500|$|This ammunition, {{and that}} which I brought with me, was rapidly {{prepared}} for use at the Laboratory established at the Little Rock Arsenal for that purpose. As illustrating as the pitiful scarcity of material in the country, the fact may be stated that it was found necessary to use public documents of the State Library for cartridge paper. Gunsmiths were employed or conscripted, tools purchased or impressed, and the repair of the damaged guns I brought with me and about an equal number found at Little Rock commenced at once. But, after inspecting the work and observing {{the spirit of the}} men I decided that a garrison 500 strong could hold out against Fitch <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> lead the remainder - about 1500 - to Gen'l Rust as soon as shotguns and rifles could be obtained from Little Rock instead of pikes and lances, with which most of them were armed. Two days elapsed before the change could be effected." ...|$|E
500|$|Through {{the early}} 19th century, Thompson {{continued}} to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company, {{and for the}} few years {{when he had a}} total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether. He was known to have written [...] "I had made it a law to myself that no alcohol should pass the mountains in my company". When two of Thompson's trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson [...] "placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse rubbing his load against the rocks {{to get rid of it}} … I told them what I had done, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do the same to every keg of alcohol." [...] Of course, wine, beer, rum and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time.|$|E

Smith went first to Government House to inform Gibbs that his Cabinet had declared independence, then to Pockets Hill Studios in east Salisbury to announce UDI to the nation. He read the proclamation aloud, then stated that independence had been declared because it had become [...] "abundantly {{clear that it is}} the policy of the British government to play us along with no real intention of arriving at a solution which we could possibly accept...

On becoming the most subscribed YouTube user, PewDiePie commented, [...] "When I started my YouTube channel in 2010, I never imagined that one day {{it would be the}} most subscribed channel in the world <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be a part of such a great community." [...] After becoming the most subscribed user, Ben Donovan of Maker Studios stated that PewDiePie [...] "is a great example of how a YouTube content creator can amass a worldwide following due to passion and creativity, and his large subscriber base showcases the loyalty and strong connection he has to his 'bros.'" [...] On 1 November, PewDiePie became the first channel to reach 15 million subscribers; the following day, the channel was surpassed by YouTube's Spotlight account {{at the top of the}} site's subscriber rankings. In the same month, PewDiePie proclaimed his dislike of YouTube's new comment system. In December, PewDiePie overtook the YouTube Spotlight channel to once again become the most subscribed user on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|Hugo Wolf was {{a student}} {{at the time of the}} 1882 Festival, yet still managed to find money for tickets to see Parsifal twice. He emerged overwhelmed: [...] "Colossal – Wagner's most inspired, sublimest creation." [...] He reiterated this view in a {{postcard}} from Bayreuth in 1883: [...] "Parsifal is without doubt by far the most beautiful and sublime work in the whole field of Art." [...] Gustav Mahler was also present in 1883 and he wrote to a friend; [...] "I can hardly describe my present state to you. When I came out of the Festspielhaus, completely spellbound, I understood that the greatest and most painful revelation had just been made to me, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> carry it unspoiled for the rest of my life." [...] Max Reger simply noted that [...] "When I first heard Parsifal at Bayreuth I was fifteen. I cried for two weeks and then became a musician." [...] Alban Berg described Parsifal in 1909 as [...] "magnificent, overwhelming," [...] and Jean Sibelius, visiting the Festival in 1894 said [...] "Nothing in the world has made so overwhelming an impression on me. All my innermost heart-strings throbbed... I cannot begin to tell you how Parsifal has transported me. Everything I do seems so cold and feeble by its side.That is really something." [...] Claude Debussy thought the characters and plot ludicrous, but nevertheless in 1903 wrote that musically it was [...] "Incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong. Parsifal is one of the loveliest monuments of sound ever raised to the serene glory of music." [...] He was later to write to Ernest Chausson that he had deleted a scene he had just written for his own opera Pelléas et Melisande because he had discovered in the music for it 'the ghost of old Klingsor, alias R. Wagner'.|$|E
500|$|Suggestions for {{introducing}} a [...] "dark horse" [...] candidate {{began to take}} place. Members backing each candidate were equally determined to win the nomination, but some felt that the deadlock could not be broken if new candidates were not introduced into the balloting. Backers for Sherman and Blaine met after the convention was adjourned. Chandler laid down his terms. Blaine had nearly 300 votes, and could not simply withdraw. As Chandler explained, even [...] "f Mr. Blaine permits his column to be broken, [...] Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Nevada, California, Oregon & twelve votes in the Territories will go to Grant... Mr. Blaine's Southern votes." [...] Both sides argued until two or three in the morning, but no decision had been reached. Grant leaders had also met that night in Roscoe Conkling's suite in the Grand Pacific Hotel. They discussed the imposing dangers of Grant's nomination bid, such as the third-term resistors. Many speculated that Grant {{was not going to}} receive the nomination. The Grant backers discussed the other two chief candidates, and found them both to be unacceptable. Some of the men called for Conkling himself as a substitute for Grant. They argued that with Grant out of the race, Conkling would face little resistance for the Republican nomination. However, Conkling refused to accept the idea of being nominated for president. He said [...] " [...] if I were to receive every other vote in the Convention, my own would still be lacking, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not give. I am here as the agent of New York to support General Grant to the end. Any man who would forsake him under such conditions does not deserve to be elected, and could not be elected.|$|E

I assembled the orchestra at the Salle Pleyel, and Ravel took a seat beside me. Everything went well until the final part, where, in spite of myself, I increased the tempo by a fraction.

2500|$|The {{arrival of}} the Butcher family in May 1988 {{signified}} an {{end of an era}} for the soap, as Den and Angie Watts (Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson) vacated their positions as landlord and landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, leaving Frank (Mike Reid), and his girlfriend Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) to take over tenancy. Ricky (Sid Owen) and Diane, played by Sophie Lawrence, Frank's teenage children came with Frank. Lawrence was 15 at the time, and she got the part in EastEnders straight after leaving stage school. Lawrence has commented, [...] "I always just thought that I would be a dancer and go into a West End musical <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be very, very happy.

2500|$|Although {{ready to}} take the city on the morning of May 26th, a white flag {{appeared}} on the city walls at 10:00am. Gough sent interpreter Peter Perring Thoms, on secondment from British Plenipotentiary and Superintendent of Trade Charles Elliot, {{to find out what it}} meant. When a Mandarin explained that the Chinese wanted peace, Gough notes in his official report: [...] "I had it explained that, as General commanding the British, I would treat with none but the General commanding the Chinese troops, that we came before Canton much against the wishes of the British nation, but that repeated insults and breaches of faith had compelled us to make the present movement, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> cease from hostilities for two hours to enable their General to meet me and Sir Le Fleming Senhouse." [...] When no general appeared, the next day British forces prepared once more for the attack on Canton. This time, a message arrived from Charles Elliot announcing that he had come to an agreement with the Governor-general of Canton, Yu Baochen (余葆纯) according to the following key points: ...|$|E
2500|$|In McManaman's final {{games for}} the club {{in the second half}} of the 1998–99 season, he began turning in mixed performances, with the media accusing him of playing out his final season in a [...] "desultory manner". His form dipped at times, arguably due to a {{combination}} of injuries, being restricted to substitute appearances (as Houllier wanted to cut the side's dependency on his gameplay and replace him), and loss of confidence in certain games where even the home fans turned against him over the contract debacle, with some labelling him a [...] "traitor" [...] and a Judas figure. McManaman told the media after one such game where he became victim of the [...] "boo boys", saying, [...] "That's understandable, when I came off the other day I knew the reaction there was going to be. But I think if they put themselves in the same predicament, and the fact that I have been at Liverpool for 12 years <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to test myself in a foreign country, that's understandable." ...|$|E

Today, I decided to remove any ambiguity. I withdraw my request of Belgian nationality. Requesting Belgian nationality was to better protect the foundation that I created with the sole purpose of ensuring the continuity and integrity of the LVMH group if I were to disappear." [...] On 10 April 2013, Arnault announced that he had decided to abandon his application for Belgian citizenship, saying he did not want the move to be misinterpreted as a measure of tax evasion at a time when France faced economic and social challenges. Arnault also stated that several employees requested to leave France for tax purposes, that he declined their requests, and that [...] "the 75% tax would not raise a lot of revenue but should prove less divisive now that it was set to be levied on firms rather than people and only due to stay in place for two years." ...|$|E

In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> write and see if we could not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but I took care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E
