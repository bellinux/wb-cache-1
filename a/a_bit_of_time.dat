25|$|Charles A. Lindbergh, {{arguably the}} world's most famous aviator, spent quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in Hempstead {{both before and}} after his epic solo flight from nearby Roosevelt Field to Le Bourget Field in Paris, France on May 20, 1927. While living here, Christopher Morley was so enamored with the place that on the three {{hundredth}} anniversary of its founding he wrote a beautiful essay in tribute. His first novel, Parnassus on Wheels, was written on a kitchen table at his Oak Street, Hempstead home in 1917. In 1704 the first stage coach on Long Island stopped to water its horses here.|$|E
25|$|The {{transformation}} from the youth {{team to the}} national side, however, took <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> {{and it was not}} until the 1994–95 season that he got his chance in the national colours. This delay was partly because during the period 90–94 Bangladesh was mainly involved with One-Day Cricket while Jawed's batting technique is always more suitable for the longer version. Jawed was part of the team that won the ICC Trophy in 1997. However, he spent most of the tournament as a reserve player, as the coach Gordon Greenidge decided to push hard hitting middle-order bat Naimur Rahman to the opening position.|$|E
25|$|Mandžukić {{first began}} the season slowly, having small issues {{adjusting}} to new Bayern coach Pep Guardiola's system. Guardiola changed Bayern's formation from the 4–2–3–1 {{they had used}} previously under Jupp Heynckes to a new 4–1–4–1 style. While it took <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to adjust, Mandžukić regained his form nonetheless in time for league play. He opened the new season in the Bundesliga by scoring two goals in two league appearances. Mandžukić scored his first Champions League goal of the season when Bayern Munich began the defence of their Champions League title against CSKA Moscow with a 3–0 victory at the Allianz Arena. He headed the only goal as Bayern defeated a valiant FC Viktoria Plzeň in November {{to move into the}} knockout stages with a record-equalling ninth successive UEFA Champions League win. Mandžukić scored his tenth goal of the new Bundesliga season in a December match against Hamburger SV.|$|E

25|$|The French Army {{preferred}} bag {{charges for}} its ammunition because the brass cartridge cases {{used by the}} Mle 1915 were expensive to produce, both in money and {{in the amount of}} brass required. This became a real problem during the war given the vast number of shells expended and Schneider was asked to redesign the gun to use a deBange obdurator and allow it to use bagged powder. Schneider agreed and adapted the breech of the Canon de 155mm GPF to fit the barrel of the Mle 1915, but this took quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> due to the press of existing work and the new Mle 1917 howitzer didn't enter service until late 1916. The main difference between the Mle 1915 and 1917 was in the breech. Many guns had their loading trays removed because it slowed down the rate of fire; a portable shell tray was used instead by the loaders.|$|E
25|$|The Jesuits {{arrived in}} the Viceroyalty of Peru by 1571; it was a key area of Spanish empire, with not only dense {{indigenous}} populations but also huge deposits of silver at Potosí. A major figure in {{the first wave of}} Jesuits was José de Acosta (1540–1600), whose book Historia natural y moral de las Indias (1590) introduced Europeans to Spain's American empire via fluid prose and keen observation and explanation, based on fifteen years in Peru and <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in New Spain (Mexico). Viceroy of Peru Don Francisco de Toledo urged the Jesuits to evangelize the indigenous peoples of Peru, wanting to put them in charge of parishes, but Acosta adhered to the Jesuit position that they were not subject to the jurisdiction of bishops and to catechize in Indian parishes would bring them into conflict with the bishops. For that reason, the Jesuits in Peru focused on education of elite men rather than the indigenous populations.|$|E

500|$|The {{graphics}} received mixed reviews. Sliva {{referred to}} the locations as [...] "visually interesting and varied", while VanOrd said the player [...] "can't help but gawk at the beautiful spectacle before [...]" [...] Juba liked the overall look and design of the main cast and environment, but critiqued the environment textures and NPCs. Elliot praised the CG cutscenes, but said that [...] "the tired, boxy side streets feel unfinished." [...] However, he further said that the expansive nature of environments balanced this issue out. The environments were praised by Famitsu, which stated that due to the expansive nature of the environments {{and the lack of}} hints concerning quests, new players might take <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> getting used to it. It also generally called the game [...] "quite nice".|$|E
500|$|In 1994, {{suspicion}} {{of foul play}} by the Benetton team (who were eventually found to {{have been responsible for}} some technical violations {{over the course of the}} season) was said to have troubled Ayrton Senna that season. For example, in the words of his then teammate, Damon Hill, Senna had chosen to spend <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> at the first corner of the Aida circuit following his retirement from the Pacific Grand Prix. After listening to Schumacher's Benetton B194 as it went past, Senna [...] "concluded that there was, what he regarded, as unusual noises from the engine". The FIA subsequently issued a press release setting out action that it required teams to take prior to the German Grand Prix, given that various cars were found to have an advanced engine management systems emulating launch and traction control.|$|E

5000|$|Of the {{recording}} process, Pringle states: [...] "we {{decided to spend}} <b>a</b> fair <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> making sure {{it was all in}} place, that we were happy with how everything sounded, primarily making sure the songs somehow linked in with one another even though there's a slew of mad genres going on within the record. We spent <b>a</b> fair <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in the studio, having written most of it at home in our warehouse, the three of us together, before taking it to the studio to mix it properly." [...] Written and produced by Crystal Fighters, Star of Love presents the unique focus and the combined talents of the band. [...] "It's absolutely collaborative... we all have our strengths within the band but because it’s all written pretty much in one room in Hackney, it all gets vetted by each other... there's a lot of tooing and froing of opinions and a collaborative relationship going on at all points of the process." ...|$|R
500|$|The group {{employed}} Brian Eno and his assisting partner Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis—both of whom {{worked on}} Achtung Baby—to produce the sessions; long-time Eno collaborator Daniel Lanois was busy promoting his solo album and was unavailable. Similar to the Achtung Baby sessions, Eno worked two-week shifts. The group often gave him in-progress songs to adjust {{and to which}} he could add his own personality. Initially, the band {{did not have a}} clear plan for how they would release the material being written. At the time, Clayton said, [...] "I don't know if what we're doing here is the next U2 album or a bunch of rough sketches that in two years will turn into the demos for the next U2 album." [...] The Edge was a proponent of making an EP of new material to promote the upcoming leg of the tour, describing his mentality as thus: [...] "We've got <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> off. We've got some ideas hanging around from the last record, let's do an EP, maybe four new songs to spice the next phase of the tour up a bit. It'll be a fan thing. It'll be cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine also rated {{it three}} out of four stars, stated [...] "Strike Back isn't {{brilliant}} television, but it's plenty entertaining, and by fitting the action of 24 with the grit of The Unit (and the nudity of Cinemax), it fills a [...]22 caliber hole in American television." [...] However Riccio added that the downside to the series was that [...] "not enough time is given over to the fractious [...] "buddy-cop" [...] relationship between the two main characters, Scott and Stonebridge, whereas quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> is spent with the villains." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post called it [...] "surprisingly stylish and addictive," [...] adding [...] "Fans of [...] "24," [...] which bowed last year, still ask me how to fill that void. They want just enough intelligence-agency hooey to make the unbelievable seem somewhat real. Until [...] "Strike Back," [...] I didn't have a good answer." [...] Stuever lauded Scott and Stapleton's portrayal, stating he is [...] "the real find here, a thoroughly unlikable loser" [...] who [...] "saves the show from a dour sense of duty," [...] adding that Staplton [...] "seems to have been created in a laboratory experiment that grafted Ewan McGregor's personality and smile onto Hugh Jackman's body — with more than adequate results." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> for us {{to realize that we}} were going to make an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E

2500|$|GamesRadar {{approved}} of the game, awarding a 90%, but added a disclaimer that the gaming experience is best [...] "if your machine is up to it".

The Windies haven't played any one-day cricket for a while and we're in the middle of our season, so I suppose we are the team to beat.
