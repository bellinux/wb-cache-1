[...] Most colorless glass was made by the New England Glass Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [...] Also producing three-mold glass in New England was the Boston Crown Glass Manufactory, as well as the Quincy Glass Works in Massachusetts, which made snuff bottles molded to a square form. [...] Three-piece molds were used from 1815 to 1835 in midwestern houses, most notably in Ohio. Marlboro Street Factory in Keene, NH manufactured dark green and <b>amber</b> <b>bottle</b> glass and was known for the manufacture of inkwells. In New York and New Jersey, famous glass manufacturers of blown three-mold glass include the Mount Vernon Glass Company, Brooklyn Flint Glass Works, and Jersey City Glassworks. The Coventry, CT Glass Company was also a manufacturer of three-mold items. It is believed that glass factories in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Baltimore also produced three-mold glassware, but since excavation is not possible, no proof exists. Some foreign molded three-part glass manufactured in England, Ireland (two part molds) and France (three part molds) in the early 19th century, is sometimes mistaken for American glass.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the {{pathogenesis}} {{is the result}} of a rupture in the host - parasite relationship [1]. This rupture is related to the imbalance of the vital force of the host, expressed through signs and symptoms, defined by Hahnemann (1995) [2] as being the source of the disease. There is no research in the literature about the clinical evolution of mice experimentally infected with T. cruzi and treated in different ways using biotherapic. Therefore, this is an area to be studied in the future. &# 13; &# 13; Aim: To evaluate the effect of different ways of treatment using biotherapic T. cruzi 17 DH on clinical evolution of mice experimentally infected with T. cruzi. &# 13; &# 13; Materials and methods: A blind randomized controlled trial was performed, using 30 swiss male mice, aged 28 days, divided into groups according to the treatment: CONTROL - animals treated with 7 % water-alcohol solution diluted in water given ad libitum in an amber bottle; GAVAGE Ã¢â‚¬â€œ animals treated with medication highly diluted T. cruzi 17 DH from 4 th to 9 th day of infection by gavage; WATER -animals treated with highly diluted T. cruzi 17 DH in water ad libitum offered in an <b>amber</b> <b>bottle</b> until the end of the study period. The groups were infected with the Y strain of T. cruzi, intraperitoneal, 1400 blood trypomastigotes. The medicine was handled according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [3] with microbiological test according to RDC nÃ‚Â° 67 and in vivo biological risk. Parasitemic curve was determined by daily counting of the parasites [4]. Were measured temperature, weight, intake of water and feed, the ruffle fur and survival of mice. Statistical analysis was performed using the tests Fisher Exact and Log-Rank, with a significance of 5 %. The experiment was approved under the protocol nÃ‚Â° 030 / 2008 - Ethics in Animal Experimentation of the Universidade Estadual de MaringÃƒÂ¡. &# 13; &# 13; Results: The mice under different treatment ways using biotherapic T. cruzi 17 DH showed differences in the clinical evolution. The treatment using biotherapic diluted in water initially shows hypothermia, with subsequent recovery of normal temperature (p= 0. 05) (Fig 1). The weight curve shows a better evolution in mice treated with water compared to control groups (p= 0. 055) and the groups treated by gavage (p= 0. 0064). Feed and water intake did not differ among the groups. While the mice that were treated with biotherapic diluted in water showed a slight level of ruffled fur, the mice in control groups and the ones treated by gavage showed a more intense level of ruffled fur (p= 0. 00001). The difference in the evolution of mortality among the groups was significant (p= 0. 034), while in the group treated with biotherapic diluted with water, the mortality rate started later, reaching the maximum of 90 %. This group showed a better clinical result, expressed by the smaller extent of ruffled fur, a better evolution of the temperature curve and higher gain of weight. This is an important result because the Y strain of T. cruzi has a mortality rate of 100 % in mice, showing once again the good performance of biotherapic in this model of infection. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusion: The use of biotherapic T. cruzi 17 DH for a long period causes clinical improvement of the infected mice with Trypanosoma cruzi.

Medicines were handled according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [2], with microbiological testing according to RDC nÃ‚Â° 67 and in vivo biological risk. We compared the parasitemia curve and total parasitemia, determined daily counting of the parasites [3], obtained using the tests Kruskal-Wallis and Wald-Wolfowitz, Statistica 8. 0, 5 % significance. Approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation/ UEM - 030 / 2008. &# 13; &# 13; Results: The animal age and the ways of treatment used influenced the evolution of the parasitemia curve. This evolution was different among different ages, and the youngest mice of the control group had higher averages of parasitemia (C 28 = 1. 4 x 106 /mL; C 38 = 1. 3 x 106 /mL and C 56 = 1. 0 x 106 /mL) (fig 1). This evolution was not observed in the groups treated daily, in which 56 day-old mice presented a higher parasitemia compared to the other groups (ED 28 = 1. 3 x 106 /mL; ED 38 = 0. 9 x 106 /mL and ED 56 = 1. 2 x 106 /mL) (fig 1 b). &# 13; &# 13; For animals treated with a single dose, the energetic stimulus provided by biotherapic caused homogeneity of biological behavior, with significant elevation of parasitemia (OD 28 = 1. 8 x 106 /mL; OD 38 = 1. 3 x 106 /mL and OD 56 = 1. 5 x 106 /mL) (fig 1 c). Likewise, the single dose treatment invariably resulted in an increase of parasitemia when compared to other treatments within the same age group (fig 1 d-f). The treatment performed daily in animals aged 28 and 38 days showed a decrease in parasitemia (fig 1 d-f). For 56 day-old mice this fall was not observed (fig 1 f). The meaning of this finding should be better explored considering the physiological maturity versus the vital energy of mice of different ages. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusion: The age and the ways of treatment used are important factors to be considered when using a highly diluted medication. The clinical use of these results in humans, should take into consideration the allometric system of medication dosage which takes into account the metabolic rate of each organism...|$|E

30|$|Several {{chloroauric acid}} {{solutions}} {{were prepared for}} utilization with CO reduction. Various weights of fresh chloroauric acid were dissolved in individual <b>amber</b> <b>bottles</b> containing water (200 mL). At least two separate batches of all solution concentrations were employed to confirm reproducibility. One set of solutions consisted of varying concentrations of chloroauric acid (0.01 to 0.09 mM in 0.01 mM increments) and HAuCl 4 (1 mM) and HAuCl 4 (2 mM) solutions were prepared. A solution of HAuCl 4 (1 wt%) was also prepared. Gold nanoparticles synthesized by CO reduction, with average diameter nanoparticles ranging from 4.5 to 52 nm were prepared as described below. For each HAuCl 4 concentration five volumes (40 mL) were prepared. Each sample was aerated at different flow rates controlled by a control valve. The gas entered the solution via a 60 um pore gas diffuser (Fisher Scientific) attached {{to the end of}} the gas supply line downstream of the control valve. The five solutions were exposed to CO gas at flow rates of 16.9, 25.45, 31.59, 37.0, and 42.9 mL/min, respectively. The solution temperature, prior to aeration, was maintained between 20 and 22 °C.|$|R
