40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{physical}} load of training of members who belong to the Judo and Basketball teams, urinary proteins before and after routine training were measured by the turbidity method (modified meulemans method) of members. The following results were obtained. 1) In members of the Basketball club, significant increase in actual urinary protein concentration was observed between noon <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> <b>on</b> the first day, between morning and noon, between noon <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> <b>on</b> the second day, between morning and noon, between morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> <b>on</b> the third day and between morning <b>and</b> <b>evening</b> <b>on</b> the fourth day.

In particular, excretion of myoglobin was recognized. The experiments on optical density of the turbidity method of each fraction were discussed. 4) The main subjective symptoms (from questionnaires) which increased with physical loads were "Whole body getting tired", "Legs getting tired" and "Wanting to lie down" in group I in the basketball club, and "Whole body getting tired", "Legs getting tired", "Feel unsteady standing", "Becoming drowsy", "Wanting to lie down" in group I, "Feeling stiff in the shoulders", "Feeling thirsty" and "Tremor in limbs" in group III in the Judo club. 5) The preliminary care of fatigued members was discussed...|$|R

5|$|For {{most of its}} distribution, B.integrifolia occurs {{only within}} about 50 {{kilometres}} (30mi) of the coast, where it typically occurs on poor quality sandy soils derived from sandstone. It grows near coastal cliffs and headlands, alongside river estuaries, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>on</b> stabilised sand dunes. The temperature range for this area is around 0–30°C (30–85°F), with almost no frosts. The species can occur in pure stands, but is usually associated with other species such as Melaleuca quinquenervia (broad-leaved paperbark).|$|E

(In fact, according to Tolkien, had the Old English plural survived, it would have been dwarrows or dwerrows.) He also coined the term eucatastrophe, though it remains mainly used in connection with his own work.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} common in spruce-fir and spruce-moorland forests and in spruce forests and plantations. Together with spruces, the fungus is also common in {{different}} European beech and oak-European hornbeam forests, {{but also on the}} forest edges, on clearings and in clearcut meadows <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>on</b> juniper heathers and in parkland. There are scarcely any habitats where the spruce is common, while the fungus is not found there. The fungus is very common in young spruce forests that are 10 to 20 years old, where it occurs on forest path edges occasionally in masses.|$|E
5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>on</b> rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints and wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E
