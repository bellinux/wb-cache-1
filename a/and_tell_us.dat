5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
25|$|GIULIANI: That's {{really an}} {{extraordinary}} statement. That's an extraordinary statement, {{as someone who}} lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that he didn't really mean that.|$|E
25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E

500|$|On January 12, 2015, the University of Virginia {{reinstated}} the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity {{after the}} police investigation concluded that no incident had {{occurred at the}} fraternity. According to Charlottesville Police Capt. Gary Pleasants, Phi Kappa Psi has been cleared; [...] "We found no basis to believe that an incident occurred at that fraternity, so there's no reason to keep them suspended." [...] On March 23, 2015, police noted that Jackie refused to cooperate with law enforcement during the investigation. [...] Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo explained, [...] "We would've loved to have had Jackie come in ... <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what happened so we can obtain justice ... even if the facts were different." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks about two female friends being {{concerned}} about their other friend who denies her bad love relationship and tries {{to convince them that}} nothing is wrong. As the girls know what is really happening, they try to comfort her and make her leave the partner. A writer of The Times of India found a break-up theme in the song, further saying that [...] "In 'Girl', the relational mishaps play out as three-way girl talk, with two girlfriends trying to help their sister see the truth of a bad connection". It opens with Beyoncé singing the lines [...] "Take a minute girl, come sit down/ <b>And</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what's been happening/ In your face I can see the pain/ Don't try and convince us you're happy." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the lyrics}} of [...] "KKK Bitch," [...] Ice-T {{describes}} a sexual encounter {{with a woman who}} he soon learns is the daughter of the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The lyrics go on to describe a scenario in which members of Body Count [...] "crash" [...] a Klan meeting to [...] "get buck wild with the white freaks". Ice-T makes humorous reference to [...] " [...] in love with Tipper Gore's two 12-year-old nieces", and ponders the possibility of the Grand Wizard coming after him [...] "when his grandson's named little Ice-T." [...] In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that [...] "'KKK Bitch' was ironic because the sentiments were true. We'd play Ku Klux Klan areas in the South and the girls would always come backstage <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how their brothers and fathers didn't like black folks. [...] We knew that 'KKK Bitch' would totally piss off the Ku Klux Klan. There's humor in the song, but it fucks with them. It's on a punk tip." ...|$|E

500|$|Bryan {{continued}} with language evoking the Civil War, telling his audience that [...] "in this contest brother has been arrayed against brother, father against son." [...] By then, {{as he spoke}} in a sincere tone, his voice sounded clearly and loudly through the hall. He denied, however that the contest was personal; he bore no ill-will towards those who supported the gold standard. However, he stated, facing towards the gold delegates, [...] "when you come before us <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that we are about to disturb your business interests, we reply that you have disturbed our business interests by your course." [...] The gold men, during the address, paid close attention and showed their appreciation for Bryan's oratory. Bryan then defended the right of silver supporters to make their argument against opposition from gold men, who were associated with financial interests, especially in the East. Although his statements nominally responded to a point made by Russell, Bryan had thought of the argument the previous evening, and had not used it in earlier speeches. He always regarded it as the best point he made during the speech, and only the ending caused more reaction from his listeners: ...|$|E

2500|$|In her Nobel {{acceptance}} speech, Morrison {{talked about}} the power of storytelling. To make her point, she told a story. She spoke about a blind, old, black woman who is approached by group of young people. They demand of her, [...] "Is there no context for our lives? No song, no literature, no poem full of vitamins, no history connected to experience that you can pass along to help us start strong? … Think of our lives <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> your particularized world.

2500|$|Also on March 10, Cramer {{appeared}} on MSNBC's Morning Joe. Commentator Joe Scarborough {{weighed in on}} the feud, criticizing Stewart and The Daily Show for being unfair to those ideologically opposed to Stewart: [...] "I {{would like to see}} Jon Stewart come out <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what he believes in. Tell us where America needs to go in the future. And let us take a microphone around and a camera around with him 24 hours a day {{for a couple of months}} and then we can edit out all the mistakes he makes. It's very easy to shoot at the arena." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ingres's own {{paintings}} {{vary considerably}} {{in their use}} of colour, and critics were apt to fault them as too grey or, contrarily, too jarring. Baudelaire—who said [...] "M. Ingres adores colour like a fashionable milliner"—wrote of the portraits of Louis-François Bertin and Madame d'Haussonville: [...] "Open your eyes, [...] nation of simpletons, <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> if you ever saw such dazzling, eye-catching painting, or even a greater elaboration of colour". Ingres's paintings are often characterized by strong local colours, such as the [...] "acid blues and bottle greens" [...] Kenneth Clark professed to [...] "perversely enjoy" [...] in La Grande Odalisque. In other works, especially in his less formal portraits such as the Mademoiselle Jeanne-Suzanne-Catherine Gonin (1821), colour is restrained.|$|E
2500|$|During the debate, Congressman Paul {{commented that}} America's history of interventionism in the Middle East {{has led to}} an unpopular view of the U.S. in Middle Eastern countries, and argued that the CIA's removal of Iranian leader Mohammed Mosaddeq in Operation Ajax, the Iraq war and the bombing of Iraq in the 1990s had led to {{increasing}} anti-American sentiment in the Middle East and promoted terrorism. When the moderator asked if Paul was suggesting that the US had [...] "invited" [...] the 9/11 attacks, Paul argued with fellow candidate Rudy Giuliani, who responded to Paul's suggestion that the U.S. pay attention to the underlying causes of terrorism by saying [...] "I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment <b>and</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that he didn't really mean that." [...] Paul responded that terrorists were the result of [...] "blowback" [...] from poor foreign policy, and that they [...] "don't come here to attack us because we're rich and we're free, they come and attack us because we're over there." ...|$|E
