500|$|After {{the march}} from Queen's Park, protests {{continued}} {{in front of}} the Consulate of the United States in Toronto, even after Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapakse declared a victory over the LTTE on 17 May, which officially marked the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Post-civil war, the goal of the protests were to ensure peace and better treatment of Tamil civilians and investigate war crimes by the Government of Sri Lanka. Protests also continuously happened {{in front of the}} Consulate of the United States in Montreal. Protesters held non-stop protests, urging Stephen Harper, who had not yet given <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> on protests, to make a statement on the issue and request immediate humanitarian aid to be sent to the island nation. The Canadian Tamil Congress urged the European Union for a unanimous investigation of war crimes. Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Lawrence Cannon reflected by announcing that [...] "Canada would work with the United States helping the United Nations deliver humanitarian aid to Sri Lanka." [...] In the meantime, Toronto's Sinhalese community continued to hold counter-Tamil protests, claiming that they were in danger by the LTTE.|$|E
2500|$|Several Indian {{security}} analysts {{claimed that}} Pakistani-based terror groups {{were linked to}} the attack. Both {{the director of the}} Institute of Central Asia at the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences and Chinese counter-terrorist expert Li Wei alluded to the influence of foreign terrorist organizations in the attack [...] without mentioning any specific country, which the Times of India claimed referred to Pakistan. However, the Chinese government, which has good relations with Pakistan, and the WUC, did not give <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> on the alleged connection to terrorists based in Pakistan. On September 8, the US-based terrorist monitoring group SITE reported on a video made by ETIM leader Abdul Shakoor Damla claiming responsibility for the July Hotan and Kashgar attacks on behalf of his group. On September 14, the Xinjiang Legal Daily reported that six men were tried for their involvement in the Hotan and Kashgar attacks. Four were given death sentences, and two were given 19-year jail terms, for charges including [...] "leading and organizing a terror group, manufacturing illegal explosives, intentional homicide, [...] arson". Xinjiang authorities have unveiled a package of policy responses to the attacks to placate Muslim Uyghurs, which include increasing quotas for Uyghur participation in local government and increasing government subsidies for religious schools.|$|E
60|$|I hadn't <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> to make. I whacked at a nettle with my stick.|$|E
60|$|Mitford {{seemed to}} think <b>any</b> <b>remark</b> superfluous, for he only groaned.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Now for Anne's real poem, Rupert,' said Elizabeth, not {{choosing}} to make <b>any</b> <b>remarks,</b> lest Rupert should consider them as compliments.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even in a destroyer," [...] Hinch snapped {{over his}} shoulder, [...] "you ain't {{expected}} to con and drive simultaneous. Don't address <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> to me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I'll have a smoke," [...] he said. [...] "I'm afraid <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> I {{could make}} wouldn't {{do justice to}} the occasion. Language has its limits." ...|$|E
60|$|I listened, {{without making}} <b>any</b> <b>remark.</b> To tell the truth, I was {{thinking}} of Stella.|$|R
60|$|The clergyman scowled {{as though}} {{he thought it was}} {{anything}} but better. He did not make <b>any</b> <b>remark,</b> however.|$|R
60|$|There {{the letter}} ended. Before {{presenting}} the cheque, I asked Sergeant Cuff {{if he had}} <b>any</b> <b>remark</b> to make.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't want <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> if YOU please,' said Miss Knag, with {{a strong}} {{emphasis}} on the personal pronoun. 'Is there any fire downstairs for some hot water presently?' ...|$|E
60|$|I hadn't <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> to make. All I {{could think}} of was the picture of Aunt Agatha {{drinking}} all this in and reaching out to sharpen the hatchet against my return.|$|E
60|$|Prescott said nothing. In {{face of such}} a situation, <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> that {{he could}} make would be superfluous. There was a long silence; and then Jernyngham spoke again, slowly, but resolutely.|$|E
60|$|The {{other men}} all ceased talking and looked on with some interest, {{but did not}} offer to {{interfere}} or make <b>any</b> <b>remark.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Not {{until they}} had arrived nearly at the house did Master Plummer make <b>any</b> <b>remark,</b> and then he said, with a long-drawn sigh: ...|$|R
60|$|She drew {{nearer to}} have a better look, and the yokels who had lingered behind, paused, {{wondering}} if she would make <b>any</b> <b>remark.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She broke down--absolutely collapsed. Devilish {{unpleasant}} it was. I'm hopeless in {{a situation}} like this. After I'd said, [...] "There, there!" [...] which didn't seem to help much, I hadn't <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> to make.|$|E
6000|$|... "Down {{about the}} edge of Arkansas I got out Bill's {{appointment}} and looked it over, and then I handed it to Andy to read. Andy read it, but didn't add <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> to my silence.|$|E
60|$|DEAR MR. MALLESON,--Many {{thanks for}} the pamphlet. You ask me to send you <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> I may have to make on the Letters, and I gather from your note at the {{beginning}} of the Letters as they now stand, that you intend making use of <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> sent you that may commend themselves to your judgment. I am not vain enough to think mine of any special value. I will, however, write you my feelings about them, encouraged to do so by your statement in the note to the pamphlet, that the use made of remarks sent you will be anonymous, if it is so desired.|$|E
60|$|Lucinda sat {{upon the}} upset kitchen stove and stared, and Jane {{leaned against the}} kitchen dresser and smiled; but neither of them made <b>any</b> <b>remark.</b>|$|R
60|$|Before {{she could}} bethink herself of <b>any</b> <b>remark</b> the door opened, and in walked, unannounced, {{a man on}} whose {{somewhat}} handsome countenance villainy was clearly stamped.|$|R
60|$|I didn't make <b>any</b> <b>remark,</b> {{having no}} taste for {{conversation}} just then, but only looked at poor Mar√ªt, who lay by {{me as though}} he was sleeping.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Mr. Barclay climbed on board and went down into the cabin {{and all over the}} vessel with them before he made <b>any</b> <b>remarks.</b> At length he turned to the boys as they stood by the rail.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{murder of}} Mademoiselle de Mermillon in her lodging {{on the night}} of the seventh of June last," [...] the Baron said gravely. [...] "Please do not make <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> before these men. The {{evidence}} against you is already sufficiently strong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{the bishop}} has said nothing. He {{probably}} thinks that <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> {{on the matter}} will come better from me, who first introduced you to his lordship's notice. The fact is, Mr. Slope, you are a little inclined to take too much upon yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That boy {{will never}} {{understand}} our foreign relations. Ethiopia in Asia!" [...] {{he said to}} himself, {{but he did not}} choose to make <b>any</b> <b>remark</b> at the moment.|$|R
6000|$|The peculiarly bland {{smile with}} which Hamilton usually {{received}} <b>any</b> <b>remark</b> that savoured of banter overspread his features as Charley spoke, but he merely replied,--"No, Charley, I'm not afraid." ...|$|R
60|$|Attim, without <b>any</b> <b>remark</b> save a wag of his tail, arose promptly, {{entered the}} hut, and lay down. You see, he was {{accustomed}} to little attentions of the sort.|$|R
6000|$|... 'P.S.--The Society {{would not}} be {{particular}} in limiting you to the Tower of London.

60|$|Mr. Rook {{opened a}} door {{at the end of}} the landing; and, turning round to speak to Emily, noticed Mirabel {{standing}} behind her. Without making <b>any</b> <b>remarks,</b> the old man pointed significantly down the stairs. His resolution was evidently immovable. Mirabel appealed to Emily to help him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} glad, Professor Challenger," [...] said he, [...] "if {{you could see}} your way to make <b>any</b> <b>remarks</b> which may occur to you without seizing me by the chin. Even the {{appearance}} of a very ordinary rock python does not appear to justify such a liberty." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{colleague}} {{read the}} paper, {{and handed it}} back to me without making <b>any</b> <b>remark.</b> I asked if he suspected the Prisoner of feigning conversion to please the Minister.|$|R
60|$|He did not {{venture to}} make <b>any</b> <b>remark,</b> nor did Bill think it wise {{to repeat the}} threat; but he shook his fist warningly, which served the same purpose.|$|R
6000|$|Roberts did {{not think}} it right to offer <b>any</b> <b>remark</b> on what {{appeared}} to him to be impossible, and he confined himself to saying in a respectful voice, [...] "Indeed, Miss Netta." ...|$|R
