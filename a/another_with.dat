5|$|After his {{graduation}} as {{an architect}} in 1878, Gaudí's first work was a set of lampposts for the Plaça Reial, the project for the Girossi newsstands and the Mataró cooperative, which was his first important work. He received the request from the city council of Barcelona in February 1878, when he had graduated but not yet received his degree, which was sent from Madrid on 15 March of the same year. For this commission he designed two types of lampposts: one with six arms, of which two were installed in the Plaça Reial, and <b>another</b> <b>with</b> three, of which two were installed in the Pla del Palau, opposite the Civil Government. The lampposts were inaugurated during the Mercè festivities in 1879. Made of cast iron with a marble base, they have a decoration in which the caduceus of Mercury is prominent, symbol of commerce and emblem of Barcelona.|$|E

5|$|At the marshal's signal, silence descended {{over the}} field and both knights spurred their horses and charged, their lances each {{striking}} the other's shield but not causing significant damage. Wheeling, both again struck but failed to penetrate, scoring glancing blows on their helmets but remaining horsed. For a third time they turned and charged and again they both struck. This time however the lances shattered, sending slivers of wood cartwheeling across the arena and nearly unseating both men. Regaining balance, the knights closed on one <b>another</b> <b>with</b> battle axes drawn, trading furious two-handed blows. As the engagement progressed, Le Gris' superior strength began to tell and Carrouges was driven back until with a mighty swing, Le Gris' axe severed the spine of Carrouges' horse. The dying beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges leaping clear and meeting Le Gris' charge with a side-step, allowing him to thrust his own axe's pike deep into the stomach of Le Gris' steed.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Winters, Texas, Hornsby played for several semi-professional and minor league teams. In 1915, he began his major league career with the St. Louis Cardinals and {{remained}} with the team for 12seasons. During this period, Hornsby won his first MVP Award and the Cardinals won the 1926 World Series. After that season, he spent one season with the New York Giants and <b>another</b> <b>with</b> the Boston Braves before being traded to the Chicago Cubs. He played with the Cubs {{for four years and}} won his second MVP Award before the team released him in 1932. Hornsby re-signed with the Cardinals in 1933, but was released partway through the season and was picked up by the St. Louis Browns. He remained there until his final season in 1937. From 1925 to 1937, Hornsby was intermittently his own manager. After retiring as a player, he managed the Browns in 1952 and the Cincinnati Reds from 1952 to 1953.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli's {{political}} views embraced certain Radical policies, particularly democratic {{reform of the}} electoral system, and also some Tory ones, including protectionism.

She {{was having an affair with}} Lyndhurst, and began <b>another</b> <b>with</b> Disraeli. Disraeli and Lyndhurst took an immediate liking to each other. Lyndhurst was an indiscreet gossip with a fondness for intrigue; this appealed greatly to Disraeli, who became his secretary and go-between. In 1835 Disraeli stood for the last time as a Radical, unsuccessfully contesting High Wycombe once again.|$|E

5|$|During late 1969, Phase IV sensors {{began to}} be {{deployed}} in-theater.

By 1971–1972 a new sensor with a commandable microphone (COMMMIKE III) and <b>another</b> <b>with</b> a vehicle ignition detector (EDET III, which could detect the unshielded ignition systems of gasoline engines) were introduced. In 1972 U.S. dollars the ADSID cost $619.00, the ACOUSID $1,452.00, and the engine detector $2,997.00. During the life of the operation approximately 20,000 sensors were deployed in Laos.|$|E
5|$|During their travels {{across the}} Wastelands, the player can be {{accompanied}} by a single non-player character (NPC) companion, who can assist in combat. Which companion can accompany the player depends on who they have encountered that can join them; it is possible to not encounter all depending on how the game is played. Only one companion may travel with the player, and should they wish to take <b>another</b> <b>with</b> them, the first must be dismissed (either voluntarily by the player or as a consequence of other events) or die in combat. One unique companion the player can have, that can allow a third to join without issue, is a dog named Dogmeat, who can be killed during the game if the player misuses him or places him in a severely dangerous situation; the release of the Broken Steel DLC, makes it possible to replace Dogmeat, provided the player acquires a Perk that grants the opportunity of getting another dog.|$|E
5|$|From {{the same}} site where T.goodmani was found, Samonds also {{recorded}} the distal (far) end of a Triaenops humerus (upper arm bone), with a width of 3.58mm. This bone was similar to humeri of T.menamena, {{but she did not}} identify it as either species because of the small size difference between T.menamena and T.goodmani. In site NCC-1 (estimated 69,600 to 86,800 years old), two Triaenops mandibles were recorded, one with p4 and m1 and <b>another</b> <b>with</b> m1–2 and part of m3. Relative to living Triaenops and Paratriaenops, m1 in those jaws is longer and narrower. Although sample sizes are small, the measurements do not resemble those of T.goodmani. In addition, the ridge between the entoconid and metaconid is stronger than in T.goodmani. Samonds identified these jaws only as Triaenops.|$|E

5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage as long as their marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one <b>another,</b> <b>with</b> dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In New York, Edouard {{produced}} strong {{waves and}} storm tides {{of one to}} twoft (0.3 to 0.6m), causing overwash along southern Long Island due to high tide. Coastal flooding occurred, including in Hampton Bays where the waves flooded one road and covered <b>another</b> <b>with</b> sand. The flooding trapped six cars, while the strong waves forced several beaches to close. Because the hurricane moved through the New York Shipping Channel, numerous ships reported winds of over hurricane status, though winds remained below tropical storm force on land. A boat capsized {{off the coast of}} Jones Beach Island, though its passengers were not injured. A Celebrity Cruises cruise ship, the MV_Zenith suffered damage from 30 to 50ft (nine to 15m) waves, injuring several passengers and crew members.
