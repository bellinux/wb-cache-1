By 1963 he was being talked <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> England team, but an indifferent game for MCC against Frank Worrell's West Indians meant he was passed over. He also taught PE during the off season at Cherry Orchard SM School in Northampton, just about a mile from the site of his later accident.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{depicting}} the two nudes in the foreground, {{the rocks and}} trees in the background, from one point of view, Metzinger used a concept he wrote <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in Note sur la peinture (published in Pan, 1910), of 'mobile perspective' to portray objects {{from a variety of}} angles, resulting in a multitude of image fragments or facets. In Two Nudes the models are captured from multiple spatial view-points and at successive intervals in time shown simultaneously on the canvas.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the root}} ideas of Kemalism began during the late Ottoman Empire under various reforms to avoid the {{imminent}} collapse of the Empire, beginning chiefly in the early 19th-century Tanzimat reforms. The mid-century Young Ottomans attempted to create the ideology of Ottoman nationalism, or Ottomanism, to quell the rising ethnic nationalism in the Empire and introduce limited democracy {{for the first time}} while maintaining Islamist influences. In the early 20th century, Young Turks abandoned Ottoman nationalism in favor of early Turkish nationalism, while adopting a secular political outlook. After the demise of the Ottoman Empire, Atatürk, influenced by both the Young Ottomans and the Young Turks, as well as by their successes and failures, led the declaration of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, borrowing from the earlier movements' ideas of secularism and Turkish nationalism, while bringing <b>about,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, free education and other reforms that have been enshrined by later leaders into guidelines for governing Turkey.|$|E

500|$|After the {{publication}} in 1915 of Cathay, Pound mentioned {{he was working}} on a long poem, casting <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> correct form. He told a friend in August: [...] "It is a huge, I was going to say, gamble, but shan't," [...] and in September described it as a [...] "cryselephantine poem of immeasurable length which will occupy me for the next four decades unless it becomes a bore." [...] About a year later, in January 1917, he had the first three trial cantos, distilled to one, published as Canto I in Poetry. He was now a regular contributor to three literary magazines. From 1917 he wrote music reviews for The New Age under the pen name William Atheling, and weekly pieces for The Egoist and The Little Review; many of the latter were directed against provincialism and ignorance. The volume of writing exhausted him. He feared he was wasting his time writing outside poetry, exclaiming that he [...] "must stop writing so much prose".|$|E
500|$|Maken X {{was first}} {{announced}} in November 1998. Maken X {{was published by}} Atlus on November 25, 1999. While Atlus' earlier Megami Tensei titles were aimed fully at the Japanese market, Maken X had been designed from the outset to have an international appeal. Voice recording for the international release took place in North America. Meguro {{was involved in this}} process, which he remembered as a positive experience. The localization was handled cooperatively by Atlus and the American branch of Sega, who acted as the game's publishers. The game's international release was announced in February 2000. One of the points Atlus was concerned <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> international version was the use of Nazi imagery for some enemies. Due to what were described as [...] "cultural points that could be harmful", the game's graphics were altered for the international release to avoid controversy. The gameplay remained unchanged between versions. Kaneko described the voice recording as {{the most difficult part of}} the localization. Initially scheduled for release in March, the game was pushed forward into April for unspecified reasons, although it was speculated that it was due to that month already boasting several game releases. Maken X was eventually released in North America on April 26, 2000. In Europe, the game was released on July 7 of that year.|$|E
2500|$|After a few lean years, Tanaka made a come-back {{effort with}} the third entry in the Angel Guts series, the {{critical}} and box-office success, Angel Guts: Nami (1980). Jasper Sharp writes that, {{from the point of}} character, plotting and construction, Tanaka's film is the most satisfying entry in the series, based on an adult manga by Takashi Ishii. He notes, however, that Tanaka's visuals are over-active make the film a difficult one for most viewers. Tanaka recalled, [...] "I was determined to make a film which was much more impressive than the comic. One image of a film has to be much more impressive than one frame of the comic. That's what film is all <b>about.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> scene in which we see Nami's eye in close-up on the screen, I shot about 3,000 feet of film just to show the details of her eye and [...] movement, including the pulsing of a blood vessel." ...|$|E

2500|$|When casting <b>about</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role of Norma Desmond for the 1950 film Sunset Boulevard, Billy Wilder offered West the role. Still smarting {{from the}} {{censorship}} debacle of The Heat's On, [...] and the constraints placed on her characterization, she declined. The {{theme of the}} Wilder film, she noted, [...] was pure pathos, while her brand of comedy was always [...] "about uplifting the audience". [...] Mae West had a unique comic character that was timeless, {{in the same way}} Charlie Chaplin did. After Mary Pickford also declined the role, Gloria Swanson was cast. In subsequent years, West was offered the role of Vera Simpson, opposite Marlon Brando, in the 1957 film adaptation of Pal Joey, which she turned down, with the role going to Rita Hayworth. [...] In 1964, West was offered a leading role in Roustabout, starring Elvis Presley. She turned the role down, and Barbara Stanwyck was cast in her place. West was also approached for roles in Frederico Fellini's Juliet of the Spirits and Satyricon, but rejected both offers.|$|E
