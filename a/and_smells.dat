5|$|Arsenic is a grey, {{metallic}} looking solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.727 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more than aluminium; less than iron). It is stable in dry air but develops a golden bronze patina in moist air, which blackens on further exposure. Arsenic is attacked by nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. It reacts with fused caustic soda {{to give the}} arsenate Na3AsO3 and hydrogen gas. Arsenic sublimes at 615°C. The vapour is lemon-yellow <b>and</b> <b>smells</b> like garlic. Arsenic only melts under a pressure of 38.6 atm, at 817°C. It is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.9 × 104S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.5eV. Liquid arsenic is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.15eV.|$|E

25|$|Lactarius glyciosmus (commonly {{known as}} the coconut scented milk cap) is a semi-edible {{mushroom}} in the genus Lactarius. Mycorrhizal, {{it can be found}} growing in soil at the base of birch trees in Europe. It is typically coloured a greyish lilac, with the sometimes hollow stem a little lighter coloured than the cap. It has crowded, decurrent gills, <b>and</b> <b>smells</b> strongly of coconuts.|$|E
25|$|A {{hallucination}} {{is defined}} as sensory perception {{in the absence of}} external stimuli. Hallucinations are different from illusions, or perceptual distortions, which are the misperception of external stimuli. Hallucinations may occur in any of the senses and take on almost any form, which may include simple sensations (such as lights, colors, tastes, <b>and</b> <b>smells)</b> to experiences such as seeing and interacting with fully formed animals and people, hearing voices, and having complex tactile sensations.|$|E
25|$|Boyd's Onehunga Zoo was a {{constant}} source of aggravation for the local council, local residents would complain regularly about the sounds <b>and</b> <b>smells,</b> with regular attempts to close it in the following years by the Council, which prompted a successful run for mayor of Onehunga by Boyd. Finally a change in the By-laws by the Onehunga Borough Council forced Boyd to close the zoo in 1922. The Auckland City Council purchased the remainder of the animals, Boyd had not already sold to other individuals, as the basis for a group that would form the nucleus of the permanent zoo at Auckland's Western Springs. There is still a Boyd Street in Onehunga today.|$|E

40|$|Malnutrition {{is common}} in both adult and {{pediatric}} patients undergoing treatment for cancer. Patients commonly attribute difficulties maintaining food intake to an altered taste developed during treatment. This review summarizes {{what is known about}} taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> dysfunction in patients with undergoing chemotherapy as their main treatment modality. Self-reported taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> alterations are prevalent in upwards of 86 % of cancer patients. There is some evidence for decreased taste sensitivity in cancer patients when assessed using common gustatory tests. In some patients, taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> alterations may continue well after their cancer treatment has been completed. Such disorders can increase distress, reduce appetite and contribute towards poor nutritional status in cancer patients. There remain no effective interventions for improving the appetite or nutritional intake of patients with cancer experiencing taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> changes. There is a lack of consistency in assessment methodologies for measuring taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> changes in cancer patients and we therefore recommend that future work use well-established methods. Research should also take into account the role of food hedonics, food flavor and texture in assessing the association between taste dysfunction, poor oral intake and malnutrition in cancer patients. Both adult and child cancer patients should be counselled on the potential impact taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> dysfunction can have on their appetite and oral intake...|$|R
25|$|The film {{begins with}} the {{sentencing}} of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between {{the reading of the}} sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on a redheaded girl (Karoline Herfurth) selling yellow plums, following her and repeatedly attempting to sniff her, but startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked <b>and</b> <b>smells</b> her all over, becoming distraught when her scent fades. Afterwards, Grenouille is haunted by the desire to recreate the girl's aroma.|$|E
25|$|It is {{less than}} 1/8inch long and their body color can range from a dark purple to a light reddish-brown color and is sparsely and weakly dotted with small pits. They have short wings and long legs. The beetle lives under rocks and logs, in sinkholes, rotting wood, termite nest, and caves, {{although}} it is now only known to still exist in four caves in the Edwards Plateau, Travis County, Texas. Not all caves {{in the region have}} been surveyed, so this may be an underestimate. It lives in total darkness so there is no use for eyes and uses elaborate appendages and beefed up nerve centers to interpret slight air-pressure or temperature changes, sounds, <b>and</b> <b>smells.</b> This sensory equipment helps the beetle travel, sense objects, and ambush prey. There is no distinct reproduction pattern for the beetle and may reproduce at any time of the year if conditions are steady in the cave. Little is known about daily life of the mold beetle because of their secretive habitats. When going to observe them they are rarely found and when they are found it is usually only one to two specimens. They are so secretive that finding an individual is a rare event. It is also very hard to distinguish Texamaurops reddelli from other beetles in the Pselaphide family. Only upon microscopic study can the beetle be distinguished by its ocular knobs on its head. This makes it hard to identify the beetles in the field as they can easily be mistaken for another beetle species in the same family.|$|E

He {{secretly}} bought a farmhouse, Oak View (or Oak Hill), in a rural upland part of the District of Columbia, in 1886, and remodeled it into a Queen Anne style summer estate. He sold Oak View upon losing his bid for re-election in 1888. [...] Not long thereafter, suburban residential development reached the area, which {{came to be known}} as Oak View, and then Cleveland Heights, and eventually Cleveland Park.

In 1995 the display space was moved to the basement of the Dedham Community Theatre, a building with an aesthetic described in 2004 as [...] "ramshackle". The museum in Dedham had no fixed operating hours, instead being open while the theater upstairs was open.

He also criticised Tony Blair for allowing himself to be effectively overruled by Brown and said of Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, then CDS, that [...] "although brilliant at what he did, [...] {{could not have been}} expected to understand the sights, sounds <b>and</b> <b>smells</b> of the battlefield". The Daily Telegraph called the book [...] "a searing indictment of how New Labour, and to some extent the military's high command, failed to properly lead, fund and equip the armed forces for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan".|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} literary strengths in Tipping the Velvet, {{according to}} reviewers and literary scholars, are the vibrant {{portrayal of the}} districts and streets of London, and Waters' ability to create sympathetic and realistic characters. Her use of synaesthesia in lush descriptions particularly interested Harriet Malinowitz in The Women's Review of Books. For example, Malinowitz cites the scene when Nan first meets Kitty, removing her glove to shake Kitty's hand. Very much an oyster girl, Nan's hands are covered with [...] "those rank sea-scents, of liquor and oyster-flesh, crab-meat and whelks, which had flavoured my fingers and those of my family {{for so many years}} we had ceased, entirely, to notice them." [...] Nan is mortified that she smells like a herring, but Kitty assuages her fears, kissing her hand and telling her she instead smells like a mermaid. Malinowitz includes this and other descriptions of sights, sounds, <b>and</b> <b>smells</b> in Victorian London as examples of elements that are [...] "breathlessly and wittily detailed".|$|E
500|$|Russula parvovirescens, {{found in}} the eastern United States, can be {{distinguished}} from R.virescens by its smaller stature, with caps measuring [...] wide and stipe up to [...] long by [...] thick. Compared to R.virescens, {{it tends to be}} more bluish-green, the patches on its cap are larger, and it has a lined cap margin. Microscopically, the terminal cells in the cap cuticle of R.parvovirescens are more swollen than those of R.virescens, which has tapered and elongated terminal cells. Another green-capped Russula is R.aeruginea, but this species may be distinguished from R.virescens by its smaller size and smooth cap. Other green russulas with a smooth cap include R.heterophylla and R.cyanoxantha var. peltereaui. Russula crustosa, like R.virescens, also has an areolate cap, but the cap becomes sticky (viscid) when moist, and its color is more variable, as it may be reddish, yellowish, or brown. Also, the spore print of R.crustosa is a darker yellow than R.virescens. R.redolens has a cap that is [...] "drab-green to blue-green", but unlike R.virescens, is smooth. R.redolens has an unpleasant taste <b>and</b> <b>smells</b> of parsley.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{widespread}} rejection of his Gogmagog claims, Lethbridge became increasingly critical of the academic and professional archaeological community, believing that an attitude of what he called [...] "trade unionism" [...] had caused most archaeologists to reject independent thought. As a result, he decided to resign and move away from Cambridge in late 1957. Relocating to Branscombe in southern Devon, he and Mina set up home in Hole House, a fortified building that dated to the Early Modern period, and angered some of the locals by banning fox hunters from crossing his land. Lethbridge came to believe that Hole House was haunted, describing unexplained noises <b>and</b> <b>smells</b> there; this increased his interest in the paranormal, and he decided to devote much of his time to investigating such phenomena in what he deemed to be a scientific manner. Lethbridge believed that ghosts were projections stored in rock and other material substances and which echoed particularly emotional or traumatic events that either happened in the past or will happen in the future. He focused many of his experiments on dowsing using a pendulum, coming to believe that the length of string used and the number of oscillations could be used to determine the type of object being detected.|$|E
