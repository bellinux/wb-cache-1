5|$|Since the , {{there were}} hints that both Sara Sidle and Grissom were {{interested}} in each other romantically. In fact, the show's creators made Sara Sidle while thinking of a future love interest for Grissom, but during the show's first three seasons, Grissom flirted with all the female characters, and when Sara asked him out to dinner, he rejected her, claiming {{that he did not}} know what to do <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on between them.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{waking up}} again, Wells is {{surprised}} to find no bullet wounds on his body. Scully and Doggett arrive to interrogate Wells, but he is confused <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on. A furious Doggett claims {{that he has been}} accused of murdering his wife, Vicky, and initially believes that Wells is faking his confusion in order to build an insanity defense. However, Doggett shows signs of doubt when he notices Wells' genuine anguish over Vicky's death. Wells is brought into court and he recognizes his father-in-law, Al Cawdry, as the man who shot him. When Wells' next court date is announced to be Thursday, he realizes that he has somehow travelled back to the day before his shooting. When the judge decides to transfer Wells to a different cell, he makes a scene in the court and accuses Cawdry of planning to kill him during the transfer.|$|E
5|$|After {{cancelling}} the self-destruct, {{they find}} the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the Enterprise computers, but {{they are unable to}} decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on as the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the Enterprise to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the Enterprise returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she {{is not the same as}} before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{appreciation}} of total adult control is also considered vital, and information, {{such as how}} long a child will be with therapeutic foster parents or {{what will happen to}} him or her next, is deliberately withheld. Attachment parenting expert Nancy Thomas states that attachment-disordered children act worse when given information <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to occur because they will use the information to manipulate their environment and everyone in it.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} and most basic method of holding the work is a planing stop or dog ear, which is simply a peg or small piece of wood or metal that stands just above the surface {{at the end of the}} bench top. The work is placed on the bench with the end pushed against the stop. The force of the planing keeps the board in place, so long as the force is always toward the stop. Planing against a stop gives the woodworker good {{feedback}} - he can tell a lot <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on just by the pressure, force and balance required. A stop can take the form of a batten attached to the end of the bench, or it can be adjustable, able to be moved up and down according to the size of the work - or pushed down below the surface when not needed. A simple bench dog can serve as a planing stop.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{from the music}} press, with Billboard magazine predicting that [...] "the Byrds will be riding high on the LP charts again with this top rock package." [...] Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times was more cautious, noting that [...] "the album is a good one, {{but it would be}} sad if it served as a monument, marking the end of the Byrds' development. There is little to distinguish it from their previous LPs in terms of creativity." [...] A resoundingly positive review came from the pen of Peter Reilly, writing in Hi-Fi/Stereo Review, who described the record as [...] "an enjoyable and well-made album which, if listened to closely enough, explains a good deal <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on around us." ...|$|E
500|$|Feeling guilty, Jerry ends {{up going}} to the funeral, where he, again, apologizes for his remark. Isaac informs him that Manya had {{forgotten}} Jerry made the pony remark: [...] "Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad." [...] Elaine asks Isaac multiple times <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen with their apartment. Isaac eventually tells her that Jerry's cousin Jeffrey is {{going to live in}} it. When it starts to rain, Jerry realizes that the game will be postponed. The following day, after the game, Jerry, George and Elaine meet at Monk's Café, where they discuss the lousy way Jerry played softball. (Jerry recalls a certain play, about which he admits, [...] "It was the single worst moment of my life.") Elaine wonders if Manya's spirit put a spell on him.|$|E
500|$|Although {{alternative}} {{options to}} {{doing business with}} China are few for the business sector, many companies large and small, including within the important financial sector, are uneasy about the changing political climate. The head of the one business association in Hong Kong said: [...] "The middle-class, the professionals, even the accountants: people are just freaked out <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on... The last bastion of Hong Kong's guarantees is the law. What we have left is our legal system, but people fear {{that this may be}} under attack too". Steve Vickers, the principal of one local risk assessment firm said: [...] "The Hong Kong government appears to now have considerably diminished autonomy and the liaison office seems to be strengthening its position, [...] certainly sent a chill through the business and social arenas in Hong Kong".|$|E

500|$|The album {{includes}} one acoustic song, [...] "Hero of War", {{which is}} about an Iraq War Veteran looking back on his war experiences. It is described by Rolling Stone as an [...] "ambivalent aggro-folk track". McIlrath said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to take the}} perspective [...] of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'" [...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on on the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to {{what is happening in the}} news media. I just thought that this needed to go into a song." ...|$|E
2500|$|CCI has {{no rules}} to cover {{anything}} outside of co-counselling sessions, so {{the manner in}} which co-counsellors relate to one another is up to them. [...] New co-counsellors are usually alerted to the possibility that they may develop strong feelings about people they counsel with and are advised to stick to co-counselling with them until they have a clearer idea <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on. [...] Gatherings of co-counsellors are somewhat like temporary intentional communities and co-counsellors generally {{seem to be able to}} relate and organise very effectively in a no rules environment.|$|E
2500|$|Callisto being {{seduced by}} Zeus/Jupiter in {{disguise}} {{was also a}} popular subject, usually called [...] "Jupiter and Callisto"; it was the clearest common subject with lesbian lovers from classical mythology. [...] The two lovers are usually shown happily embracing in a bower. The violent rape described by Ovid as following Callisto's realization {{of what is going}} on is rarely shown. [...] In versions before about 1700 Callisto may show some doubt <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, as in the versions by Rubens. It was especially popular in the 18th century, when depictions were increasingly erotic; François Boucher painted several versions.|$|E

2500|$|McKenna {{was opposed}} to Christianity and most forms of {{organized}} religion or guru-based forms of spiritual awakening, favouring shamanism, which he believed was the broadest spiritual paradigm available, stating that: [...] "What I think happened {{is that in the}} world of prehistory all religion was experiential, and it was based on the pursuit of ecstasy through plants. And at some time, very early, a group interposed itself between people and direct experience of the 'Other.' This created hierarchies, priesthoods, theological systems, castes, ritual, taboos. Shamanism, on the other hand, is an experiential science that deals with an area where we know nothing. It {{is important to remember that}} our epistemological tools have developed very unevenly in the West. We know a tremendous amount <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on in the heart of the atom, but we know absolutely nothing about the nature of the mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Importantly, the ready-to-hand only {{emerges from}} the prior {{attitude}} in which we care <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on {{and we see the}} hammer in a context or world of equipment that is handy or remote, and that is there [...] "in order to" [...] do something. In this sense the ready-to-hand is primordial compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and [...] "close" [...] to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be. Only by studying our [...] "average-everyday" [...] understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of our relationships to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can we lay appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world.|$|E
2500|$|James Reed of The Boston Globe complimented [...] "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] as [...] "a thumping club cut that's irresistible on an {{otherwise}} forgettable album." [...] Barry Walters of Spin commented that, apart from [...] "Don't Wake Me Up", Fortune [...] "makes {{it easy for}} Chris Brown's haters and harder on his many fans", writing that [...] "there's {{more than the usual}} number of midtempo ballads that once again mix sex-fantasy titillation with his now-familiar toxic defensiveness". Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot called the album [...] "a pure-pop candy cane, meant to be enjoyed, consumed and forgotten", commenting that [...] "thinking would ruin everything" [...] and [...] "its mixture of smut, vulnerability, menace and dancefloor celebration tells us next to nothing <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on between Chris Brown’s ears, which is probably for the best." [...] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times likened its trendy musical style to a product's shelf life and attributed it to [...] "Brown's reflex of curbing his creative impulses at nearly every turn, with a few killer exceptions, and showing a conservatism unbecoming such a self-styled renegade." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Publishers Weekly {{reviewer}} selected Sniegoski's [...] "Noah's Orphans" [...] as {{the best}} of the four stories noting that [...] "Sniegoski manages to make a far-fetched setup both plausible and moving". The editor at SFRevu wrote [...] "the depth of characterization and emotional conflict [...] stands out". The Entertainment Examiner reviewer identified both [...] "Noah's Orphans" [...] and Butcher's [...] "The Warrior" [...] as equally the best stories saying “Both Sniegoski and Butcher infuse their characters...with solid, relatable emotion that truly makes you care <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on. Their action and dialogue is tense and engaging, even in the calmest scene, and the details they use are vivid enough to create a strong mental image of the scene without taking over the story." [...] Other reviewers found [...] "The Warrior" [...] to be typical of the Harry Dresden series. Richardson's [...] "The Third Death of the Little Clay Dog" [...] was called [...] "a delightful tale" [...] and [...] "an intriguing mystery" [...] that [...] "neatly merges noir conventions with a fantastical plot", though the characterization was panned as being [...] "flat and inexpressive". Though described as [...] "a roller coaster ride of a story" [...] and [...] "wildly imaginative" [...] Green's [...] "The Difference A Day Makes" [...] was found to employ [...] "gratuitous macabre writing" [...] in trying to describe [...] "increasingly twisted and depraved scenarios, using the same stock descriptions and dialogue". Another reviewer wrote that [...] "Green goes overboard" [...] describing Nightside so that [...] "story is more about the setting than any actual plot... the ending feel like a letdown".|$|E
