I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing.

500|$|Reflecting {{the treaty}} between the British and French governments {{that led to}} Concorde's construction, the name Concorde is from the French word [...] (...) , which has an English equivalent, [...] Both words mean agreement, harmony or union. The name was officially changed to Concord by Harold Macmillan in {{response}} to a perceived slight by Charles de Gaulle. At the French roll-out in Toulouse in late 1967, the British Government Minister for Technology, Tony Benn, announced that he would change the spelling back to Concorde. This created a nationalist uproar that died down when Benn stated that the suffixed [...] "e" [...] represented [...] "Excellence, England, Europe and Entente (Cordiale)". In his memoirs, he recounts a tale of a letter from an irate Scotsman claiming: [...] "ou talk about 'E' for England, but part of it is made in Scotland." [...] Given Scotland's contribution of providing the nose cone for the aircraft, Benn replied, [...] "t was also 'E' for 'Écosse' (the French name for Scotland)– <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> have added 'e' for extravagance and 'e' for escalation as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{reworked}} 1996 Broadway production received mixed reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times disliked it: [...] "This latest King <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> {{look like}} a million dollars as a regional production; on Broadway... it's a disappointment. The score remains enchanting but, somewhere along the line, {{there has been a}} serious failure of the theatrical imagination." [...] But Liz Smith enthused: [...] "The King and I is perfect"; and the Houston Chronicle wrote, of the subsequent tour, [...] "The King and I is the essence of musical theater, an occasion when drama, music, dance and decor combine to take the audience on an unforgettable journey." [...] Critic Richard Christiansen in the Chicago Tribune observed, of a 1998 tour stop at the Auditorium Theatre: [...] "Written in a more leisurely and innocent and less politically correct period, [...] cannot escape the 1990s onus of its condescending attitude toward the pidgin English monarch and his people. And its story moves at a pace that's a mite too slow for this more hurried day and age." [...] When the production reached London in 2000, however, it received uniformly positive reviews; the Financial Times called it [...] "a handsome, spectacular, strongly performed introduction to one of the truly great musicals".|$|E

2500|$|The studio did {{not like}} Stone's choice to play Nixon. They wanted Tom Hanks or Jack Nicholson [...] two of Stone's {{original}} choices. The director briefly considered Gene Hackman, Robin Williams, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Stone met with Warren Beatty but the actor wanted to make too many changes to the script. Stone cast Hopkins based on his performances in The Remains of the Day and Shadowlands. Of Hopkins, Stone said, [...] "The isolation of Tony is what struck me. The loneliness.

2500|$|The salvage of Squalus was {{commanded}} by Rear Admiral Cyrus W. Cole, Commander of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, who supervised salvage officer Lieutenant Floyd A. Tusler from the Construction Corps. Tusler's {{plan was to}} lift the submarine in three stages {{to prevent it from}} rising too quickly, out of control, with one end up, in which case there would be a high likelihood of it sinking again. For 50 days, divers worked to pass cables underneath the submarine and attach pontoons for buoyancy. On 13 July 1939, the stern was raised successfully, but when the men attempted to free the bow from the hard blue clay, the vessel began to rise far too quickly, slipping its cables. Ascending vertically, the submarine broke the surface, and [...] of the bow reached into the air for not more than ten seconds before she sank once again {{all the way to the}} bottom. Momsen said of the mishap, [...] "pontoons were smashed, hoses cut <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> add, hearts were broken." [...] After 20 more days of preparation, with a radically redesigned pontoon and cable arrangement, the next lift was successful, as were two further operations. Squalus was towed into Portsmouth on 13 September, and decommissioned on 15 November. A total of 628 dives had been made in rescue and salvage operations.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics on {{the record}} were {{described}} by the band members as [...] "a collaborative psycho-therapy session wherein personal demons of various sizes and importance are exorcised, vilified, taken revenge upon and laid to rest." [...] Vig said they tried to deal with [...] "dark themes that I {{think a lot of}} people can relate to in some way or another", which included voyeurism, hedonism, perversion, obsession and [...] "the art of self-destruction." [...] Manson stated that even though she put together most of the songs, [...] "everybody has ideas that come to the table and I just use what I fancy. When we're working on something, the lyrics take a while to work on and [...] come to me and say 'I've had these ideas, use them if you want' and if there's something I like, I'll stick it in with my own, or vice-versa. Some people come in going 'I've got this great title for a song' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> use that." [...] Manson remarked that while the content was [...] "a lot more poppy" [...] than most of her previous work, the songs invoked the dark side of her nature, as [...] "sometimes I'm a bit wee creepy, and that definitely comes out in the music." [...] She also declared that music [...] "unlocks sensations and feelings that you keep inside, that society doesn't allow you to show", saying that the gist of a mean-spirited song like [...] "Vow" [...] is very real despite [...] "none of us hav ever really acted on those feelings". Vig added that the band was eager to exploit the contrast between words and music: [...] "The initial idea was to make this a dark lyric with a shiny, happy, pop sensibility. You could be singing this really catchy line and realize the lyrics were totally wacked." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Stevenson gave a {{presentation}} at an emergency {{session of the}} Security Council. In his presentation, which attracted national television coverage, he forcefully asked Soviet UN representative Valerian Zorin if his country was installing nuclear missiles in Cuba, and when Zorin appeared reluctant to reply, Stevenson punctuated with the demand [...] "Don't wait for the translation, answer 'yes' or 'no'!" [...] When Zorin replied that [...] "I am not in an American court of law, and therefore do not answer a question put {{to me in the}} manner of a prosecuting counsel...you will have your answer in due course", Stevenson retorted, [...] "I am prepared to wait for my answer until Hell freezes over." [...] Stevenson then showed photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane which proved the existence of nuclear missiles in Cuba, just after Zorin had implied they did not exist. Stevenson also attended several meetings of the EXCOMM at the White House during the Missile Crisis, where he boldly proposed to make an exchange with the Soviets: if they would remove their missiles from Cuba, the United States would agree to remove its obsolete Jupiter missiles from Turkey. However, he faced strong opposition from some other EXCOMM members, who regarded such an exchange as a sign of weakness. According to Kennedy adviser and Stevenson friend George W. Ball, who was present, these members [...] "intemperately upbraided Stevenson... outraged and shrill." [...] However, President Kennedy remarked [...] "You have to admire Adlai, he sticks to his position even when everyone is jumping on him", and Robert Kennedy wrote that [...] "Stevenson has since been criticized for the position he took at the meeting...although I disagreed strongly with his recommendations, I thought he was courageous to make them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>might</b> add that they made as much sense as some others considered during that period of time." [...] Stevenson remarked [...] "I know that most of those fellows will consider me a coward for the rest of my life for what I said today, but perhaps we need a coward in the room when we are talking about nuclear war." [...] In fact, the Kennedy Administration did remove the Jupiter-class MRBMs from Italy and Turkey some six months after the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, and there is evidence that President Kennedy privately agreed that, if the Soviets would remove their missiles from Cuba, he would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey and Italy at a later date. [...] The deal was kept a secret for many years, however, and Stevenson was thus given no credit for his original suggestion.|$|E
