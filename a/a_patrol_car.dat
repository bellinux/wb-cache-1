It has survived many troubles, including flooding in its opening year, damage {{on the night of}} 8/9 December 1940 by enemy action, and an arson attack on Christmas Eve 1980, when the church was only just saved from complete destruction by the presence of a police officer in <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> nearby, who managed to call the fire brigade.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Palma Nova bombing {{occurred}} on July 30, 2009, when a limpet {{bomb went off}} outside a Civil Guard barracks {{in the town of}} Palma Nova, Majorca, Spain. The bomb was placed under <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> and two Civil Guard officers {{died as a result of}} the explosion. A second device was found under another Civil Guard vehicle at nearby barracks and safely exploded by police. On August 9, the Basque nationalist and separatist organisation ETA claimed responsibility for the attack, while four other bombs exploded around restaurants and shopping centres in Palma, Majorca, causing no injuries.|$|E

25|$|A {{response}} car {{is similar}} to <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car,</b> but {{is likely to be}} of a higher specification, capable of higher speeds, and will certainly be fitted with audible and visual warnings. These cars are usually only used to respond to emergency incidents, so are designed to travel fast, and may carry specialist equipment, such as assault rifles, or shotguns. In the UK, each station usually only has one, which is called an area car.|$|E

25|$|In late March 1975, Bar-Jonah, impersonating {{a police}} officer, {{abducted}} eight-year-old Richard O'Conner {{while he was}} on his way to school, then proceeded to sexually assault and strangle him. A neighbor, looking out of her window, observed the abduction and notified authorities, who began searching for the boy. <b>A</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> later observed a car matching that used in the abduction parked far away from others in a parking lot, and after calling for backup, ordered Bar-Jonah out of the car. O'Conner was found in the car bloodied, having defecated and urinated on himself from the sexual assault, and near the point of death.|$|E
25|$|Traffic police cars, {{known in}} the UK as Road Policing Units, are cars {{designed}} {{for the job of}} enforcing traffic laws, and as such usually have the highest performance of any of the police vehicles, as they must be capable of catching most other vehicles on the road. They may be fitted with special bumpers designed to force vehicles off the road, and may have visual and audible warnings, with special audible warnings which can be heard from a greater distance. In some police forces, the term traffic car may refer to cars specifically equipped for traffic control in addition to enforcing traffic laws. As such, these cars may differ only slightly from <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car,</b> including having radar and laser speed detection equipment, traffic cones, flares, and traffic control signs.|$|E
25|$|Mătăsăreanu's {{vehicle was}} {{rendered}} inoperable after {{two of its}} tires were shot out and the windshield covered in bullet holes. At 9:56 am, he attempted to carjack a yellow 1963 Jeep Gladiator on Archwood by shooting at the driver who fled on foot, three blocks east of where Phillips died. He quickly transferred all of his weapons and ammunition from the getaway car, {{but was unable to}} operate the Jeep due to him being unfamiliar with the stick-shift vehicle. As KCBS and KCAL helicopters hovered overhead, <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> driven by SWAT officers quickly arrived and stopped {{on the opposite side of}} the truck to where the Chevrolet was stopped. Mătăsăreanu left the truck, took cover behind the original getaway car, and engaged them for two-and-a-half minutes of almost uninterrupted gunfire. Mătăsăreanu's chest armor deflected a double tap from one of the SWAT officers, which briefly winded him before he continued firing. At least one SWAT officer fired his AR-15 below the cars and wounded Mătăsăreanu in his unprotected lower legs; he was soon unable to continue and put his hands up to show surrender.|$|E

50|$|United States v.

500|$|On 23 July 2009, {{after the}} {{programme}} underwent a major overhaul, the opening sequence and theme were heavily changed. This time, the classic [...] "Overkill" [...] theme was completely removed, {{and a new}} theme created by Simba Studios was used. However, producer Jonathan Young stated that echoes of [...] "Overkill" [...] can still {{be heard in the}} theme. The opening sequence featured <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> driving through the streets of Sun Hill. The closing sequence follows the same patrol car, however, this time, from an overhead view.

500|$|At {{the same}} time as the police handed control over to the SAS, they began making {{arrangements}} for the IRA operatives once they were in custody, including finding a police vehicle in which to transport the prisoners. <b>A</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> containing Inspector Luis Revagliatte and three other uniformed officers, apparently on routine patrol and with no knowledge of Operation Flavius, was ordered to return to police headquarters as a matter of urgency. The police car was stuck in heavy traffic travelling north on Smith Dorrien Avenue, close to the roundabout where it meets Winston Churchill Avenue. The official account states that at this point, Revagliatte's driver activated the siren on the police car in order to expedite the journey back to headquarters, intending to approach the roundabout from the wrong side of the road and turn the vehicle around. The siren apparently startled McCann and Farrell, just as Soldiers [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] were about to challenge them, outside the Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. [...] "Soldier A" [...] stated at the inquest that Farrell looked back at him and appeared to realise who [...] "A" [...] was; [...] "A" [...] testified that he was drawing his pistol and intended to shout a challenge to her, but [...] "events overtook the warning": that McCann's right arm [...] "moved aggressively across the front of his body", leading [...] "A" [...] to believe that McCann was reaching for a remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] shot McCann once in the back; [...] "A" [...] went on to tell the inquest that he believed Farrell then reached for her handbag, and that he believed Farrell may also have been reaching for a remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] also shot Farrell once in the back, before returning to McCann—he shot McCann a further three times (once in the body and twice in the head). [...] "Soldier B" [...] testified that he reached similar conclusions to [...] "A", and shot Farrell twice, then McCann once or twice, then returned to Farrell, shooting her a further three times. Soldiers [...] "C" [...] and [...] "D" [...] testified at the inquest that they were moving to apprehend Savage, who was by now [...] south of the petrol station, as gunfire began behind them. [...] "Soldier C" [...] testified that Savage turned around while simultaneously reaching towards his jacket pocket at {{the same time}} as [...] "C" [...] shouted [...] "Stop!"; [...] "C" [...] stated that he believed Savage was reaching for a remote detonator, at which point he opened fire. [...] "Soldier C" [...] shot Savage six times, while [...] "Soldier D" [...] fired nine times. All three IRA members died. One of the soldiers' bullets, believed to have passed through Farrell, grazed a passer-by.|$|E

As the two were walking in, they were spotted by two LAPD officers, Loren Farrell and Martin Perello, who were driving down Laurel Canyon in <b>a</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car.</b> Officer Perello issued a call on the radio, [...] "15-A-43, requesting assistance, we have a possible 211 in progress at the Bank of America."

50|$|VASCAR (Visual Average Speed Computer And Recorder) is a {{technology}} {{for determining the}} speed of a moving vehicle. It is used by police officers to catch speeding motorists.
