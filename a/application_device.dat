40|$|BackgroundThe present {{preliminary}} study describes concentration time courses of the NSAID carprofen in the plasma and synovial fluid in a microfrature sheep model after transcutaneous treatments {{with a novel}} <b>application</b> <b>device</b> (Vetdrop®). To treat circumscribed inflammatory processes a transcutaneous <b>application</b> <b>device</b> could potentially be beneficial. After transcutaneous application normally lower systemic concentrations are measured which may {{reduce the incidence of}} side effects, whereas efficacy is still maintained. In this study carprofen was used based on its capacity to provide analgesia after orthopaedic procedures in sheep and it is considered that it may have a positive influence on the healing of cartilage in low concentrations. ResultsIn all transcutaneously treated animals, carprofen plasma concentrations exceeded those of synovial fluid, although plasma levels remained significantly reduced (300 -fold) as compared to carprofen administered intravenously. Furthermore, in contrast to the intravenously treated animals, a modest accumulation of carprofen in plasma and synovial fluid was observed in the transcutaneously treated animals over the 6 -week treatment period. ConclusionsThe transcutaneously administered carprofen using the Vetdrop® device penetrated the skin and both, plasma- and synovial concentrations could be measured repeatedly over time. This novel device may be considered a valuable transcutaneous drug delivery system...|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of gel-based two-dimensional protein separations with protein identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is the workhorse for the large-scale analyses of proteomes. Such high-throughput proteomic approaches require automation of all post-separation steps and the in-gel digest of proteins especially {{is often the}} bottleneck in the protein identification workflow. With the objective of reaching the same high performance of manual low-throughput in-gel digest procedures, we have developed a novel stack-type digestion device and implemented it into a commercially available robotic liquid handling system. This modified system is capable of performing in-gel digest, extraction of proteolytic peptides, and subsequent sample preparation for MALDI-MS without any manual intervention, but with a performance at least identical to manual procedures as indicated {{on the basis of}} the sequence coverage obtained by peptide mass fingerprinting. For further refinement of the automated protein identification workflow, we have also developed a motor-operated matrix <b>application</b> <b>device</b> to reproducibly obtain homogenous matrix preparation of high quality. This matrix preparation was found to be suitable for the automated acquisition of both peptide mass fingerprint and fragment ion spectra from the same sample spot, a prerequisite for high confidence protein identifications on the basis of peptide mass and sequence information. Due to the implementation of the stack-type digestion device and the motor-operated matrix <b>application</b> <b>device,</b> the entire platform works in a reliable, cost-effective, and sensitive manner, yielding high confidence protein identifications even for samples in the concentration range of as low as 100 fmol protein per gel plug...|$|E
