5|$|The doctor tells Scully that Emily {{is getting}} worse. A {{woman from the}} {{adoption}} agency arrives and wants to stop Scully from making decisions for Emily. Mulder connects {{the names of the}} women in the nursing home to recent births and finds that Dr. Calderon was treating them. Emily reacts badly to being placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Mulder finds medical records with Scully's name on them <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home,</b> along with a live fetus in a refrigerated chamber. Mulder finds Calderon entering soon after, and Detective Kresge arrives as well. Mulder and Kresge confront Calderon, who attacks Kresge. Despite Mulder's warning Kresge shoots Calderon, whose wounds cause him to spew green blood which incapacitates Kresge. Mulder quickly leaves the building to avoid being affected by the blood. Calderon morphs into Kresge, and deceives Mulder and escapes. Mulder returns to the hospital, where Emily has gone into a coma. Days later Emily has died. Mulder visits Scully at the funeral chapel, telling her that Kresge is recovering and all evidence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> and Prangen is gone. The only evidence left is Emily's body, but the agents instead find sand bags in her coffin along with Scully's cross necklace, which she had previously given to Emily.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 2006, Venerable Ho died peacefully in {{her sleep}} at the Man Fut Tong Nursing Home, at about 9:30pm, just one month before turning 98. Until being {{hospital}}ised in November 2005, she had cooked for and looked after herself and played {{an active role in}} running both the temple and the nursing home. During her hospital stay, she suffered a stroke, which affected her speech and paralysed the left side of her body. Discharged in December 2005, she was recuperating well <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> until she developed a chest infection and breathing difficulties a few days before she died.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home,</b> the leprechaun {{pretends to}} be O'Grady. After he chases Tory to an elevator, the leprechaun throws O'Grady's bloodied body down the shaft as Tory flees. Before dying, O'Grady tells her {{that the only way}} to kill the leprechaun is with a four-leaf clover. Tory returns to the farmhouse, where she {{searches}} for a clover until she is attacked by the leprechaun; Nathan and Ozzie save her. Alex sets a trap near the well, but the leprechaun almost kills him. Ozzie reveals he swallowed the last gold coin, and the leprechaun critically wounds him to get at it. Before the leprechaun can kill Ozzie, Alex takes a four-leaf clover Tory has found, sticks it to a wad of gum, and shoots it into the leprechaun's mouth, taking away his power. The leprechaun falls into the well, but his skeleton climbs out. Nathan pushes the leprechaun back into the well and blows up both the well and leprechaun with gasoline. The police arrive, and Tory is reunited with her father. As the police investigate the remains of the well, the leprechaun vows he will not rest until he recovers every last piece of his gold.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; {{according}} to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing blood poisoning. Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his team-mates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he saw were able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin with a severe fever for most of the trip. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12operations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> to which he was taken. His condition worsened {{to the point where the}} doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season. No official announcement about Hammond's illness was made, other than to say he was in a nursing home. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease. He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond's subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.|$|E
25|$|Back in New York, the horrified {{nursing home}} {{residents}} watch television news reports of the murder/suicide. Max reveals that he recognized Zev as Wallisch when he arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home,</b> and that Wallisch and Sturm killed his family.|$|E

A journalist discovers Lawrence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> and decides to write a biography about her.|$|E

25|$|The Drammen Line {{past the}} site of Høvik Station opened as a narrow gauge railway on 7 October 1872. The area of Jong was at first served by Sandvika Station and from 1873 also by Slependen Station. The need for a station serving Jong was first {{articulated}} during the early 1930s by the manager of Fru Hjorts Pleiehjem, who served 300 patients and 60 employees <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home.</b> The residents' association for Jongåsen joined in on the effort through {{a letter to the}} Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in April 1935. They argued that some passengers taking the bus would switch to the train. They met with NSB' director the following year, without success. NSB responded that this would increase travel time for the trains, that {{it would be difficult to}} stop because of the hill and that it would be difficult to fit into the schedule.|$|E

2500|$|... "Joanne" [...] was {{featured}} in documentary film, , which chronicled the recording of the parent album and the singer's life. In one of the scenes, the singer and her father visits her grandmother <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home,</b> {{so that she can}} listen to the track about her daughter. While Gaga's dad was [...] "overcome with emotion, [...] steps out of the room during the visit", her grandmother reassures the singer that she [...] "got it right" [...] with the song. Spencer Kornhaber from The Atlantic named it [...] "the most memorable scene of the documentary". Bonnie Stiernberg from Billboard thought that [...] "the film reaches an apex during [...] key scene", calling it [...] "an intimate single-camera shot that moves from Gaga's grandmother's face to her father to Gaga, who plays the song on her cellphone." [...] Leslie Helperin from The Hollywood Reporter also highlighted this part of the biography, writing that [...] "the scene in which she plays 'Joanne'... to her aged grandmother is particularly fascinating. Gaga clearly craves approval and validation from the elderly lady and seems to be pushing to create a cathartic drama out of the scene, but her grandmother seems resistant to all this emotional hyperbole, insisting that the loss is well in the past now."

2500|$|Manet and Baudelaire became {{constant}} companions {{from around}} 1855. In the early 1860s, Baudelaire accompanied Manet on daily sketching trips and often met him socially. Manet also lent Baudelaire money and looked after his affairs, particularly when Baudelaire went to Belgium. Baudelaire encouraged Manet {{to strike out}} on his own path and not succumb to criticism. [...] "Manet has great talent, a talent which will stand the test of time. But he has a weak character. He seems to me crushed and stunned by shock." [...] In his painting Music in the Tuileries, Manet includes portraits of his friends Théophile Gautier, Jacques Offenbach, and Baudelaire. While it's difficult to differentiate who influenced whom, both Manet and Baudelaire discussed and expressed some common themes through their respective arts. Baudelaire praised the modernity of Manet's subject matter: [...] "almost all our originality comes from the stamp that 'time' imprints upon our feelings." [...] When Manet's famous Olympia (1863), a portrait of a nude prostitute, provoked a scandal for its blatant realism mixed with an imitation of Renaissance motifs, Baudelaire worked privately to support his friend, though he offered no public defense (he was, however, ill at the time). When Baudelaire returned from Belgium after his stroke, Manet and his wife were frequent visitors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>home</b> and she would play passages from Wagner for Baudelaire on the piano.|$|E
