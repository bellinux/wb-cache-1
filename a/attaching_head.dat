40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} whether cross-bridge cycle {{models with}} one or two tension-generating steps can account for the force-velocity relation of and tension response to length steps of frog skeletal muscle. Transition-state theory defined the strain dependence of the rate constants. The filament stiffness was non-Hookean. Models were refined against experimental data by simulated annealing and downhill simplex runs. Models with one tension-generating step were rejected, as they had a low efficiency and fitted the experimental data relatively poorly. The best model with two tension-generating steps (stroke distances 5. 6 and 4. 6  nm) and a cross-bridge stiffness of 1. 7 pN/nm gave a good account of the experimental data. The two tensing steps allow an efficiency of up to 38 % during shortening. In an isometric contraction, 54. 7 % of the <b>attached</b> <b>heads</b> were in a pre-tension-generating state, 44. 5 % of the <b>attached</b> <b>heads</b> had undergone the first tension-generating step, and only 0. 8 % had undergone both tension-generating steps; they bore 34 %, 64 %, and 2 %, respectively, of the isometric tension. During slow shortening, the second tensing step made a greater contribution. During lengthening, up to 93 % of the <b>attached</b> <b>heads</b> were in a pre-tension-generating state yet bore elevated tension by being dragged to high strains before detaching...|$|R

40|$|SummaryMuscle force {{results from}} the {{interaction}} of the globular heads of myosin-II with actin filaments. We studied the structure-function relationship in the myosin motor in contracting muscle fibers by using temperature jumps or length steps combined with time-resolved, low-angle X-ray diffraction. Both perturbations induced simultaneous changes in the active muscle force and in the extent of labeling of the actin helix by stereo-specifically bound myosin heads at a constant total number of <b>attached</b> <b>heads.</b> The generally accepted hypothesis assumes that muscle force is generated solely by tilting of the lever arm, or the light chain domain of the myosin head, about its catalytic domain firmly bound to actin. Data obtained suggest an additional force-generating step: the “roll and lock” transition of catalytic domains of non-stereo-specifically <b>attached</b> <b>heads</b> to a stereo-specifically bound state. A model based on this scheme is described to quantitatively explain the data...|$|R

40|$|Generation {{of force}} and {{shortening}} in striated muscle {{is due to the}} cyclic interactions of the globular portion (the head) of the myosin molecule, extending from the thick filament, with the actin filament. The work produced in each interaction is due to a conformational change (the working stroke) driven by the hydrolysis of ATP on the catalytic site of the myosin head. However, the precise mechanism {{and the size of the}} force and length step generated in one interaction are still under question. Here we reinvestigate the endothermic nature of the force-generating process by precisely determining, in tetanised intact frog muscle fibres under sarcomere length control, the effect of temperature on both isometric force and force response to length changes. We show that raising the temperature: (1) increases the force and the strain of the myosin <b>heads</b> <b>attached</b> in the isometric contraction by the same amount (∼ 70 %, from 2 to 17 °C); (2) increases the rate of quick force recovery following small length steps (range between − 3 and 2 nm (half-sarcomere) − 1) with a Q 10 (between 2 and 12 °C) of 1. 9 (releases) and 2. 3 (stretches); (3) does not affect the maximum extent of filament sliding accounted for by the working stroke in the <b>attached</b> <b>heads</b> (10 nm (half-sarcomere) − 1). These results indicate that in isometric conditions the structural change leading to force generation in the <b>attached</b> myosin <b>heads</b> can be modulated by temperature at the expense of the structural change responsible for the working stroke that drives filament sliding. The energy stored in the elasticity of the <b>attached</b> myosin <b>heads</b> at the plateau of the isometric tetanus increases with temperature, but even at high temperature this energy is only a fraction of the mechanical energy released by <b>attached</b> <b>heads</b> during filament sliding...|$|R

In these three states, each thought to mimic a different stage in ATP turnover, the double-headed motors {{attach to the}} microtu-bules by one head only, with the free head tethered in relatively ®xed positions. The three structures differ both {{in the way the}} <b>attached</b> <b>heads</b> interact with tubulin and in the position of the tethered heads. In the strongly binding rigor and AMP.

The data argue against model mechanisms in which a conformational change in the bound head guides the free head closer to its next binding site; on the contrary, the transition from ADP-®lled via rigor to the AMP. PNP (ATP-like) state of the bound head produces a small motion of the free head in the counter-productive direction. How-ever, the observation that the tethered head points towards the minus end, in all three states, is consistent with the idea that the relative arrangement of the heads in a dimer is a major determinant of direction-ality...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground Kinesins are a {{superfamily}} {{of motor}} proteins that use ATP hydrolysis to fuel movement along microtubules {{and participate in}} many crucial phases of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Usually these motors are heterotetramers of two heavy and two light chains, and have globular motor domains on the two heavy chains. Most kinesins move towards the microtubule ‘plus end’, but some, such as ncd (nonclaret disjunctional protein), move in the opposite direction. Heavy chain dimers produced by overexpression are viable motors. Results In order to establish whether the opposite directionality of kinesin and ncd dimers is related to notable conformational differences, we have used electron cryo-microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction methods to investigate the structure of kinesin and ncd dimers attached to microtubules {{in the presence of}} AMP–PNP (5 ′-adenylylimidodiphosphate), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue. Three-dimensional maps of the motor–microtubule complexes show the motors to have one unattached, and one <b>attached</b> <b>head</b> per tubulin dimer. The polarity of the reconstructions was determined for each individual microtubule. Attachment occurs on the crest of a protofilament {{at the end of the}} tubulin dimer that points towards the plus end of the microtubule. The <b>attached</b> <b>head</b> extends over the next tubulin molecule along the protofilament. The unattached heads of kinesin and ncd have distinctly different conformations. Conclusions The <b>attached</b> <b>heads</b> of kinesin and ncd appear to be similar and to interact with the same region of the plus end-oriented tubulin subunits. The free heads, however, are quite different, which suggests that directionality could be determined by differences in the dimer conformations. Work is in progress to obtain three-dimensional maps in the presence of different nucleotides with the aim of understanding how these motors move along microtubules...|$|R
40|$|A {{model has}} been {{developed}} for characterizing the interaction between strongly-binding myosin cross-bridges and actin in muscle fibers under equilibrium conditions where both heads of the myosin cross-bridge bind to actin. The model, that of Anderson and Schoenberg (1987. Biophys. J. 52 : 1077 - 1082) is quite {{similar to that of}} Schoenberg (1985. Biophys. J. 48 : 467 - 475), except that explicit account is taken of the fact that each crossbridge has two heads which can bind to actin. The key assumption that allows this model to explain a large body of data unexplained by the Schoenberg (1985) model is that the two crossbridge heads are not totally independent of one another after attachment. After the first <b>head</b> <b>attaches,</b> the second <b>head</b> is then free to attach only to an actin site distal to the first head. This means that when the more distally <b>attached</b> <b>head</b> subsequently detaches and reattaches (as the heads continually do), it will not reattach in a position of lesser strain and reduce the force it supports, but instead will remain attached in its strained position until the proximally <b>attached</b> <b>head</b> also detaches. This model gives an explanation for two important and otherwise unexplained observations made previously: it explains why at ionic strengths in the range of 50 - 120 mM, (a) the rate constant of force decay after a small stretch is a sigmoidal function of nucleotide analogue concentration, and (b) why in the presence of analogues or in rigor the rate constant of force decay after a small stretch is significantly slower than the rate constant for myosin subfragment- 1 detachment from actin in solution...|$|R

40|$|Kinesin binds to microtubules with half-site ADP {{release to}} form a {{tethered}} intermediate with one <b>attached</b> <b>head</b> without nucleotide and one tethered head that retains its bound ADP. For DKH 405 containing amino acid residues 1 - 405 of Drosophila kinesin, release of the remaining ADP from the tethered head is slow (0. 05 s(- 1)), but release is accelerated by added ADP or ATP. The maximum rate of ADP-stimulated dissociation of tethered DKH 405 from the microtubule is approximately 12 s(- 1) as determined by turbidity. Parallel measurements of ADP-stimulated release of 22 ̆ 7 (32 ̆ 7) -O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) -ADP (mantADP) from the tethered intermediate by fluorescence indicate that the reaction is biphasic with a fast phase that occurs {{at a rate that}} is similar to dissociation. The rate of the slow phase is dependent on the concentrations of salt and microtubules and is equal in each case to the rate for bimolecular stimulation of ADP release by microtubules as measured independently. These results are consistent with a scheme in which the fast phase, with approximately one-third of the total amplitude change, is due to ADP-stimulated release of mantADP from the tethered intermediate at approximately 6 s(- 1). This direct release of mantADP continues until terminated by dissociation of DKH 405 from the microtubule at approximately 12 s(- 1). The majority of the amplitude change thus occurs through bimolecular recombination of DKH 405. mantADP with microtubules following initial dissociation. Analysis of a simple scheme indicates that hydrolysis of ATP at the <b>attached</b> <b>head</b> before the tethered head can release its ADP and become tightly bound may be the principal limitation to processivity...|$|R
