500|$|King William dies after Victoria's 18th birthday, {{avoiding}} a regency. <b>After</b> <b>accession,</b> Victoria immediately begins to exert her independence, including moving {{into her own}} room and banishing Conroy from her household and coronation. During her first meeting with the Privy Council, she announces that [...] "I mean to devote my life in service of my country and my people". Victoria now moves into the recently completed Buckingham Palace and her aunt, Queen Adelaide, advises her against giving in too much to Lord Melbourne's direction. Albert then comes to England {{to spend more time}} with Victoria. They bond more, dancing together during her coronation and later discussing together the condition of the poor. Albert hints at taking their relationship further but the self-sufficient Victoria resists and he leaves.|$|E

Upon their accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths: the Accession Declaration as first required by the Bill of Rights, and an oath that they will [...] "maintain and preserve" [...] the Church of Scotland settlement as required by the Act of Union. The monarch is usually crowned in Westminster Abbey, normally by the Archbishop of Canterbury. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; indeed, the ceremony usually takes place many months <b>after</b> <b>accession</b> to allow sufficient time for its preparation and for a period of mourning.|$|E

Prior to Croatia becoming a member of the EU on 1 July 2013, Boris Vujčić, governor of the Croatian National Bank, stated that he would like the kuna to be replaced by the euro as soon as possible <b>after</b> <b>accession.</b> [...] In its first assessment under the convergence criteria in May 2014, the country satisfied the inflation and interest rate criteria, but did not satisfy the public finances and ERM membership criteria. The European Central Bank expects Croatia to be approved for ERM-II membership at the earliest in 2016, leading to a subsequent euro adoption at the earliest in 2019. [...] According to a eurobarometer poll in April 2015, 53 percent of Croatians are in favor of introducing the euro (a decrease of 2 percent from 2014), whereas 40 percent are opposed (an increase of 1 percent from 2014).|$|E
