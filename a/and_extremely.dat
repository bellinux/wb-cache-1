Because of the low bandwidth <b>and</b> <b>extremely</b> high latency available on the Internet, distributed computing typically deals only with embarrassingly parallel problems. Many distributed computing applications have been created, of which SETI@home and Folding@home are the best-known examples.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} progressed westward, Tampa and nearby {{locations}} started to experience its effects. Strong winds {{from the northeast}} blew {{water out of the}} Tampa Bay to the lowest level ever recorded. The barometer fell to 961mbar (hPa; 28.4inHg), <b>and</b> <b>extremely</b> high waves battered the shore from Flamingo to Cape Romano. The surf continued well inland, forcing survivors to cling atop trees. North of Tampa, the hurricane's effects were moderate or light, while in the southwestern part of the state, damage increased in severity. A portion of the local citrus crop was destroyed. Property damage was widespread from Tampa to Jacksonville and points south. High winds tore the roofs off homes and shook some structures off their foundations.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{finally began}} upon the battlecruisers in 1920 and 1921, after a delay of almost five months. However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing <b>and</b> <b>extremely</b> {{expensive}} naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: one looked at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
5|$|Described {{as being}} similar {{to members of}} the genera Pareledone, Eledone, and Enteroctopus, V. togata has a large body with large eyes and {{extensive}} membranes that link the octopus' arms together. The species has a single line of suckers on each arm, and its head, mantle, and part of its arms are covered in warts. Although the reproductive habits of V. togata have not been extensively studied, the species is believed {{to be one of the}} most fecund among octopuses in its region and depth level, despite the species possessing large eggs <b>and</b> <b>extremely</b> large spermatophores.|$|E
5|$|Encounters with tawny nurse sharks {{underwater}} {{indicate a}} more docile demeanor than the similar nurse shark; usually divers {{are able to}} approach the sharks closely and even touch and play with them without incident. However, this species has been infrequently provoked into biting, and merits respect due to its strength, small but sharp teeth, <b>and</b> <b>extremely</b> powerful jaws. Tawny nurse sharks are favored attractions for ecotourist divers off Thailand, the Solomon Islands, and elsewhere. This species also adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquaria in Europe, the United States, Okinawa, and Singapore, where they may become tame enough to be hand-fed.|$|E

Accordingly, the Japanese turned back for the NEI that day. The heavy cruisers were again escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the NEI on 15March. During this time, the Behar survivors were held in a small <b>and</b> <b>extremely</b> hot store room on board Tone, and were given little access to food and water, sanitary facilities and exercise.|$|E
