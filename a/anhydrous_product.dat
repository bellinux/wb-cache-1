Cooling rate {{plays a major}} role in the differentiation of run products. At the lower cooling rate, glasses of tephri-phonolitic and trachy-andesitic composition have been detected. At comparable cooling rate, the dry glasses show a larger compositional variability and degree of differentiation than the hydrous products. The amount of crystallizing solid phases is always larger in the dry products. It is strongly controlled by both cooling rate and water content and massive crystallization occurs only at lower cooling rates. At a constant cooling rate, massive crystallization is observed at lower temperatures. Clinopyroxene, plagioclase and oxide occur in the <b>anhydrous</b> <b>products,</b> whereas plagioclase crystallization is suppressed in the hydrous ones. The lack of plagioclase results from the faster crystallization kinetics for Feand Mg-bearing phases than for tectosilicates. Textural coarsening occurs at high cooling rate and, for a constant cooling rate, at higher temperatures. The textural and compositional variability observed at the margin of dikes may not mirror flow differentiation processes but could be due to cooling rate variations. Early homogeneous magma batches subjected to cooling rate-induced differentiation may also produce heterogeneous rocks similar to that originated by magma mingling. Cooling rate-related differentiation influences the physical properties (viscosity and density) of magmas. Dry or H 2 O-poor magmas resulting from low cooling rate differentiation are not allowed to rise within dikes. Viscosity variations induced by cooling rate may be responsible for flow localization within conduits. The effects of cooling rate should be incorporated in fluid-mechanical models of magma ascent...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: A {{theoretical}} and experimental study {{was performed in}} order to identify factors that influence the propensity of compounds containing anionic functional groups that are commonly found on pharmaceutical drug compounds to form hydrates. A Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) survey was initially undertaken to determine the propensity of different pharmaceutically acceptable anions to form hydrates. The results showed that hydrate formation will take place more regularly when the polarity of the functional group increases. Furthermore, if the charge distribution is very concentrated over the polar groups, hydrate formation will occur more readily. This observation was further investigated by performing a series of potential energy surface (PES) scans for the hydrogen bond (H-bond) in the structure of N-(aminoiminomethyl) -N-methylglycine monohydrate (creatine monohydrate) with various Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Wave Functional Theory (WFT) methods. WFT is often also referred to as ab initio, which refers to the construction of the wave function from first principles when this theory is applied. The scans revealed that several strong and directional H-bonds with different geometrical parameters between the carboxylate group and the water molecule are possible, which suggests that the H-bond {{plays an important role in}} driving the formation of pharmaceutical hydrates. A total of 44 hydrate structures were identified that have pharmaceutically acceptable functional groups. Optimisations in the gas phase and in an implicit solvent polarisable continuum solvent model with a variety of solvents showed that there is a significant dependence of the H-bond interaction energy on the anionic group as well as the steric density of surrounding substituents. It was found that the M 06 - 2 X method utilising the 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) basis set outperformed the other methods that were tested when compared to optimisations performed with the benchmark MP 2 /aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. Furthermore, the strength of the H-bond was measured in the 44 experimentally determined structures by using a total of five generalized gradient approximation (GGA) methods, of which two methods contained the DFT-D 3 correction. The results of these DFT methods were subsequently compared to results obtained at the benchmark MP 2 /aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. The M 06 - 2 X method was identified as the most economical method to calculate H-bond energies. It was also found that the H-bond interaction energy shows a substantial dependence on the electrostatic environment. This was observed by a significant decrease in H-bond strength as the relative permittivity of the solvent increases. The effect of steric density on the H-bond interaction energy was investigated by performing hydrogen bond propensity calculations. These values were then compared to the interaction energies of each structure and the results showed that the presence of large bulky substituents can lead to an increase in bond energy by forcing the anionic functional group closer to the water molecule. Contrastingly, the bulky group can also push the anionic group away from the water molecule and result in a decrease in bond energy. Approximate values for the amount of stabilisation offered to the H-bonding system by the surrounding crystalline environment were calculated by optimising the H-bond geometrical parameters of selected compounds with a combination of the M 06 - 2 X and MP 2 methods utilising the 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) basis set. The H-bond interaction energies were then calculated at the M 06 - 2 X/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory and compared to the H-bond interaction energies in geometries that have been fully optimised. After these energies were compared and the crystal packing of each structure was investigated, it was found that the packing of some structures within the crystalline environment limits the number of H-bonds that can be formed between the water and the compound of interest. Full optimisation calculations result in structures with cooperative stabilisation, such that more than one H-bond is found between the two fragments. The effect of substituents on H-bond interaction energy was investigated by the addition of six electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on four aromatic compounds with different anionic functional groups, namely carboxylate, nitrogen dioxide, sulfonate and phosphonate. It should also be mentioned that the nitrogen dioxide is not an anionic functional group, but it was included as it is a neutral radical that often forms hydrogen bonds. A total of 80 structures were optimised with a combination of the M 06 - 2 X and MP 2 methods utilising the 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) basis set. This was followed by counterpoise corrected single point calculations at the M 06 - 2 X/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) level of theory. The results showed that the H-bond interaction energy bears no relationship to the inductive strength or the inductive ability of the substituents, but rather the ability of these substituents to rotate the anionic functional group and allow cooperative stabilisation of the H-bond. Furthermore, AIM analysis was performed for the substituted H-bonded aromatic structure. The results showed that electron-donating groups that are placed at the para position yield stronger H-bonds, which is once again accompanied by cooperative stabilisation. Electron-withdrawing groups with sufficient inductive effects can result in a weaker H-bond when placed at the meta position. The effect of water activity (aw) on the hydrate crystal formation was investigated experimentally by performing a series of crystallisations in various solvent mixtures. These mixtures consisted of water mixed with acetone, ethanol and ethyl acetate. A total of three organic acids were used in crystal formation, namely pyridine- 4 -carboxylic acid (isonicotinic acid), N-amino-iminomethyl-N-methylglycine (creatine) and benzene- 1, 3, 5 -tricarboxylic acid. It was found that water activity affects the formation of the hydrate as well as the <b>anhydrous</b> <b>product.</b> Additionally, nucleation and super saturation plays a large role in crystal formation and can serve as an effective technique when the formation of crystals of an appropriate shape and size is required for further analysis. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: 'n Teoretiese en eksperimentele studie was uitgevoer om faktore te identifiseer wat die geneigdheid van verbindings met anioniese funksionele groepe wat algemeen gevind word op farmaseutiese dwelm verbindings om die hidraat produk te vorm, affekteer. 'n Opname van strukture in die Cambridge Strukturele Databasis (CSD) is onderneem om die geneigdheid van verskillende farmaseutiese aanvaarbare anione om hidrate te vorm te bepaal. Die resultate het getoon dat hidraatvorming meer gereeld plaasvind indien die polariteit van die funksionele groepe toeneem. Verder is daar ook opgemerk dat 'n gekonsentreerde ladingsverspreiding op die polêre groepe ook tot 'n toename in hidraat vorming sal lei. Hierdie waarneming is verder ondersoek deur 'n reeks potensiële energie oppervlak (PES) skanderings van die waterstof binding (H-binding) vir die struktuur van N-amino-iminometiel-N-metielglisien monohidraat (kreatien monohidraat) met verskeie Digtheids-Funksionele Teorie (DFT) en Golffunksie Teorie (WFT) metodes uit te voer. Die skanderings het getoon dat verskeie sterk, gerigte H-bindings met verskillende geometriese parameters tussen die karboksilaatgroep en die watermolekule kan vorm. Hierdie bevindinge lê klem op die belangrike rol wat H-bindings in die vorming van farmaseutiese koolhidrate speel. 'n Totaal van 44 hidraat strukture met farmaseutiese aanvaarbare funksionele groepe was geïdentifiseer. Optimaliserings is in die gas fase asook in 'n implisiete kontinuum polariseerbare oplosmiddel model met 'n verskeidenheid oplosmiddels uitgevoer. Die resultate het 'n beduidende afhanklikheid van die H-binding interaksie-energie op die anioniese groep asook die steriese afkskerming van omringende groepe getoon. Daar is bepaal dat die M 06 - 2 X metode wat saam met die 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) basisstel die mees akkuraatste resultate gelewer het in vergelyking met die ander DFT metodes asook die MP 2 /aug-cc-pVTZ maatstaf. Die H-binding se sterkte is vir hierdie strukture bereken deur vyf GGA metodes te gebruik, waarvan twee metodes van die DFT-D 3 korreksie gebruik maak. Die resultate van die berekeninge met hierdie DFT metodes is daarna vergelyk met resultate verkry met die MP 2 /aug-cc-pVTZ maatstaf. Daar is gevolglik bepaal dat die M 06 - 2 X metode die mees ekonomiese metode is om H-binding energië te bereken. Die H-binding interaksie energie toon 'n aansienlike afhanklikheid op die diëlektriese konstante van die oplosmiddel aan. Hierdie waarneming is op grond van 'n beduidende afname in die H-binding interaksie-energie indien die relatiewe permittiwiteit van die oplosmiddel verhoog word gemaak. Die effek van steriese digtheid is ondersoek deur waterstofbindinggeneigdheid waardes te bereken. Hierdie waardes is met die interaksie-energië van elke struktuur vergelyk. Die resultate dui daarop dat steries digte groepe tot 'n toename in interaksie energie kan lei wanneer die anioniese funksionele groep nader aan die water molekule gestoot word. Verder is dit ook moontlik vir hierdie steries digte groepe om die anioniese groep weg van die water molekule te stoot en gevolglik 'n afname in interaksie energie te veroorsaak. Benaderde waardes vir die hoeveelheid stabilisering wat die omringende kristallyne omgewing aan die H-binding bied is bereken deur die H-binding geometriese parameters van geselekteerde verbindings met die M 06 - 2 X en MP 2 metodes en die 6 - 311 ++G (d,p) basisstel te optimaliseer. Die H-binding interaksie-energië is gevolglik by die M 06 - 2 X/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) vlak van teorie bereken en met die H-binding energië in strukture wat volledige optimaliseer is vergelyk. Nadat hierdie waardes vergelyk is, is daar gevind dat die pakking van strukture in the kristallyne omgewing verhoed dat sekere H-bindings tussen die water molekule en die verbinding van belang kan vorm. Strukture wat volledig optimaliseer is, lei tot strukture wat in staat is om koöperatiewe stabilisering te ondergaan. Koöperatiewe stabilisering word gekenmerk deur die vorming van meer as een H-binding tussen twee fragmente. Die effek van substituente op die H-binding interaksie energie is ondersoek deur die bevoeging van ses elektrondonor- en elektronontrekkendegroepe op vier aromatiese verbindings, naamlike die karboksilaatgroep, stikstofdioksied, sulfonaat en fosfonaat. Dit moet ook genoem word dat stikstofdioksied nie 'n anioniese funksionele groep is nie, maar dit was wel ingesluit omdat dit ‘n neutrale radikaal groep is wat dikwels waterstofbindings vorm. 'n Totaal van 80 strukture optimiserings was uitgevoer met 'n kombinasie van die M 06 - 2 X en MP 2 metodes wat gebruik maak van die 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) basisstel. Dit is gevolg deur interaksie-energie berekeninge op die M 06 - 2 X/ 6 - 311 ++G(d,p) vlak van teorie. Die resultate het getoon dat daar geen verband tussen die induktiewe vermoë van die substituente en die sterkte van die H-binding is nie, dit is eerder die vermoë van hierdie substituente om die anioniese funksionele groep te laat roteer wat toelaat dat koöperatiewe stabilisering van die H-binding kan geskied. Die AIM analise is op 'n gesubstitueerde H-binding struktuur toegepas. Die resultate het getoon dat elektrondonorgroepe wat by die para posisie geplaas word tot sterker H-bindings sal lei, wat weereens met koöperatiewe stabilisering vergesel word. Elektrononttrekkendegroepe met sterk induktiewe effekte kan tot 'n swakker H-binding lei indien hulle by die meta posisie geplaas word. Die effek van water aktiwiteit (w) op hidraatkristalvorming is deur die uitvoering van 'n reeks kristallisasies in verskeie oplosmiddelmengsels ondersoek. Hierdie oplosmiddel mengsels bestaan uit water met asetoon, etanol of etielasetaat gemeng. Kristallisasies is vir drie organiese sure, naamlik piridien- 4 -karboksielsuur, N-amino-iminometiel-N-metielglisien monohidraat en 1, 3, 5 -benseen tri-karboksielsuur uitgevoer. Daar is gevind dat water aktiwiteit 'n invloed op die vorming van die hidraat en watervrye produkte kan hê. Daarbenewens, speel water aktiwiteit 'n belangrike rol in die nukleasie fase van kristalvorming en kan as 'n effektiewe tegniek dien om kristalle van 'n toepaslike vorm en grootte vir verdere analise te verkry...|$|E

The <b>product</b> solutions can be used directly for the nitrolysis of organic ompounds. The oxidation is carried out at approximately + 1. 85 V vs. SCE (aq) at platinum or titanium-supported iri ium oxide anodes. Up to 40 g quantities of N 205 have been prepared with good energy efficiency in a laboratory-scale, divided cell with a porous Vycor or Nation separator. Complete oxidation of the N 204 oc-curs in a region of low solvent background current; however, the overall current efficiency is reduced to- 65 %, apparently because of transport losses of N 204 and N 205 to the catholyte. Several of the species resulting from the dissociation of N 204 and N 20 ~ in the solutions have been identified by Raman spectroscopy.

40|$|International audienceThe {{composition}} of triacylglycerols (TAGs) {{is a very}} useful parameter to understand several properties of creams and <b>anhydrous</b> milk fat <b>products</b> such as nutritional value, technological applications, and textural properties. In this paper, the molecular species of TAGs of equine milk were identified {{using a combination of}} non-aqueous reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and high temperature gas chromatography and were then compared to the TAGs {{composition of}} human milk. The data showed that equine milk contained a complex mixture of different TAGs molecular species resulting from the widest range of its fatty acids as compared to human milk. In particular, the largest differences in TAGs composition between equine and human milk concerned TAGs containing medium-chain fatty acids; for C(8), C(10), and C(12). In terms of carbon number (CN), TAGs with CN 36 -CN 46 were the most abundant in equine milk with a maximum concentration at CN 44 (15. 3 %), while TAGs with CN 44 -CN 52 were the predominant in human milk with a maximum of CN 52 (30 %). For both milks studied, the experimentally determined distributions of TAGs molecular species deviated from those predicted by the random hypothesis. TAGs with CN 44 corresponding to a fatty acids carbon number distribution of C(8) /C(18) /C(18), C(12) /C(14) /C(18), and C(10) /C(16) /C(18) were apparently preferentially synthesized in equine milk.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of aliphatic bifunctional thioureas have been attempted using several nucleophilic displacement reactions. The first method involved treatment of an aliphatic diamine with ammonium thiocyanate, under two {{different sets of}} reaction conditions. The first set of reaction conditions utilized water as the solvent, while second employed acetone as the solvent. Both of the reactions utilizing l, 2 -ethylenediamine and ammonium thiocyanate did not afford the desired bis(thioureas). In particular, the crystalline solid obtained from the reaction carried out in water was 57. 8 ± 0. 05 % thiocyanate by mass. The second nucleophilic addition method involved the treatment of both 1, 2 -ethylenediamine and 1, 6 -hexanediamine diamine with silicon tetraisothiocyanate in <b>anhydrous</b> benzene. The <b>product</b> from the reaction of l, 6 -hexanediamine with silicon tetraisothiocyanate in anhydrous benzene {{was found to be}} 40. 3 ± 2. 07 % thiocyanate by mass. The third set of reaction conditions involved treatment of 1, 6 hexanediamine with silver thiocyanate in concentrated ammonium hydroxide. As a result of the presence characteristic thiocyanate IR absorbance peak at 2100 cm- 1 in the product, it was found to contain thiocyanate ions. It was concluded that the product was composed of mainly the 1, 6 hexanediamine thiocyanate salts. The final set of reaction conditions involved treatment of 1, 6 hexanediamine with silver thiocyanate and thiourea, in concentrated ammonium hydroxide. Upon analysis of the resulting reaction mixtures, it was determined that each fraction contained no thiocyanate anion or starting thiourea.

40|$|Singlet oxygen is very electrophilic and {{undergoes}} several organic reactions. Singlet oxygen undergoes reactions with biomolecules, including sulfur containing methionine and cysteine. There {{has been}} considerable {{interest in the}} scope and mechanism of the oxidation of metal bound sulfur. We are presenting a mechanistic study of the photooxidation of a Pt(II) monothiolato complex without any alpha hydrogens adjacent to the thiolato moiety. During the photooxidation of Pt (bipyridine) (benzene dithiolate), Pt(bpy) (bdt) by Gray and Connick, no sulfenate product was formed. In contrast, the Selke laboratory characterized the oxidation products and explored the mechanism of the reaction of a Pt monothiolate system, Pt(II)) (bipyridine) (aminoethanethiol) Cl, [Pt(II) (bpy) (aet) Cl]. This reaction led to sequential formation of sulfenate followed by a slower reaction to form sulfinite. A persulfoxide was the primary intermediate in this reaction. The persulfoxide may behave differently in aprotic and protic solvents. In addition, {{it was suggested that}} a secondary intermediate may also be involved in the formation of sulfenate. It is well established that in the photooxidation of organic sulfides, the persulfoxide is the primary intermediate, followed by the formation of the hydroperoxy sulfonium ylide as the secondary intermediate. The formation of such a hydroperoxy sulfonium ylide during the intermolecular oxidation of a Pt complex was investigated in this work. We synthesized the complex Pt(II) (bipyridine) (dimethyl aminoethanethiol), Pt(II) (bpy) (dmaet) because this complex does not have any alpha hydrogen, thereby making the formation of a hydroperoxy sulfonium ylide impossible. The complex Pt(II) (bipyridine) (dimethyl aminoethanethiol), Pt(II) (bpy) (dmaet) was synthesized from Pt(II) (bipyridine) (dichloride) and 1 -amino- 2 - methyl 2 -propanethiol and characterized by 1 H NMR, UV Vis and mass spectroscopy. Photooxidation of the complex was carried out in ultra pure water and in <b>anhydrous</b> acetonitrile. <b>Product</b> studies involving mass spectroscopy showed the formation of sulfenate and sulfinite in water but only the formation of sulfinite in anhydrous acetonitrile. The formation of a sulfenate in water {{in the absence of an}} alpha Hydrogen in the complex leads to the conclusion that a proton is abstracted from water to form a hydroperoxy thiolate which then transfers an oxygen atom. It also implies that formation of an ylide is not required for sulfenate formation. In contrast, photooxidation in anhydrous acetonitrile leads to the formation of only sulfinite, indicating that without a proton from the solvent or the complex, intramolecular oxygen atom transfer and sulfenate formation is not possible for these Pt- thiolato complexes...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{carbonation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} appealing CO 2 emission mitigation techniques capable of storing CO 2, in the thermodynamically stable states. However, the technical mineralization process faces serious challenges, in regard to the reaction kinetics and issues with high energy intensity. Pre-activation techniques such as mechanical activation are proposed as effective strategies to enhance the kinetics of mineral carbonation processes. They however, significantly increase the total energy consumption of the processes and hence, optimizing the energy needed for pre-activation process is essential. Mechanical activation technique was performed, using a Uni-Ball-Mill 5. The variation of determinant structural parameters such as particle size, specific surface area, pore volume, crystallite size and crystallinity was recorded as a function of injected milling energy input, using SEM, BET and XRD analysis techniques. Considering the outcomes of this research stage, the optimal level of pre-activation milling energy for the most suggested microstructure for CO 2 storage was found to be about 55 kJ/g. Energy optimization and kinetics enhancement was then considered and expanded to the field of reactive compound extraction. Milling energy inputs of 0, 13. 8, 27. 6, 41. 4 and 55. 2 kJ/g were injected for the purpose of the reactants’ pre-activation. Solid state extraction was performed under the isothermal conditions of 400, 425 and 450 ̊C in a combined DSC/TGA thermal analyzer device (NETZSCH STA 449 F 3 A- 0918 -M Jupiter). The trend of activation energy variation vs. milling energy input was calculated and monitored to find the optimal amount of milling energy input needed to produce the structural properties with the lowest amount of activation energy for the solid state extraction process. The calculated amount of optimal milling energy input, to address the objective of this phase of study was found to be about 27. 6 kJ/g. This resulted in an almost 34 % reduction in the activation energy of MgSO 4 solid state extraction. Complimentary to the goal of enhancing the kinetics and performance of the mineral carbonation process, the enhancement of directed anhydrous carbonation was examined as a next stage of research. Two different strategies were followed to address this objective, including the optimization and control of carbonation parameters (temperature and pressure), and the implementation of heterogeneous precipitation, in order to promote the possibility of formation of <b>anhydrous</b> carbonation <b>products</b> during the aqueous carbonation of Mg(OH) 2 powders. Carbonation reactions were performed in a 4650 Parr high-temperature high-pressure reaction vessel. Carbonation temperatures of 100, 150 and 200 ̊C and CO 2 pressure of 10, 20, 25 and 30 bars, were used. This stage of study confirmed the noticeable influence of carbonation temperature on the formation of anhydrous carbonates, and on the enhancement of directed carbonation. As a continuation, the effects of the implementation of preferred precipitation sites on the efficiency of directed carbonation process was figured out, by injecting two different seeding materials, in the aqueous medium. Hydrophobic activated carbon and hydrophilic alumina seeds were used to bring two different wettability properties. The combined controlling of carbonation parameters and implimentation of more efficient seeding material resulted in an improved carbonation conversion of up to 72 %, with an anhydrous carbonate concentration of around 60 %...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{increasing}} {{anthropogenic emissions}} {{of greenhouse gas}} carbon dioxide (CO₂) are considered as the main driving force behind climate change on Earth. Despite the incentives surrounding carbon-free energy, it will take decades until significant market penetration is achieved. In the meantime, while carboneous fossilized energy sources continue to dominate the energy blend and worldwide energy demand is continuously increasing, {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) can offer an immediate solution to fight climate change. Several high temperature CO₂ capture technologies are under development (e. g. chemical looping of calcium sorbents is predicted to provide zero emission energy from coal). Calcium sorbents must be recycled given its natural state in the Earth's crust as calcium carbonate. Looping raises concerns about the energy intensive sorbent regeneration and ultimate fate of the separated CO₂ as well as the degradation of the sorbent material. Unlike their Ca-based counterparts, Mg-bearing sorbents, derived from silicate minerals and industrial wastes, can act as combined carbon capture and storage media in various energy conversion systems. The magnesium carbonate formed during the carbon mineralization process is recognized as the most safe and permanent method to store anthropogenic CO₂. Despite the benefits of Mg carbon mineralization, the reactions experience limitations in terms of kinetics and overall conversion, depending on the reaction system, and the mechanisms are not well understood, especially at high temperature and pressure conditions. Mg(OH) ₂ carbonation in the slurry phase is known to occur spontaneously and recent results show improved gas-solid carbonation with comparable materials in the presence of H₂O vapor. The pathways of H₂O enhanced gas-solid Mg(OH) ₂ carbonation were investigated at elevated temperatures and CO₂ pressures (up to 400 °C and 15 atm). Attributed to the fast formation of hydrated carbonate intermediates, carbonation conversion showed dramatic increase with increasing H₂O loading. Still, carbonation of Mg(OH) ₂ in a gas-solid system has largely demonstrated limited reaction kinetics and overall conversion. The gas-solid limitations and the enhanced effect of steam motivated an in-depth study of slurry phase Mg(OH) ₂ carbonation. The literature lacked an investigation of Mg(OH) ₂ slurry carbonation at elevated temperature, thus this study examined carbonation at moderate temperature and CO₂ pressure (up to 200 ºC and 15 atm). The reaction conditions responsible for hydrated and <b>anhydrous</b> carbonate <b>product</b> phases were evaluated and carbonate formation kinetics were investigated. Reaction temperature was found to be the dominant parameter driving the formation of specific carbonate phases. Anhydrous carbonate is most desirable from a carbon storage perspective, due to its magnesium efficiency, omission of additional crystal waters and thermodynamic stability; therefore solution additives were investigated for their role in bypassing formation of metastable intermediates. The use of MgCO₃ seed particles gave the best result, producing 100 % anhydrous carbonate at 150 ºC where it was not observed previously. After the detailed study of Mg(OH) ₂ carbonation in both gas-solid and slurry arrangements, its integration with an energy conversion process, the water gas shift reaction (WGSR), was explored to increase the sustainability of carboneous energy sources. The removal of CO₂ by the carbonation reaction enhanced hydrogen yield of the WGSR as the equilibrium of the gas phase reaction was shifted towards products. Unexpectedly, a side reaction was exposed, which converted CO to aqueous formate ion and limited the overall production of hydrogen. Overall, this study explored the fundamental chemistry relating to carbonate phase formation mechanisms and kinetics during the carbonation reaction of Mg(OH) ₂ in various reactor systems...|$|R
