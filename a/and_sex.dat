Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist <b>and</b> <b>sex</b> therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician <b>and</b> <b>sex</b> columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age <b>and</b> <b>sex,</b> with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{the role of}} <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> gender in {{healthcare}} has been increasingly acknowledged by physicians. In fact, a new gender-specific branch of medicine has rapidly developed. It {{is important to recognize}} and investigate when <b>and</b> how <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> gender can affect a patient’s health <b>and</b> whether <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> gender play a role in disease prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Moreover, it is also necessary to determine when <b>and</b> how <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> gender affect the way in which a patient is seen and treated by doctors. In this paper, we analyze only two central issues of that debate. First, we argue that gender-specific medicine tends to misrepresent and confuse the concepts of <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> gender. Second, we illustrate how this new sub-discipline implicitly but extensively presupposes the sharp distinction between exactly two <b>sexes</b> <b>and</b> exactly two genders. In particular, we shall demonstrate why these issues may constitute a problem for gender-specific medicine and propose some methods of dealing with them to enhance medicine in general...|$|R
5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications <b>and</b> <b>sex.</b> The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E

5|$|Body Language is {{the ninth}} studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, {{released}} on 10 November 2003 by Parlophone. Following the massive commercial success of her eighth studio album Fever (2001), Minogue enlisted {{a diverse group}} of writers and producers to aid in creating a new album, including Cathy Dennis, Dan Carey, Emiliana Torrini, Johnny Douglas and Mantronix among others. Influenced by the musical works of the 1980s and artists like Prince and Scritti Politti, Body Language musically differs from Minogue's previous albums, which mainly featured disco-oriented dance-pop tracks, and instead explores genres like synthpop, electroclash, R, and hip hop. Many tracks in Body Language contain references to songs from the 1980s and lyrically, the album touches upon themes of enjoyment, flirting, <b>and</b> <b>sex.</b>|$|E

5|$|Feathers are {{a feature}} {{characteristic}} of birds (though {{also present in}} some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds).

The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and systematics.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} definitions of <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> virginity loss {{and the influence}} of gender, religiosity, middle school <b>sex</b> education, <b>and</b> the importance of virginity on those definitions. The study also tests the applicability of social exchange theory to explain how undergraduates define <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> virginity loss. Vaginal intercourse was most often considered to be <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> virginity loss, followed by anal <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> oral <b>sex.</b> The results indicate that women tend to consider more behaviors to be <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> virginity loss than men. Religion <b>and</b> middle school <b>sex</b> education were minimally important. Both viewing virginity as a gift and the importance of maintaining virginity until marriage were related to definitions of <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> virginity loss. Results indicate that the application of social exchange theory in predicting classification of behaviors as <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> virginity loss were mixed. With oral sex receiving the most variation {{as to whether or not}} it is <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> virginity loss and being an activity in which young people frequently participate, sex education programs should provide greater attention to oral <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> the associated health risks.
