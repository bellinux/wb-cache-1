5|$|On 15 January 2013 former fcbusiness {{magazine}} editor Ryan McKnight was named {{as the new}} Chief Executive Officer at the club, becoming the youngest CEO in UK football. Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County in the relegation zone, Gannon was fired as Stockport County boss following the 3–1 home defeat by Mansfield Town on 16 January 2013. He was replaced by Darije Kalezić, who initially saw an upturn in results, but left the position himself two months later following a poor run that left the club in serious danger of relegation to the Conference North. Ian Bogie in turn succeeded Kalezić, {{but was unable to}} turn the club's form <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were relegated to the Conference North on the final day after a defeat to title challengers Kidderminster Harriers.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the Santa Cecilia was boarded. Initially, {{the first}} party to board was pushed back, and Hamilton was {{alone on the}} quarter deck {{fighting}} four Spaniards. A musket butt soon knocked him down. At this moment the other division had swung <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> too boarded the ship. This included the Marines, who, with a single volley, rushed the main deck saving Hamilton. They then charged with the bayonets, driving the Spaniards from the top decks. The Spaniards were then caught in a crossfire, which drove them below deck. The fight continued {{in the heart of}} the ship.|$|E

And then I saw these little girls {{skipping}} and running <b>around.</b> <b>And</b> <b>they</b> looked about thirteen. This can't be them. No way!". Nevertheless, the Spice Girls managed to impress them. They played a few of their tracks, but neither Watkins nor Wilson particularly like them, except for a song the group wrote with Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe, called [...] "Feed Your Love", which the duo thought was [...] "dark and cool". A songwriting session was booked within the next days.|$|E
500|$|At the Paley Festival Glee {{panel in}} March 2010, Murphy stated that Brittany and Santana {{would be seen}} to make out during the show's first season. Morris and Rivera only became aware of this after reading a Paley Festival report online. When they asked Murphy about the development, {{he claimed to have}} made the {{statement}} [...] "to get a kick" [...] out of the [...] "dirty guy" [...] asking about them. Murphy told Morris and Rivera that Glee would not push relationships to appease the show's fans, but would only pursue those which were [...] "organic and natural." [...] While there are moments on the show which depict Brittany and Santana as being very close to one another, Morris attributes these to her close relationship with Rivera: [...] "that is just Naya and I joking around with each other and being really close. It's always her and I just messing <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> end up using it." ...|$|E

But after that, I think we're looking to do some shows {{starting}} in March. Maybe local around here, maybe even some Mardi Gras gigs. But yeah, last week we sat <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> played me some new stuff they're working on, and it sounds good. Sounds like it's got a lot of promise, and really they just need me in the fuckin' practice room. So all {{this is going to happen}} this year. It has to happen. I know there's a responsibility here. Down has a fanbase and they are very very very loyal. So I don't want to let those people down. They deserve some new music, we have it. We've demoed other songs, there's songs that haven't even been released that people have never heard, so there's always Down there. For all you people out there, don't you stress. We got the Down coming." ...|$|E

500|$|Joss was {{concerned}} about supporting his family after his baseball career ended; many players of the day had little education and few marketable job skills beyond their abilities on the diamond. As sportswriter Franklin Lewis wrote, [...] "Only a handful of players in the rough, stirring, {{early days of the}} major leagues arrived from campuses. And when they did, sometimes the shock was too great for them. Some grizzled holdovers from the 1890s were <b>around</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> bore down heavily on the eardrums of the so-called college-boy set." [...] Joss was hired as a sports columnist after the 1906 season for the Toledo News-Bee. He also served as their Sunday sports editor. His writings proved so popular that sales of the paper increased and a special phone line was installed in his office to field the large volume of calls he received from fans. The increased popularity gave him an advantage when negotiating with the Naps before the 1907 season, and the club agreed to pay him $4,000 ($). (By 1910, player salaries averaged only $2,500.) ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1984 review, Billboard {{states the}} album is [...] "funnier and more {{versatile}} than most of their metal brethren", calling the production [...] "typically strong". A retrospective review by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was extremely positive. He noted that the album caused [...] "a hoopla that {{was a bit of}} a red herring since the band had been layering in synths since their third album, Women and Children First". He further stated that [...] "Jump"'s [...] "synths played a circular riff that wouldn't have sounded as overpowering on guitar", but that [...] "the band didn't dispense with their signature monolithic, pulsating rock." [...] He also stated that [...] "where [...] albums placed an emphasis on the band's attack, this places an emphasis on the songs, and they're uniformly terrific, the best set of original tunes Van Halen ever had." [...] He concluded that [...] "it's the best showcase of Van Halen's instrumental prowess as a band, the best showcase for Diamond Dave's glorious shtick, the best showcase for their songwriting, just their flat-out best album overall. [...] here's no way Van Halen could have bettered this album with Dave <b>around</b> (<b>and</b> <b>they</b> didn't better it once Sammy [...] joined, either)." ...|$|E

Alfonso Cuarón, the director of the third film, stated he [...] "would love to have the opportunity" [...] to return. Goblet of Fire director Mike Newell declined a spot to direct the fifth film, and was not approached for this one. Guillermo del Toro turned down the chance to direct the film in order to direct [...] Terry Gilliam was Rowling's personal choice to direct Philosopher's Stone. When asked whether he would consider directing a later film, Gilliam said, [...] "Warner Bros. had their chance the first time <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> blew it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk <b>around,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel {{distinguished}} between basic services {{that should be}} guaranteed to everybody from discretionary medical services that are not guaranteed. The result would be a two tiered system, where those with more money could afford more discretionary services. He saw a failure to define basic services as the reason attempts at universal health care coverage have failed. As a result, the belief that universal health care would require unlimited costs makes any attempt at providing universal health care seem likely to end in national bankruptcy. Instead of universal coverage of basic health care, those who are well insured have coverage for many discretionary forms {{of health care and}} no coverage for [...] some basic forms of health care. Emanuel said that while drawing a line separating basic and universal health care from discretionary health care is difficult, the attempt should be made. Emaniel mentioned the philosophies of Amy Gutmann, Norman Daniels and Daniel Callahan when arguing that there is an overlap between liberalism and communitarianism where civic republicanism and deliberative democracy meet. According to The Atlantic, Emanuel is describing the philosophy of John Rawls in arguing that society is choosing one value (equality) over another (a healthy society), and this substitution may be responsible for limited choices in health care. PolitiFact says that Emanuel was describing the fact that doctors often have to make difficult choices, such as who should get a liver transplant. [...] PolitiFact also said, [...] "Academics often write theoretically about ideas that are being kicked <b>around.</b> <b>And</b> <b>they</b> repeat and explore those ideas, without necessarily endorsing them." ...|$|E
