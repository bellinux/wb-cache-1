Experiments {{were carried}} out on the heat resistance, corrosion-resistance and {{adhesion}} performance of the nano-modified urushiol titanium <b>antiseptic</b> <b>paint</b> on the top heat exchanger of Atmospheric Tower. Through the experiment, {{it can be found}} that the corrosion resistance in the environment of HCl-H 2 S-H 2 O can be effectively improved by adding a certain amount of nano-SiO 2 into urushiol coating made of titanium the top heat exchanger of Atmospheric Tower for modification...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Many {{techniques}} {{are there for}} skin preparation before surgery, the commonest being initial scrub with antiseptic soap solution, followed by painting the prepared area with <b>antiseptic</b> <b>paint</b> solution. But degerming of the skin {{can be done with}} antiseptics us ed for less than one minute which is as effective as five minute scrub with germicidal soap solution followed by painting with antiseptics. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES : 1. To evaluate the efficacy of povidone iodine alone and antiseptic agent containing alcoholic chlorhexidine with povidone iodine in preoperative skin preparation by taking swab culture. 2. To compare the rate of postoperative wound infection in both the groups. METHODS: STUDY DESIGN: Comparative study conducted on 100 patients in two groups. STUDY SETTING: Sri Venkateswara Medical College Tirupathi SOURCE OF DATA: 100 Patients (50 in each Group) undergoing elective and emergency surgery admitted in the Department of General Surgery in S. V. R. R. Government General Hospital, Tirupati from 2013 to 2014. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Patients undergoing elective & emergency surgery in department of general surgery. 2. Patients with no focus of infection anywhere on the body. 3. Patients irrespective of their age and sex. 4. Patients neither immunocompromised nor on any long term steroids. 5. Patients undergoing mes h repair of hernia are also included. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Immuno compromised patients and patients on long term steroids. 2. Patients with septicemia. 3. Patients suffering from malignancies or undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy. 4. Contaminat ed surgeries in which viscus was opened were excluded from the study. 5. Patients with co - morbid medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension etc. METHOD OF COLLECTION OF DATA: In each case preoperatively, detailed history was taken and routine investiga tions like haemoglobin, total count, differential count, ESR, RBS and chest X - ray, ultrasound were done to rule out any co - morbid conditions, chronic infections or malignancy. Preoperative shaving of the parts was done at the same time on previous evening for all the patients and same antibiotic protocol was followed. The pre - operative skin preparation in each group is done with the respective antiseptic regimen. Group I: Three coats of aqueous povidone iodine IP 5...|$|E

40|$|It is a {{cold winter}} evening and the visitors’ lounge at the Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre feels like the waiting room of a forlorn hospital, {{a place where you}} sit anticipating news that can only be bad.

40|$|A {{prospective}} randomised {{trial was}} carried out to compare the efficacy of method of scrubbing the operative site for ten minutes with an antiseptic (GpA; n = 68) with a simplified method where the <b>antiseptic</b> was merely <b>painted</b> onto the operation site (GpB; n = 67). The median age, sex distribution {{and the types of}} procedures done in each group were similar as was the antibiotic policy. There were a total of 11 patients who got infected, 6 in the group A and 5 in the group B. No significant difference could be demonstrated in the infection rates between the two groups. It is concluded that the old method of prolonged scrubbing the operation site can safely be omitted to a more simplified version...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Antiseptic</b> scrub and <b>paint</b> {{can reduce}} {{bacterial}} colonization and postoperative wound infection. Two forms of antiseptics, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine, {{are commonly used}} in the operating theater. Objective: To study {{the efficacy of the}} reduction of bacterial colonization and surgical wound infection among these antiseptic. Material and Method: Five hundred surgical patients were randomly divided into two groups. Povidone Iodine and Chlorhexidine were used for skin preparation in group 1 and 2 respectively. Bacterial colonization and postoperative wound infection were examined after skin preparation. Demographic data was analyzed by student’s t test; the culture result and surgical wound infection were analyzed by Mantel-Haenszel method for relative risk and 95 % CI. Results: There was a significant reduction of bacterial colonization and wound infection after skin preparation in group 2 compared with group 1. Conclusion: Colonization of bacterial and postoperative surgical wound infection were significantly reduced in the chlorhexidine group. Chlorhexidine antiseptic should be the first consideration for preoperative skin preparation...|$|R
