50|$|The RMG <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> ('RMG' {{stands for}} “Reaktivnaya Mnogotselevaya Granata” or rocket-propelled {{multi-purpose}} grenade) {{was developed by}} Bazalt in the early 2000s.

The design project was supervised by leading designer S. Kh. Irtuganov. Officially adopted by the Russian Government in December 2011.|$|R
50|$|The RPG-29 {{is unusual}} among Russian <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers</b> {{in that it}} lacks an initial {{propellant}} charge to place the projectile {{at a safe distance}} from the operator before the rocket ignites. Instead, the rocket engine starts as soon as the trigger is pulled, and burns out before the projectile leaves the barrel.|$|R

50|$|The PTRD {{suffered}} from numerous flaws; {{the most notable}} are the lack of penetration versus enemy vehicles and inability to aim accurately with a telescopic sight, which frustrated PTRD teams, its size and weight which hampered its mobility and deployment, and its immense muzzle blast which gave away the unit's firing position. The PTRD was eventually replaced by the RPG series of <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers.</b>|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the effect}} of very compact hollow charge warheads was being noted {{and a number of}} {{countries}} began producing man-portable anti-tank weapons utilizing this ammunition. The development of man-portable, shoulder-fired <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers</b> began in 1941; most could be reloaded, but a few such as the German Panzerfaust were fired from disposable tubes. Unlike anti-tank guns, their light weight made them easily portable by individual infantrymen on the battlefield, and they offered similar degrees of firepower whilst being quicker and cheaper to produce.|$|R

50|$|The Satukandav Pass, 30 km east of Gardez, was {{the main}} passage between Kabul and Khost.

To defend the approaches of the Satukandav, the Mujahideen deployed ten BM-12 multiple <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers,</b> and placed ZGU-1 anti-aircraft guns on every height. They had a plentiful supply of DShK machine guns, 75 and 82 mm recoilless rifles, and RPG-7 <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers.</b> They also mined {{the opening of the}} pass to a depth of three kilometers, boasting that their position was impregnable.|$|R

5000|$|Panzerschreck (lit.

Another popular nickname was Ofenrohr ("stove pipe").|$|E
50|$|The {{attitude}} of the locals changed suddenly, and the base was attacked soon after with small arms. Taliban attacks increased to five or six a day, including fire from RPG-7 <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers.</b> With all roads cut, the district centre was effectively under siege, and wholly dependent on helicopter flights from Camp Bastion for resupply. This was sometimes interrupted {{for as long as}} five days, as Taliban fire would have put the helicopters at risk. A unit of Royal Engineers surrounded the whole compound and the helicopter landing pad with a double rampart of Hesco barriers, despite Taliban fire.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the nominal}} ceasefire, {{hostilities}} were resumed on December 8 when the LNM militias launched a major two-pronged offensive {{to capture the}} Christian-held Mediterranean seafront and central Beirut. [...] Units of the Lebanese Army moved into the Parliament House and central post office areas, thus blunting the Muslim-leftist drive toward the city centre. [...] However, fighting continued on the Hotel district, as the Al-Mourabitoun, with assorted LNM allies and in conjunction with As-Saiqa, attacked the buildings occupied by the Christian militias. In this round of assaults Soviet-made RPG-7 <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers</b> and vehicle-mounted 106mm recoilless rifles were employed in the direct fire support role {{for the first time}} in Lebanon.|$|R

50|$|On Wednesday 20 September 2000, the Real Irish Republican Army (RIRA) {{carried out}} {{an attack on}} MI6 in Vauxhall, Lambeth, London. A Russian-built RPG-22 <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher,</b> fired from 300 metres away from MI6 headquarters, struck the {{building}} {{on the south side}} of the eighth floor, causing superficial damage.

50|$|The RPG-28 was {{unveiled}} in 2007 at IDEX Abu Dhabi by the State Research and Production Enterprise, Bazalt {{as a modern}} <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launcher</b> designed to defeat modern and future tanks with advanced reactive and composite armour as well as fortified infantry. It was offered for export in 2008. Officially adopted by the Russian Government in December 2011.|$|E
50|$|Shoot-and-scoot (alternatively, fire-and-displace or fire-and-move) is an {{artillery}} tactic of firing at a target and then immediately {{moving away from}} the location from where the shots were fired to avoid counter-battery fire (e.g. from enemy artillery). The need for such tactics in World War II became obvious from the noticeable smoke signature produced by the use of anti-tank infantry weapons such as the German Panzerfaust anti-tank grenade launcher, the American M1 bazooka and its German Panzerschreck derivative <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers,</b> and also by the various models of Nebelwerfer and Wurfrahmen 40 German barrage rocket systems. In modern times, moving after firing is important as there are a multitude of electronic systems, such as counter-battery radar that can automatically detect artillery fire in near real-time and direct counter-battery fire from friendly artillery.|$|R
5000|$|MoC/Tanzim militiamen were {{provided}} {{with a variety of}} small-arms, including MAT-49 submachine guns, M1 Garand (or its Italian-produced copy, the Beretta Model 1952) and SKS semi-automatic rifles, Heckler & Koch G3, FN FAL (variants included the Israeli-produced 'lightened' ROMAT M1953), M16A1, Vz. 58, AK-47 and AKM assault rifles. Several models of handguns were used, including Tokarev TT-33, CZ 75, FN P35 and MAB PA-15 pistols. Squad weapons consisted of Bren Mk. I [...]303 (7.7mm), AA-52, RPD, RPK and FN MAG light machine guns, with heavier Browning M1919A4 [...]30 Cal, Browning M2HB [...]50 Cal, SG-43/SGM Goryunov and DShK machine guns being employed as platoon and company weapons. Crew-served weapons comprised 88.9mm Instalaza M65, RL-83 Blindicide, RPG-2 and RPG-7 <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers,</b> light and heavy mortars of unspecified models, plus B-10 82mm, B-11 107mm and M40A1 106mm recoilless rifles.|$|R
50|$|At dawn on February 15, {{the battle}} {{began with the}} Viet Cong {{attempting}} {{to cut through the}} wires of the South Korean base. The South Korean marines were dug in and waiting with requests for air-support. Due to foggy weather, the supporting AC-47s could not engage the Viet Cong, so the South Koreans only had artillery support. When the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had penetrated Korean positions, heavy fighting followed. Initially, the outnumbered South Koreans, though vastly superior in firepower, were pinned down, but the ranks of the Communist forces soon started to break up as the South Koreans counterattacked. When the fighting ended, South Korean forces reported that 246 enemy bodies had been left behind on the battlefield. In addition, they reported retrieving three flamethrowers, five <b>anti-tank</b> <b>rocket</b> <b>launchers,</b> two machine guns, 28 rifles, 100 pieces of dynamite, and over 6,000 rounds of ammunition.|$|R
