This paper presents a review of fish video multitracking techniques. It describes the possibilities of tracking individuals and groups at different scales, but also outlines the advantages and limitations of the detection methods. The problem of occlusions, during which errors of individual identifications are very frequent, is underlined. This paper summarizes different approaches to improving the quality of individual identification, notably by {{the development}} of three-dimensional tracking, image analysis and probabilistic applications.

40|$|With the {{development}} of digital imaging techniques over the last decade, there are now new opportunities to study complex behavioural patterns and rhythms in fish (from individual to collective group) and to track {{a very large number}} of individuals. These new technologies and methods provide valuable information to fundamental and applied science disciplines such as ethology, <b>animal</b> <b>sociology,</b> animal psychology, veterinary sciences, animal welfare sciences, statistical physics, pharmacology, as well as neuro- and ecotoxicology. Specifically in situations where a large number of individuals are involved, the use of video tracking data is essential, as manual analyses would be complicated, time-consuming and sometimes even impossible. Today, multitracking allows us to observe directly the behaviours of groups, and to determine the real interaction rules by sampling data collected in nature or in the laboratory, without any a posteriori rules as it was and is frequently the case in computer simulation of collective behaviours. With these technologies, the quantitative measures of collective behaviours is now easily accessible, and allow to define social behaviours with more accuracy than just qualitative criteria as is always the case for instance with the definition of shoaling and schooling behaviours. Firstly will be introduced a review of fish video multitracking techniques. This review describes the possibilities of tracking individuals and groups at different scales, but also outlines the advantages and limitations of the different detection methods. The problem of occlusions, during which errors of individual identifications are very frequent, will be discuss. Secondly, our recent contribution in colour-based multitracking will be introduced, notably the new application of fluorescent VIE (Visible Implant Elastomer) tags in automatic tracking technology to study the behaviour of transparent animals like glass eels (Anguilla anguilla) in dim light or in darkness. The method makes it possible to measure the activity (notably distance and speed) of four individuals as a function of tidal and nycthemeral rhythms in the same flume (circular aquarium simulating the river or estuarine conditions) across a wide time scale (from seconds to weeks) in the context of migration in estuary.

50|$|A dog behaviourist is {{a person}} who works in modifying or {{changing}} behavior in dogs. They can be experienced dog handlers, who have developed their experience over many years of hands-on experience, or have formal training up to degree level. Some have backgrounds in veterinary science, <b>animal</b> science, zoology, <b>sociology,</b> biology, or <b>animal</b> behavior, and have applied their experience and knowledge to the interaction between humans and dogs. Professional certification may be offered through either industry associations or local educational institutions. There is however no compulsion for behaviorists {{to be a member of}} a professional body nor to take formal training.|$|R

Since that time, the role of stress in living systems has become an active area of research in fields as wide-ranging as psychology, <b>sociology,</b> <b>animal</b> behavior, ecology, and conservation biology. Because of its importance in human disease, stress has also come to take a prominent place in the vernacular. Unfortunately, widespread use of such a broad term has perhaps caused its meaning to become less clear...|$|R
50|$|While {{any person}} who works to modify a dog's {{behaviour}} might be considered a dog behaviourist {{in the broadest sense}} of the term, an animal behaviourist, is a title given only to individuals who have obtained graduate degrees in a related field and obtained post-graduate certification. The professional fields and course of study for dog behaviorists include, {{but are not limited to}} <b>animal</b> science, zoology, <b>sociology,</b> biology, psychology, ethology, and veterinary science. People with these credentials usually refer to themselves as Applied Animal Behaviourists (PhD) or Veterinary Behaviorists (veterinary degree). If they limit their practice to a particular species, they might refer to themselves as a dog/cat/bird behaviorist.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{interventions}} from a ‘posthumanist’ or ‘new materialist’ perspective {{have highlighted}} the embedded character of human systems within a ‘panarchy’ {{of human and}} non-human systems. This article brings attention to a very particular element of materiality, one with a profound significance for issues of security – relations between human and non-human animals in instances of conflict. It {{is an indication of}} the deeply human-centred character of both international relations and security studies that almost none of the central texts mention the very significant roles that non-human animals have in the conduct of war. We argue that the character of war would have been radically different but for the forced participation by an enormous range of non-human animals. Even though, with the improvements in transportation over the last century, non-human animals are less evident {{in the context of the}} movement of people and equipment, they still play a significant number of roles in the contemporary war-machines of wealthy countries. Drawing on literature from critical <b>animal</b> studies, <b>sociology</b> and memoirs, this article discusses the enormous variety of roles that non-human animals have played in the conduct of war, and examines the character of human–non-human animal relations in times of war...|$|R

In the theoretical part, the author relies on the theory of constructing the identity of the <b>animal's</b> role in <b>sociology</b> and in our society. This thesis processes seven qualitative interviews with people who care for abandoned animals within specific organizations. The practical part is, except for introducing the institution and consultants, focused on the data analysis. The caregiver's relationship with animals began to form during childhood and further tightened through their help abandoned animals. This relationship had an impact that they decided to fully focus on taking care of animals in a particular shelter. This expirience was the reason to create new abilities and attitudes that are necessary for doing this work effectively. Aspecially emotional detachment and accepting the fact that you cannot save every animal. It also {{had an impact on the}} social aspects of the caregiver in terms of interaction with other people and worsening relations them. Human is perceived the reason why animals [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the relevance of}} <b>animals</b> to medical <b>sociology</b> by arguing that pet owners’ accounts of veterinary decision-making can highlight key sociological themes which have important relevance to both human and animal health. Based on semi-structured interviews, the paper argues that interspecies ‘kinship’ allows for the extension of sociological claims regarding altruism, self-interest and mutuality from human blood donation to companion animal blood ‘donors’. Furthermore, this study extends sociological understanding of the human-animal bond by showing how the dog’s status as kin meant {{they were expected to}} donate blood, and that the act of donation itself represents an important opportunity for family ‘display’. However, owners who do not or cannot donate blood themselves describe pet blood donation as an opportunity to lessen associated feelings of guilt or obligation through ‘doing good by proxy’. These findings raise critical sociological and ethical questions concerning the risks and benefits of donation, and for how we understand third-party decision making. Finally, the paper argues for the close entanglement of human and animal health, and concludes that sociologists of health and medicine should explore the radical possibility that decision-making in healthcare more generally might be influenced by experiences at the veterinary clinic, and vice versa...|$|R
40|$|Adam Smith, Charles Darwin, Rudolf Clausius, and Léon Brillouin {{considered}} certain “values” as key quantities {{in their}} descriptions of market competition, natural selection, thermodynamic processes, and information exchange, respectively. None of those values can be computed from elementary {{properties of the}} particular object they are attributed to, but rather values represent emergent, irreducible properties. In this paper, such values are jointly understood as information values in certain contexts. For this aim, structural information is distinguished from symbolic information. While the first {{can be associated with}} arbitrary physical processes or structures, the latter requires conventions which govern encoding and decoding of the symbols which form a message. As a value of energy, Clausius’ entropy is a universal measure of the structural information contained in a thermodynamic system. The structural information of a message, in contrast to its meaning, can be evaluated by Shannon’s entropy of communication. Symbolic information is found only in the realm of life, such as in <b>animal</b> behavior, human <b>sociology,</b> science, or technology, and is often cooperatively valuated by competition. Ritualization is described here as a universal scenario for the self-organization of symbols by which symbolic information emerges from structural information in the course of evolution processes. Emergent symbolic information exhibits the novel fundamental code symmetry which prevents the meaning of a message from being reducible to the physical structure of its carrier. While symbols turn arbitrary during the ritualization transition, their structures preserve information about their evolution history...|$|R
