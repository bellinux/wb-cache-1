50|$|The <b>amplitude</b> <b>analysis</b> {{suggests}} a drag of aether. But {{the analysis of}} phase suggests that the Solar System goes towards the constellation Dorado at a speed of 227 km/s. These results were presented by Miller as a positive indication {{of the existence of}} an aether drift. However, the effect Miller saw was tiny - much smaller than would be expected for a stationary aether. In order for these results to be consistent with an aether, it had to be assumed that the aether was dragged along with the earth to a much greater extent than aether theories typically predicted. Values that high could be eliminated due to other physical phenomenon like stellar aberration, which put upper limits on the amount of dragging. Furthermore, the measurement was statistically far from any other measurements being carried on at the time. Fringe shifts of about 0.01 were being observed in many experiments, while Miller's 0.08 was not duplicated anywhere else—including Miller's own 1904 experiments with Morley, which showed a drift of only 0.015.|$|E

40|$|High-permittivity layers, {{related to}} high-porosity layers or {{impermeable}} clay lenses, {{can act as}} low-velocity electromagnetic waveguides. Electromagnetic wave phenomena associated with these features are complicated, not well known and not easy to interpret in borehole GPR data. Recently, a novel <b>amplitude</b> <b>analysis</b> approach was developed that is able to detect continuous low-velocity waveguides and their boundaries between boreholes by using maximum and minimum positions of the trace energy profiles in measured GPR data. By analyzing waveguide models of different thickness, dip, extent, permittivity, and conductivity parameters, we extend the <b>amplitude</b> <b>analysis</b> to detect spatially limited or terminated waveguides. Waveguides that show high-amplitude elongated wave trains are most probably caused by a change in porosity rather than a change in clay content. In a crosshole GPR data set from the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site, two terminated wave-guiding structures were detected using the extended <b>amplitude</b> <b>analysis.</b> Information gained from the <b>amplitude</b> <b>analysis</b> improved the starting model for full-waveform inversion which imaged the lateral extent and thickness of terminated waveguides with high resolution. Synthetic data calculated using the inverted permittivity and conductivity models show similar amplitudes and phases, as observed in the measured data, which indicates {{the reliability of the}} obtained models.

40|$|SummaryRod photoreceptors {{generate}} amplified, reproducible {{responses to}} single photons via a G protein signaling cascade. Surprisingly, genetic perturbations that dramatically alter the deactivation {{of the principal}} signal amplifier, the GPCR rhodopsin (R∗), do not much alter the amplitude of single-photon responses (SPRs). These same perturbations, when crossed into a line lacking calcium feedback regulation of cGMP synthesis, produced much larger alterations in SPR <b>amplitudes.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of SPRs from rods with and without feedback reveal that the consequences of trial-to-trial fluctuations in R∗ lifetime in normal rods are also dampened by feedback regulation of cGMP synthesis. Thus, calcium feedback trumps the mechanisms of R∗ deactivation in determining the SPR amplitude, attenuating responses arising from longer R∗ lifetimes to a greater extent than those arising from shorter ones. As a result, rod SPRs achieve a more stereotyped amplitude, a characteristic considered important for reliable transmission through the visual system...|$|R

40|$|High {{contrast}} zones within aquifers like preferential flow paths or impermeable clay lenses can {{be related}} to low-velocity waveguides resulting in complicated electromagnetic wave propagation behavior in borehole GPR data. Recently, an <b>amplitude</b> <b>analysis</b> was introduced that was able to identify continuous low-velocity waveguides between boreholes already in the measured data. Here, we extend this approach by investigating synthetic data for continuous and discontinuous waveguides in more detail. We found that discontinuous waveguides show characteristic wave propagation behavior causing late arrival high amplitude spreading in the data. The <b>amplitude</b> <b>analysis</b> was able to detect the waveguide and the boundaries at the borehole where the waveguide is present, and the intensity of the spreading can be used to quantitatively estimate the extend of the waveguide into the domain. Applying the <b>amplitude</b> <b>analysis</b> and full-waveform inversion to crosshole GPR data from the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site, we were able to detect two discontinuous waveguide caused by changes in porosity (validated by porosity logs), that were confirmed by the full-waveform inversion results that provided a detailed image of the waveguides between the wells...|$|E

The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter zone were determined in ten healthy volunteers and then compared with the intracranial volume change (ICVC) revealed by phase-contrast cine MRI during the cardiac cycle. In addition, a frequency analysis of these waveforms was performed.
