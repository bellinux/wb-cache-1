5|$|Normally a {{sluggish}} species, {{it relies on}} camouflage for protection. Locomotion is primarily rectilinear, using the broad ventral scales in <b>a</b> <b>caterpillar</b> fashion and aided by its own weight for traction. When agitated, it can resort to a typical serpentine movement and move with surprising speed.|$|E

Built in 1947, Idlewild's {{model was}} one of three similar rides still in operation in North America, one of two featuring a working canopy that covers the riders, and the only one that still utilized an undercarriage fan. The ride was removed to be refurbished and returned in the future.|$|E
5|$|Protective {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} prey {{to avoid}} predation. It includes special protective resemblance, now called mimesis, where the whole animal looks like some other object, for example when <b>a</b> <b>caterpillar</b> resembles a twig or a bird dropping. In general protective resemblance, now called crypsis, the animal's texture blends with the background, for example when a moth's colour and pattern blend in with tree bark.|$|E

2500|$|Large silk trails help {{increase}} adhesion to {{the host}} plant. <b>As</b> <b>caterpillars</b> advance in groups, they form thick mats of silk that provide them with secure adhesion. Isolated caterpillars have been observed to fall off their host trees and perish. It has been hypothesized that {{this is due to}} the production of thin strands that do not provide a secure grip or due to a faster exhaustion of silk supply. [...] In addition to this, making silk is more costly for larvae in their first instars, so grouping is beneficial in earlier stages. <b>As</b> <b>caterpillars</b> develop, they decrease the use of shared silk.|$|R
5|$|Butterflies {{in their}} adult stage can live from {{a week to}} nearly a year {{depending}} on the species. Many species have long larval life stages while others can remain dormant in their pupal or egg stages and thereby survive winters. The Melissa Arctic (Oeneis melissa) overwinters twice as <b>a</b> <b>caterpillar.</b> Butterflies may have one or more broods per year. The number of generations per year varies from temperate to tropical regions with tropical regions showing a trend towards multivoltinism.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting <b>a</b> <b>caterpillar</b> for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, c. 1865. The caterpillar is {{seated on a}} toadstool and is smoking a hookah; the image {{can be read as}} showing either the forelegs of the larva, or as suggesting a face with protruding nose and chin. Eric Carle's children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week.|$|E
5|$|In a {{memorandum}} of 1908, Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed. Snow vehicles {{did not yet}} exist however, and so his engineer Reginald Skelton developed the idea of <b>a</b> <b>caterpillar</b> track for snow surfaces. In the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get {{him all the way}} to the Pole, and decided additionally to take horses (based on Shackleton's near success in attaining the Pole, using ponies), and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910. Man-hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau, on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed Beardmore Glacier.|$|E

5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose and forehead pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air bladders were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont was based on <b>a</b> <b>caterpillar</b> with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder {{in order to give}} the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent paint to glow when a black light was shone on it during that scene.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some species}} of sea anemone burrow in soft sediment, the {{majority}} are mainly sessile, attaching to a hard surface with their pedal disc, and tend {{to stay in the}} same spot for weeks or months at a time. They can move however, being able to creep around on their bases; this gliding can be seen with time-lapse photography but the motion is so slow as to be almost imperceptible to the naked eye. The process resembles the locomotion of a gastropod mollusc, a wave of contraction moving from the functionally posterior portion of the foot towards the front edge, which detaches and moves forwards. Sea anemones can also cast themselves loose from the substrate and drift to a new location. Gonactinia prolifera is unusual in that it can both walk and swim; walking is by making a series of short, looping steps, rather like <b>a</b> <b>caterpillar,</b> attaching its tentacles to the substrate and drawing its base closer; swimming is done by rapid movements of the tentacles beating synchronously like oar strokes. Stomphia coccinea can swim by flexing its column, and the sea onion anemone inflates and casts itself loose, adopting a spherical shape and allowing itself to be rolled about by the waves and currents. There are no truly pelagic sea anemones, but some stages in the life cycle post-metamorphosis are able, in response to certain environmental factors, to cast themselves off and have a free-living stage that aids in their dispersal.|$|E

25|$|In 1901, Méliès {{continued}} producing successful {{films and}} was {{at the peak of}} his popularity. His films that year included The Brahmin and the Butterfly, in which Méliès portrays a Brahmin who transforms <b>a</b> <b>caterpillar</b> into a beautiful woman with wings, but is himself turned into <b>a</b> <b>caterpillar.</b> He also made the féerie Red Riding Hood and Bluebeard, both based on stories from Charles Perrault. In Bluebeard, Méliès plays the eponymous wife-murderer and co-stars with Jeanne d'Alcy and Bleuette Bernon. The film is an early example of parallel cross-cutting and match cuts of characters moving from one room to the next. The Edison Company's 1902 film Jack and the Beanstalk, directed by Edwin S. Porter, was considered a less successful American version of several Méliès films, particularly Bluebeard. That year, he also made Off to Bloomingdale Asylum, a blackface burlesque that includes four white bus passengers transforming into one large black passenger who is then shot by the bus driver.|$|E
