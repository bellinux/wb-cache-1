25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton, the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that he might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E

500|$|Near {{the end of}} Tucker's third congressional term in 1824, Thomas Jefferson {{presented}} him with an offer {{on behalf of the}} fledgling University of Virginia, sanctioned by Trustees James Madison and Joseph C. Cabell, to serve as the first Professor of Moral Philosophy. The offer met the school's desire to appoint a non-Federalist to the post, and Tucker's connections with Cabell and St. George would also have facilitated his selection. Another factor was Tucker's recent 1822 Essays on Various Subjects of Taste, Morals, and National Policy, which included papers from the Port Folio. Madison had been provided a copy of these and recommended them to Jefferson, saying they were [...] "among the best answers to the charges of our national ...backwardness." [...] Tucker's selection may <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an accommodation to some of the school's opponents, including Episcopalians, Federalists, and notable western Virginians, many of whom were friends of Tucker's. Presumably, his prior monetary indiscretions were overlooked since no related formal charges were extant.|$|E
500|$|Various sources {{considered}} {{the media coverage}} prior to Webster's arrest {{to be focused on}} finding something to blame other than her murderer. After Webster's arrest the media continued to search for any outside agency that might have been responsible for the event. From the beginning, media reports highlighted the lack of parental supervision at the party, and in sentencing Webster, Justice Wood made comments criticising the lack of parental supervision. Researchers Jonathan Morrow and Mehera San Roque in the Sydney Law Review wrote that Wood's comments [...] "might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> quoted from the very newspapers that were covering the crime"; his comments, in turn, were heavily reported in the media. Webster's sentencing also received considerable media coverage, possibly due to his youth and the length of his sentence, as well as curiosity about the newly established [...] "truth-in-sentencing" [...] principles. His appeal regarding the length of his sentence received similar coverage.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} September 1994 {{floppy disk}} release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue. The enhanced CD-ROM {{was released in}} December 1994, which featured full speech for logs and e-mails, multiple display resolutions, and more detailed graphics. The CD-ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version. After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version, LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release, using company employees and his friends' voices, which he mixed with ambient sounds to create [...] "audio vignettes". Doug Church later said, [...] "We tried {{to keep them from}} shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version, but Origin would have none of it". System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version, stating, [...] "I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full-speech CD version. The additional audio added so much it might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a different game. The CD version seemed so much more, well, modern. And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people's minds by the floppy version (the silent movie version!). I really think that cost us sales..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Energy {{conservation}} could <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{accomplished by}} resting quiescent without shutting off the organism from the environment, potentially a dangerous situation. A sedentary nonsleeping animal {{is more likely}} to survive predators, while still preserving energy. Sleep, therefore, seems to serve another purpose, or other purposes, than simply conserving energy. Another potential purpose for sleep could be to restore signal strength in synapses that are activated while awake to a [...] "baseline" [...] level, weakening unnecessary connections that to better facilitate learning and memory functions again the next day; this means the brain is forgetting {{some of the things we}} learn each day.|$|E
2500|$|Yet another view—not {{incompatible}} {{with either of}} those discussed above—connects the species with the Muisca, a Native American nation in today's Colombia. The duck is native to these lands too, {{and it is likely}} that it was kept by the Muisca as a domestic animal to some extent. It is conceivable that a term like [...] "Muisca duck", hard to comprehend for the average European of those times, would be corrupted into something more familiar. Likewise, the Miskito Indians of the Miskito Coast in Nicaragua and Honduras heavily relied on it as a domestic species, and the ducks may <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> named after this region.|$|E

2500|$|HAP {{never had}} any {{explicit}} policy advocating segregation; nonetheless, for various reasons de facto segregation was the norm. [...] Whites complained when placed near “black” areas, and segregation of Vanport by neighborhood might <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> enforced legally. Only in 1944 were complaints raised about the segregation situation in the city. [...] Reacting to the criticism—and pressure from Eleanor Roosevelt—by April 1944, HAP began placing incoming blacks into the “white” areas of the settlement. [...] However, word quickly spread and 63white residents quickly signed a petition demanding {{a reversal of the}} policy. [...] Entire buildings were free in the “black” areas of town, they argued, and after opponents of the integration [...] plan appeared at a HAP meeting the authority decided to resume its previous policies.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, humanitarians and reformers were campaigning in Britain against the appalling {{conditions}} in British prisons and hulks. In 1777 prison reformer John Howard wrote The State of Prisons in England and Wales, exposing the harsh {{conditions of the}} prison system to [...] "genteel society"." [...] Penal transportation was already well-established as a central plank of English criminal law and until the American Revolution about a thousand criminals per year were sent to Maryland and Virginia. It served as a powerful deterrent to law-breaking. According to historian David Hill, [...] "Europeans knew little about the geography of the globe" [...] and to [...] "convicts in England, transportation to Botany Bay was a frightening prospect."

[...] Straucher also reacted against the claims of Viennese politicians that Bukovina was destitute and [...] "semi-asiatic", deeming them [...] "most unfair".
