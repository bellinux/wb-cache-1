5|$|The papacy intervened {{once again}} to try to produce a last-minute peace deal, {{resulting}} in a fresh conference at La Ferté-Bernard in 1189. By now Henry was suffering from <b>a</b> <b>bleeding</b> ulcer that would ultimately prove fatal. The discussions achieved little, although Henry {{is alleged to have}} offered Philip that John, rather than Richard, could marry Alice, reflecting the rumours circulating over the summer that Henry was considering openly disinheriting Richard. The conference broke up with war appearing likely, but Philip and Richard launched a surprise attack immediately afterwards during what was conventionally a period of truce.|$|E
5|$|While separated, {{they meet}} the {{inhabitants}} of the mansion—Maurice (Ed Asner) and Lyda (Lily Tomlin). The ghosts soon turn the agents against each other. Scully is told that Mulder will kill her. Scully meets back up with Mulder, only for him to pull out a gun and shoot her. Scully, completely confused, loses consciousness, and the perspective shifts. It is revealed that Lyda is actually the one carrying out these actions and, through her ghostly ability to create apparitions, causes Scully to see Mulder instead. Meanwhile, Mulder comes upon <b>a</b> <b>bleeding</b> Scully lying on the floor. When he leans over her to try to help her, she shoots Mulder in the stomach. Again, the audience sees that it is Lyda pretending to be Scully, manipulating Mulder.|$|E

40|$|A {{moving magnet}} type oil-free linear {{compressor}} {{has been designed}} for applications such as electronics cooling. A control system using a solenoid operated valve was developed for DC offset and axial clearance control. Operation of the linear compressor with a fixed clearance of 0. 8 mm was compared with a zero DC offset operation. The fixed clearance operation requires a higher power input. The mean piston position can be controlled by using a DC bias on the drive voltage or by using <b>a</b> <b>bleed</b> flow from the compressor body to the suction side of the compressor. Using a DC bias on the drive voltage induces a higher power loss than using <b>a</b> <b>bleed</b> flow {{when there is a}} small radial clearance between the piston and cylinder. This provides evidence that the piston control in a refrigeration system with capacity control should be for a zero DC offset using <b>a</b> <b>bleed</b> flow...|$|R

Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend {{himself in front of}} Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd - even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding <b>a</b> <b>bleeding</b> Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.|$|E
5|$|Smythe married Irene Sands on March 17, 1920, at Central Methodist Church. The couple {{lived in}} an {{apartment}} on St. Clair Avenue, then moved to the Runnymede area of Toronto {{to be close to}} Smythe's sand and gravel business, which operated a gravel pit north-west of Jane Street and St. Clair. (Smythe Park exists on the site today). In 1927, after their first two children, Stafford and Miriam, were born, they moved to the Baby Point enclave of Toronto, where they would live {{for the rest of their}} lives. Irene and Smythe had two other children, Hugh and Patricia. Hugh became a doctor; a specialist in rheumatology, and later a director of Maple Leaf Gardens. Patricia died due to an allergic attack at the age of ten, in 1945. Stafford became involved in the Smythe sand and gravel business and Maple Leaf Gardens before dying of complications from <b>a</b> <b>bleeding</b> ulcer in 1971. Stafford's son Thomas was a stick boy with the Maple Leafs and later was involved with the Toronto Marlboros and Doug Laurie Sporting Goods at Maple Leaf Gardens, before becoming director of the Smythe Charitable Foundation after Conn's death.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} the actuator rate requirements {{for control of}} rotating stall using <b>a</b> <b>bleed</b> valve and provide tools for predicting these requirements. Modification of both the stable and unstable parts of the compressor characteristic via addition of continuous air injection serves to reduce the requirement of <b>a</b> <b>bleed</b> valve used {{for the purpose of}} rotating stall stabilization. Analytical tools based on low order models (2 - 3 states) and simulation tools based on a reduced order model (37 states) are described. <b>A</b> <b>bleed</b> actuator rate limit study is presented to compare the actuator requirements predicted by theory, simulation, and experiment. The comparisons show that the predictions obtained from theory and simulations share the same trend as the experiments, with increasing accuracy as the complexity of the underlying model increases.
