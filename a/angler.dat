40|$|Published and {{unpublished}} {{research findings}} regarding charter and headboat fishing customers from 11 studies were reviewed {{to provide a}} marketing data base for operators and to guide further research efforts. Generally, charter/headboat fishing is a male-oriented activity. Customers were between 30 and 55 years of age. Although both groups of <b>anglers</b> considered themselves to be experienced, charterboat <b>anglers</b> had fished for more years. Charter <b>anglers</b> fished more often {{with their families and}} headboat <b>anglers</b> more often with their friends. Charterboat <b>anglers</b> reported higher incomes than headboat <b>anglers.</b> Relaxation, having fun, and escaping from daily pressures were generally more important to both groups of <b>anglers</b> than motives relative to catching fish. Most <b>anglers</b> indicated that the skills and performance of the captain and crew contributed heavily to the overall evaluation of their fishing experience. <b>Anglers</b> were more heavily influenced to choose a particular captain or boat by informal advertising methods (i. e., word-of-mouth recommendations, reputation, and visits to the marina) than formal methods (i. e., advertisements, brochures, radio, and television). Charter <b>anglers</b> relied more on word-of-mouth recommendations and headboat customers were more influenced by previous experiences. Implications for further research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Recreational <b>anglers</b> {{were interviewed}} in the Blackwood Estuary, Western Australia, to {{ascertain}} demographics, {{spatial and temporal}} patterns of use, expenditures, and attitudes to conservation and fisheries management. Although {{almost half of the}} angling groups encountered were tourist families staying in caravan parks, most <b>anglers</b> were male, 31 - 45 years old, with relaxation as the primary motive for fishing. On average, boat-based <b>anglers</b> fished more frequently than shore-based <b>anglers</b> and locals fished more frequently in the Blackwood Estuary than tourists. Expenditures by <b>anglers</b> on bait, tackle, and capital equipment were considerable. Although support for biodiversity conservation measures and fisheries management regulations was high, noncompliance with minimum size limits was common and further education of <b>anglers</b> appears to be necessary. The study has shown that for fisheries management purposes, any creel survey of the Blackwood Estuary should ensure that local <b>anglers</b> and boat-based <b>anglers</b> are adequately surveyed...|$|R

5|$|Just as predators such as <b>angler</b> {{fish have}} a {{structure}} that lures prey, so some parasites mimic their host's natural prey, but with roles reversed; the parasite gets eaten by the host. This deception provides the parasite easy entry into the host, which they can then feed upon, allowing them to continue their life cycle.

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or host. In its broadest sense, it could include various types of exploitation, as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms of exploitation involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian mimicry (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. The metaphor of a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the caveat that mimics are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up as and imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive mimics, nor would a human <b>angler.</b> Treated separately is molecular mimicry, which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E
40|$|Sales of Texas fishing {{licenses}} have declined since 1988. Several authors {{have suggested that}} this decline is related {{to changes in the}} demographic characteristics of the Texas population, including increasing urbanization. As urban residents have been shown to participate in fishing less frequently than rural residents, the population of Texas residents most likely to engage in angling has declined accordingly. Based on these population trends, urban resident <b>anglers</b> (urban <b>anglers)</b> may represent the future of fishing. Information on urban <b>anglers?</b> demographic characteristics, motivations for fishing and consumptive orientation may be used to tailor and modify programs and policies targeting urban <b>anglers.</b> The purpose of this thesis was to identify differences between urban and rural <b>anglers</b> and to determine if the two groups were distinct from so-called average <b>anglers.</b> The thesis utilized data from the 2002 Statewide Survey of Texas <b>Anglers.</b> The independent variable, residency, was determined on the basis of United States Census Bureau criteria. Dependent variables included demographic variables (e. g., gender, age, race/ethnicity, and income), motivations for fishing, and consumptive orientation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare mean ii scores among the three groups. The study found differences among urban <b>anglers,</b> rural <b>anglers,</b> and <b>anglers</b> in general in terms of their demographic variables, motivations for fishing, and consumptive orientation. The thesis also shows that by managing resources for average <b>anglers,</b> agencies may be ignoring important (and growing) constituencies...|$|R

From each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. During the revised shows of The Monster Ball, Gaga changed the concept {{and the performance of}} the song. She wore an emerald green dress by Thierry Mugler, and was attacked by a giant, mechanical <b>Angler</b> fish. Gaga then removed the dress to reveal a leotard of the same color and during the bridge she is lowered beneath the stage to acquire her pyro-technic bra. In the final chorus of the song Gaga returns and kills the monster with the sparks from the bra.|$|E
5|$|The {{streams and}} lakes around Adams offer {{a number of}} fish for the <b>angler</b> to seek out. The two most common species, eastern brook trout and rainbow trout (Columbia River redband trout), are in nearly every lake and stream. Brown trout and {{cutthroat}} trout appear {{in most of the}} lakes in the High Lakes Area and three lakes are home to tiger trout. All the lakes in the High Lakes Area are periodically replanted with varying species of trout. Bull trout {{can be found in the}} upper reaches of the Klickitat and Lewis Rivers. Westslope cutthroat trout can be found the Klickitat and cutthroat trout are found in the Lewis River and upper reaches of the Cispus River. Whitefish can be found in the Klickitat, Lewis, and Cispus Rivers. Because of barriers to fish passage (dams on the Lewis and Cowlitz Rivers, falls on the White Salmon River), the only river where anadromous fishes can reach the streams around Adams is the Klickitat River. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, and steelhead, in several different runs, make for the upper reaches of the Klickitat, including those around Adams, every year.|$|E

40|$|An {{obstacle}} to conducting economic studies of marine sport <b>anglers</b> is the difficulty and expense in drawing a representative sample. Unlike inland fishing, where licenses are required in all states, only selected states require a marine sport fishing license and these licenses usually only cover selected marine fishing activities. Currently, {{there are no}} low cost methods of obtaining {{a representative sample of}} marine <b>anglers</b> because they are generally not licensed, use multiple access points, and represent a small proportion of the general population. The difficulty and expense of drawing a representative sample may have stifled attempts to study marine <b>anglers.</b> We test alternative sampling strategies by comparing the characteristics of a representative sample of experienced marine <b>anglers</b> with the characteristics of two other samples using multivariate and univariate analysis techniques. We conclude a sample of marine <b>anglers</b> drawn from the population of licensed inland <b>anglers</b> is not significantly different from the representative sample of experienced marine <b>anglers.</b> Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|A {{mail survey}} of tournament shark <b>anglers</b> and party boat shark <b>anglers</b> was {{completed}} {{to examine their}} fishing activity, attitudes, trip expenditures, and consumer surplus. A sample of 700 shark <b>anglers</b> was selected from tournaments in the Gulf of Mexico during 1990, and a sample of party boat shark <b>anglers</b> was drawn from Port Aransas, Tex., party boat <b>anglers</b> {{during the summer of}} 1991. A response rate of 58 % (excluding nondeliverables) was obtained from tournament <b>anglers.</b> The sample of party boat shark <b>anglers</b> was too small to provide useful results. Tournament shark <b>anglers</b> reported fishing an average of 58 days per year and targeted sharks and other large marine species. Tournaments occupy a small portion of their fishing effort. If this group of <b>anglers</b> were not able to fish for sharks, one-third indicated no other species would be an acceptable substitute, while others were willing to substitute other large marine species. Shark trip expenditures averaged $ 197 per trip with a consumer surplus of $ 111 per trip. Based on MRFSS {{estimates of the number of}} shark fishing trips, we estimate a total of $ 43, 355, 000 was spent by shark <b>anglers</b> in the Gulf of Mexico with a consumer surplus of $ 23, 865, 000 for a total gross value of the shark fishery of $ 66, 220, 000.

40|$|The African Union’s {{prioritisation}} of inland fisheries as {{an investment}} area for poverty alleviation and regional economic development will require the development of management plans. These {{should be based on}} sound knowledge of the social dynamics of the resource users. In South Africa the social dynamics of resource users of inland fisheries have never been assessed. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the human dimensions of the <b>anglers</b> utilising the fishery in Lake Gariep, South Africa’s largest impoundment. The study was based on 357 first-time interviews conducted on the lakeshore between October 2006 and December 2007. <b>Anglers</b> were categorised as recreational (39 %) or subsistence (61 %) based on their residency, occupation, primary motivation for angling, mode of transport and gear use. Subsistence <b>anglers</b> were local (99 %), residing within 10 km of the place where they were interviewed, while recreational <b>anglers</b> included both local resident and non-resident members. The racial composition of <b>anglers</b> was dependent on user group and differed significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) from the demographic composition of the regional population. Recreational <b>anglers</b> were predominantly White (≥ 60 % of interviews) and Coloured (≥ 25 %), while 84 % of subsistence <b>anglers</b> were Coloured and 16 % Black African. Most recreational <b>anglers</b> had permanent employment or were pensioners while < 30 % of subsistence <b>anglers</b> were permanently employed. Most recreational users (82 %) accessed the lake with their own vehicle while subsistence <b>anglers</b> mainly walked (63 %) or used a bicycle (28 %). Recreational interviewees either consumed (59 %), sold (11 %), gave away (10 %) or released (20 %) some of their catch. Subsistence <b>anglers</b> either ate their catch (53 %) and/or sold (41 %) their catch. Within the subsistence sector no <b>anglers</b> released fish after capture or gave some of the catch away. We conclude that this inland fishery contributes to the livelihood of the rural poor who use the lake on a subsistence basis and that recreational-angler based tourism may contribute to increased income and employment opportunities through related service industries. ...|$|R
