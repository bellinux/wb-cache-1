Controlled carbon acceptor concentrations over the range of 10 to the 17 th- 10 to the 20 th/cu cm were achieved by resistively heating a graphite filament with a direct current power supply. Capacitance-voltage, p/n junction and secondary-ion mass spectrometry measurements indicate that there is negligible diffusion of carbon during growth and with postgrowth rapid thermal <b>annealing.</b> <b>Carbon</b> was used for p-type doping in the base of Npn AlGaAs/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors.

40|$|Optical {{absorption}} (OA) and {{electron spin}} resonance measurements have been performed on IIa, Ib, IaA and IaB type diamonds irradiated by 3 MeV electrons. OA reveals that the GR 1 system in diamond is usually accompanied by an underlying broad background band, which is tentatively attributed to strained neutral vacancies (Vdegrees). The photochromic changes in OA suggest that the concentration calibration constants for the Vdegrees, H 3 and H 4 defects should be halved, that the 3 H and 5 RL centres could be different charge states of a di-interstitial related defect and that the di-interstitial R 1, 3 H and 5 RL centres in diamond are stable to annealing temperatures up to at least 800 degreesC. The generation and annealing of interstitials and vacancies have been studied {{as a function of}} the nitrogen concentration and aggregation state. The results suggest that single substitutional nitrogen (N-S) efficiently traps carbon interstitials, but releases them upon annealing at 400 degreesC. Defects related to nitrogen aggregation in IaB diamond also trap interstitials, but do not release them upon <b>annealing.</b> <b>Carbon</b> interstitials are not trapped by N-S-N-S pairs. Instead, an increase in the concentration of N-S-N-S centres enhances the production rates of vacancies and interstitials, reduces their annealing temperatures and favours formation of the 3 H over RI di-interstitials.

40|$|Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers {{have begun}} {{to be used as}} {{substrates}} of large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs) for high speed and low power applications. The SOI structure consists of a top silicon layer, a buried oxide (BOX) layer, and a silicon substrate. The thickness of the top silicon layer of the SOI wafers required for metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) devices is on the order of 30 - 200 nm. Defect control for the thin top silicon layer is very important, where the light element impurities play a key role. Oxygen and carbon are main light element impurities included unintentionally in silicon crystals. Oxygen impurities in silicon crystals promote mechanical strength but lead to oxygen microprecipitates after <b>annealing.</b> <b>Carbon</b> impurities act as nucleation sites for oxygen precipitation in the gettering process of LSI production and the carbon impurities precipitate in dislocation loop formation. A quantitative analysis is required for determining these light element impurities in the top silicon layer of SOI wafers. However, the characterization of these impurities in the top silicon layer is lagging because of the difficulty in measuring their concentrations in ultrathin layers. 　　In this study we report on detection of the light element impurities after electron irradiation by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Irradiation with electrons, protons, or other high-energy particles induces defects that involve light element impurities and emit strong luminescence. There are two well-known radiative defects: the complex of interstitial carbon and interstitial oxygen which induces the C-line at 0. 79 eV and that of interstitial carbon and substitutional carbon which induces the G-line at 0. 97 eV. The ultraviolet (UV) excitation enables us to detect these lines from the ultrathin top silicon layer of a SOI wafer because of the shallow penetration depth of UV light and the confinement effect of photo-excited carriers in the top silicon layer. 　　Various commercial SOI wafers (thicknesses of top silicon layers: 60 - 200 nm) were irradiated with 1 MeV electrons by a fluence ranging from 3 x 10 16 to 1 x 10 17 electrons/cm 2 for luminescence activation of light element impurities. We detected the C-line and the G-line from all the samples under the UV light excitation. That demonstrates the presence of oxygen and carbon in the top silicon layers. To {{the best of my knowledge}} this is the first report on detection of carbon and oxygen impurities in the ultrathin top silicon layer. 　　As yet we have not observed differences in crystalline quality depending on the SOI wafer fabrication methods. We compared PL spectra under the UV light excitation from UNIBOND, SIMOX, and ELTRAN wafers fabricated in 2002 to find out differences in concentration of the light element impurities. We observed substantial differences in the intensity of the C-line and the G-line among these wafers. The variation in the intensity of the C-line and the G-line reflects the carbon and oxygen concentrations. We also found variation in concentrations of these light element impurities in a wafer. 　　In order to verify that the PL signal under the UV light excitation does not come from the silicon substrate, we implanted xenon ion solely in the top silicon layer by adjusting the accelerating voltage to 50 keV. Although we detected the luminescent activated centers, such as the C-line, under the UV light excitation with a penetration depth of 10 nm, we did not detected the centers under the visible light excitation with a penetration depth of 3 μm. This confirmed that PL under UV light excitation detects the C-line not from the substrate but from the top silicon layer. 　　We confirmed the repeatability of this method. Several SOI wafers were separately irradiated with electrons and separately measured by PL spectroscopy under the same conditions. The spectral shape in terms of the relative intensity between the C-line, G-line, and bound exciton line was almost the same for the separate measurements. We estimated detection limit of our PL measurement for carbon impurities in bulk silicon wafers. We measured the intensity ratios of the C-line and the G-line to the free exciton (FE) line for bulk silicon wafers whose carbon impurity concentration had been determined to be from 1 x 10 15 to 3 x 10 6 atoms/cm 3 by FT-IR. The quantitative relationships between the intensity ratios (I PL) and the carbon concentration ([C]) were expressed as I PL ∝ [C] n. We estimated the detection limit to be on the order of 10 12 atoms/cm 3 by taking the signal-to-noise ratio into consideration. The detection limit of the carbon impurity in the top silicon layers is supposed to be on the order of 10 14 atoms/cm 3 because the thickness of the top silicon layers is two orders of magnitude smaller than the penetration depth of the excitation light. This number is large enough for measuring carbon impurity with practical concentration. Therefore our PL measurement has sufficient accuracy to determine the carbon impurities in the top silicon layers quantitatively. 　　In conclusion, we revealed that differences in the impurity concentration depending on the wafer fabrication methods and variations of the impurity concentration depending on the location of the wafers. Luminescence activation using electron irradiation with PL measurement under the UV light excitation is a very promising tool for the evaluating the light element impurities in the top silicon layer of SOI wafers...|$|E

In graphitic carbon, lithium motion is governed by the arrangement of carbon rings: while 6 -member rings block lithium diffusion through layers of graphene, higher valence rings permit it. Our approach turns to topological analysis of the distance function, constructing explicit triangulations to represent carbon rings, classifying them as blocking (blue) or non-blocking (pink) (middle left). We use our representation to quantify both the portions of the nanosphere that are accessible from the exterior (dark pink) (middle right), as well as studying the effects of defects on the diffusion distance needed to saturate the nanosphere (right). Abstract — Large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are commonly used for simulating the synthesis and ion diffusion of battery materials. A good battery anode material is determined by its capacity to store ion or other diffusers. However, modeling of ion diffusion dynamics and transport properties at large length and long time scales would be impossible with current MD codes. To analyze the fundamental properties of these materials, therefore, we turn to geometric and topological analysis of their structure. In this paper, we apply a novel technique inspired by discrete Morse theory to the Delaunay triangulation of the simulated geometry of a thermally <b>annealed</b> <b>carbon</b> nanosphere. We utilize our computed structures to drive further geometric analysis to extract the interstitial diffusion structure as a single mesh. Our results provide {{a new approach to}} analyze the geometry of the simulated carbon nanosphere, and new insights into the role of carbon defect size and distribution in determining the charge capacity and charge dynamics of these carbon based battery materials.

In many computational chemistry problems, interfaces are better represented as volumetric regions than as discrete surfaces. The geometry of this interface is largely defined by electron density and electrostatic potential fields. While experimental measurements such as chemical bond and Van der Waals radii do not directly specify the interface, they are physically relevant in modeling molecular structure. Rather than use these radial values to directly determine surface geometry, we use them to define an uncertainty interval in an electron density distribution, which then guides classification of volume data.

Therefore, the obtained results may not necessarily give the accurate actual behaviors of beams. Previously, it was shown that the prediction of stress～strain relationship of <b>annealed</b> low <b>carbon</b> steel under arbitrarily varied uniaxial cyclic loadings is possible by means of producing the computer program based on the experimental results by the author and other. In this paper the dynamic elasto-plastic {{analysis of}} simply supported beam is presented by using above-mentioned actual stress～strain relationship to determine the moment～curvature relations. The differential equations of motion are solved by means of a single step forward integration procedure. Results obtained from two different conditions of loading are shown and compared with the responses of corresponding beam with bilinear characteristics...|$|R
40|$|We examine {{possible}} {{mechanisms for}} graphitization at dislocation cores in diamond, {{both as an}} explanation for brown coloration in natural brown diamond and {{as a model for}} <b>annealing</b> in amorphous <b>carbon</b> materials. We find a metastable structure for the 90 ° partial dislocation core where bonds are broken in both single- and double-period structures leading to a row of paired sp 2 C atoms. We examine the effect of hydrogen and other impurities on this core structure both through direct interaction and potential charging effects. We also investigate a mechanism for progressive aromatization through the migration and aggregation of 30 ° partial dislocations...|$|R
