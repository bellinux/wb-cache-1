50|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} eventually {{replaced the}} <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace.</b> It rapidly superseded both the Bessemer process and Siemens-Martin process in Western Europe by the 1950s and in Eastern Europe by the 1980s. The <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> steelmaking had superseded Bessemer process in UK by 1900, but elsewhere in Europe, especially in Germany, the Bessemer and Thomas processes were used {{until the late}} 1960s when they were superseded by basic oxygen steelmaking. The last <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> in the former East Germany was stopped in 1993. In the US, steel production using the Bessemer process ended in 1968 and the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> had stopped by 1992. In Hunedoara steel works, Romania the last 420-tonne capacity <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was shut down on 12 June 1999, demolished and scrapped between 2001 and 2003, but the eight smokestacks of the furnaces remained until February 2011. The last <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> shop in China was shut down in 2001. The nation with the highest share of steel produced with <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> (almost 50%) is Ukraine. The process is still in use in both India and Russia.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> {{was first}} {{developed}} by German-born engineer Carl Wilhelm Siemens. In 1865, the French engineer Pierre-Émile Martin {{took out a}} license from Siemens and first applied his regenerative furnace for making steel. Their process {{was known as the}} Siemens-Martin process, and the furnace as an [...] "open-hearth" [...] <b>furnace.</b> Most <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> were closed by the early 1990s, not least because of their slow operation, being replaced by the basic oxygen furnace or electric arc furnace.|$|R
50|$|The {{successor}} to Mr. Bachman was Mr. Severn P. Ker, who had {{many years of}} experience in the commercial side of the steel industry. Under Mr. Ker's direction, the company continued to increase its capacity and to extend its operations. In 1910, a sixth <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was built, and a 14” band mill was added to the production line. In 1913, another <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> and certain auxiliary equipment were added, which raised the annual capacity of the company to 180,000 tons of <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> ingots.|$|R

50|$|The AJAX furnace was a {{modification}} of the tilting <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> that used blown oxygen to improve productivity. The process {{was used in the}} UK during the 1960s at a time of transition from <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> to oxygen based steel making.|$|R
50|$|<b>Open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{are one of}} {{a number}} of kinds of furnace where excess carbon and other {{impurities}} are burnt out of pig iron to produce steel. Since steel is difficult to manufacture due to its high melting point, normal fuels and furnaces were insufficient and the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was developed to overcome this difficulty. Compared to Bessemer steel, which it displaced, its main advantages were that it did not expose the steel to excessive nitrogen (which would cause the steel to become brittle), was easier to control, and it permitted the melting and refining of large amounts of scrap iron and steel.|$|R
50|$|After World War I {{the company}} bought land at nearby Roundwood, and by 1920 a tenth <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was added and new rolling {{capacity}} on 10 in, 12 in and 18 in rolling mills began production.|$|R

50|$|The AJAX process {{invented in}} 1957, and named after its originator, Albert Jackson. The process {{involved}} modifying an <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> to use oxygen instead of air.

50|$|Ultimately this {{principle}} was applied even more efficiently in regenerative heat exchangers, {{such as the}} Cowper stove (which preheat incoming blast air with waste heat from flue gas; these are used in modern blast furnaces), and in the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> (for making steel) by the Siemens-Martin process.|$|R
50|$|While {{arguably the}} first {{primitive}} <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was the Catalan forge, invented in Spain in the 8th century, it is usual to confine the term to certain 19th-century and later steelmaking processes, thus excluding bloomeries (including the Catalan forge), finery forges, and puddling furnaces from its application.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War many {{industrial}} {{companies in}} South Yorkshire faced problems due to the decline in the need for their products. The large steel producers within the United Kingdom were nationalised in 1951 under the Labour Government, but, just two years later Steel, Peech & Tozer was de-nationalised. By the 1950s Templeborough's <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> were in need of replacement and the United Steel Companies set about the task of updating its melting facilities. Plans, under the name “Operation SPEAR” (Steel Peech Electric Arc Reorganization), brought the most modern electric arc furnaces to the company, six of these replacing the 14 <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> When completed Templeborough Melting Shop became the world's largest electric arc steel making plant with a capability of producing 1.8 million tons per year.|$|R

50|$|Steel {{manufacture}} in Stocksbridge {{had always}} been by melting iron and steel firstly in crucibles (from 1860), then Bessemer converters (from 1862) and Siemens <b>Open</b> <b>Hearth</b> <b>Furnaces</b> (from 1899 until 1968) and lastly Electric arc furnaces (from 1939 until 2005). Iron has never been produced from iron ore at Fox's, by any method.|$|R
5000|$|Steel, Peech and Tozer, {{known locally}} as [...] "Steelos" [...] {{was one of the}} largest {{manufacturers}} in the Rotherham area. In 1918 they merged with Samuel Fox and Company, based in Stocksbridge and Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company in Scunthorpe creating United Steel Companies (USC). The Templeborough steelworks was reputed to be a mile long. At its height in the mid-20th century, the company employed 10,000 people. In the 1950s as Templeborough's <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> had become outdated USC set up “Operation SPEAR” (Steel Peech Electric Arc Reorganization), to inroduce six modern electric arc furnaces to replace the 14 <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> This resulted in Templeborough Melting Shop becoming the largest electric arc steel making plant in the world: they were capable of producing 1.8 million tons per year. USC also employed the cybernetician Stafford Beer to run a simulation of a [...] "cybernetic factory".|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} of the Sharon Steel Hoop Company being immediately adjacent to the Sharon Steel Company, later the Farrell Works of the Carnegie Steel Company, made it feasible for the new company to purchase its requirements of semi-finished steel from the mill located so near. When the original Sharon Steel Company was acquired later by the United States Steel Corporation, and a new contract for billets could not be negotiated, it became necessary for the Sharon Steel Hoop Company to produce its own <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> steel. Thus, in 1902, the “Steel Hoop” inaugurated a building program which included four 35-ton <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces,</b> a blooming mill, and a bar mill on which billets would be rolled to be converted into bands on the 8” and 9” mills. In 1905, a fifth <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was added, and a 10” hot strip mill was brought into production, In 1906, the company built and operated the first continuous pickling and galvanizing unit ever built in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Two more blast {{furnaces}} were brought into operation in 1871. Further new plant was added {{over the next}} decade, including a slab mill, a large plate mill, a billet mill and three <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> In 1888 the company was renamed the Parkgate Iron & Steel Company Limited to reflect its increase in steelmaking.|$|R
50|$|Abé (1996) {{explores the}} record of iron and steel firms in Victorian England by {{analyzing}} Bolckow Vaughan & Company. It was wedded for too long to obsolescent technology and was a very late adopter of the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> method. Abé concludes that the firm—and the British steel industry—suffered from a failure of entrepreneurship and planning.|$|R
50|$|Later {{applications}} {{included the}} blast furnace {{process known as}} hot blast and the <b>Open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> also called Siemens regenerative furnace (which was used for making glass), where the hot exhaust gases from combustion are passed through firebrick regenerative chambers, which are thus heated. The flow is then reversed, so that the heated bricks preheat the fuel.|$|R
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the fire-clay retort, higher heats could be held in the retort benches, leading to faster and more complete carbonization of the coal. As higher heats became possible, advanced methods of retort bench firing were introduced, catalyzed by the development of the <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> by Siemens, circa 1855-1870, leading to a revolution in gas-works efficiency.|$|R
2500|$|Cleveland Rolling Mill {{expanded}} {{its presence in}} 1868 {{with the construction of}} the Newburgh Steel Works next to its existing plant. The new works included an <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> Bessemer furnace; it was the first continuous <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> Bessemer <b>furnace</b> west of the Allegheny Mountains and only the fifth such furnace in the nation. A [...] stationary blast furnace and four [...] rolling <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> were also built. A boiler plate mill, sheet metal mill, and wire mill were in operation by 1870. Another [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace was erected in 1872. By the end of 1872, the combined Newburgh plants had two puddling mills; two blast furnaces; two Bessemer converters; a boiler plate mill; two rail and rod mills; a wire mill; and a bolt, nut, and spike manufacturing shop. The Newburgh plants were producing so much pig iron, cast iron, and steel that Cleveland Rolling Mill became one of the principal metalworks in the state. A second <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> was constructed in 1876, and the company leased the works and the Proton Furnace of the Cleveland Iron Co. in 1878. Cleveland Rolling Mill built a [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace at the leased site a year later, by which time Cleveland Rolling Mill occupied [...] of the Union-Miles Park neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|George Cresswell Furnace, {{also known}} as the George Cresswell Furnace Stack is a {{historic}} lead furnace located near Potosi, Washington County, Missouri. It was built about 1840, and is an <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> measuring about 100 feet square at its base and constructed of massive limestone blocks interlaced with mortar. The stack rises to a height of approximately 25 feet.|$|R
50|$|Regenerative heating {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution when it was used in the hot blast process on blast furnaces, It was later used in glass and steel making, to increase the efficiency of <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnaces,</b> and in high pressure boilers and chemical and other applications, where it continues to be important today.|$|R
50|$|The Bessemer {{process was}} the first {{inexpensive}} industrial process for the mass production of steel from molten pig iron before {{the development of the}} <b>open</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace.</b> The key principle is removal of impurities from the iron by oxidation with air being blown through the molten iron. The oxidation also raises the temperature of the iron mass and keeps it molten.|$|R
