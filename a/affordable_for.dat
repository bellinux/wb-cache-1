25|$|From 1905 Anton Tschudi {{started selling}} lots from his farm Øvre Høybråten, which were <b>affordable</b> <b>for</b> {{ordinary}} workers.

Trains were available from Lørenskog, but the first service did not arrive at Oslo East Station until 07:40, too late for industry workers. They were therefore often forced to spend the weeks in the city center and the weekends with their families at Høybråten. The matter was corrected from 21 April 1908, when a new red eye services commenced.|$|E

25|$|In practice, modern governments finance war {{by putting}} {{additional}} money into circulation, and {{the function of}} the bonds is to remove money from circulation and help to control inflation. War bonds are either retail bonds marketed direct to the public or wholesale bonds traded on a stock market. Exhortations to buy war bonds are often accompanied by appeals to patriotism and conscience. Retail war bonds, like other retail bonds, tend to have a yield which is below that offered by the market and are often made available {{in a wide range of}} denominations to make them <b>affordable</b> <b>for</b> all citizens.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade after 2000, a housing crisis began in Auckland with the market not being able to sustain the demand for {{affordable}} homes. The Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act 2013 mandated that a minimum of 10 per cent of new builds in certain housing areas be subsidized to make them <b>affordable</b> <b>for</b> buyers who had incomes on par with the national average. In a new subdivision at Hobsonville Point, 20 per cent of new homes were reduced to below $550,000. Some of the demand for new housing at this time was attributed to the 43,000 people who moved into Auckland between June 2014 and June 2015.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, China's {{progress}} in the control of tuberculosis and public-health reform {{will depend on the}} degree of political commitment to address these challenges. In this regard, the indication by Premier Wen Jiabao, speaking at the National People's Congress in March 2006, that public health is a key component of the country's 11th 5-year development plan is very encouraging. He highlighted the need to improve rural and urban health services, making them <b>affordable</b> <b>for</b> all, and specifically mentioned the need to control HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis. With increased governmental commitment and funding to improve public health, China has {{reason to believe that the}} prevalence of tuberculosis and deaths caused by the disease can be halved within the next decade.|$|E
