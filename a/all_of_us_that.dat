Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E

His mother, Jane, said that [...] "though Stephen continually told <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he didn't do charity work for recognition, even {{he acknowledged that}} to be appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire was awesome". Jane received the MBE from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in November 2014.|$|E
500|$|WALL•E {{proves to}} this {{generation}} {{and beyond that}} the film medium's only true boundaries are the human imagination. Writer/director Andrew Stanton {{and his team have}} created a classic screen character from a metal trash compactor who rides to the rescue of a planet buried in the debris that embodies the broken promise of American life. Not since Chaplin's [...] "Little Tramp" [...] has so much story—so much emotion—been conveyed without words. When hope arrives {{in the form of a}} seedling, the film blossoms into one of the great screen romances as two robots remind audiences of the beating heart in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> yearns for humanity—and love—in the darkest of landscapes.|$|E

500|$|In mid-2013, guitarist John Petrucci {{began writing}} {{a story for}} a concept album, {{presenting}} it {{to the rest of}} Dream Theater about a year later. The band and the record label were receptive to the idea, with Petrucci recalling, [...] "Everybody had the 'go for it' mentality. And from the very first meeting that we had with Dave Rath at Roadrunner, when I presented this and even just said the title, he was 100 percent on board. The involvement of everybody at Roadrunner has been absolutely unbelievable, so supportive. It kind of ignited the secret nerd in <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> loves this sort of stuff, because it's fun, it's different." [...] From its conception, Petrucci envisioned the story as eventually being re-worked into a film, play, or video game.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed {{to go on and}} on forever. It was just beautiful... He showed <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> it was possible to go a little further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it {{in the way that they}} should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. [...] "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck and here comes 'Like a Rolling Stone'".|$|E
2500|$|Several filmmakers, {{including}} John Landis, Eli Roth, Clive Barker, and Guillermo del Toro, {{paid tribute}} to Romero in a Land of the Dead special. Guillermo del Toro said: [...] "Finally someone {{was smart enough to}} realize that it was about time, and gave George the tools. It should be a cause of celebration amongst <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Michelangelo has started another ceiling. It's really a momentous occasion..." ...|$|E

5000|$|When {{it turned}} out that “the blast Nagasaki was a good one,” Hull said in a 1995 {{interview}} with CNN, “it was a tremendous relief. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> felt <b>that</b> way. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> felt <b>that</b> way.

What have we done?...How many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> knew everything about the bomb, enough to know what its potential was? Well, a relatively small number, maybe a thousand. Maybe a few of them. So let's say a thousand just to be generous. How many people were killed — 20,000. It means I'm responsible for 400? That's the kind of arithmetic that bothers you.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Johnson's {{work in the}} 1940s and 1950s {{demonstrated}} that the slide trombone could be played in the bebop style; as trombonist Steve Turre has summarized, [...] "J. J. did for the trombone what Charlie Parker did for the saxophone. And <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> are playing today wouldn't be playing the way we're playing if it wasn't for what he did.

[...] Imam Mohamed Hagmagid Ali, vice-president of ISNA, stated: [...] "This is a wake up call to <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> violence against women is real and cannot be ignored. It must be addressed collectively by every member of our community." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{scene in}} which Marcus changes his mind while with Jacqueline was a major rewrite to the script. According to Hudlin, in the {{original}} draft, Eddie's character Marcus [...] "never decides anything, things are decided for him by the different women. So, we finally realized {{he had to make}} an affirmative choice. Going through the script with a buddy of mine, we talked about it, and my buddy Tre said 'look, he's got to make a decision.' And I said, 'you're right. He's got to reject her, and choose her.' And it seems so obvious now, I'm like 'what's wrong with me?

60|$|Our {{subsequent}} {{journey is}} always a broken experience to me.

2500|$|As {{seen from}} the vilification in Moore's and James' {{comments}} quoted above, the Commissioners came in for as much criticism as the grid itself. Mumford wrote that: [...] "With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the municipal engineer, without the slightest training as either an architect or a sociologist, could [...] "plan" [...] a metropolis..." [...] and Montgomery Schuyler, another architecture critic, claimed that [...] "We all agreed [...] <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> is, who pay attention to such things [...] that the Commissioners were public malefactors of high degree." [...] Jean Schopfer, writing in The Architectural Record in 1902, said of them [...] "Men of genius were needed ... Unhappily, they were ... men devoid of all imagination," [...] while historian Thomas Janvier, in his book In Old New York (1894), wrote of the [...] "deplorable results" [...] of [...] "the excellently dull gentlemen", and criticized the plan as only [...] "a grind of money-making."
