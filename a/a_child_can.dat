25|$|Fraternal {{polyandry}} was traditionally practiced among nomadic Tibetans in Nepal, {{parts of}} China {{and part of}} northern India, in which two or more brothers are married to the same wife. It is most common in societies marked by high male mortality. It is associated with partible paternity, the cultural belief that <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> {{have more than one}} father.|$|E
25|$|When a {{hand loom}} {{was located in}} the home, {{children}} helped with the weaving process from an early age. Piecing needs dexterity, and <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> be as productive as an adult. When weaving moves from the home to the mill, children are often allowed to help their older sisters, and laws {{have to be made}} to prevent child labour becoming established.|$|E
25|$|When baptised, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> get an {{additional}} name (baptismal name), {{especially if there}} is no saint who bears their name, so they take a name associated with a patron saint. In confirmation, children receive another given name, but it is not used. Both baptismal and confirmation names have religious significance only, and they are not on any official records.|$|E

25|$|India has {{legislation}} since 1986 {{which allows}} work by children in non-hazardous industry. In 2013, the Punjab and Haryana High Court gave a landmark order that directed that there shall {{be a total}} ban on the employment of children up {{to the age of}} 14 years, be it hazardous or non-hazardous industries. However, the Court ruled that <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> work with his or her family in family based trades/occupations, for the purpose of learning a new trade/craftsmanship or vocation.|$|E
25|$|The Registro Civil (Civil Registry) officially records a child's {{identity}} as {{composed of a}} forename (simple or composite) and the two surnames; however, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> be religiously baptized with several forenames, e.g. Felipe Juan Froilán de Todos los Santos. Until the 1960s, it was customary to baptize children with three forenames: {{the first was the}} main and the only one used by the child; if parents agreed, one of the other two {{was the name of the}} day's saint. Nowadays, baptizing with three or more forenames is usually a royal and noble family practice.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there is}} {{variation}} {{in all of}} the processes of the development of the sex organs, <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> be born with a sexual anatomy that is typically female or feminine in appearance with a larger-than-average clitoris (clitoral hypertrophy) or typically male or masculine in appearance with a smaller-than-average penis that is open along the underside. The appearance may be quite ambiguous, describable as female genitals with a very large clitoris and partially fused labia, or as male genitals with a very small penis, completely open along the midline ("hypospadic"), and empty scrotum. Fertility is variable.|$|E
50|$|Medico-legal {{psychiatric}} {{assessments are}} also utilized {{in the context}} of child safety and <b>child</b> protection services. <b>A</b> <b>child</b> psychiatrist's assessment <b>can</b> provide information on the psychological impact of abuse or neglect on <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> <b>A</b> <b>child</b> psychiatrist <b>can</b> carry out an assessment of parenting capacity, taking into consideration the mental state of both the child and the parents, and this may be used by child protective services to decide whether <b>a</b> <b>child</b> should be placed in an alternative care arrangement such as foster care.|$|R

25|$|Death of <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> {{take the}} form of a loss in infancy such as {{miscarriage}} or stillbirth or neonatal death, SIDS, or the death of an older child. In most cases, parents find the grief almost unbearably devastating, and it tends to hold greater risk factors than any other loss. This loss also bears a lifelong process: one does not get 'over' the death but instead must assimilate and live with it. Intervention and comforting support can make all the difference to the survival of a parent in this type of grief but the risk factors are great and may include family breakup or suicide.|$|E
25|$|In Portugal, {{the custom}} of giving a child four last names is getting popular, since this way <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> have each of their grandparents' last names. In Portugal and Brazil, some people view this {{as a sign of}} snobbery, since it used to be the noble {{families}} who had a large number of surnames. (For instance, the Emperor Pedro I of Brazil (also known as Pedro IV of Portugal) (1798–1834) had the full name of Pedro de Alcântara Francisco Antônio João Carlos Xavier de Paula Miguel Rafael Joaquim José Gonzaga Pascoal Cipriano Serafim de Bragança e Bourbon, and his son, the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, had the full name of Pedro de Alcântara João Carlos Leopoldo Salvador Bibiano Francisco Xavier de Paula Leocádio Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga de Bragança e Bourbon). For the sake of simplicity, most Portuguese people have two surnames.|$|E

2500|$|The cognitive-developmental {{theory is}} also {{closely linked to}} Jean Piaget’s {{analysis}} for the age-related cognitive changes a child goes through. Lawrence Kohlberg suggested that cognition comes before action and behavior (“I am a boy so I do boy-like things”). This {{emphasizes the importance of}} a child’s understanding about gender roles and their permanent placement in it. After <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> fully grasp this concept, gender-specific information will become more relevant. This idea of gender consistency, similar to Piaget’s concrete-operational stage, is represented by three stages: ...|$|E
2500|$|To add to {{this basic}} pattern, a second given name, or other {{paternal}} or maternal surnames are optional, up to the aforementioned limit of two given names and four surnames. Both limits are sometimes not respected, especially among the former aristocracy. [...] Usually, the maternal surnames precede the paternal ones, but the opposite is also possible. If the father is unknown, or he has not acknowledged the child, only the mother's family name(s) is/are used. <b>A</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> receive surnames from his/her parents' ancestors, even if those surnames {{are not part of}} the parents' names, under the condition that the parents prove those names were used by their ancestors.|$|E

2500|$|Undiagnosed {{hearing loss}} in <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> have serious effects on many {{developmental}} areas, including language, social interactions, emotions, cognitive ability, {{academic performance and}} vocational skills, any combination of which can have negative impacts {{on the quality of}} life. [...] The serious impacts of a late diagnosis, combined with the high incidence (estimated at 1 - 3 per 1000 live births, and as high as 4% for neonatal intensive care unit patients) have been the driving forces behind screening programs designed to identify infants with hearing loss as early as possible. [...] Early identification allows these patients and their families to access needed resources to help them develop.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transition}} from the novice reader stage to the decoding stage is marked {{by the absence of}} painful pronunciations and in its place the sounds of a smoother, more confident reader. In this phase of learning to read, the reader adds at least 3,000 words to what they can decode. For example, in the English language, that readers need to now learn the variations of the vowel-based rhymes and vowel pairs. It is essential during this stage, if a reader is going to become fluent, the reader needs to acquire a sufficient repertoire of the letter-patterns and vowel-pairs that help to make up words that go beyond the basic level.The faster <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> see that the word [...] "together" [...] is [...] "to-ge-ther", the faster the reader will become a more fluent reader.|$|E
2500|$|Children {{may have}} {{problems}} with bladder control (primarily at night), until eight years or older, and may wear diapers while sleeping to control bedwetting. The Children's Health and Wellness website claims that diapering <b>a</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> prolong bedwetting, as it sends a [...] "message of permission" [...] to urinate in their sleep. [...] Dr Anthony Page of the Creative Child Online Magazine claims that children can get used to their diapers and begin to view them as a comfort, {{and that of the}} children surveyed, most would rather wear diapers than worry about getting up at night to go to the toilet. In a series of online surveys, Robert A Pretlow, MD, of eHealth International, Inc., cites an identical figure. He argues that if Internet users are representative of society as a whole, these surveys imply that a fetishistic or emotional attraction to diapers may be responsible for these [...] "comfort" [...] cases, and that [...] "these behaviors are a significant cause of enuresis and incontinence." [...] He called for further studies to be done on the topic.|$|E
