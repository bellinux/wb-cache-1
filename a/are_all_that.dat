They have a 2000-seat stadium {{to the south}} of the town and are the only team besides the England {{national}} football team to wear the 3 lions badge. The King George V playing fields <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remain of the Mount Field, which in 1876 hosted a first-class match between Kent and Hampshire County Cricket Club.|$|E
5|$|Repeats of all {{versions}} of Double Dare aired in various cycles on Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids from the network's inception in 1999 until its closure in 2009. Since 2011, Double Dare has {{been incorporated into}} the branding of TeenNick's classic Nickelodeon blocks The '90s <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> <b>That,</b> and its successor, NickSplat (previously known as The Splat).

5|$|Phenomenalism is {{the theory}} that {{representations}} (or sense data) of external objects <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral monism, as it is called, resembles property dualism.|$|E
5|$|The AdelaideMannum {{pipeline}} {{crosses the}} park and the Anstey Hill water filtration plant lies on its southern boundary; together they supply 20% of Adelaide's reticulated water. Significant historical uses of the area are preserved as ruins and highlighted with interpretive signs. The ruins of Newman's Nursery <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remains {{of what was once}} the largest plant nursery in the Southern Hemisphere. Ellis Cottage is one of the earliest homes in the area, and the Rumps Bakery building housed the first bakery in Tea Tree Gully. Quarries supplied stone for significant Victorian buildings in Adelaide and aggregate for road building. Klopper's quarries in the southwest hosted plays for the Festival of the Arts in 1980 and 1988.|$|E

The bow can still be made out (basically pointing to the harbour bridge) and some concreted near here which is most likely anchor chain.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for vitiligo. For those with light skin, {{sunscreen}} and makeup <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is typically recommended.

A number of surgical options are available {{for those who do}} not improve with other measures. A combination of treatments generally has better outcomes. Counselling to provide emotional support may be useful.|$|E
25|$|Although {{a mining}} and milling plant was {{constructed}} on the mine site before Beanland went into operation, {{there is no}} record of production. The entire plant was still in existence until at least the 1940s. It is now largely demolished; foundations, the 150horsepower boiler and part of the Ingersoll-Rand Imperial Type 10air compressor <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remains of the plant. Much of the waste rock was dumped just northeast of the shaft near a small wetland.|$|E

The castle, the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Denis, together with South Pond, the former fish-pond for the castle, are the only three structures left from this early period. The parish church is the oldest building in Midhurst. Just across the River Rother, in the parish of Easebourne, is the ruin of the Tudor Cowdray House.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade of the 20th Century, library {{collections}} had exceeded 20,000 volumes and had massively outgrown the original reading room in Fairmount Hall. The university opened its first library building, the , (named for the first President of Fairmount College, Nathan J. Morrison) in 1909, with the assistance of a $40,000 grant provided by Andrew Carnegie. The first Morrison Library had a neo-classical design, characterized by the doric-style columns on its façade. Sadly these columns <b>are</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> remain of this building, which was tragically destroyed by fire in 1964.|$|E
