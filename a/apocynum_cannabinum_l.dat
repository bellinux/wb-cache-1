40|$|As {{agroforestry}} {{becomes more}} {{accepted in the}} Midwestern US, understanding how non-timber forest product growth is impacted by forest management practice becomes increasingly important. Timber harvest and prescribed fires are common forest management practices in the Central Hardwoods Region, and canopy gaps commonly result from these practices. Three studies were conducted in central and southern Missouri to assess the impacts of forest management. One of the studies focused {{on the effects of}} discrete canopy gaps on the height, reproduction and mortality of transplanted Actaea racemosa L., Allium tricoccum Aiton, Collinsonia canadensis L. and Hydrastis canadensis L. This study was replicated at the Horticulture and Agroforestry Research Center in New Franklin, MO as well as the Doug Allen Project Site in Gravois Mills, Missouri. Results indicate that small canopy gaps may prove beneficial for increasing rates of photosynthesis, as well as the height and sexual reproduction of the study species. Using ground flora cover data from the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project, a second study was conducted on the relationships (P less than 0. 05) between size and abundance of eleven herb species with ecological site types and the following timber harvest types: clearcutting, group selection, single-tree selection and intermediate thinning timber and no harvest (control). The goals were to ascertain whether ecological site descriptions can be used in conjunction with silvicultural management to select and manage sites for forest farming. Study species included Actaea racemosa L., <b>Apocynum</b> <b>cannabinum</b> <b>L.,</b> Aristolochia serpentaria L., Dioscorea quaternata J. F. Gmel., Echinacea simulata R. L. McGregor, Geranium maculatum L., Hydrastis canadensis L., Parthenium integrifolium L., Podophyllum peltatum L., Sanguinaria canadensis L. and Tephrosia virginiana (L.) Pers. Uneven-aged management harvest types were significantly positively related to the percent cover and/or frequency of A. racemosa, E. simulata, G. maculatum, H. canadensis, P. peltatum and S. canadensis. Percent covers and/or frequencies of A. racemosa, A. cannabinum and A. serpentaria were significantly, positively related to mesic ESDs only, while the percent covers and/or frequencies of D. quaternata, G. maculatum and P. integrifolium were significantly, positively related to specific mesic and specific xeric ESDs xiv A third study was conducted using the ground flora cover data from The Nature Conservancy's Chilton Creek Management Area, to assess significant (P less than 0. 05) relationships between size and abundance of eight herb species with different ecological site descriptions under prescribed fire management. Goals for the study included identifying forest farming sites and planning prescribed fire management that, paired together, might stimulate growth of these plants. Study species included Actaea racemosa L., <b>Apocynum</b> <b>cannabinum</b> <b>L.,</b> Aristolochia serpentaria L., Dioscorea quaternata J. F. Gmel., Geranium maculatum L., Parthenium integrifolium L., Sanguinaria canadensis L. and Tephrosia virginiana (L.) Pers. Percent cover values for the following species were positively related to time since beginning of experiment: A. racmosa, A. serpentaria, A. cannabinum, D. quaternata and T. virginiana, and frequency of A. cannabinum and D. quaternata was positively related to time since beginning of experiment. Representatives of these species significantly increased in percent cover over time and in the latter subset, had higher frequency over the course of prescribed fire management. Small canopy gaps may be beneficial to non-timber forest product species in oak hickory forests. Knowledge of how these species perform on particular ecological site descriptions can influence forest farming site selections. Additionally, decisions about which overstory management activities will be conducted, whether these be timber stand improvement activities involving canopy-gap creation, unevenaged management timber harvest types, and prescribed fire, can be used to determine whether forest farming operations can be synergistic with the existing silvicultural management plan...|$|E
40|$|Hemp ” refers {{primarily}} to Cannabis sativa L. (Cannabaceae), although the term {{has been applied}} to dozens of species representing at least 22 genera, often prominent fiber crops. For examples, Manila hemp (abaca) is Musa textilis Née, sisal hemp is Agave sisalina Perrine, and sunn hemp is Crotolaria juncea L. Especially confusing is the phrase “Indian hemp, ” which has been used both for narcotic Asian land races of C. sativa (so-called C. indica Lamarck of India) and <b>Apocynum</b> <b>cannabinum</b> <b>L.,</b> which was used by North American Indians as a fiber plant. Cannabis sativa is a multi-purpose plant that has been domesticated for bast (phloem) fiber in the stem, a multi-purpose fixed oil in the “seeds ” (achenes), and an intoxicating resin secreted by epidermal glands. The common names hemp and marijuana (much less frequently spelled marihuana) have been applied loosely to all three forms, although historically hemp has been used primarily for the fiber cultigen and its fiber preparations, and marijuana for the drug cultigen and its drug preparations. The current hemp industry is making great efforts to point out that “hemp is not marijuana. ” Italicized, Cannabis refers to the biological name of the plant (only one species of this genus is commonly recognized, C. sativa L.). Non-italicized, “cannabis ” is a generic abstraction, widely used as a noun and adjective, and commonly (often loosely) used both for cannabis plants and/or any or all of the intoxicant preparations made from them. Probably indigenous to temperate Asia, C. sativa is the most widely cited example of a “camp follower. ” It was pre-adapted to thrive in the manured soils around man’s early settlements, which quickly led to it...|$|E

50|$|Concerns about {{milkweed}} {{bitterness and}} toxicity {{can be traced}} back to Euell Gibbons, author of Stalking the Wild Asparagus (1962). It is theorized that Gibbons inadvertently prepared common dogbane (<b>Apocynum</b> <b>cannabinum),</b> a poisonous somewhat similar-looking plant instead. He devised a method to remove the bitterness and toxicity by plunging the young shoots into boiling water (not cold) and cooking for one minute, repeating the procedure at least three times to make the plant safe to eat. Gibbons' method was copied from book to book, dominating edible plants literature for forty years. Most modern foragers consider the bitterness and toxicity issue a myth.

The two functions are not mutually exclusive, however, so {{it may not be}} possible to resolve the issue. The moth's coloration appears to be aposematic for insectivorous birds. Chemical signals do not prevent bats from attacking, but do cause bats to release C. tenera they have caught.|$|R
50|$|Apocynin {{was first}} {{described}} by Oswald Schmiedeberg, a German pharmacologist, in 1883 and was first isolated by Horace Finnemore, in 1908,from {{the root of}} Canadian hemp (<b>Apocynum</b> <b>cannabinum).</b> At the time, this plant was already used for its known effectiveness against edema and heart problems. In 1971, apocynin was also isolated from Picrorhiza kurroa, a small plant that grows at high altitudes in the western Himalayas. P. kurroa was used for ages {{as a treatment for}} liver and heart problems, jaundice, and asthma. In 1990, Simons et al. isolated apocynin to a pharmacologically useful level using an actively guided isolation procedure. Apocynin’s observed anti-inflammatory capabilities proved to be a result of its ability to selectively prevent the formation of free radicals, oxygen ions, and peroxides in the body. Apocynin has since been extensively studied to help determine its disease-fighting capabilities and applications.|$|R

40|$|Oedema is the {{presence}} of excess fluid in the body tissues (Guyton & Hall, 1997). During long air flights, blood pools in the body tissues due to decreased muscle movement. This causes bilateral ankle oedema and results in an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis as well as discomfort to the passengers after their flight (Hope et al., 2001). Hamamelis virginica is clinically indicated as a homoeopathic remedy which acts upon the venous system (Nash, 2002). Apis mellifica, <b>Apocynum</b> <b>cannabinum,</b> Natrum muriaticum and Natrum sulphuricum are all homoeopathic remedies used in the treatment of oedema. The aim {{of this study is to}} ascertain the efficiency of the Homoeopathic complex formula, Hamamelis virginica 30 cH, Apis mellifica 6 cH, <b>Apocynum</b> <b>cannabinum</b> 6 cH, Natrum muriaticum 6 cH and Natrum sulphuricum 6 cH in the treatment of swelling (bilateral oedema) in the lower extremities in women during and after long air flights. This study is a double blind, placebo controlled trial. Forty female participants, between the ages of eighteen to thirty-nine, with a previous history of ankle swelling after long air flights and who were planning long air flights of eight hours or more, were recruited by means of advertisement for this study. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria underwent an examination and were matched in terms of age and risk factors; weight, cigarette smoking, oral contraception, alcohol and coffee consumption. The participants within the matched pairs were then assigned to one of two groups. One group was randomly assigned the experimental group and the other the control. Participants were required to take six powders sublingually without water. The first powder was taken two hours before the actual flight. The second, third and fourth powders were taken every two and a half hours during the course of the fight and the fifth powder was taken after the flight landed. The sixth powder was taken the day after the flight. The participants were measured by the researcher (Appendix D), measuring the circumference of their calf, ankle and foot. The participants were instructed to do three measurements, the first on the day of their flight, the second on the day they arrive at their destination and the third, on the day after their last dose of medication. The measurements were recorded and a questionnaire completed (Appendix E). The data obtained from the participants measurement and questionnaire form was statistically analysed using the repeated measures test, paired t-test, descriptive statistics the crosstab, and the Huynh-Feldt test. Statistical analysis showed significant differences, P< 0. 05, between the control and medicated groups for the measurements in centimetres of the left ankle and right ankle. The results obtained from the research show that the homoeopathic complex medication in this study significantly reduces lower extremities oedema during long air flights, as compared to the control group. The control group, on the other hand, did show an increase in measurements of the lower extremities during the air flight. This implies that the placebo did not provide any benefit towards reducing the oedema of lower extremities in women during long air flights. Therefore the null hypothesis was rejected Preliminary findings suggest that the homoeopathic complex preparation of Hamamelis virginica 30 cH, Apis mellifica 6 cH, <b>Apocynum</b> <b>cannabinum</b> 6 cH, Natrum muriaticum 6 cH and Natrum sulphuricum 6 cH, is effective in reducing the oedema of ankles during long air flights but more research is needed to confirm these findings.
