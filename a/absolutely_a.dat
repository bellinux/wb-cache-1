Her maternal grandparents were both actors and ran the Reading Repertory Theatre Company. Winslet has two sisters, Anna and Beth, {{both of whom are}} actresses, and a younger brother, Joss. The family had limited financial means; they lived on free meal benefits and were supported by a charity named the Actor's Charitable Trust. When Winslet was 10, her father nearly lost his foot in a boating accident and found it harder to find work, leading to more financial hardships for the family. Even so, Winslet has said, [...] "We never felt like the poor kids, which is <b>absolutely</b> <b>a</b> credit to my parents. We lived in a lovely terrace house and we all had each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Let Me In was {{not well}} {{received}} by all critics. Some disputed Reeves' claims {{that he was not}} remaking the film but re-adapting the book, criticizing it for being too similar to the Swedish film. Josh Tyler wrote [...] "The movie he’s made is <b>absolutely</b> <b>a</b> direct remake of the 2008 film, the two are so similar that it’s almost impossible to differentiate between them." [...] In a similar vein, Jamie S. Rich noted that while there was plenty of content in the original novel that the Swedish film omitted, [...] "Reeves hasn't really ferreted out anything new; on the contrary, there is actually less plot in Let Me In than in the Alfredson version." [...] Beth Accomando wrote, [...] "How Reeves can take the credit 'written and directed by Matt Reeves' seems almost laughable when you note how similar the script and the direction are to the original." [...] In comparing the two films, she opined that the remake [...] "makes obvious all that the original film made subtle and does so with less complexity." [...] Mark Kermode called it [...] "the most utterly redundant remake of the year".|$|E

[...] In mid-May 1994 in Napa County, California, Gary Ramona won his lawsuit against his daughter's therapist and the psychiatrist who had given her sodium amytal. The psychiatrist claimed the drug helped Ramona's daughter remember specific details of sexual molestation by Ramona, but a court brief written by Martin Orne, a University of Pennsylvania psychiatrist who pioneered research of hypnosis and sodium amytal, stated that the drug is [...] "not useful in ascertaining 'truth' [...] [...] [...] The patient becomes sensitive and receptive to suggestions due to the context and to the comments of the interviewers." [...] This was the first successful legal challenge to the [...] "repressed memory phenomenon". Dr. Kenneth Gottlieb, a San Francisco psychiatrist said, [...] "It’s <b>absolutely</b> <b>a</b> psychiatric drug...I {{would never want to}} use a drug that tampers with a person’s unconscious unless there was no other drug available. And I would not use it without resuscitating equipment, in case of allergic reaction, and only with an M.D. anesthesiologist present." [...] According to Dr. John Yagiela, coordinator of the anesthesia and pain control department of UCLA’s school of dentistry, [...] "It’s unusual for it to be used [...] " [...] and [...] "better, safer alternatives are available." ...|$|E

2500|$|Voice of Desmond Miles, Nolan North, urged Ubisoft {{to adopt}} motion capture methods similar to Naughty Dog's Uncharted. Speaking in an interview, North {{admitted}} there's a [...] "disconnect" [...] in the Ubisoft game's current setup, which has voice actors provide voice facial animation separately from body motion capture, which is recorded by different actors. [...] "I wish it wasn't done separately," [...] North said. [...] "Don't get me wrong, the mo-cap actors {{do a great}} job, but {{there will always be}} somewhat of a disconnect when it's done this way.

They closed their review by saying [...] "Last Christmas" [...] is both Who's most festive and least yuletide-y Christmas romp to date. And that's <b>absolutely</b> <b>a</b> good thing". Den of Geek heavily praised the episode, stating that [...] "It's one heck of a gamble to go for an hour-long Doctor Who Christmas special, where all but a few minutes at the end {{turn out to be a}} dream. Yet that's just what Steven Moffat pulled off with his far improved Yuletide episode". They closed their review saying [...] "Last Christmas" [...] ensured that one of Doctor Who's strongest years in recent times was capped off very nicely indeed".|$|E
