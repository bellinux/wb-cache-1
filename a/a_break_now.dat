6000|$|In {{thinking}} of Rousseau's peculiar feeling for nature, which acquired such a decisive {{place in his}} character during his life at Les Charmettes, {{it is to be}} remembered that it was entirely devoid of that stormy and boisterous quality which has grown up in more modern literature, out of the violent attempt to press nature in her most awful moods into the service of the great revolt against a social and religious tradition that can no longer be endured. Of this revolt Rousseau was a chief, and his passion for natural aspects was connected with this attitude, but he did not seize those of them which the poet of Manfred, for example, forced into an imputed sympathy with his own rebellion. Rousseau always loved nature best in her moods of quiescence and serenity, and in proportion as she lent herself to such moods in men. He liked rivulets better than rivers. He could not bear the sight of the sea; its infertile bosom and blind restless tumblings filled him with melancholy. The ruins of a park affected him more than the ruins of castles.[84] It is true that no plain, however beautiful, ever seemed so in his eyes; he required torrents, rocks, dark forests, mountains, and precipices.[85] This does not affect the fact that he never moralised appalling landscape, as post-revolutionary writers have done, and that the Alpine wastes which throw your puniest modern into a rapture, had no attraction for him. He could steep himself in nature without climbing fifteen thousand feet to find her. In landscape, as has been said by one with a right to speak, Rousseau was truly a great artist, and you can, if you are artistic too, follow him with confidence in his wanderings; he understood that beauty does not require a great stage, and that the effect of things lies in harmony.[86] The humble heights of the Jura, and the lovely points of the valley of Chambéri, sufficed to give him all the pleasure of which he was capable. In truth a man cannot escape from his time, and Rousseau at least belonged to the eighteenth century in being devoid of the capacity for feeling awe, and the taste for objects inspiring it. Nature was a tender friend with softest bosom, and no sphinx with cruel enigma. He felt neither terror, nor any sense of the littleness of man, nor of the mysteriousness of life, nor of the unseen forces which make us their sport, as he peered over the precipice and heard the water roaring at the bottom of it; he only remained for hours enjoying the physical sensation of dizziness with which it turned his brain, with <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>now</b> and again for hurling large stones, and watching them roll and leap down into the torrent, with as little reflection and as little articulate emotion {{as if he had been}} a child.[87] ...|$|E

The master reminds the student that the officers on the side of the crown were all well experienced men and that this was an advantage that the Parliamentarians did not have. As for money, neither side had much on hand. Some of the forces supporting the king took future credit while those supporting the Parliament were funded by an appeal to the cities and by the placing of levies on the towns.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{weeks after}} his win at Epsom Harzand {{returned}} to Ireland for the Irish Derby at the Curragh on 25 June. Idaho, Red Verdon, Moonlight Magic, Port Douglas and Shogun were again in opposition but Harzand was made the 4/6 favourite in a nine-runner field. Smullen settled the colt in third place before moving up on the outside {{to take the lead}} two and a half furlongs from the finish. He overcame a sustained challenge from Idaho to win by half a length. After the race Weld said [...] "A lot of people thought Harzand didn't have speed but he showed today that he had.

50|$|A red card {{results in}} an {{ejection}} from the game and a two-minute penalty for the team. A player may receive a red card directly for particularly rough penalties. For instance, any contact from behind during <b>a</b> fast <b>break</b> is <b>now</b> being treated with a red card. A red-carded player has to leave the playing area completely. A player who is disqualified may be substituted with another player after the two-minute penalty is served. A coach or official can also be penalized progressively. Any coach or official who receives a two-minute suspension will have to pull out one of their players for two minutes; however, the player {{is not the one}} punished, and can be substituted in again, as the penalty consists of the team playing with a one player less than the opposing team.|$|R

50|$|Still {{looking for}} their first road win of 2006 and trying to <b>break</b> <b>a</b> <b>now</b> five-game losing streak, the Lions went to Wisconsin {{to take on the}} Green Bay Packers. After the teams traded first-quarter field goals, the Packers took a 10-3 halftime lead thanks to a 14-yard TD run by Vernand Morency. Detroit closed to within a point with two more Jason Hanson field goals, but the Packers settled matters with another {{touchdown}} run by Morency, this one from 21 yards out with less than three minutes remaining. Packers quarterback Brett Favre broke Dan Marino's career completions record during the contest, but also threw three interceptions. The Lions fell to 2-12 on the season, 0-7 away from Ford Field.|$|R
40|$|Last year, as the State of California {{struggled}} with a $ 42 billion budget deficit, its financial inability to correct constitutionally deficient prison conditions led {{a federal court}} to order the release of 40, 000 state prisoners. In Oregon, Michigan, Connecticut, Vermont, and Delaware, spending on corrections now exceeds spending on higher education. Across the nation, {{more than one of}} every one hundred Americans is behind bars. When the financial crisis of 2008 dealt its blow, state correctional budgets were already nearing <b>a</b> <b>breaking</b> point. <b>Now,</b> in the wake of unprecedented budget shortfalls, state governments have been forced to confront a difficult reality: the ever-increasing prison population has come at too high a price. The question is no longer whether {{to reduce the number of}} prisoners, but how. Reversing years of ever-harsher sentencing policies, jurisdictions throughout the United States are trying to cut costs by expanding good time credit, increasing parole eligibility, and authorizing new forms of early release. This Article examines judicial sentence modification, an often overlooked ameliorative mechanism that has potential benefits many other forms of early release lack. For states wishing to promote early release in a manner that is both transparent and publicly accountable, judicial sentence modification is a promising, and potentially sustainable, new mechanism for sentence reduction...|$|R

5000|$|The fourth track, [...] "Lenny Bruce", {{is about}} the subversive Jewish comedian of that name. An {{influential}} entertainer whose use of provocative language led to a famous obscenity trial, Bruce died of a drug overdose in 1966. Despite the secular tone of the lyrics, the music is [...] "anchored in the resolute cadences of piano gospel," [...] according to music critic Tim Riley. Often regarded as a bizarre tribute, the song portrays Bruce {{as some kind of}} martyr, even though its characterizations of Bruce have been described as peculiar and almost non-descript. When Dave Herman asked why, after so many years, Dylan chose to write a song about Lenny Bruce (July 2, 1981 interview), he answered, [...] "You know, I have no idea! I wrote that song in five minutes! I found it was a little strange after he died, that people made such a hero out of him. When he was alive he couldn't even get <b>a</b> <b>break.</b> And certainly <b>now,</b> comedy is rank, dirty and vulgar and very unfunny and stupid, wishy-washy and the whole thing. ... But he was doing this same sort of thing many years ago and maybe some people aren't realizing that there was Lenny Bruce, who did this before and that is what happened to him. So these people can *do* what they're doing now. I don't know." ...|$|R
