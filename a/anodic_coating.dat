For comparison, four different negatively charged ions studied. It is proved that negatively charged ions strongly participated in the formation of an incipient film with high impedance value at the first step. The growth of ceramic coating depends on the combination between Al of the substrate and O from the electrolyte, and the negatively charged ions are little consumed.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{influence}} of anodizing process on fatigue life of aluminium alloy 7050 -T 7451 by performing axial fatigue tests at stress ratio âRâ of 0. 1. Effects of pre-treatments like degreasing and pickling employed prior to anodizing on fatigue life were studied. The post-exposure surface observations were made by scanning electron microscope (SEM) to characterize the effect of each treatment before fatigue testing. The surface observations have revealed that degreasing did not change the surface topography while pickling solution resulted {{in the formation of}} pits at the surface. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to identify those constituent particles which were responsible for the pits formation. These pits are of primary concern with respect to accelerated fatigue crack initiation and subsequent <b>anodic</b> <b>coating</b> formation. The fatigue test results have shown that pickling process was detrimental in reducing the fatigue life significantly while less decrease has been observed for anodized specimens. Analyses of fracture surfaces of pickled specimens have revealed that the process completely changed the crack initiation mechanisms as compared to non-treated specimens and the crack initiation started at the pits. For most of the anodized specimens, fatigue cracks still initiated at the pits with very few cracks initiated from <b>anodic</b> <b>coating.</b> The decrease in fatigue life for pickled and anodized specimens as compared to bare condition has been attributed to decrease in initiation period and multi-site crack initiations.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Hard anodising on aluminium and its alloys has been widely practised {{for many years in}} order to improve the resistance of the otherwise poor wear characteristics of aluminium. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in other treatments and coatings, on both aluminium and other base metals. The aim of this investigation is to explain the tribological performance and wear mechanism(s) of an uncoated aluminium alloy, four <b>anodic</b> <b>coated</b> alloys, and also an electroless nickel alloy. All of the coatings are produced on three different aluminium alloys. The thickness of the anodic films is 30 - 35 micron, as this thickness falls within the range commonly used by industry. In an endeavour to explain the role of coating thickness on wear life, electroless nickel alloy has been produced in a range of thicknesses of 10, 20 and 30 micron. To evaluate abrasive and adhesive wear, the samples were rubbed against a single point diamond and steel ball, respectively, in a reciprocating movement at room temperature and 65 - 75 % relative humidity, under a wide range of load and sliding distance. Some tests continued to run until a breakdown of the coatings occurred, whilst other tests were interrupted at intermediate stages. This enabled the initiation and propagation of failure mechanisms to be studied. Abrasive wear was performed under dry conditions, whereas, adhesive wear was evaluated under both dry and lubricated conditions. Wear of these coatings was proportional to the applied load and sliding distance, but there was no direct relationship between wear and hardness. The tribological performance of these coatings appears to be dictated by a) the composition of the substrate, b) the chemical and physical nature of the coatings and c) the test conditions. Under boundary lubricated conditions there was a considerable increase in the wear life of the coatings. A three dimensional surface texture is superior to a machined surface, in controlling contact conditions. There is an approximate linear relationship between coating thickness and wear life for electroless nickel alloys. These coatings predominantly fail by adhesion, plastic deformation and brittle fracture. A microscopic model for fracture of brittle materials, under both static and dynamic conditions for abrasive and adhesive wear correlates very well with the behaviour of these coatings. Analytical interpretation of adhesive wear was made by separately calculating the coefficient of wear "K" of the counterbodies. This information enables an improved understanding of the wear test itself {{to be added to the}} model of the wear mechanisms involved...|$|R

In order to mask these highly sensitive inclusions and to enhance the surface mechanical properties, hard physical vapour deposition (PVD) CrN coatings, elaborated at two different temperatures, have been used.

In order to refine and homogenize the microstructure of the diecast Al-Si alloys, the melt-shearing process parameters were controlled and T 6 heat treatment was carried out.

Samples with porosities between 14 and 70 % and gold thicknesses (10 and 20 Â nm) were considered. The sputtering of gold on the nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) films results in an increase of the fringe intensity of the oscillations in the spectra resulting from Fabry-PÃ©rot interferences in the porous layer, with a reduction in the maximum reflectance in the UV-visible region. For the thicker gold layer, sharp valleys appear in the near-infrared (IR) range that can be useful for accurate spectral shift measurements in optical biosensing. A theoretical model for the optical behavior has also been proposed. The model shows a very good agreement with the experimental measurements, what makes it useful for design and optimization of devices based on this material.

40|$|AbstractâA {{large portion}} of the cost for {{commercial}} fiber-coupled optoelectronics is packaging. Developments which reduce packaging time, eliminate components, and improve packaging automation can have an enormous impact in reducing cost and increasing availability of packaged lasers and receivers. One key step for fiber-coupled devices is alignment of the fiber to the device and rigid attachment of the fiber. In this letter, we present a new technique for bonding fiber autoaligned directly to an active device or waveguide on a Si-submount using field-assisted anodic bonding. Silica fibers coated with a high-Na+ glass (through sputtering of Pyrex, or coating and curing with liquid sodium silicate solution) are placed in a metallized v-groove on the Si submount and anodically bonded. This bond has shear strength comparable to solder-bonded components (600 g) and the v-groove autoaligns the fiber to the component in two of the three dimensions. This novel combination of <b>anodic</b> bonding and <b>coated</b> fiber on precision fabricated v-grooves eliminates lenses and packaging time, will lead to lower-cost packages, and will facilitate multicomponent optical submounts and other novel optoelectronic technology.
