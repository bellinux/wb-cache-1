Rayburn {{reassured}} {{viewers of}} the first CBS show that [...] "This is your old favorite, updated with more action, more money <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see, more celebrities." [...] The {{first few weeks of}} the show were somewhat {{different from the rest of}} the run. At first, many of the questions fit into the more bland and innocuous mold of the earlier seasons of the original series. In addition, many of the frequent panelists on the early episodes were not regulars later in the series but had appeared on the 1960s version, including Klugman, Arlene Francis, and Bert Convy, the last of whom was later chosen as host of the show's 1990 revival before being diagnosed with a brain tumor which eventually took his life.|$|E
2500|$|A patch was {{released}} September 9, 2010 to fix {{issues in the}} game. [...] Players can no longer use collision glitches with the world geometry {{to find ways to}} cheat on the game's leaderboards. [...] Additionally the patch adds an audible beep to players who sit idle in multiplayer lobbies, prompting them to set their status to [...] "ready". The patch also decreases the amount of time to wait on players who do not finish multiplayer races. [...] Vector Unit later removed glitched times from the game's leaderboards in November 2010. When asked {{about the possibility of a}} PlayStation 3 port of the game, the company stated [...] "People ask us this all the time, and unfortunately the answer is no. [...] Microsoft Studios licensed the game from Warner, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine Microsoft is not generally all that gung-ho about making games for the PlayStation." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "On Beacon Hill," [...] {{her husband}} assented. [...] "It {{was seven years}} ago, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> gather from his present appearance, he {{was little more than}} a boy.

He was quite young, of course." ...|$|E

The houses have all been lightly run up with wood, which is plentiful enough in the hills, and no great harm, therefore, will be done if it is again burnt down. The pagoda and palace are the only stone buildings in it. They did some harm to the former, last time, by firing shot at it for a day or two; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see for yourself, no attempt has since been made to repair it, and I do not suppose they will trouble to damage it further.|$|E

"Well, as Lieutenant Asher and {{his wife}} are here yet, and have no earthly reason for being {{anywhere}} in particular; and as Captain Asher seems to be tired of the toll-gate; and as Captain Lancaster doesn't care where he is; and as Miss Olive doesn't {{know what to do with}} herself until it is time for her to get married; and as you are always ready to go gadding; and as the children need bracing up; <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> not get along without Miss Raleigh; and as Mrs. Blynn is a good housekeeper; and as I have an offer for renting our town house; I propose that we all go to sea together." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{went through}} this {{exceedingly}} pretty house and its gardens with melancholy interest. The first is merely a pavilion in the Italian taste, though it is about half {{as large as the}} President's House, at Washington. I should think the Great Trianon has quite twice the room of our own Executive residence; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> well imagine, from what has already been said, the Capitol itself would be but a speck among the endless edifices of the chateau. The projection in the centre of the latter is considerably larger than the capitol, and it materially exceeds that building in cubic contents. Now this projection is but a small part indeed of the long line of façade, it actually appearing too short for the ranges of wings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, she nursed me very kindly, but, {{so far as}} I know, {{until last}} night {{there was nothing more}} affectionate, and I had sense enough to refuse to talk about our {{somewhat}} eventful past. I pretended not to understand, said that we were explorers, etc., and kept asking her where you were, for I forgot to say I found that you had gone. I think that she grew rather angry with me, for she wanted to know something, <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> guess, I wanted to know a good deal. But I could get nothing out of her except that she was the Khania--a person in authority. There was no doubt about that, for when one of those slaves or servants came in and interrupted her while she was trying to draw the facts out of me, she called to some of her people to throw him out of the window, and he only saved himself by going down the stairs very quickly.|$|E
60|$|But I {{can assure}} you, {{in the first}} place, that St. Louis {{is by no means}} {{altogether}} new. I have been up at it, and found most lovely and true colour left in many parts: the crown, which you will find, after our mornings at the Spanish chapel, is of importance, nearly untouched; the lines of the features and hair, though all more or less reproduced, still of definite and notable character; and the junction throughout of added colour so careful, that the harmony of the whole, if not delicate with its old tenderness, is at least, in its coarser way, solemn and unbroken. Such as the figure remains, it still possesses extreme beauty--profoundest interest. <b>And,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see it from below with your glass, it leaves little to be desired, and may be dwelt upon with more profit than nine out of ten of the renowned pictures of the Tribune or the Pitti. You will enter into the spirit of it better if I first translate for you a little piece from the Fioretti di San Francesco.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, my love,' {{kissing her}} forehead, 'I trust {{we shall not}} call upon you for {{anything}} too heroic. With respect to this young gentleman's addresses, I expect {{in the first place}} that all clandestine correspondence, which no young woman can entertain for a moment without lessening herself in her own eyes and in those of her lover--I request, I say, that clandestine correspondence of every kind may be given up, and that you will refer Mr. Bertram to me for the reason. You will naturally wish to know what is to be the issue of such a reference. In the first place, I desire to observe this young gentleman's character more closely than circumstances, and perhaps my own prejudices, have permitted formerly. I should also be glad to see his birth established. Not that I am anxious about his getting the estate of Ellangowan, though such a subject is held in absolute indifference nowhere except in a novel; but certainly Henry Bertram, heir of Ellangowan, whether possessed of the property of his ancestors or not, is a very different person from Vanbeest Brown, the son of nobody at all. His fathers, Mr. Pleydell tells me, are distinguished in history as following the banners of their native princes, while our own fought at Cressy and Poirtiers. In short, I neither give nor withhold my approbation, but I expect you will redeem past errors; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> now unfortunately only have recourse to ONE parent, that you will show the duty of a child by reposing that confidence in me which I will say my inclination to make you happy renders a filial debt upon your part.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, your {{wisdom and}} duty {{touching}} soul-sickness {{are just the}} same. Ascertain clearly {{what is wrong with}} you; and so far as you know any means of mending it, take those means, and have done; when you are examining yourself, never call yourself merely a [...] "sinner," [...] that is very cheap abuse; and utterly useless. You may even get to like it, and be proud of it. But call yourself a liar, a coward, a sluggard, a glutton, or an evil-eyed, jealous wretch, if you indeed find yourself to be in any wise any of these. Take steady means to check yourself in whatever fault you have ascertained, and justly accused yourself of. And as soon as you are in active way of mending, you will be no more inclined to moan over an undefined corruption. For the rest, you will find it less easy to uproot faults, than to choke them by gaining virtues. Do not think of your faults; still less of others' faults: in every person who comes near you, look for what is good and strong: honor that; rejoice in it; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> try to imitate it: and your faults will drop off like dead leaves, when their time comes. If, on looking back, your whole life should seem rugged as a palm-tree stem; still, never mind, so long as it has been growing; and has its grand green shade of leaves, and weight of honeyed fruit, at top. And even if you cannot find much good in yourself at last, think that it does not much matter to the universe either what you were, or are; think how many people are noble, if you cannot be; and rejoice in THEIR nobleness. An immense quantity of modern confession of sin, even when honest, is merely a sickly egotism; which will rather gloat over its own evil, than lose the centralization of its interest in itself.|$|E
60|$|The rolling of a coach {{into the}} court was a signal {{for us to be}} at our posts, and we {{abandoned}} the bureau so lately occupied by the great father of diplomacy, for the drawing-room. I have already told you that this dinner was in honour of Mr. Canning, and, although diplomatic in one sense, it was not so strictly confined to the corps as to prevent a selection. This selection, in honour of the principal guest, had been made from the representatives of the great powers, Spain being the least important nation represented on the occasion, the republic of Switzerland excepted. I do not know whether the presence of the Swiss chargé-d'affaires was so intended or not, but it struck me as pointed and in good taste, for all the other foreign agents were ambassadors, {{with the exception of the}} Prussian, who was an Envoy Extraordinary. Diplomacy has its honorary gradations as well as a military corps; <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> know but little of such matters, I will explain them en passant. First in rank comes the Ambassador. This functionary is supposed to represent the personal dignity of the state that sends him. If a king, there is a room in his house that has a throne, and it is usual to see the chair reversed, in respect for its sanctity; and it appears to be etiquette to suspend the portrait of the sovereign beneath the canopy. The Envoy Extraordinary comes next, and then the Minister Plenipotentiary. Ordinarily, these two functions are united in the same individual. Such is the rank of Mr. Brown. The Minister Resident is a lower grade, and the Chargé-d'affaires the lowest of all. Inter se, these personages take rank according to this scale. Previously to the peace of 1814, the representative of one monarch laid claim to precede the representative of another, always admitting, however, of the validity of the foregoing rule. This pretension gave rise to a good deal of heartburning and contention. Nothing can, in itself, be of greater indifference whether A. or B. walk into the reception-room or to the dinner-table first; but when the idea of general superiority is associated with the act, the aspect of the thing is entirely changed. Under the old system, the ambassador of the Emperor, claimed precedence over all other ambassadors, and, I believe, the representatives of the kings of France had high pretensions also. Now there are great mutations in states. Spain, once the most important kingdom of Europe, has much less influence to-day than Prussia, a power of yesterday. Then the minister of the most insignificant prince claimed precedency over the representative of the most potent republic. This might have passed while republics were insignificant and dependent; but no one can believe that a minister of America, for instance, representing a state of fifty millions, as will be the case before long, would submit to such an extravagant pretension on the part of a minister of Wurtemburg, or Sardinia, or Portugal. He would not submit to such a pretension on the part of the minister of any power on earth.|$|E
