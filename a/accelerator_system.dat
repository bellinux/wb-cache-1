40|$|A {{comprehensive}} experimental {{investigation of}} the geometrical and operating conditions which affect most strongly the ion beam divergence of three-grid <b>accelerator</b> <b>systems</b> is presented. Three-grid <b>accelerator</b> <b>systems</b> are shown to offer significant improvements in ion beam focusing over two-grid <b>accelerator</b> <b>systems.</b> These improvements are greatest for low, but limited, net-to-total accelerating voltage ratio ranges and small screen-to-accelerator grid separation ratios (i. e., high perveance grid sets). Ion beam focusing gains are negligible at a net-to-total accelerating voltage ratio near unity. Low decelerator grid impingement currents and low ion beam divergence angles require that the decelerator hole diameter be about twenty five percent larger than the accelerator hole diameter, also that the decelerator grid be spaced as close as is practically possible to the accelerator grid...|$|R

5000|$|To span a {{wide range}} in a typical ram <b>accelerator</b> <b>system,</b> {{multiple}} stages with propellants with different sound speeds are used to maintain high performance.

5000|$|According {{to a line}} {{spoken by}} Egon in Ghostbusters II, each pack's energy cell has a {{half-life}} of 5,000 years. Knobs on the main stock of the proton pack can perform various functions to customize the proton stream, including adjustments for stream intensity, length, and degrees of polarization. In the cartoon series The Real Ghostbusters, the maximum power setting for the proton packs is [...] "500,000 MHz," [...] which possibly refers to the rate of positron collisions occurring within the pack's <b>accelerator</b> <b>system.</b> In the cartoon the packs also have a self-destruct mechanism capable of affecting at least a half-mile radius. The Real Ghostbusters and the Extreme Ghostbusters also made proton packs less efficient with power cells, allowing them {{to run out of}} energy when appropriate for dramatic tension; in the latter show, the proton packs require replaceable power cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|The proton pack, {{designed}} by Dr. Egon Spengler, is a man-portable particle <b>accelerator</b> <b>system</b> {{that is used}} to create a charged particle beamâcomposed of protonsâthat is fired by the proton gun (also referred to as the [...] "neutron wand"). Described in the first movie as a [...] "positron collider", it functions by colliding high-energy positrons to generate its proton beam. The beam allows a Ghostbuster to contain and hold [...] "negatively charged ectoplasmic entities". This containment ability allows the wielder to position a ghost above a trap for capture. The name proton pack is not used in the original movie at all, and is not used until the subway tunnel scene in Ghostbusters II, when Egon says that they should get their proton packs. The doorman to the Mayor's mansion also uses the term proton pack, asking the Ghostbusters if he can buy one from them for his little brother. Egon replies that [...] "A proton pack is not a toy".|$|E
50|$|In 1986 United States {{president}} Ronald Reagan {{announced the}} National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program, intended to develop two X-30 aircraft capable of single stage to orbit (SSTO), {{as well as}} horizontal takeoff and landing from conventional runways. The aircraft {{was to be a}} hydrogen fuelled air-breathing space plane, with a low speed <b>accelerator</b> <b>system</b> to bring the aircraft up to Mach 3, where the main dual-mode scramjet engines (ramjet/scramjet) would take over. At the edge of the atmosphere, a rocket was to take over and provide the final energy for orbital insertion. It was based on a classified DARPA research program called Copper Canyon. This research program suggested that Mach 25 might be possible. As the program proceeded it became clear that Mach 17 was probably the limit, whilst the weight penalty and complexity of the skin heat exchanger and other propulsion systems was going to be substantial. The program was established by the secretary of defence in 1985, and was funded to the end of FY1994, when the decision was made that the 15 billion dollars required to build the two X-30 test craft were excessive.|$|E
