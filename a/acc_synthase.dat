25|$|Ethylene is biosynthesized {{from the}} amino acid {{methionine}} to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM, also called Adomet) by the enzyme Met Adenosyltransferase. SAM is then converted to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by the enzyme <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> (ACS). The activity of ACS determines {{the rate of}} ethylene production, therefore regulation of this enzyme is key for the ethylene biosynthesis. The final step requires oxygen and involves {{the action of the}} enzyme ACC-oxidase (ACO), formerly known as the ethylene forming enzyme (EFE). Ethylene biosynthesis can be induced by endogenous or exogenous ethylene. ACC synthesis increases with high levels of auxins, especially indole acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinins.|$|E
50|$|<b>ACC</b> <b>Synthase</b> and {{ethylene}} biosynthesis {{are regulated}} by {{a whole host}} of stimuli.

50|$|However, {{it is also}} {{inhibited}} by {{a number}} of compounds as well. S-Adenosylethionine can bind as a substrate for <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> (with higher affinity than SAM) and therefore inhibit any reaction with SAM. <b>ACC</b> <b>Synthase</b> is also competitively inhibited by aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) and aminooxyacetic acid (AOA), inhibitors to many pyridoxal phosphate-mediated enzymic reactions. They are natural toxins that cause slow binding inhibition by interfering with the coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate. <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> activity is also inhibited by intermediates of the activated methyl cycle and the methionine-recycling pathway: 5′-methylthioadenosine, α-keto-γ-methylthiobutyric acid, and S-adenosylhomocysteine.|$|E
40|$|Acyl-CoA carboxylases (<b>ACCs)</b> and ketoacyl <b>synthases</b> (KSs) are two {{important}} enzymes in the fatty acid synthesis and polyketide synthesis systems. ACCs carboxylate acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) to produce malonyl-CoA. After conversion of malonyl-CoA to malonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) by acyltransferase catalysis, KSs catalyze {{the addition of}} malonyl-CoA to an acyl chain to make the chain two carbon atoms longer. This critical step makes the fatty acid chain grow {{to a variety of}} carbon atom lengths. There are tens of thousands of amino acid sequences (primary structures) and hundreds of three-dimensional (tertiary) structures of these enzymes available on public databases such as GenBank (Benson et al., 2005) and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Rose et al., 2011). Nevertheless, classification of ACCs and KSs, along with the other enzymes of the fatty acid and polyketide synthesis systems, by their primary and tertiary structures had not been fully done. Such classification should cast new light in these enzyme groups in terms of their catalytic mechanisms, active sites, and substrate specificities. Thus, we constructed a new database to classify thioester-active enzymes (ThYme) by their primary and tertiary structures (Cantu et al., 2011). ThYme, as its name suggests, includes the enzymes working on thioester-containing substrates. It covers eight enzyme groups: the acyl-CoA <b>synthases,</b> <b>ACCs,</b> acyltransferases, KSs, hydroxyacyl dehydratases, enoyl reductases, and thioesterases, and one noncatalytic protein group, the acyl carrier proteins, in the fatty acid and polyketide synthesis systems. This thesis presents the results of structurally classifying the ACCs and KSs. This includes the classification protocols to separate enzymes into families and subfamilies, the contents within each family and subfamily, and further observations and conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Liver {{metabolism}} {{is influenced}} by hormones and nutrients. Amino acids such as glutamine or leucine induce an anabolic response, which resembles that of insulin in muscle and adipose tissue. In this work, the signalling pathways {{and the effects of}} insulin were compared to those of glutamine and leucine in isolated hepatocytes from normal and streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Glutamine increased cell volume and induced an anabolic response characterized by an activation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (<b>ACC),</b> glycogen <b>synthase</b> (GS) and p 70 ribosomal S 6 kinase (p 70 S 6 K), the key enzymes in fatty acid, glycogen and protein synthesis, respectively. The effects of glutamine were independent of insulin and did not share its signalling components. Leucine, which is poorly metabolized by the liver and does not modify cell volume, activated ACC and p 70 S 6 K, and exerted a synergistic effect on the glutamine-induced activation of ACC and p 70 S 6 K. These amino acids did not affect insulin signalling. Insulin alone had no anabolic effect in hepatocytes, despite the activation of protein kinase B. Nevertheless, it enhanced the activation of ACC and p 70 S 6 K induced by leucine. However, insulin injected intravenously activated rat liver p 70 S 6 K. In hepatocytes from streptozotocin-diabetic animals, the metabolic responses to the amino acids and insulin were similar to those in normal hepatocytes. We conclude that glutamine, insulin and leucine exert different effects that are mediated by different signalling pathways, although their effects are combinatory. The anabolic effect of insulin in hepatocytes was strictly dependent on the permissive action of leucine...|$|R

The studied genes code for enzymes of fatty acid synthesis [ATP citrate-lyase (ACL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (<b>ACC),</b> fatty acid <b>synthase</b> (FAS), malic enzyme (ME), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD 1) ], for an apolipoprotein [apolipoprotein A 1 (APOA 1) ], and for the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), which is a transcription factor implied in the regulation of several genes of lipid metabolism. The results show that the fat-line chickens display significantly higher hepatic transcription rates and mRNA levels than the lean-line chickens for the ACL, ME and APOA 1 genes.

TBEs inhibited lipid accumulation, triglyceride content, and glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity during adipocyte differentiation of 3 T 3 L 1 cells. The mRNA levels of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (CEBP-α), adipocyte protein 2 (aP 2), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (<b>ACC),</b> fatty acid <b>synthase</b> (FAS), and stearoylcoenzyme A desaturase- 1 (SCD- 1), were suppressed by TBEs.

In addition, TBEs were decreased nitric oxide (NO) production. These results suggest that TBEs may inhibit adipogenesis and inflammatory response; therefore, they seem to be beneficial as a food ingredient to prevent obesity-associated inflammation...|$|R

This compound is known to competitively inhibit {{the activity of the}} enzyme <b>ACC</b> (1 -aminocyclopropanecarboxylate) <b>synthase</b> which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolic cycle of ethylene production. Ethylene is a naturally occurring plant hormone that stimulates ripening in climacteric melon fruit, such as rind colour change, flesh softening and production of volatiles. Pre-harvest application of ReTain at the concentration of 125 ppm on rockmelon plants 2 weeks before harvest inhibited postharvest ethylene production. Melons harvested from plots treated with ReTain had lower rates of ethylene production at harvest and after cold storage than melons harvested from control plots. The ethylene inhibition resulted in a delay of fruit ripening of about 2 days. ReTain-treated fruit had a firmer flesh than untreated fruits. In addition, delayed fruit maturity showed less incidence of disease. The results suggest that application of ReTain has major benefits as a harvest management tool for rockmelon production, allowing growers to regulate fruit ripening, improve fruit quality and reduce postharvest rot severity...|$|R

To identify targets of the Snf 1 kinase that modulate expression of INO 1, a gene required for an early, rate-limiting step in phos-pholipid biosynthesis, we performed a genetic selection for suppressors of the inositol auxotrophy of snf 1 D strains. We identified mutations in ACC 1 and FAS 1, two genes important for fatty acid biosynthesis in yeast; ACC 1 encodes acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (Acc 1), and FAS 1 encodes the b subunit of fatty acid <b>synthase.</b> <b>Acc</b> 1 was shown previously to be phosphorylated and inactivated by Snf 1. Here we show that snf 1 D strains with increased Acc 1 activity exhibit decreased INO 1 transcription. Strains carrying the ACC 1 suppressor mutation have reduced Acc 1 activity in vitro and in vivo, as revealed by enzymatic assays and increased sensitivity to the Acc 1 -specific inhibitor soraphen A. Moreover, a reduction in Acc 1 activity, caused by addition of soraphen A, provision of exogenous fatty acid, or conditional expression of ACC 1, suppresses the inositol auxotrophy of snf 1 D strains. Together, these findings indicate that the inositol auxotrophy of snf 1 D strains arises in part from elevated Acc 1 activity and that a reduction in this activity restores INO 1 expression in these strains.

Aminoethoxyvinylglycine, a known inhibitor of <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase,</b> did {{not alter the}} apparent turnover of <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> in vivo although it efficiently blocked inactivation of the enzyme by its substrate S-adenosylmethionine in vitro. Similar results were obtained, using a novel assay with permeabilized cells, for <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> in tomato cell cultures treated with a fungal elicitor. The results indicate that inactivation of <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> in vivo differs from substrate-dependent inactivation in vitro...|$|E
40|$|A pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP) -dependent enzyme, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (<b>ACC)</b> <b>synthase</b> (S-adenosyl-l-Met methylthioadenosine-lyase, EC 4. 4. 1. 14), catalyzes the {{conversion}} of S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to ACC. A tomato <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> isozyme (LE-ACS 2) with a deletion of 46 amino acids at the C terminus {{was chosen as the}} control enzyme {{for the study of the}} function of R 286 in <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase.</b> R 286 of the tomato <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> was mutated to a leucine via site-directed mutagenesis. The <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> mutant R 286 L was purified using a simplified two-step purification protocol. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis indicated that the overall three-dimensional structure of the mutant was indistinguishable from that of the control enzyme. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the binding affinity of R 286 L <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> for its cofactor PLP was reduced 20 - to 25 -fold compared with control. Kinetic analysis of R 286 L showed that this mutant <b>ACC</b> <b>synthase</b> had a significantly reduced turnover number (kcat) of 8. 2 × 10 − 3 s− 1 and an increased Km of 730 μm for AdoMet, leading to an 8, 000 -fold decrease in overall catalytic efficiency compared with the control enzyme.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to study changes in plasma leptin concentration parallel {{to changes in the}} gene expression of lipogenic- and lipolytic-related genes in adipose tissue of dairy cows around parturition. Subcutaneous fat biopsies were taken from 27 dairy cows in week 8 antepartum (a. p.), on day 1 postpartum (p. p.) and in week 5 p. p. Blood samples were assayed for concentrations of leptin and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA). Subcutaneous adipose tissue was analysed for mRNA abundance by real-time qRT-PCR encoding for leptin, adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR 1), adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR 2), hormones-sensitive lipase (HSL), perilipin (PLIN), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), acyl-CoA synthase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL 1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (<b>ACC),</b> fatty acid <b>synthase</b> (FASN) and glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GPD 2). Body weight and body condition score of the cows were lower after parturition than before parturition. The calculated energy balance was negative in week 1 and 5 p. p., with higher negative energy balance in week 1 p. p. compared with that in week 5 p. p. On day 1 p. p., highest concentrations of NEFA (353. 3 mumol/l) were detected compared with the other biopsy time-points (210. 6 and 107. 7 mumol/l, in week 8 a. p., and week 5 p. p. respectively). Reduced plasma concentrations of leptin during p. p. when compared with a. p. would favour increasing metabolic efficiency and energy conservation for mammary function and reconstitution of body reserves. Lower mRNA abundance of ACC and FASN expression on day 1 p. p. compared with other biopsy time-points suggests an attenuation of fatty acid synthesis in subcutaneous adipose tissue shortly after parturition. Gene expression of AdipoR 1, AdipoR 2, HSL, PLIN, LPL, ACSL 1 and GPD 2 was unchanged over time...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{performed}} to examine {{the response of the}} enzymes related lipid metabolism gene to hormonal stimulation in pig muscle tissue from finishing pigs. Longissimus dorsi muscle was collected and muscle tissue explants (approximately 100 mg) were prepared by sterile technique in finishing barrows (100. 5  5. 3 kg BW) of Rongchang. A in vitro system was established to investigate the regulation of Insulin (INS), Somatotropin (ST), Epinephrine (Epi) and Glucagon (GCG) on Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL), Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (<b>ACC),</b> Fatty Acid <b>Synthase</b> (FAS) and Hormone Sensitive Lipase (HSL) gene expression to determine whether there was any potential for the manipulation of the Intramuscular Fat (IMF) deposit in Longissimus dorsi muscle of pig. The experiment was conducted with an orthogonal design with a L 9 (3 4) and each treatment had three replicates. Results showed that ST significantly affected HSL and FAS mRNA abundance (p – 5 M, ST; 5 x 10 – 11 M, Epi; 1 x 10 – 6 M, GCG; 1 x 10 – 7 M, INS; 1 x 10 – 7 M, ST; 5 x 10 – 9 M, Epi; 1 x 10 – 6 M, GCG; 1 x 10 – 6 M, INS; 1 x 10 – 7 M, ST; 5 x 10 – 9 M, Epi; 1 x 10 – 6 M, GCG; 1 x 10 – 6 M) could increase IMF content by increasing LPL, ACC and FAS mRNA expression and at the same time, the combination of hormones (INS; 1 x 10 - 7 M, ST; 5 x 10 – 10 M, Epi; 1 x 10 – 7 M, GCG; 1 x 10 – 8 M) had higher IMF content by decreasing HSL mRNA expression. It could be concluded that the combination of hormones (INS; 1 x 10 – 5, ST; 5 x 10 – 9, Epi; 1 x 10 – 7, GCG; 1 x 10 – 8) could improve IMF content in finishing pigs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background High dietary protein {{can reduce}} fat {{deposition}} in animal subcutaneous adipose tissue, but {{little is known}} about the mechanism. Methods Sixty Wujin pigs of about 15 kg weight were fed either high protein (HP: 18 %) or low protein (LP: 14 %) diets, and slaughtered at body weights of 30, 60 or 100 kg. Bloods were collected to measure serum parameters. Subcutaneous adipose tissues were sampled for determination of adipocyte size, protein content, lipid metabolism-related gene expression, and enzyme activities. Results HP significantly reduced adipocyte size, fat meat percentage and backfat thickness, but significantly increased daily gain, lean meat percentage and loin eye area at 60 and 100 kg. Serum free fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations in the HP group were significantly higher than in the LP group. Serum glucose and insulin concentrations were not significantly affected by dietary protein at any body weight. HP significantly reduced gene expression of acetyl CoA carboxylase (<b>ACC),</b> fatty acid <b>synthase</b> (FAS) and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 c (SREBP- 1 c) at 60 kg and 100 kg; however, the mRNA level and enzyme activity of FAS were increased at 30 kg. HP promoted gene and protein expression and enzyme activities of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), carmitine palmtoyltransferase- 1 B (CPT- 1 B), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR γ) and adipocyte-fatty acid binding proteins (A-FABP) at 60 kg, but reduced their expression at 100 kg. Gene expression and enzyme activity of hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) was reduced markedly at 60 kg but increased at 100 kg by the high dietary protein. Levels of mRNA, enzyme activities and protein expression of ACC, FAS, SREBP- 1 c and PPAR γ in both LP and HP groups increased with increasing body weight. However, gene and protein expression levels/enzyme activities of LPL, CPT- 1 B, A-FABP and HSL in both groups were higher at 60 kg than at 30 and 100 kg. Conclusion Fat deposition in Wujin pigs fed high dietary protein for 25 weeks was reduced mainly by depression of lipogenic gene expression. The mechanism of lipid transport, lipolysis and oxidation in adipose tissue regulated by dietary protein appeared to be different at 60 kg and 100 kg body weights. </p...|$|R
