5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of}} the Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E

5|$|It {{was during}} this time that the entire sport of ski jumping {{underwent}} a significant transition in technique. Until the early 1990s nearly all athletes used the parallel style (or Däscher technique), in which the skis are held close together and parallel to each other. This had been the norm since the 1950s, with Matti Nykänen creating <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s with the skis pointed diagonally {{off to the side}} in a crude attempt to increase surface area, which yielded more distance. However, this came largely at the expense of stability and balance, akin to 'walking a tightrope' in mid-air and leaving athletes {{at the mercy of the}} elements. Akimoto, Findeisen, Berg, and Goldberger's accidents were all caused by unpredictable gusts of wind that made them lose control at the highest and fastest stage of their jumps, exacerbated by an outdated technique ill-suited to the new extremes of ski flying, as well as the prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes.|$|E

5|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{rate and}} extent of recovery. The {{prognosis}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome is determined mainly by age (those over 40 may have a poorer outcome), and by the severity of symptoms after two weeks. Furthermore, those who experienced diarrhea {{before the onset of}} disease have a worse prognosis. On the nerve conduction study, the presence of conduction block predicts poorer outcome at 6 months. In those who have received intravenous immunoglobulins, a smaller increase in IgG in the blood two weeks after administration is associated with poorer mobility outcomes at six months than those whose IgG level increased substantially. If the disease continues to progress beyond four weeks, or there are multiple fluctuations in the severity (more than two in eight weeks), the diagnosis may be chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which is treated differently.|$|E

25|$|The {{lingering}} {{symptoms of}} neuropathy associated with cerebral beriberi {{are known as}} Korsakoff's syndrome, or the chronic phase of Wernicke-Korsakoff's. Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder resulting from a deficiency in thiamine, sharing the same predominant features of cerebral beriberi, as characterized by ocular abnormalities, ataxia of gait, a global state of confusion, and neuropathy. The state of confusion associated with Wernicke's may consist of apathy, inattention, spatial disorientation, inability to concentrate, and mental sluggishness or restlessness. Clinical diagnosis of Wernicke's disease cannot be made without evidence of ocular disturbance, yet these criteria may be too rigid. Korsakoff's likely represents <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> clinical manifestation of Wernicke encephalophathy, as they both share similar pathological origin.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, {{the company}} Vidago, Melgaço e Pedras Salgadas was constituted, {{absorbing}} {{the capital of}} the Companhia Portuguesa das Águas Salus. Following their acquisition, a new analysis of the waters by professor Herculano de Carvalho, referred to the existence <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alkalinity in the two springs, that included magnesium, silica and carbon dioxide. Beginning in 1935, the clinical directorate began to employ a glycemic curves systematically as a method of investigating the effects of the water to diabetes sufferers. With consistente growth and visitors, {{at the beginning of the}} 1950s, there was a need to erect a specific building to shelter the water from the Prado spring, in order to substitute the wooden structure.

25|$|Analysis {{of catch}} returns from 1969 to 1985, {{showed that the}} fish caught most often by anglers were barbel, bream, bleak, carp, chub, dace, eel, gudgeon, perch, and roach. Over the study period the returns {{revealed}} that there was <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> species caught, with a shift from roach and dace based catches, to one of chub and bream, a change that was perceived by anglers to represent a ‘serious detriment’ to the fishery. This led to comments that the river had become ‘too clean for its fish’, and its popularity, especially for match fishing, declined from the mid 1980s. Competition from other fisheries such as well stocked ponds and lakes with better amenities and more consistent catches of fish also meant {{a reduction in the}} appeal of fishing the Trent.|$|E

25|$|Expression of MMP3 is {{primarily}} regulated {{at the level}} of transcription, where the promoter of the gene responds to various stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, and oncogene products. A polymorphism in the promoter of the MMP3 gene was first reported in 1995. The polymorphism is caused by <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of adenosines located at position -1171 relative to the transcription start site, resulting in one allele having five adenosines (5A) and the other allele having six adenosines (6A). In vitro promoter functional analyses showed that the 5A allele had greater promoter activities as compared with the 6A allele. It has been shown in different studies that individuals carrying the 5A allele have increased susceptibility to diseases attributed to increased MMP expression, such as acute myocardial infarction and abdominal aortic aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|Transducer {{technologies}} employed much less commonly for headphones include the Heil Air Motion Transformer (AMT); Piezoelectric film; Ribbon planar magnetic; Magnetostriction and Plasma-ionisation. The first Heil AMT headphone was marketed by ESS Laboratories and was essentially an ESS AMT tweeter {{from one of}} the company's speakers being driven at full range. Since the turn of the century, only Precide of Switzerland have manufactured an AMT headphone. Piezoelectric film headphones were first developed by Pioneer, their two models both used a flat sheet of film which limited the maximum volume of air that could be moved. Currently TakeT produce a piezoelectric film headphone which is shaped not unlike an AMT transducer but which like the driver Precide uses for their headphones, has <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> size of transducer folds over the diaphragm. It additionally incorporates a two way design by its inclusion of a dedicated tweeter/supertweeter panel. The folded shape of a diaphragm allows a transducer with a larger surface area to fit within smaller space constraints. This increases the total volume of air that can be moved on each excursion of the transducer given that radiating area.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{pronunciation}} of {{the first}} consonant of certain clusters, most commonly C or P in cç, ct, pç and pt. These consonants may be variably elided or conserved. For some words, this variation may exist inside a country, sometimes in all of them; for others, the variation is dialectal, with the consonant being always pronounced in one country and always elided in the other. This variation affects 0.5% of the language's vocabulary, or 575 words out of 110,000. In most cases, Brazilians variably conserve the consonant while speakers elsewhere have invariably ceased to pronounce it (for example, detector in Brazil versus detetor in Portugal). The inverse situation is rarer, occurring in words such as fa(c)to and conta(c)to (consonants never pronounced in Brazil, pronounced elsewhere). Until 2009, this reality could not be apprehended from the spelling: while Brazilians did not write consonants that were no longer pronounced, the spelling of the other countries retained them in many words as silent letters, usually when {{there was still a}} vestige of their presence in the pronunciation of the preceding vowel. This could give the false impression that European Portuguese was phonologically more conservative in this aspect, when in fact it was Brazilian Portuguese that retained more consonants in pronunciation.|$|E

500|$|Five other Armillaria {{species are}} found in Australia. Within the range of A.luteobubalina, A.hinnulea is {{restricted}} to gully habitats. A.fumosa is a rarer species found only in poorly drained or seasonally wet locations. A.luteobubalina and A.montagnei [...] share cap features and a similar unpleasant flavour, but the latter species has an olive-tinged cap, larger spores (9.5–11 by 5.5–7µm compared to 6.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5µm) and a more conspicuous annulus than those found in A.luteobubalina. The morphology of the vegetative structures of A.limonea is distinctly different than A.luteobubalina, {{and can be used}} to distinguish the two species. [...] A.novae-zelandiae has a sticky more flattened cap and stem below the ring and is found in wet forests, and A.pallidula is a species with cream gills maturing to pale pink found in tropical Australia arising from dead tree stumps or the roots of dead or living trees. A.luteobubalina is the only Armillaria species which occurs in Western Australia. Distinguishing Australian species is economically important, because A.luteobubalina is more pathogenic than {{the other members of the}} genus. A molecular diagnostic test, developed in 2002, can accurately identify each species using DNA extracted from its mycelia. Before this, species identification was limited to times when fruit bodies were in season. This technology also revealed <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> molecular material of A.luteobubalina that suggested sexual reproduction.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1950s, {{the courts}} {{commonly}} accepted {{that they could}} approve a [...] "compromise" [...] agreement {{where there was a}} dispute over the precise meaning of words in a trust document. In some cases, the courts used this to rearrange trusts for the benefit of certain parties (such as minors) where there was no real dispute. In 1954 however, the House of Lords decided in Chapman v Chapman [...] AC 429 that this power was reserved for a genuine dispute. This decision caused frustration: where previously all trusts could be varied, either through the court's ability to create a [...] "compromise" [...] agreement or the rights granted to trusts which came under the Settled Land Act 1925, Chapman limited this right to those created under the 1925 Act. In January 1957 the Lord Chancellor asked the Law Reform Committee [...] "to consider whether any alteration is desirable in the powers of the court to sanction <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trusts of a settlement in the interests of beneficiaries under disability and unborn persons, with particular reference to the decision in Chapman v. Chapman", and a report was presented to Parliament in November of that year. A draft bill was drawn up and introduced by Petre Crowder, the Member of Parliament for Ruislip-Northwood; it received its second reading in the House of Lords on 12 June 1958, and was given the Royal Assent on 23 July 1958.|$|E
