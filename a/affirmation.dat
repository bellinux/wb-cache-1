5|$|That same year, a {{group of}} liberal ministers {{composed}} a statement defending their theological views known as the Auburn <b>Affirmation</b> {{due to the fact}} that it was based on the work of Robert Hastings Nichols of Auburn Seminary. Citing the Adopting Act of 1729, the <b>Affirmation</b> claimed for the PCUSA a heritage of doctrinal liberty. It also argued that church doctrine could only be established by action of the General Assembly and a majority of presbyteries; therefore, according to the <b>Affirmation,</b> the General Assembly acted unconstitutionally when it required adherence to the five fundamentals.|$|E

5000|$|The Phoenix <b>Affirmations</b> {{take on a}} {{threefold}} structure, {{based on}} the Three Great Loves identified by Jesus and affirmed within Judaism: Love of God, Love of Neighbor, and Love of Self. (Matthew 22:34-40//Mark 12:28-31//Luke 10:25-28; cf. Deuteronomy 6:5; Leviticus 19:18)The Phoenix <b>Affirmations</b> {{are not meant to}} be a static set of principles to stand for all time. The authors attached a version number to them—currently 3.8—indicating that the <b>Affirmations</b> are the product of continual modification and may be amended in the future in light of new awareness and deeper understanding of what is believed to be God’s call. In contrast to a Creed, the <b>Affirmations</b> are not meant to serve as a test of faith against which a person’s Christian commitments are to be verified. Diana Butler Bass described the Phoenix <b>Affirmations</b> as follows: [...] "Together, they spell out the theological basis of Protestant liberality: being open and humble, yet grounded in the biblical story of God's dream for humankind." ...|$|R
50|$|Notaries in {{the state}} of New Jersey serve as {{impartial}} witnesses to the signing of documents, attests to the signature on the document, and may also administer oaths and <b>affirmations.</b> Seals are not required; many people prefer them and as a result, most notaries have seals in addition to stamps. Notaries may administer oaths and <b>affirmations</b> to public officials and officers of various organizations. They may also administer oaths and <b>affirmations</b> in order to execute jurats for affidavits/verifications, and to swear in witnesses.|$|R
5|$|After the 1920s, {{however, the}} church no longer {{required}} <b>affirmation</b> of these beliefs, allowing toleration for alternative {{interpretations of the}} Confession. By the 1940s, the dominance of liberal theology {{had given way to}} a neo-orthodox consensus within PCUSA seminaries, and this consensus would be maintained up to the 1958 merger. As a reaction against liberalism, neo-orthodoxy was characterized by an emphasis on divine transcendence rather than divine immanence, renewed <b>affirmation</b> of total depravity, and resistance to secularism and cultural accommodation within the church.|$|E
5|$|Hygeberht's {{contemporary}} at Canterbury, Æthelhard, was {{the first}} Archbishop of Canterbury to require an <b>affirmation</b> of faith from his subordinate bishops when they were elected.

5|$|In 1929, Princeton Theological Seminary was reorganized to {{make the}} school's {{leadership}} and faculty more representative of the wider church rather than just Old School Presbyterianism.

The purpose is not to deny the past, but not to indulge it as this is likely to cause negative thinking. By practicing <b>affirmations</b> and positive thinking, it is believed WFS members slowly change their habits and their thoughts become reality.|$|R

5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science.

5|$|Besides the {{architecture}} encompassing the oldest artworks in Croatia, {{there is a}} long history of artists in Croatia reaching to the Middle Ages. In that period the stone portal of the Trogir Cathedral was made by Radovan, representing the most important monument of Romanesque sculpture from Medieval Croatia. The Renaissance had the greatest impact on the Adriatic Sea coast since the remainder of Croatia was embroiled in the Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War. With the waning of the Ottoman Empire, art flourished during the Baroque and Rococo. The 19th and the 20th centuries brought about <b>affirmation</b> of numerous Croatian artisans, helped by several patrons of the arts such as bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer.

5|$|Burton {{points out}} that many {{conservative}} critics and magazines (John Simon, James Bowman, the World Report) initially either criticized the film or praised it only for its non-political elements. Only after {{the popularity of the}} film was well-established did conservatives embrace the film as an <b>affirmation</b> of traditional values. Burton implies the liberal-left could have prevented the conservatives from claiming rights to the film, had it chosen to vocalize elements of the film such as its criticism of military values. Instead, the liberal-left focused on what the film omitted, such as the feminist and civil rights movements.|$|E
5|$|The 1925 General Assembly {{faced the}} threat of schism over {{the actions of the}} Presbytery of New York. Attempting to deescalate the situation, General Assembly {{moderator}} Charles Erdman proposed the creation of a special commission to study the church's problems and find solutions. The commission's report, released in 1926, sought to find a moderate approach to solving the church's theological conflict. In agreement with the Auburn <b>Affirmation,</b> the commission concluded that doctrinal pronouncements issued by the General Assembly were not binding without the approval of a majority of the presbyteries. In a defeat for conservatives, the report was adopted by the General Assembly. Conservatives were further disenchanted in 1929 when the General Assembly approved the ordination of women as lay elders.|$|E

The film's English title for international release was mainly One's Own Choice, however it was shown at the Moscow International Film Festival under the title, On Own Will. Other translations of the Malayalam title have also been used, such as By Choice, Her Own Choice, Marriage by Choice, Betrothal by Choice, The Betrothal, and The Selection.|$|E

5000|$|The {{thirteen}} <b>affirmations</b> may {{be difficult}} for women to implement in day-to-day living, depending on their situations. For instance, women with limited financial resources many find it difficult to accept that [...] "problems bother her only to the extent she allows them." [...] Depressed women many find it difficult to make enthusiasm a daily exercise, or accept happiness as a habit to develop. Similarly positive thinking <b>affirmations</b> have been interpreted as asking women to deny their real feelings and inhibiting recovery. The applicability of the <b>affirmations</b> to female alcoholic's lives may limit the appeal of the WFS program.|$|R
5|$|Two {{enduring}} royal traditions {{emerged in}} Imerina {{as a consequence}} of the power struggle between Andriamasinavalona and his older brother. Some versions of oral history describe a combat between their armies at Ambohibato in which Andriamasinavalona emerged victorious. He erected a commemorative stone at the battle site that he named Ankazonorona, designating it the site where newly enthroned kings would stand to receive their first expression of hasina (homage, <b>affirmation</b> of authority) from their subjects. Andriamasinavalona also introduced the practice of gathering his subjects to consult them and obtain their consent before making certain decisions. This practice was continued by subsequent rulers in Imerina.|$|E
5|$|It thus {{appears that}} prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had {{abandoned}} the land; that the only adverse claim was vested in the mission of San Diego and made an absolute grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have. How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians? On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it an <b>affirmation</b> that they had abandoned their occupancy, and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was in the mission, and an absolute grant was made subject only {{to the rights of}} such mission.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures. It requires governmental searches and seizures {{to be conducted}} only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or <b>affirmation,</b> particularly describing {{the place to be}} searched and the persons or things to be seized. It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government, and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.|$|E
