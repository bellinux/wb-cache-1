40|$|Innovation is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} key factors that influence the long-term success of a company in the competitive markets of today. As a result, there is a growing interest in the further study of the determining factors of innovation. Today, the focus is on these factors related to people and behavior, emphasizing the role of organizational culture, as a factor that can both stimulate or restrain innovation, and therefore affect company performance. However, there is little empirical research linking these variables, particularly in the Spanish context. The purpose of this paper is to study these links by using a sample of industrial companies. The results show that culture can foster innovation, as well as company performance, or it could also be an obstacle for both of them, depending on the values promoted by the culture. It has been found specifically, that an <b>adhocratic</b> culture is the best innovation and performance predictor.

The purpose of this case {{study was to examine the}} implementation of inclusive educational practices for the delivery of special education services from an organizational and cultural perspective. Two interrelated perspectives were chosen as a framework. First, the change process was analyzed as a transformation along the professional bureaucracy and collaborative adhocracy continuum. Second, the implementation of inclusion was analyzed as a metaphor of competing values, the conflict between the quest for both excellence and equity. The interrelatedness of these two perspectives on successful implementation of inclusionary practices was at the heart of the study. Data was reviewed and organized into three analytical frameworks reflecting the research questions guiding the study: (1) How do the <b>adhocratic</b> organizational structures within a school community change when inclusionary practices for special education service delivery are implemented? (2) How does the level of conflict between the competing values of equity and excellence change when inclusionary practices for special education service delivery are implemented? (3) How are the key components for successful implementation of inclusionary practices perceived within a school organization?Analysis of the three research questions revealed a clear pattern. First, it was demonstrated that the preexistence of <b>adhocratic</b> characteristics in the school organization corresponded with the successful launching of inclusion and that these same characteristics appeared to solidify, and in some cases, expand with the evolution of inclusion. Next, the natural state of conflict between the competing values of excellence and equity was shown to be in a perpetual state of flux during the implementation of inclusion. While some manifestations of conflict were resolved with the growth of adhocracy, new forms of the conflict took root in later stages. Finally, a complex interaction between the growth of adhocracy, the conflict between excellence and equity and the identified factors of success in the implementation of inclusion was analyzed. The growth of adhocracy, while not able to entirely negate the conflict between excellence and equity, did appear to be a contributing factor in the reduction of many manifestations of the conflict between excellence and equity. This lessening of conflict then created a fertile cultural environment for the successful implementation of inclusion...|$|E

Secondly, we assess the ability of HRM professional to design a cooperative HRM configuration using a serious game (N= 40). By specifying configurational HRM to this level of detail, both the complexity and enormity of HRM configuration design become evident.

On a longer term there appears to be outside pressure in need of increased regulation which ICANN seems to respond to with amended bylaws and a more formalized multistakeholder model.

40|$|Purpose: The overall aim of {{this study}} is to obtain more {{knowledge}} about Human Resources (HR) work in supporting line managers and employees in the increasingly expanding consulting industry. The study aims to identify which support outsourced consultants mainly value from their employer in a specific consulting company, which is then compared to the consultant managers' perception of their work in providing consultants with support. The comparison should then provide a strategy for how the firm´s HR unit can advise the line managers concerning support to the consultants. Theory: The theoretical framework describes the challenges of personnel-related work in innovative organizations, bearing in mind the variable level of capacity and interest in personnel matters by consultant managers and the need for support. In order to illustrate and examine the types of support that can be identified in the statements by consultants and line managers, the categorization by House (1981) involving instrumental, informative, evaluative and emotional support has been selected for use. To ascertain the flexible conditions that can prevail in consulting firms, Mintzberg's (1989) theory of <b>adhocratic</b> organizational structures has been used to illustrate how outsourced consultants and line managers can experience a flexible structure and how these conditions can affect the supply of support. Method: This study is based on qualitative research, where a total of six semi-structured interviews have been conducted to collect empirical data. The data have been analysed by encoding, where the answers to questions at the interviews have been divided into four different categories, corresponding to House (1981). Results: The study's empirical results show that the consultants experience seek an improvement in mainly evaluative and emotional support, combined with a generally increased social interaction. Both consultants and line managers experience that instrumental support is a complex task. The distance between the two groups during the everyday working situation and the specialized character of the consultant’s competence give rise to a marginal understanding of the consultants' work by the line manager. As far as informative support is concerned, it appears that the confidence for the work by line managers, concerning business and personal affairs is satisfactory. This type of support seems to be catered for in the studied organization. In a broader context, this study highlights the complexity of providing support under the flexible working conditions that prevail in an <b>adhocratic</b> organizational structure. Based on previous research, two possible strategies have emerged for how HR can facilitate line managers to provide consultants with support. One strategy is to develop clear descriptions of responsibilities, where information is provided concerning when and how support can be conveyed to consultants. We also suggest that further development of the line managers’ role in a more HR-oriented context could be carried out...|$|E
40|$|Several {{researchers}} analyse organisational {{forms as}} an idealised historical evolution were new organisational forms builds on earlier established forms. These idealised theoretical approaches have {{the advantages of}} creating an overall understanding {{of the variety of}} organisations that can be observed at a given time. They also explain this variety with a simple evolutionary logic: New organisational innovations occur in established forms. If they prove competitive they will be imitated and, with time, new forms will emerge.   Hereby organisational development is not only a question of situational fit, but also due to historical dependencies. Different contributions observe different forms and give different theoretical explanations. This paper suggests an extensive framework of different organisation forms and links this framework to an elaborated theoretical analysis based on new institutional economics and other fields of organisation theory. The theoretical analysis is based on the four co-coordination mechanisms authority, rules, price and ideology. The organisational development is analysed as a stepwise development where forms develop from one level to another with time and increased scale. At the first level the Simple hierarchy  and the <b>Adhocratic</b> form is identified. At a second level the U-form and the Professional form follows. At the third level, the M-form and H-form of large enterprises are identified. Finally, at a fourth level a new form, the W-form, is identified. The development is explained by identification of situational factors and by the use of different co-ordination mechanisms. As the idealised evolution continuous, more sophisticated forms develop which modify and extend the use the co-ordination mechanisms of earlier forms...|$|E

As project complexity increases, so too does the need to do new things. The existing Project Management tools – examples being Earned Value Management, PRINCE 2, Lifecycle Management, PMBOK® – are incredibly useful; but they were designed for linear project development in a stable, understood environment. We term them 'First Order'. Second Order Project Management (PM) goes beyond, addressing the issues of a complex, unstable, uncertain environment with all its associated difficulties. Second Order PM has to address four major issues: the conspiracy of optimism, inappropriate contracting models, the application of methods and tools capable of dealing with complexity, and the need for creative, inspirational, <b>adhocratic</b> leadership. These problems are compounded by the need to convince executive sponsors from different disciplines to invest in the necessary process improvement – this book is designed to help alleviate the frustration that every member of the profession has experienced when trying to gain such approval. Illustrated by interviews with an international group of very senior managers responsible for managing highly complex projects, Michael Cavanagh explains why there is nothing magical, or even complicated, about Second Order PM. The techniques discussed include aspects of System Thinking, Experiential Learning and its application, Ethics and Governance, Stakeholder Relationships, Appropriate Contracting Models, Outcome-driven Management and Leadership Behaviour, all recognised as increasingly necessary in direct proportion to the complexity of the project at hand.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} practitioner {{research is}} set in a mixed, rural 11 - 16 Church of England Comprehensive School. It embraces reflective action enquiry into leadership and management of innovation in a turbulent period of national educational change. It is founded on the belief that if change processes are to be understood widely, practitioners must share experience emanating from reflective and analytical practice. This study is about "managing to learn" It embraces concepts of managing personal learning; managing colleagues' and students' learning; and managing processes leading to the emergence of the school as a "learning organisation" It is also about "learning to change" and espouses learning to promote personal change; learning to facilitate change in others; and learning to establish institutional change as a natural on-going characteristic of organisational life. This study is founded on a process of "reflection", as characterised by Schön (1983). Consequently, it employs a process of personal reflection on leadership roles in managing change and learning processes. It employs processes of reflection on cultural and political aspects of organisational life and resultant manifestations and implications of introducing, implementing, and institutionalising organisational and cultural change. This research utilises "refraction"- that is, convergence and divergence. Firstly, it promotes divergent and creative ways of organising which encourage and facilitate innovative processes. Secondly, it employs processes of converging, focusing, and concentrating on taken-for-granted "critical incidents" {{in the life of a}} developing school, to elicit meanings of events as understood by participants. Thirdly, it applies cultural and political prisms to school organisation, together with autocratic, bureaucratic, <b>adhocratic,</b> and reticular-democratic lenses in order to elucidate important cultural, political and organisational data.

40|$|More than ever, {{education}} organisations {{are experiencing}} {{the need to}} develop new services and processes to satisfy expanding and changing customer needs and to adapt to the environmental changes and continually tightening economic situation. Innovation has been found in many studies to have {{a crucial role in the}} success of an organisation, both in the private and public sectors, in formal education and in manufacturing and services alike. However, studies concerning innovation in non-formal adult education organisations, such as adult education centres (AECs) in Finland, are still lacking. This study investigates innovation in the non-formal adult education organisation context from the perspective of organisational culture types and social networks. The objective is to determine the significant characteristics of an innovative non-formal adult education organisation. The analysis is based on data from interviews with the principals and fulltime staff of four case AECs. Before the case study, a pre-study phase is accomplished in order to obtain a preliminary understanding of innovation at AECs. The research found strong support for the need of innovation in AECs. Innovation is basically needed to accomplish the AEC system’s primary mission mentioned in the ACT on Liberal Adult Education. In addition, innovation is regarded vital to institutes and may prevent their decline. It helps the institutes to be more attractive, to enter new market, to increase customer satisfaction and to be on the cutting edge. Innovation is also seen as a solution to the shortage of resources. Innovative AECs search actively for additional resources for development work through project funding and subsidies, cooperation networks and creating a conversational and joyful atmosphere in the institute. The findings also suggest that the culture type that supports innovation at AECs is multidimensional, with an emphasis on the clan and <b>adhocratic</b> culture types and such values as: dynamism, future orientation, acquiring new resources, mistake tolerance, openness, flexibility, customer orientation, a risk-taking attitude, and community spirit. Active and creative internal and external cooperation also promote innovation at AECs. This study also suggests that the behaviour of a principal is crucial. The way he or she shows appreciation the staff, encouragement and support to the staff and his or her approachability and concrete participation in innovation activities have a strong effect on innovation attitudes and activities in AECs...|$|E
40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} have {{become one of}} the main business strategies in the past decades. However, as the international experience indicates, the impact of mergers {{and acquisitions}} is rather ambiguous. On the one hand, mergers accelerate the evolution of organizations, strengthen their market positions and competitive advantages, create opportunities for the future development. On the other hand, mergers and acquisitions often lead to severe system crises, caused by various confrontations and risks. From the social and administrative point of view, mergers and acquisitions are commonly perceived as troublesome transformation processes instilling distrust and fear in the workers. Fear of the upcoming mergers is typical not only for ordinary employees, but also for senior management, who remains the most vulnerable unit in the M&A process. Mergers are considered as a stress and challenge for all the categories of employees. The employees realize the instability and the vulnerability of their current statuses, the limited ability to influence the situation and job insecurity. The uncertainty and fear lead to the employees’ resistance of different kinds, which eventually destroys the corporate unity, exacerbates the contradictions between various groups of employees and destabilizes the operation of companies. The authors assume that in the post-industrial age the employees’ perceptions of the merger processes can change and study the trends and factors which determine employees’ attitude towards mergers and acquisitions. Nowadays management strategies and the logic of administrative processes change radically, the structure of companies and the relationships in organizations networks undergo crucial transformations. The tendency to the democratization of organizations has received widespread recognition; companies become more flexible and are more frequently perceived and operate as open systems. The companies start to use the project management structures and the <b>adhocratic</b> corporate culture is formed. All these chances allow to avoid various typical problems during the course of mergers and acquisitions and creating favorable starting conditions for the association. The authors stress the following features of modern organizations: contractual relations between employers and employees, minimization of the bureaucratic procedures and formal reports, the democratic governance, the authority and responsibility delegation and the profit sharing. The company staff, being organized into self-managing teams and possessing high level of competence, is not only better protected in the course of associations, but also has greater development opportunities. Due to these factors mergers and acquisitions are no longer associated with solely negative consequences and cause fear and active resistance of the staff; they start to be perceived as a change of the activity context which can lead to positive results. </p...|$|E
