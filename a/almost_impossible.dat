5|$|Some American {{alligators}} {{are missing}} an inhibited gene for melanin, {{which makes them}} albino. These American alligators are extremely rare and <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to find in the}} wild. They could only survive in captivity, as they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators.|$|E
5|$|The Treaties of 1823 and 1826, {{although}} fraudulent {{at their}} roots, {{were allowed to}} stand. The legal obstacles to Indian land suits at the time made it <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to obtain redress until monetary compensation was awarded the Senecas under the Indian Claims Commission in the late 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E

5|$|A {{medical report}} {{documented}} that wearing an underwire bra in the Tropics, specifically East Africa, {{can lead to}} severe furuncular myiasis of the breast caused by the Tumbu fly. The eggs and larvae from this fly are deposited in clothing, especially {{along the length of}} the metal wires of an underwire bra, and can only be killed by applying heat through ironing. It is <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> when ironing a traditional underwire bra to achieve the required heat to kill the larvae deposited along the underwire.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{took place}} over several days at Music Bank, the famous {{rehearsal}} studios in London. Actor Michael spent forty hours practising the drumming beforehand, but with vision inside the suit limited to a camera feed piped to a small screen inside the head, precision was <b>almost</b> <b>impossible.</b> Many takes ended with the wooden drum sticks broken against the rims, sending shards of wood flying off-camera. This, combined with the difficulty of choreographing the delicate movements of the gorilla head with Michael's acting, meant that 35takes were required to produce the final 90-second scene.|$|E
5|$|The first {{combination}} {{flew through}} poor weather conditions {{and managed to}} reach Norway and fly towards its objective. During the flight over Norway the Rebecca receiver, {{which was supposed to}} pick up the transponder signal from the Eureka beacons being used by the Norwegian SOE agents, developed a mechanical problem and was unable to pick up the signal. This left the aircrew with only map-reading available to locate the landing zone, but the poor weather made this <b>almost</b> <b>impossible.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles {{led him to}} make the player character's death <b>almost</b> <b>impossible,</b> which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} six well-situated and {{developed}} redoubts {{making up the}} strong Ottoman garrison position at Magdhaba reflected considerable planning; the redoubts were <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to locate on the flat ground {{on both sides of}} the Wadi el Arish. Clearly, the move of the Ottoman garrison from El Arish had not been a sudden, panicked reaction; indeed it was first noticed by Allied aerial reconnaissance planes as early as 25 October.|$|E
5|$|The storm made {{launching}} the lifeboats <b>almost</b> <b>impossible.</b> At about 3:00am, Captain Pearce ordered the two port lifeboats lowered, each with four crew on board. While being passed astern {{one of the}} boats broke the painter and became adrift. Her crew tried hard to {{pull up to the}} ship's side, but it was impossible in the heavy squall. The other was accidentally let go and both boats, in heavy seas, were unable to be retrieved.|$|E
50|$|The musicians gelled so {{well that}} talk began early on of future collaborations. With everyone's ever-changing schedules, it <b>almost</b> seemed <b>impossible,</b> that is, until {{a few months ago}} when the Cerzosie {{brothers}} reached out to everyone with a common break in schedules coinciding mid-May. With a brief break in Sevendust's current tour schedule and Candlebox finally lightening their dates after their successful 20th Anniversary Tour, everything finally fell into place.|$|R
60|$|The slender, wickedly {{delicate}} blades clashed together, {{and after}} a momentary glizade were whirling, swift and bright as lightnings, and <b>almost</b> as <b>impossible</b> to follow with the eye. The Marquis led the attack, impetuously and vigorously, and almost at once Andre-Louis {{realized that he had}} to deal with an opponent of a very different mettle from those successive duellists of last week, not excluding La Motte-Royau, of terrible reputation.|$|R
50|$|The Lost Highway deal did {{not come}} to be, however, as the band's {{representative}} at the label was fired and things subsequently fell through. The Sinners still had an opening slot on Lucinda Williams' ongoing tour, a slot that was fairly open-ended. Without a label backing them up, however, it was <b>almost</b> financially <b>impossible</b> for The Sinners to hit the road. Instead, Ford accepted an invitation to join Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, relegating The Sinners to an indefinite hiatus.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} hull and a gunner and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be <b>almost</b> <b>impossible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Josquin's motets {{use some}} kind of {{compositional}} constraint on the process; they are not freely composed. Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard and appreciated as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E
5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E

25|$|Building across Kansas {{and eastern}} Colorado was simple, with few natural {{obstacles}} (certainly {{fewer than the}} railroad was to encounter further west), but the railroad found it <b>almost</b> economically <b>impossible</b> because of the sparse population. It set up real estate offices {{in the area and}} promoted settlement across Kansas on the land that was granted to it by Congress in 1863. It offered discounted fares to anyone who traveled west to inspect land; if the land was purchased, the railroad applied the passenger's fare toward the price of the land.|$|R
40|$|It is <b>almost</b> an <b>impossible</b> {{assignment}} to treat, {{in a single}} paper, in a competent and satisfactory manner, so difficult and complex a subject as South Africaâ€™s racial policy; and {{the magnitude of the}} assignment is only matched by what could perhaps justifiably be called the unforgivable presumptuousness {{on the part of a}} person who makes the attempt. I must therefore ask for your indulgence and tolerant understanding for the many examples of incompleteness â€” the many gaps, in time and in substance â€” that will undoubtedly be evident in this presentation...|$|R
5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. During high speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only the screws, Bismarck was <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to steer.|$|E
5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be <b>almost</b> <b>impossible.</b> Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
5|$|Hedley Verity (18 May 1905– 31 July 1943) was a {{professional}} cricketer who played for Yorkshire and England between 1930 and 1939. A slow left-arm orthodox bowler, he took 1,956wickets in first-class cricket {{at an average of}} 14.90 and 144 wickets in 40Tests at an average of 24.37. Named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1932, he is {{regarded as one of the}} most effective slow left-arm bowlers to have played cricket. Never someone who spun the ball sharply, he achieved success through the accuracy of his bowling. On pitches which made batting difficult, particularly ones affected by rain, he could be <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to bat against.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{influential}} {{example of such a}} calculation was carried out over a period of a few hours by Arnold Wilkins after being asked to consider a problem by Robert Watson Watt. Watt had learned that the Germans claimed to have invented a radio-based death ray, but Wilkins' one-page calculations demonstrated that such a thing was <b>almost</b> certainly <b>impossible.</b> When Watt asked what role radio might play, Wilkins replied that it might be useful for detection at long range, a suggestion that led to the rapid development of radar and the Chain Home system.|$|R

[...] "The whol {{face of the}} country was covered with herds of Buffaloe…" [...] explains Meriwether Lewis as written in his journal while crossing the Great Plains along the Missouri River. Lewis and Clark followed horses through impassable rapids since migrating horses are known to follow along rivers. The Rocky Mountains seemed as <b>almost</b> an <b>impossible</b> to climb, but as they followed migrating bison, they found passages and gaps that they would have never have found if it weren’t for migrating bison.|$|R
6000|$|And to {{do without}} [...] "chicken" [...] for dinner would seem <b>almost</b> as <b>impossible</b> for some folks. To be sure, we might live along very comfortably without those {{delightful}} broils, and roasts, and fricassees, {{but it would be}} a great pity. And, if we live in the country, there is no meat which is so cheap and easily procured all the year round as chicken. I wonder what country-people would do, especially in the summer time, when they have little other fresh meat, without their chickens. Very badly, I imagine.|$|R
5|$|In 1896, the National Association of Colored Women {{was formed}} to promote the needs of black women. Bethune served as the Florida chapter {{president}} of the NACW from 1917 to 1925. She worked to register black voters, which was resisted by white society and had been made <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> {{by a variety of}} obstacles in Florida law and practices controlled by white administrators. She was threatened by members of the resurgent Ku Klux Klan in those years. Bethune also served {{as the president of the}} Southeastern Federation of Colored Women's Clubs from 1920 to 1925, which worked to improve opportunities for black women.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> to hear a person speak.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{came in at}} {{the start}} of the second day's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added, before falling at 7/86, part of a {{collapse}} of 5/27. He hit two sixes in his innings, including one from the first ball that he faced, feeling that a defensive strategy would be <b>almost</b> <b>impossible</b> in the difficult conditions. Australia ended at 101, and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury. Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire, 6/51. Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings, which followed a similar pattern to their first effort. Wickets fell steadily as Johnston (6/18) and Miller (3/49) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs.|$|E
60|$|Another {{circumstance}} in {{that service}} is deserving of notice. Except {{in the highest}} parts of all, the emoluments of office do not in any degree correspond with the trust, nor {{the nature of the}} office with its name. In other official systems, the style, in general, is above the function; here it is the reverse. Under the name of junior merchant, senior merchant, writer, and other petty appellations of the counting-house, you have magistrates of high dignity, you have administrators of revenues truly royal, you have judges, civil, and in some respects criminal, who pass judgment upon the greatest properties of a great country. The legal public emoluments that belong to them are very often so inadequate to the real dignity of the character, that it is <b>impossible,</b> <b>almost</b> absolutely <b>impossible,</b> for the subordinate parts of it, which, though subordinate, are stations of power, to exist, as Englishmen, who look at a fortune to be enjoyed at home as their ultimate object, and to exist in a state of perfect incorruption in that service.|$|R

500|$|When the {{suspension}} bridge fell in 1869, {{the idea of}} a new bridge was discussed at length. [...] The initial project dates from 1875, which proposed that the new bridge had accompanying rail tracks, and that it be built on the remaining foundations of {{the suspension}} bridge, using scaffolding. Actually, given the height of the bridge and the river's depth and current, scaffolding is <b>almost</b> technically <b>impossible</b> to implement. In the final project from 1878, a jetting alternative was offered, despite very few companies mastering the technique at the time. The problem of fitting rail tracks, which was later abandoned, delayed the project.|$|R
