40|$|Abstract — Disulfiram-induced {{hepatotoxicity}} is a recognised entity {{despite the}} difficulty in determining its contribution to the damage when alcoholism itself is a frequent cause of liver disease. Less well characterised is the mechanism of disulfiram-induced hepatotoxicity and the high fatality rate associated with this entity. The clinical spectrum of the disease is reviewed and experimental data suggesting the mechanism of toxicity are presented. Failure to recognise this problem and to terminate therapy {{as soon as possible}} may result in death due to massive hepatic necrosis. Disulfiram, tetramethylthiuram, was fortu-itously noted to sensitise to alcohol in 1937 (Williams, 1937). Subsequently, articles in 1948 discussed the syndrome occurring upon exposure to <b>alcohol</b> after <b>ingestion</b> of disulf-iram (Hald and Jacobsen, 1947) and the first clinical trial in alcoholics (Martensen-Larsen, 1947).

30|$|Tremor, {{primarily}} of the hands, {{is among the}} most common lithium side effects, seen in approximately one quarter of treated patients (Gelenberg and Jefferson 1995). Lithium tremor is generally symmetric and is indistinguishable from essential or physiologic tremor.

Patients treated with D 2 blockers and lithium may present with a complex tremor from multiple etiologies. The severity of lithium-induced tremor is additive to other forms of physiologic tremor from etiologies such as anxiety, <b>alcohol</b> withdrawal, caffeine <b>ingestion</b> or idiopathic, familial tremor.

Objectives: To explore cognitive and psychological functioning in users who intentionally ingest alcohol gel compared with ethyl-alcohol only misusers and controls. Methods: Male, Central and Eastern European alcohol only misusers, (n= 14; mean age 39 years), alcohol gel users (n= 14; mean age 43 years) and controls (n= 12; mean age 31 years) were recruited from a London Homeless Service during 2013 / 14. Alcohol misusers, alcohol gel users and controls were compared on the Forwards and Backwards Digit Span Test; Block Design test; Retrospective and Prospective Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ) and the Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Alcohol gel users performed significantly worse on the Block Design task (p< 0. 01) and PRMQ (p< 0. 01) relative to both alcohol only and control groups, and significantly worse on the digit span relative to controls (p= 0. 01). Both alcohol misusing groups scored comparatively on digit span backwards (p< 0. 01), with both groups performing significantly worse than controls.

40|$|Abstact Neuronal {{refinement}} and stabilization are {{hypothesized to}} confer resilience to poor decision-making and addictive-like behaviors, such as excessive ethanol drinking and dependence. Accordingly, structural abnormalities {{are likely to}} contribute to the appearance of alcohol withdrawal signs and symptoms, that occur from suddenly ceasing the use of <b>alcohol</b> after chronic <b>ingestion,</b> thus perpetuating the addictive cycle. Here we show that ethanol dependent rats display a loss of dendritic spines in medium spiny neurons of the Nacc, accompanied by a reduction of TH-positive terminals and PSD- 95 positive elements.

These changes are restricted to the withdrawal phase of ethanol dependence suggesting their relevance in the genesis of signs and/or symptoms affecting ethanol withdrawal, and thus the whole addicting cycle. Overall these results highlight the importance of spine function on the evolution of alcohol dependence and suggest that the selective loss of ‘long thin’ spines may affect learning dysfunctions and significantly contribute to further ‘impoverish’ the already deficient dopaminergic transmission whose hypofunctionality is a major factor for the emergence of the harmful consequences of alcohol abuse/dependence...|$|R
