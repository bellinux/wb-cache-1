On Day 33, Big Brother told Kris to remain silent until 2 a.m. as punishment for discussing nominations or automatically face the public vote. He failed to keep quiet and faced eviction. On Day 37, he was evicted with 63% of the public vote.|$|E

5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} <b>a</b> <b>ringing,</b> it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear {{to be coming from}} one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E

5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and encounters with predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is <b>a</b> <b>ringing</b> pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E
5|$|The poem is {{described}} as a poem of water and hope. It begins with images of the sea, water, and of Eliot's past; this water later becomes a metaphor for life and how humans act. This transitions into an image of <b>a</b> <b>ringing</b> bell and a discussion on time and prayer. Images of men drowning dominate the section before leading into how science and ideas on evolution separate mankind from properly understanding the past. This ends with Krishna stating that the divine will, and not future benefits or rewards, matters. The fourth section is a prayer to the Virgin Mary for fishermen, sailors, and the drowned.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three days, the group {{undertook}} a series of tasks by which they could earn the right to become housemates. The remaining non-housemates were instructed to change into a special uniform. Anyone not obeying would lose {{the opportunity to become}} a housemate. Lisa gained housemate status {{in the early hours of}} Day 2 when she answered <b>a</b> <b>ringing</b> phone in the living room. Given 15 minutes to select the fourth housemate, she chose Kris. Charlie and Saffia later became housemates after walking barefoot over broken sugar glass, believing it to be real glass, and Karly became the seventh housemate after being tricked into believing that she had a motorbike ridden over her stomach. Freddie and Sophie became housemates after changing their names, documented by deed poll to Halfwit and Dogface respectively. On Day 3 Cairon earned housemate status by dunking a biscuit in a cup of tea for 25.5 seconds without it disintegrating. Remaining non-housemates Angel, Beinazir, Marcus, Siavash, Sophia and Sree faced the public vote on Day 4 to determine which five would become housemates and which one would be evicted. With 6.8% of a vote to save, Beinazir became the first evictee without ever becoming a housemate.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{trade-off}} between the amplifying {{effect of the}} resonators {{and the length of}} sustain of <b>a</b> <b>ringing</b> bar. The energy in <b>a</b> <b>ringing</b> bar comes from the initial mallet strike, and that energy can either be used to make the bar ring louder initially, or not as loudly but {{for a longer period of}} time. This is not an issue with marimbas and xylophones, where the natural sustain time of the wooden bars is short, but vibraphone bars can ring for many seconds after being struck, and this effect is highly desirable in many circumstances. Therefore, the resonators in a vibraphone are usually tuned slightly off-pitch to create a balance between loudness and sustain.|$|E

30|$|Advantages of {{the hollows}} on fingers are as follows: {{prevention}} of ring deformation, geometrical restriction of <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> part, giving optimal mating force to <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> part. The first advantage is prevention of <b>ring</b> deformation. <b>A</b> <b>ring</b> part {{held by a}} robotic hand is deformed by grip force. This means that a clearance between <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> part and <b>a</b> shaft part disappears. On the other hand, <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> closed by hollows of fingers does not receive grip force. Therefore, the proposed method {{can be applied to}} any material rings. The second advantage is geometrical restriction of <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> part. <b>A</b> position and an angle of <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> part are restricted by the hollows of fingers. The successful condition of ring assembly θ<θ _m in the previous section is satisfied by the hollows of fingers. This means that <b>a</b> <b>ring</b> part can be assembled without jamming.|$|R

25|$|The Hungarian participle pengő means 'ringing' (which in turn {{derives from}} the verb peng, an onomatopoeic word {{equivalent}} to English 'ring') and was used from the 1517th century to refer to silver coins making <b>a</b> <b>ringing</b> sound when struck on a hard surface, thus indicating their precious metal content. (The onomatopoeic word used for gold coins is csengő, an equivalent of English 'clinking' meaning a sharper sound; the participle used for copper coins is kongó meaning a deep pealing sound.) After the introduction of forint paper money in Hungary, the term pengő forint was {{used to refer to}} forint coins literally meaning 'ringing forint', figuratively meaning 'silver forint' or 'hard currency'.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on local}} tissue {{concentrations}} of local anesthetics, excitatory or depressant {{effects on the}} central nervous system may occur. Initial symptoms suggest some form of central nervous system excitation such as <b>a</b> <b>ringing</b> in the ears (tinnitus), a metallic taste in the mouth, or tingling or numbness of the mouth. As the concentration rises, a relatively selective depression of inhibitory neurons results in cerebral excitation, which may lead to more advanced symptoms include motor twitching in the periphery followed by grand mal seizures. A profound depression of brain functions occurs at higher concentrations which may lead to coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Such tissue concentrations may be due to very high plasma levels after intravenous injection of a large dose. Another possibility is direct exposure of {{the central nervous system}} through the cerebrospinal fluid, i.e., overdose in spinal anesthesia or accidental injection into the subarachnoid space in epidural anesthesia.|$|E
