40|$|Summary. This paper studies {{finite element}} methods {{for a class}} of <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> models. For both {{standard}} and mixed methods, existence and uniqueness results are proved, optimal rates of convergence are obtained and the superconvergence property is established. Reduced integration is shown to be an efficient method for <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> problems and selected reduced integration {{is found to be}} identical to the mixed method. The significance of the analysis is threefold. The mixed method and the reduced integration methods converge uniformly at the optimal rate with respect to the arch thickness parameter, so they are locking free. Second, mixed method and reduced integration keep the superconvergence properties of the standard method. Finally, this is the first attempt to investigate the superconvergence of finite element methods for <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> problems.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} experimentally, theoretically, and numerically a wide-range tunability of electrothermally actuated MEMS arch beams. The beams {{are made}} of silicon and are intentionally fabricated with some curvature as in-plane shallow arches. Analytical results based on the Galerkin discretization of the Euler Bernoulli beam theory are generated and compared to the experimental data and results of a multi-physics finite-element model. A good agreement is found among all the results. The electrothermal voltage is applied between the anchors of the clamped-clamped MEMS <b>arch</b> <b>beam,</b> generating a current that passes through the MEMS <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> and controls its axial stress caused by thermal expansion. When the electrothermal voltage increases, the compressive stress increases inside the <b>arch</b> <b>beam.</b> This leads to increase in its curvature, thereby increases the resonance frequencies of the structure. We show here that the first resonance frequency can increase up to twice its initial value. We show also that after some electro-thermal voltage load, the third resonance frequency starts to become {{more sensitive to the}} axial thermal stress, while the first resonance frequency becomes less sensitive. These results can be used as guidelines to utilize arches as wide-range tunable resonators...|$|E

The concept relies on the inherent quadratic nonlinearity originating from the arch curvature, which results in a softening behavior that creates hysteresis and co-existing states of motion. Since it is independent of the electrostatic force, this nonlinearity gives more flexibility in the operating conditions and allows for lower actuation voltages.

To demonstrate this concept, we study electrothermally tuned and electrostatically driven MEMS initially curved resonators. Applying electrothermal voltage heats up the beams and then increases their curvature (stiffness) and controls their resonance frequencies. While changing the electrothermal voltage, we demonstrate high frequency tunability of arc resonators compared to the cosine-configuration resonators for the first and third resonance frequencies. For arc beams, we show that the first resonance frequency increases up to twice its fundamental value and the third resonance frequency decreases until getting very close to the first resonance frequency triggering the veering phenomenon.

40|$|One of the {{critical}} missions for bridge structural health monitoring (SHM) {{is to provide a}} reliable assessment technique to potential hazards caused by structural damage or other structural defects using continuously monitored vibration data. Recognising the needs and shortcomings of SHM, a project was established by NICTA, the University of Technology Sydney and The University of Sydney to develop reliable damage detection methods to provide robust and accurate assessment techniques for critical bridge infrastructure in Australia. This paper presents the progress of research and development of a vibration-based damage detection technique and its experimental validation in the laboratory. The proposed technique uses residual frequency response functions (FRFs) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) to form damage specific features (DSFs) that are incorporated in pattern recognition using artificial neural networks (ANNs). In the method, FRFs are obtained using modal analysis techniques and damage is identified using ANNs that innovatively map the DSF to damage characteristics, such as damage location and severity.

40|$|An {{adaptive}} tuned {{vibration absorber}} (ATVA) with a smart variable stiffness element {{is capable of}} retuning itself {{in response to a}} time-varying excitation frequency, enabling effective vibration control over a range of frequencies. This paper discusses novel methods of achieving variable stiffness in an ATVA by changing shape, as inspired by biological paradigms. It is shown that considerable variation in the tuned frequency can be achieved by actuating a shape change, provided that this is within the limits of the actuator. A feasible design for such an ATVA is one in which the device offers low resistance to the required shape change actuation while not being restricted to low values of the effective stiffness of the vibration absorber. Three such original designs are identified: (i) A pinned–pinned <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> with fixed profile of slight curvature and variable preload through an adjustable natural curvature; (ii) a vibration absorber with a stiffness element formed from parallel curved beams of adjustable curvature vibrating longitudinally; (iii) a vibration absorber with a variable geometry linkage as stiffness element.

At the non-complete extraction stage, the periodic pressure from the main roof is mainly caused by the combination impact or individual impact from the broken cantilever beam roof in the irregular caving zone, and the broken or overturned overlying beam roof fixed at the two ends. But at the complete extraction stage, the periodical pressure from the main roof is mainly caused by the periodical broken, overturn and unstable <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> roof in the regular caving zone. The strength of periodic pressure at the non-complete extraction stage is higher than that at the complete extraction stage. A case study on the roof movement of a LTCC face at the No. 4  mine in Yangquan, China, further described the roof movement at the two stages (Kang et al. 1997). Based on the movement characteristics of overlying strata at the LTCC face, Yan (1996) introduced a mechanical theory of limited deformation and proposed a balance structure of macro continuous “compressed arch beam” of overlying strata at the upper location.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the basic}} types of {{strength}} calculations is the calculation of limit equilibrium of constructions. This report describes new method for solving the problem of limit equilibrium. The rigid-plastic system in this method is substituted with an «equivalent» elastic system with specially constructed rigidities. This {{is why it is}} called the method of pseudorigidities. An iteration algorithm was developed for finding pseudorigidities. This algorithm is realized in a special software procedure. Conjunction of this procedure with any elastic calculation program (base program) creates a program solving rigid-plastic problems. It is proved, that iterations will be converge to the solution for the problem of limit equilibrium. The solution of tests show, that pseudorigidity method is universal. It allows the following: - to solve problems of limit equilibrium for various models (<b>arch,</b> <b>beam,</b> frame, plate, beam-wall, shell, solid); - to take into account both linearized and square-law fluidity conditions; - to solve problems for various kinds of loads (concentrated, distributed, given by a generalized vector); - {{to take into account the}} existing various of fluidity criteria in different sections etc. The iterative PRM process quickly converges. The accuracy of PRM is very high even in case of rough finite-element structuring.

40|$|In {{the present}} dissertation, {{displacement}} control systems for large span structures using cablenets are herein proposed. The system {{is based on}} cable supported beam nets with additional prestressing control of the support cables such as to optimize the structural behavior of the system: the passive control design problem leads to an optimal control problem for structures governed by variational inequalities. The optimal shape of a prestressing support cable in many cases leads to a Form-Finding problem of the structure. The analysis {{is based on the}} two-nodes-curved-cable-element where large displacements and large rotations occur. Therefore, a multi-span cable is a non-linear and flexible structure since every loading case defines a new equilibrium configuration for the system. Using a prestressing strategy, the configuration of the cable structure due to the permanent loading is final. The novel passive control system is based on prestressing cables mechanism where permanent loads are relieved by a first level prestressing cables set named (a) and moving loads together with excessive displacements are taken by an additional cablenet (b) depending on the form {{and the use of the}} structure. Several variations of these passive control systems using prestressing cables are herein proposed: 1) A combination of a horizontal straight beams and external prestressing supported cable connecting with vertical rods where sliding contacts occur between rods and the cable. 2) A set of cables named (β) is used. This set has the same form with the cables of set (α), they also fastened at the same points while freely sliding bearings are used as connection joints with the vertical rods of the structure. The peculiarity of the cables of the latter set in that they are not homogenous. They are composed of n number of initially prestressed rods surrounded with the cracked unilateral stiffness rod elements with different initial prestresses at each face of the polygonal line. The prestressed cable elements are connected with nonprestressed of small length cable elements of the same set (β), where are not activated during permanent loading because of the set (α) supported cables, but is only activated under the moving loading action. 3) A prestress strategy when set (α) cables supported a horizontal straight beam structure, such as the reactions of the cable at the sliding contacts with the vertical rods due to prestress are bigger than the action forces of the permanent loading at the upper side of the same vertical rods. The result of this strategy is a new equilibrium configuration of the beam structure in opposite direction of the moving loading action. 4) The unilateral Form-Finding of <b>arch</b> <b>beam</b> structures using cable configuration due to the nodal permanent loading, but with negative shape form. 5) Introduction of diagonal cable element with no contact at the middle of their length, to connect nodes of the upper beam structure and the corresponding (in diagonal direction) node of the set (α) cable. The diagonal cables are not prestressed, but in the case of moving loading action the one them is stretched and the other has no action due to no press occur in cable elements. 6) The use of small displacements at the moving end of beam or arch structure supported with set (α) cable, due to moving loading action. 7) In floating bodies model, the compulsion overtopping of natural waterline of the body by the use of stable anchorage to the bottom by four prestressed cable (or chain) elements. 8) A combination between several of the above systems to the same model. The proposed models for large space structures with several passive systems on it, such as the above eight cases, aim with the purpose to minimize the effects of moving loading action. In any case the proposed model has been fully numerically examined, by the use (2 -D) or (3 -D) linear and non-linear finite element models. Many examples of them are bridge structures with several free length spans and with different passive control systems of displacements against moving loads according DIN 1072 & Eurocode- 1. In the case of (3 -D) models some of the examples have been checked successfully with wind loading models. Additionally checks with excellent results gave the basic examples for bridge structures against seismic action with dynamic spectra analysis according Greek National Rules. The study presents new techniques for the design and construction of large span structures (such as bridges, long cover structures and as an extension of the passive prestress control method using cables and applications on floating bodies and structures). The scope of this work is to develop new models of large space structures where unilateral conditions occur minimizing moments action and respectively the necessary sections of the structural members. These type of structure minimize the seismic action on the bridge. The proposed models of large span structures lead to a safer and more economical method of construction with small disturbance to the natural environment. ...|$|E
