5|$|The 1894-S Barber dime {{is one of}} {{the great}} numismatic rarities, with a {{published}} mintage of 24 proof pieces. Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist, the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of worn-out coins, just enough to coin 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to sell them for a good price. According to the story, she spent one on a dish of ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.|$|E

Taylor's selection on the team was considered unusual for a team noted for its average-sized post players and fast-paced style of play and gave the mystics a completely different look. She did not compete in the Mystics Season opener against the Indiana Fever. Her absence was noted in the game as it was the only loss suffered by the Mystics.|$|E

Nicki Minaj was also someone who she would like to collaborate with on the album, but did not get the chance.

500|$|On 27 October 1912, Mawson {{outlined}} the summer sledging program. Seven sledging parties would depart from Cape Denison, surveying {{the coast and}} interior of Adélie Land and neighbouring King George V Land. They were required {{to return to the}} base by 15 January, when the Aurora was due to depart; any later, it was feared, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> trapped by ice. Bickerton was to lead one of the parties, which would use the air-tractor to haul four sledges and explore the coast {{to the west of the}} hut. Most of the parties left in early November, but Bickerton's Western party delayed until December, in the hope of avoiding the ferocious winter winds. Work on the air-tractor sledge was delayed by the fierce winds, and the first trial took place on 15 November, between the main base and Aladdin's Cave—a depot which had been established on the plateau above Cape Denison. The air-tractor reached a speed of , covering the , expedition member Charles Laseron recorded, [...] "in great style". Soon, the sledge began hauling cargo up the slope, laying depots for the summer sledging parties.|$|E

Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing {{they are not going}} to budge, she stands up to them and says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Amor Prohibido was {{recorded}} in its entirety at record producer Manny Guerra's studio in San Antonio, Texas and was engineered by house engineer Brian [...] "Red" [...] Moore. Pérez, wrote that the singer [...] "never complained about her mix or the sound onstage" [...] calling this [...] "rare" [...] among singers. He added that he never heard her say: [...] "I don't want to do that." [...] He said it was common for her {{to arrive at the}} studio during the album's production, [...] "hum her part a little", telling them not to worry about her because she will [...] "know what to do when [...] are ready to record", and then [...] "go off to shop at the mall." [...] Pérez said the band never [...] "had to ask [...] to change something in the studio" [...] as she [...] "track her vocals by herself, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the one who would request a second take" [...] in order to [...] "add little harmonies she'd create" [...] during recording. Former keyboardist of the group, Rena Dearman provided several songs she wrote to A.B., who requested some material from her. A.B. favored [...] "I'll Be Alright" [...] and wanted Selena to record the song for Amor Prohibido, which was rejected by EMI Latin because [...] "it didn't fit the mood of the album." [...] for which A.B. later told her it could be included in Selena's next Tejano recording. The band's production sequence remain unchanged for Amor Prohibido. Selena and the band recorded their parts in the studio after they had first perfected them during pre-production. A.B. would then arrange and mix them. It took two weeks for Selena to record the album's ten tracks.|$|E
500|$|Fever is {{considered}} to be a prominent example of Minogue's constant [...] "reinventions". The image she adopted during this period was described by Baker as [...] "slick, minimalist and postmodern", and it was seen as a step forward from the [...] "camp-infused" [...] tone of Light Years. Larissa Dubecki from The Age used the term [...] "nu-disco diva" [...] to describe Minogue during this period. Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club opined that Minogue's public image and her persona in her music videos [...] "presented herself as a mechanical muse whose every gesture snapped and locked into place with the sound of a vacuum seal". He further remarked that the singer's [...] "hygienic coo summoned a cool sort of cyborg soul, and her videos showed her gliding through sleek futurescapes, tonguing the sweet-and-sour tang of a techno kiss". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters felt that the simplicity of the album made it a [...] "classy piece of work" [...] and commented that Minogue's experience and choice of collaborators resulted in [...] "the thirtysomething Minogue upstaging soulless, brainless music by younger American pop tarts like Britney [...] and Christina [...] ". Robbie Daw from Idolator pointed out that Britney Spear's recording of her 2004 hit [...] "Toxic", Madonna's comeback album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), Paris Hilton's musical debut Paris (2006), and radio stations' shift towards playing [...] "more groove-oriented sounds" [...] all followed the release of Fever, although he admitted that [...] "we have no way of knowing whether Kylie Minogue's eighth studio album was directly responsible for these pop happenings". Chris True from AllMusic, in his biography of Minogue, commented that the release of the album and lead single [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] cemented her position as an international music icon, saying [...] "Her place in pop music history would be consolidated in 2001, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reintroduced to America after more than a decade as well".|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the stated}} {{intent of the}} levirate law as {{expressed}} in Deuteronomy is to provide an heir so that the deceased brother's name [...] "will not be obliterated from Israel" [...] (...) , such laws effectively provided protection for widows as well. At the time the Torah was written, if a woman {{did not have a}} husband because of widowhood, she had no one to provide for her any longer <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> disgraced, if not likely die of starvation. Children were also a means of continued provision, since they are commanded to care and show respect for the elderly as they move further along in years. A childless widow was without both means of provision. Although quite contrary to our modern day dilemmas, even becoming a second wife to a brother-in-law, as indicated in Deuteronomy 25:5-10, was better than living on the streets at the mercy of those around her. Under Torah, men had a responsibility to the women around them, which included life-sustaining provisions (i.e. food, shelter, and comfort). Those of honor were beholden to their responsibility to protect the defenseless.|$|E

God asked the man where he was. The man replied that he grew afraid when he heard God, and he hid because he was naked. God asked him who told him that he was naked and whether he had eaten the forbidden fruit. The man replied that the woman whom God put at his side gave him the fruit, and he ate. When God asked the woman what she had done, she replied that the serpent duped her, and she ate.
