40|$|Early {{detection}} of a refractive error and its correction are extremely {{important for the}} prevention of amblyopia (poor vision). The golden standard in the {{detection of}} refractive errors is retinoscopy – a method where the pupils are dilated in order to exclude accomodation. This results in a more accurate measurement of a refractive error. Automatic computer refractometer is also in use. The study included 30 patients, 15 boys, 15 girls aged 4 – 16. The first examination was conducted with refractometer on narrow pupils. Retinoscopy, followed by another examination with refractometer was performed on pupils dilated with mydriatic drops administered 3 times. The results obtained with three methods were compared. They indicate that in narrow pupils the autorefractometer revealed an increased diopter value in nearsightedness (myopia), the »minus overcorrection«, whereas findings obtained with retinoscopy and autorefractometer in mydriasis – cycloplegia, were much more accurate. The results were statistically processed, which confirmed the differences between obtained measurements. These findings are consistent with the results of studies conducted by other authors. <b>Automatic</b> <b>refractometry</b> on narrow pupils {{has proven to be a}} method for detection of refractive errors in children. However, the exact value of the refractive error is obtained only in mydriasis – with retinoscopy or an automatic refractometer on dilated pupils...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{determine}} {{relation between}} near work and myopia progression in student population. Causes of myopia occurrence are not sufficiently explained. Methods This retrospective-prospective, descriptive research included 100 students with verified myopia up to- 3 Dsph. Ophthalmo-logical examination and measurement diopter-hours variable (Dh) were done twice, {{in the period}} from January 2011 until January 2012. Results A multivariate regression analysis of impact on the difference of distance visual acuity without correction {{to the right and}} left eye and difference of <b>automatic</b> computer <b>refractometry</b> in cycloplegia of both eyes indicates that, diopter-hours variable (Dh) had statistically significant impact on increase of distance visual acuity difference (right eye OR: I measurement–Dh 1. 489, II measurement–Dh 1. 544, p< 0. 05; left eye OR: I measure-ment–Dh 1. 602, II measurement–Dh 1. 538, p< 0. 05) and <b>automatic</b> computer <b>refractometry</b> in cycloplegia (right eye OR: I measurement 1. 361, II measurement 1. 493, p< 0. 05; left eye OR: I measurement 0. 931, II measurement 1. 019, p< 0. 05) during both measurements. Conclusion Near work cause the increase of myopia. This research opened a perspective for other researches on the impact of near work on myopia.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the reliability of}} dipstick measurements of urine specific gravity (U-SG). METHODS: Fresh urine specimens were tested for urine pH and osmolality (U-pH, U-Osm) by a pH meter and an osmometer, and for U-SG by three different methods (<b>refractometry,</b> <b>automatic</b> readout of a dipstick (Clinitek- 50), and (visual) change of colour of the dipstick). RESULTS: The correlations between the visual U-SG dipstick measurements and U-SG determined by a refractometer and the comparison of Clinitek((R)) - 50 dipstick U-SG measurements with U-Osm were less than optimal, showing very wide scatter of values. Only the U-SG refractometer values and U-Osm had a good linear correlation. The tested dipstick was unreliable for the bedside determination of U-SG, even after correction for U-pH, as recommended by the manufacturer. CONCLUSIONS: Among the bedside determinations, only refractometry gives reliable U-SG results. Dipstick U-SG measurements should be abandoned...|$|R
