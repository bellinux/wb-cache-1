Soil exchangeable acid was positively correlated with exchangeable Al 3 +, and negatively correlated with pH, exchangeable Ca 2 +, exchangeable base amount and base saturation, which are the main factors affecting the soil exchangeable acid.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> in saline soils {{is limited by}} the difficulty in accurately separating soluble <b>cations</b> from <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations.</b> A method is examined for saline soils in which <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> are calculated as the total extractable cations minus the concentration of soil solution (soluble) cations. In addition, a further two standard methods were investigated, one which assumes the total soil extractable <b>cations</b> are <b>exchangeable,</b> the other utilises a pretreatment to remove soluble salts prior to {{measurement of}} the remaining (<b>exchangeable)</b> <b>cations.</b> After equilibration with a range of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) solutions at various ionic strengths, the <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations of two soils (Dermosol and Vertosol) were determined by these methods and compared to known values. The assumption that <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> can be estimated as the total soil extractable cations, although valid at low ionic strength, resulted in an overestimation of exchangeable Na and Ca concentrations at higher ionic strengths due to the presence of soluble salts. Pretreatment with ethanol and glycerol was found to effectively remove soluble salts thus allowing the accurate measurement of the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC), however, dilution associated with the pretreatment process decreased concentrations of exchangeable Ca while simultaneously increasing exchangeable Na. Using the proposed method, good correlations were found between known and measured concentrations of exchangeable Na (Dermosol: y= 0. 873 x and Vertosol: y= 0. 960 x) and Ca (Dermosol: y= 0. 906 x, and Vertosol: y= 1. 05 x).

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} prevalence of salinity world-wide, {{the measurement of}} <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations in saline soils remains problematic. Two soil types (Mollisol and Vertisol) were equilibrated {{with a range of}} sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) solutions at various ionic strengths. The concentrations of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> were then determined using several different types of methods, and the measured <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations compared to reference values. At low ionic strength (low salinity), the concentration of <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cations</b> can be accurately estimated from the total soil extractable cations. In saline soils, however, the presence of soluble salts in the soil solution precludes the use of this method. Leaching of the soil with a pre-wash solution (such as alcohol) was found to effectively remove the soluble salts from the soil, thus allowing the accurate measurement of the effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). However, the dilution associated with this pre-washing increased the exchangeable Ca concentrations while simultaneously decreasing exchangeable Na. In contrast, when calculated as the difference between the total extractable cations and the soil solution cations, good correlations were found between the calculated <b>exchangeable</b> <b>cation</b> concentrations and the reference values for both Na (Mollisol: y= 0. 873 x and Vertisol: y= 0. 960 x) and Ca (Mollisol: y= 0. 901 x and Vertisol: y= 1. 05 x).
