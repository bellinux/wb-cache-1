40|$|The {{automatic}} loading & unloading {{technology is the}} key to the <b>automatic</b> <b>ring</b> production line. In this paper, the <b>automatic</b> vertical hot <b>ring</b> rolling (VHRR) process is taken as the target, the method of the loading & unloading for VHRR is proposed, and the mechanical structure of loading & unloading system is designed, The virtual prototype model of VHRR mill and loading & unloading mechanism is established, and the coordinated control method of VHRR mill and loading & unloading auxiliaries is studied, the movement trace and dynamic characteristic of the critical components are obtained. Finally, a series of hot ring rolling tests are conducted on the VHRR mill, and the production rhythm and the formed rings' geometric precision are analysed. The tests results show that the loading & unloading technology can meet the high quality and high efficiency ring production requirement. The research conclusions have practical significance for the large-scale <b>automatic</b> <b>ring</b> production...|$|R

40|$|A novel all-fibre cavity <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> {{spectroscopy}} {{technique is}} proposed where a tilt fibre Bragg grating (TFBG) or long-period grating (LPG) in the cavity provides sensitivity to surrounding medium. Such configuration with an LPG as the representative was theoretically analyzed.

A TFBG, with enhanced sensitivity compared to usual LPGs, was used in a <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> cavity of 1 m constructed with 2 fibre Bragg gratings as the reflectors and the decay time changed from 220 to 450 ns when the TFBG was immersed into water from air...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{resonant}} microcavities with ultra {{high quality}} factors {{are widely used}} for biosensing. Until now, the primary method of detection has been based upon tracking the resonant wavelength shift {{as a function of}} biodetection events. One of the sources of noise in all resonant-wavelength shift measurements is the noise due to intensity fluctuations of the laser source. An alternative approach is to track the change in the quality factor of the optical cavity by using phase shift cavity <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> spectroscopy, a technique which is insensitive to the intensity fluctuations of the laser source. Here, using biotinylated microtoroid resonant cavities, we show simultaneous measurement of the quality factor and the wavelength shift by using phase shift cavity <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> spectroscopy. These measurements were performed for disassociation phase of biotin-streptavidin reaction. We found that the disassociation curves are in good agreement with the previously published results. Hence, we demonstrate not only the application of phase shift cavity <b>ring</b> <b>down</b> spectroscopy to microcavities in the liquid phase but also simultaneous measurement of the quality factor and the wavelength shift for the microcavity biosensors in the application of kinetics measurements...|$|R

This optimization problem is NP-hard. We develop two polynomial-time approximation algorithms, with performance guarantees between 1. 5 and 1. 6 and between 1. 5 and 1 5 +, respectively. The second algorithm can be adapted, with the same performance guarantees, to the problem in which lightpaths are not prespecified and only the endpoints of each connection are given. Both algorithms can be easily adapted, with the same performance guarantees, to the problem in which only link protection is desired, and each group must be carried in a closed trail.
