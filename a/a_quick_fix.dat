25|$|Though still {{a matter}} for debate, the {{indemnity}} deal has complicated the question of ultimate blame. For decades the Government and Department of Education were to blame for lack of oversight, {{various parts of the}} Catholic Church refused to reform internal systems, the police generally ignored complaints, and the courts sent small children to the institutions with little concern for their rights. The 2002 deal has appeared in hindsight to be a well-intentioned but unsatisfactory attempt at <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>fix.</b> In May 2009 CORI agreed to contribute more to the envisaged higher compensation amounts.|$|E
500|$|In 1924 a small pipehead dam {{was built}} [...] {{downstream}} {{from the present}} Canning Dam. It was only intended as <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> to the water supply problem and it soon became apparent that a major reservoir was needed, although it would be nine years before work on the current Canning Dam would begin. The new dam was completed in 1940 {{at a cost of}} AU£1.1million. Engineer Russell Dumas designed the dam and directed most of its construction.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of the Korean War, {{training}} populations at Lackland soared to 28 basic military training squadrons (BMTS) within the 3700th Military Training Wing. Temporary facilities, to include 129 [...] "I dormitories", were hastily erected as <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> to replace tents cities housing recruits. In 1955 the number of BMTS was reduced to 16, where it remained for the next two decades.|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} has been criticized as being a [...] "collection of imposing hyper-modern monumental structures, high-end chain stores, enormous video screens, expensive restaurants, a sports arena and tons of parking, completely isolated {{from the rest of}} the city by a pair of freeways [...] [...] [...] like the schizophrenic dream of some power-hungry capitalist technocrat." [...] However, other journalists have countered this criticism of New Urbanist principles, citing that developments like Victory Park build on a classic, centuries old formula and [...] "are not <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> but the slow weaving together of smart, sometimes big, often small, urban solutions" [...] to create viable and enduring community destinations.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{allegations}} that some diploma mills take students' money for essays, then produce a low standard essay or close their websites without providing the purchased essay. [...] Students then have {{little time to}} provide an essay before a deadline. [...] Also diploma mills have allegedly blackmailed students demanding more money than was originally agreed and threatening to reveal plagiarism to the university unless more money is paid.

2500|$|Daspit's cruise raised {{enough of}} an issue that tests were carried out by COMSUBPAC's gunnery and torpedo officer, Art Taylor. Taylor, [...] "Swede" [...] Momsen, and others fired warshots into the cliffs of Kahoolawe, {{beginning}} 31August. Additional trials, supervised by Taylor, used a crane to drop warheads filled with sand instead of high explosive from a height of [...] (the height was chosen so the velocity at impact would match the torpedo's running speed of 46 knots). In these drop tests, 70% of the exploders failed to detonate {{when they hit the}} target at 90 degrees. <b>A</b> <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> was to encourage [...] "glancing" [...] shots (which cut the number of duds in half), until a permanent solution could be found.|$|E
2500|$|To avoid [...] "shaking {{hands with}} St. Peter" [...] (as Lockwood put it), E.A.

Lightweight aluminum alloy (from propellers of Japanese planes shot down during the attack on Pearl Harbor) was machined {{to take the place of}} the Mark6's heavy pin block so inertial forces would be lower. Electrical switches, developed by Johnson, were tried as well. Both fixes worked and were relatively easy to implement. In September 1943, the first torpedoes with new contact pistols were sent to war. [...] "After twenty-one months of war, the three major defects of the Mark14 torpedo had at last been isolated. ...

[...] Upon accepting the South Alabama job, Graves stated that he would attempt to instill a style of play similar to Butler's. He said to expect [...] "very hard-nosed and tough" [...] defensive play and [...] "a defensive-oriented team". Graves said the offensive plan would change year-to-year based on player skill sets. He added that he will expect maximum hustle from his players at all times.|$|R
50|$|Clinical {{trials have}} shown the Hall Technique to be effective, however it is not <b>an</b> easy, <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> {{solution}} to the problem of carious primary molars. The technique is not suited to every tooth, child or clinician, however it can be an effective method of managing carious primary molars. Hall technique should not be used when there are clinical or radiographic signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpitis or dental abscess. Radiographically, there should be a clear band of dentine between the carious lesion and pulp for a Hall Technique to be suitable.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>a</b> {{technological}} <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> or 'magic-bullet' for control and elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) is flawed. NTDs are embedded within complex biological and social {{systems that are}} shaped by ecological and political contexts. This commentary emphasises the need for implementation research to address implementation gaps in the control of NTDs. With a specific focus on sub-Saharan Africa and helminth diseases amenable to preventive chemotherapy through mass drug administration, we explore {{the important role of}} context, programme partnerships and community in achieving equitable and effective NTD control...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{integrated}} development environments {{make recommendations}} and automate common tasks, such as refactorings, auto-completions, and error corrections. However, these tools present {{little or no}} information {{about the consequences of}} the recommended changes. For example, a rename refactoring may: modify the source code without changing program semantics; modify the source code and (incorrectly) change program semantics; modify the source code and (incorrectly) create compilation errors; show a name collision warning and require developer input; or show an error and not change the source code. Having to compute the consequences of a recommendation — either mentally or by making source code changes — puts an extra burden on the developers. This paper aims to reduce this burden with a technique that informs developers of the consequences of code transformations. Using Eclipse <b>Quick</b> <b>Fix</b> as <b>a</b> domain, we describe <b>a</b> plug-in, <b>Quick</b> <b>Fix</b> Scout, that computes the consequences of <b>Quick</b> <b>Fix</b> recommendations. In our experiments, developers completed compilation-error removal tasks 10 % faster when using <b>Quick</b> <b>Fix</b> Scout than <b>Quick</b> <b>Fix,</b> although the sample size was not large enough to show statistical significance.

25|$|As a result, <b>a</b> {{series of}} <b>quick</b> <b>fixes</b> {{followed}} {{to ensure that}} American forces would not be caught completely off guard {{in the event of}} war. More important was the sensitivity with which American officials now treated the nervousness of their European counterparts; the Americans now became more willing to take steps to boost morale in Europe and ease the now-widespread anxieties there. The coup and the Berlin Blockade that June made clear that constant reassurance was needed to bind the Europeans to the U.S. system; hence, the remobilization of U.S. armed forces began.|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{practical}} implementation of two innovative projects in Denmark and Sweden. The research {{is motivated by}} the high political interest for innovations as <b>a</b> modern <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> to societal problems. Innovations are regarded as an all-round solution; however, research has mainly been focused on technical and economical factors without considering social problem solving.

Faith is generally seen as {{an important element of}} innovations geared to social problem solving. Results shows that faith is bound to certain structural levels and that a given innovative process runs the risk of creating conflicting perceptions at different levels. The research demonstrates the importance of including components such as value differences, conflicts of interest, and ideology when promoting innovations and when studying innovative efforts...|$|R
