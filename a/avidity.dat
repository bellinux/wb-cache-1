We tested for associations between antibody <b>avidities</b> to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) antigens and age, asymptomatic parasitaemia, malaria exposure index (a distance weighted local malaria prevalence) and immunity to febrile malaria during 10 -months of prospective follow up. Cross-sectional antibody levels and <b>avidities</b> to Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA 1), Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (42) (MSP 1) and Merozoite Surface Protein 3 (MSP 3) were measured by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay in 275 children, who had experienced at least one episode of clinical malaria {{by the time of}} this study, as determined by active weekly surveillance. Antibody levels to AMA 1, MSP 1 and MSP 3 increased with age. Anti-AMA 1 and MSP 1 antibody <b>avidities</b> were (respectively) positively and negatively associated with age, while anti-MSP 3 antibody <b>avidities</b> did not change. Antibody levels to all three antigens were elevated in the presence of asymptomatic parasitaemia, but their associated <b>avidities</b> were not. Unlike antibody levels, antibody <b>avidities</b> to the three-merozoite antigens did not increase with exposure to Pf malaria. There were no consistent prospective associations between antibody <b>avidities</b> and malaria episodes.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The levels and <b>avidities</b> of anti-tau IgG antibodies were measured using ELISA in paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples obtained from 49 MS patients and 47 controls. Anti-tau antibodies were significantly elevated intrathecally (p, 0. 0001) in the MS group.

25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} {{are highly}} associated with glomerulonephritis in SLE, although some patients with high titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies do not develop renal disease. This {{is most likely}} {{due to the fact}} that anti-dsDNA are a heterogeneous population, some of which have been found not to be pathogenic. Anti-dsDNA antibodies can be present in normal individuals, however these antibodies are usually low <b>avidity</b> IgM isotype. In contrast, pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies found in SLE are usually of IgG isotype and show high <b>avidity</b> for dsDNA. One possible mechanism for anti-dsDNA and their role in nephritis is the formation of immune complexes that arise by indirect binding to DNA or nucleosomes that are adhered to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Another mechanism is direct binding of antibodies to GBM antigens such as C1q, nucleosomal proteins, heparin sulphate or laminin, which can initiate an inflammatory response by activating complement. They can also be internalised by certain molecules on the GBM cells and cause inflammatory cascades, proliferation and alteration of cellular functions.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{quantify}} and characterize antigen-specific CD 8 + T cells irrespective of functional readouts using fluorochrome-conjugated peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHCI) tetramers {{in conjunction with}} flow cytometry has transformed our understanding of cellular immune responses over the past decade. In the case of prevalent CD 8 + T cell populations that engage cognate pMHCI tetramers with high <b>avidities,</b> direct ex vivo identification and subsequent data interpretation is relatively straightforward. However, the accurate identification of low frequency antigen-specific CD 8 + T cell populations can be complicated, especially in situations where T cell receptor-mediated tetramer binding occurs at low <b>avidities.</b> Here, we highlight a few simple techniques that can be employed to improve the visual resolution, and hence the accurate quantification, of tetramer binding CD 8 + T cell populations by flow cytometry.

40|$|AbstractDuring most {{clinically}} relevant infections with cytopathic viruses, neutralizing antibodies {{are generated}} early, i. e., {{within the first}} week of infection. As early as 4 days after immunization of mice with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a cytopathic virus closely related to rabies virus, hybridomas could be isolated that secreted virus-neutralizing IgGs. Such antibodies were devoid of somatic mutations, showed high binding <b>avidities</b> (∼ 109 M− 1), and used V gene fragments predominantly belonging to the VHQ 52 and VK 19 – 28 families. In contrast, most secondary and hyperimmune response IgGs isolated 12 and 150 days after infection used several additional V gene combinations. These, which used the VHQ 52 /VK 19 – 28 combination of early IgGs, were point mutated but showed only marginally enhanced binding <b>avidities.</b> Since all VHQ 52 / VK 19 – 28 -positive IgGs bound to one subsite within the major antigenic site of VSV-G irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} somatic point mutations, fine specificity diversification of secondary and hyperimmune responses was achieved by newly appearing V gene combinations...|$|R

25|$|EIA (enzyme immunoassay) detects {{antibodies}} using a DNA-coated polystyrene microtitre plate. The DNA used {{in these}} assays is often recombinant dsDNA or from calf thymus extract.

This assay can be quantitative or semi-quantitative, allowing for estimations of the levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies. This test can produce false positives due to contamination of ssDNA from denatured dsDNA. EIA detects low and high <b>avidity</b> anti-dsDNA antibodies, increasing its sensitivity and reducing its specificity.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{established}} that polyvalency {{is a critical}} feature of cell surface carbohydrate recognition. Nevertheless, carbohydrate–protein interactions are typically evaluated by using assays {{that focus on the}} behavior of monovalent carbohydrate ligands in solution. It has generally been assumed that the relative affinities of monovalent carbohydrate ligands in solution correlate with their polyvalent <b>avidities.</b> In this paper we show that carbohydrate ligands synthesized directly on TentaGel beads interact with carbohydrate-binding proteins in a polyvalent manner. The carbohydrate-derivatized beads can, therefore, be used as model systems for cell surfaces to evaluate polyvalent carbohydrate–protein interactions. By using a combinatorial approach to synthesize solid-phase libraries of polyvalent carbohydrates, one can rapidly address key issues in the area of cell surface carbohydrate recognition. For example, studies reported herein demonstrate that there is an unanticipated degree of specificity in recognition processes involving polyvalent carbohydrates. However, the correlation between polyvalent <b>avidities</b> and solution affinities is poor. Apparently, the presentation of carbohydrates on the polymer surface has a profound influence on the interaction of the ligand with the protein receptor. These findings have implications for how carbohydrates function as recognition signals in nature, as well as for how polyvalent carbohydrate–protein interactions should be studied...|$|R

In resistant mice, MT 389 -specific CD 8 � T cells dramatically expanded during acute infection in neonates to a frequency rivaling that in adults; furthermore, in both neonatal and adult mice, this antipolyoma CD 8 � T cell response exhibited nearly identical T cell receptor (TCR) functional <b>avidities</b> and TCR functional fingerprints.

Since germinal centres are involved in antibody production and affinity maturation, the susceptibility of the TNF-�-deficient mice could have been due to this secondary defect.
