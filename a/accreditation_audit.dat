40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the role and impact of a central {{academic}} development unit (ADU) within an institutional strategic and operational change management project. The primary goal of this project was to improve vocational education and training (VET) learning and teaching practice in an Australian dual-sector regional university. This driver of this change management project was in preparation for an external <b>accreditation</b> <b>audit</b> with the Australia Skills Quality Authority (ASQA). This paper presents perspectives from the ADU director and a specific ADU team (six senior educators and nine administrative staff) employed for 16 months to enact partial project goals. The ADU director utilises narrative methodology to describe the enactment of the project at the ADU level within the context of Kotters 8 Step Change Model (Kotter, 2012). An open and closed item survey approach was used to capture the perceptions of the ADU team regarding demonstrated leadership, management and team functionality throughout the duration of the project. The survey data also captured their perceptions regarding the value placed on change management requirements and indicators and their most rewarding experiences throughout the project. This paper highlights challenges and key lessons for ADUs associated with change management in a dual-sector environment. It also highlights the importance of utilising a suitable change management framework to initiative, lead and support meaningful, sustained changes in the dual-sector education environmen...|$|E
30|$|Trust is a {{critical}} aspect of cloud computing. We examined and categorized existing research and practice of trust mechanisms for cloud computing in five categories– reputation based, SLA verification based, transparency mechanisms (self-assessment and information revealing), trust as a service, and formal <b>accreditation,</b> <b>audit,</b> and standards. Most current work on trust in the cloud focus narrowly on certain aspects of trust; our thesis {{is that this is}} insufficient. Trust is a complex social phenomenon, and a systemic view of trust mechanism analysis is necessary. In this paper we take a broad view of trust mechanism analysis in cloud computing and develop a somewhat informal and abstract framework as a route map for analyzing trust in the clouds. In particular, we suggest: (1) a policy-based approach of trust judgment, by which the trust placed on a cloud service or a cloud entity is derived from a “formal” audit proving that the cloud entity conforms to some trusted policies; (2) a “formal” attribute-based approach of trust judgment, by which particular attributes of a cloud service or attributes of a service provider are used as evidence for trust judgment, and the belief in those attributes is based on formal certification and chains of trust for validation. To support this mechanism, we propose a general structure of evidence-based trust judgment, which provides a basis to infer the trust in a cloud entity from the belief in the attributes that entity has, and in which, based on the semantics of trust, we define the attributes to be examined are in a space of two-dimensions – domain of expectancy and source of trust including competency, integrity, and goodwill.|$|E

40|$|Background: Public health {{laboratories}} {{form the}} {{foundation on which}} today’s clinical laboratory practice in Cameroon is built. The advent of the Strengthening Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation (SLMTA) programme in 2009 empowered the Bamenda Regional Hospital Laboratory (BRHL) to improve its working culture, practices and management. Objectives: To evaluate the results of SLMTA implementation at BRHL and discuss lessons learned. Method: In 2010, the SLMTA programme was rolled out in Cameroon to improve laboratory quality management systems in five laboratories, including BRHL. Three workshops were conducted (the first centralised, the remaining two on-site at each laboratory) and improvement projects were implemented after each workshop {{with the assistance of}} mentors. Audits were used in order to evaluate performance and to identify areas for further improvement. Results: BRHL had the lowest score (18 %) amongst the cohort at the baseline audit and the highest (81 %) at the official Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards <b>Accreditation</b> (SLIPTA) <b>audit</b> conducted in August 2013 by the African Society for Laboratory Medicine. Improvements were observed in each of the 12 Quality System Essentials; improvement was especially noteworthy in the areas of facilities and safety, and purchasing and inventory.

40|$|Background: Kenya has {{implemented}} the Strengthening Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation (SLMTA) programme to facilitate quality improvement in medical laboratories and to support national accreditation goals. Continuous quality improvement after SLMTA completion {{is needed to}} ensure sustainability and continue progress toward <b>accreditation.</b> Methods: <b>Audits</b> were conducted by qualified, independent auditors to assess the performance of five enrolled laboratories using the Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards Accreditation (SLIPTA) checklist. End-of-programme (exit) and one year post-programme (surveillance) audits were compared for overall score, star level (from zero to five, based on scores) and scores {{for each of the}} 12 Quality System Essential (QSE) areas that make up the SLIPTA checklist. Results: All laboratories improved from exit to surveillance audit (median improvement 38  percentage points, range 5 – 45 percentage points). Two laboratories improved from zero to one star, two improved from zero to three stars and one laboratory improved from three to four stars. The lowest median QSE scores at exit were: internal audit; corrective action; and occurrence management and process improvement (< 20 %). Each of the 12 QSEs improved substantially at surveillance audit, with the greatest improvement in client management and customer service, internal audit and information management (≥ 50 percentage points). The two laboratories with the greatest overall improvement focused heavily on the internal audit and corrective action QSEs. Conclusion: Whilst all laboratories improved from exit to surveillance audit, those that focused on the internal audit and corrective action QSEs improved substantially more than those that did not; internal audits and corrective actions may have acted as catalysts, leading to improvements in other QSEs. Systematic identification of core areas and best practices to address them is a critical step toward strengthening public medical laboratories. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe master {{programmes}} in {{the field}} of public administration reveal two trends, and in spite of being contradictory they ensur e both the convergence and specificity imposed by the continental/national realities:•A thematic focus on public management (MPM), public policies (MPP) or public affairs (MPA);•A diversification of the content and didactic methodologies related to the traditions and national public developments. The preoccupations on enhancing the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) are more visible in the context of applying thoroughly the principles of Bologna Declaration. The recent EHEA Ministerial Conference and the Third Bologna Policy Forum in Bucharest have highlighted that EHEA”is constructed on the basis of common European principles and on the growing internationalisation of higher education” and”HEIs welcome the opportunity for evaluation, <b>accreditation</b> or <b>audit</b> that incorporate their diverse activities and have an international added value”. EHEA countries’ focus on promoting Quality Assurance (QA) in higher education has been expressed in institutional building and promotion of contents and practicescompatible at European level. The need for programme internationalization is also supported by QA transnational organizations as well as several projects aimed at joint programmes. In this context, the current paper aims to present, in a comparative approach, the modalities and good practices derived from external QA evaluations for the quality of programmes {{in the field}} of public administration, accomplished by the Romanian Agency for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ARACIS) and the European Association for Public Administration Accreditation (EAPAA) for bachelor and master programmes in the National School of Political Studies and Public Administration in Bucharest, Romania.

30|$|Clinical audit in the {{document}} {{is defined as a}} ‘systematic examination or review of medical radiological procedures. It seeks to improve the quality and outcome of patient care through structured review whereby radiological practices, procedures and results are examined against agreed standards for good medical radiological procedures.

It emphasises that clinical audit is not research, quality system <b>audit,</b> <b>accreditation</b> or a regulatory activity, but a multi-professional activity that is both scheduled and systematic, carried out by auditors with knowledge of the procedures, combining internal assessment of performance with external review and identifying areas for future improvement. All those involved in audit should respect the confidentiality of patient data, staff discussions, audit reports and other performance data. Much emphasis is placed on the difference between clinical audit and other quality systems and regulatory inspections, there being clear differences in the purpose, focus, scope, methods and consequences {{of the results of the}} observations, their impact and use. Regulatory bodies should neither carry out clinical audits directly not exclusively set up the criteria for the audits.|$|R

The number of member laboratories is 211 from which 123 are accredited ones. The goals of ISTA are international standardization of: reporting results (Orange Certificate); methodologies for testing seeds (Rules), laboratory performance (Accreditation Programme) and international exchange of scientific results (Journal of Seed Science and Technology, Seed Symposiums and Seed Seminars). Since 1933 ISTA has published the International Rules for Testing Seeds. The ISTA Rules can be modified and amended annually by members and non-members, public and private laboratories or persons working in the area of seed science and technology during ISTA Annual Meeting held every year in a different country. To update the Rules, ISTA has 17 technical committees which are responsible for the study and validation of the proposed new seed evaluation method. The technical committees are also responsible for training, education and publication within its area of expertise. To achieve reproducibility of seed quality determination, the standardization of laboratory performance is highly important through: the continuous monitoring of performance through proficiency tests, development of a quality assurance system according to one international standards within the laboratory, regular auditing of the laboratories through an independent body and the further training and education of seed analysts in international training and education workshops.
