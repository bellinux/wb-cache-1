500|$|A fireman named O. H. Bush {{and several}} other men crawled through a broken window of the {{farmhouse}} in search of survivors. When they determined {{that no one was}} in the house, they salvaged what furniture they could before the fire spread into the living room. Bush discovered dynamite in the corner; he picked up <b>an</b> <b>armful</b> of explosives and handed it to one of the men. As Kehoe left his burning farm and house in his Ford truck, he stopped to tell those fighting the fire, [...] "Boys, you're my friends. You better get out of here. You better head down to the school", and drove off.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} badnjak {{has been brought}} in, or {{immediately}} before in some places, <b>an</b> <b>armful</b> of straw is spread over the floor. The straw is usually brought in with the same greetings and throwing of grain as the badnjak. The person spreading it may imitate a hen clucking to call her chicks, [...] "Kvo, kvo, kvo", with the family's children imitating chicks, [...] "Piju, piju, piju", while they pick at the straw. In Čečava, northern Bosnia, the children then {{lie down on the}} straw, before closing their eyes and picking a stalk with their lips: the child that picked the longest stalk will supposedly be the luckiest in the following year. In the Bay of Kotor, the ceremony is accompanied by the words [...] "Kuda slama, tuda slava"—"Whither straw, thither celebration." [...] A common custom is to scatter a handful of walnuts over the straw. It will be collected and taken out of the house {{on the morning of the}} second day after Christmas. Some of the straw may be set aside and used in apotropaic practices in the coming year.|$|E

2500|$|The Pigeon Detectives's {{performance}} was also memorable as frontman Matt Bowman informed {{the crowd that}} he was too clean and then asked if anyone in the audience had any mud or muddy trainers that they could throw at him. This request was readily carried out by the crowd. Bowman himself then proceeded to pick up <b>an</b> <b>armful</b> of mud from the stage and rubbed it over his head. Later he ran down to the crowd, inviting fans to rub his hair, whilst {{at the end of their}} popular single [...] "I'm Not Sorry", he jumped off the stage into the crowd. This performance left Stage 2/NME noticeably caked in mud for the rest of the festival.|$|E

2500|$|... "Thus from maidenhood {{to middle}} age, {{before the time}} when the last {{wrinkles}} of old age finally spread over her face, a woman is <b>a</b> pleasant <b>armful</b> for <b>a</b> man to embrace, and, even if the beauty of her prime is past, yet ...|$|R

60|$|At {{first he}} was in doubt what to do, but soon decided to stay where he was till the morrow.

60|$|Only {{a feeling}} of {{loneliness}} came over her and she watched {{the point where he}} had disappeared, with longing eyes, awaiting his return. As before, she was appraised of his presence by a soft sound behind her, and turned to see him coming across the turf with <b>a</b> great <b>armful</b> of branches.|$|R
60|$|Then Minnikin {{ran back}} to the King's palace as he had done before, but first he went on board the Troll's ship and took a great {{quantity}} of gold and silver and other precious things, and out of these he once more gave to the kitchen-maid <b>a</b> whole <b>armful</b> of gold and silver hoops.|$|R

He drew up a stool {{and took out a}} big knife.|$|R
6000|$|... "Trust me, {{your honor}} One {{of the first}} things I did, when the firing was over, was to pop into a stable and to get <b>a</b> big <b>armful</b> of hay; and take it out and hide it away, under a hedge.

5000|$|Shirley's husband, who {{was angry}} and {{confused}} at her departure, waits for her return with <b>a</b> large <b>armful</b> of flowers.

60|$|<b>A</b> fresh <b>armful</b> of {{brushwood}} {{had been}} thrown on to the fire before the men left it, and long after they had ridden away {{they could see the}} flames mounting high.
