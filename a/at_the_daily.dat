5|$|Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane: A {{reporter}} {{who works with}} Clark Kent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Daily</b> Planet, and former lover of Superman.

5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people‚Äîthe meteor infected‚Äîshe spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Daily</b> Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her ‚Äì her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E
