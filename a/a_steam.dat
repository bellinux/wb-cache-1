5|$|Other {{advantages}} of using an electric fire engine were {{that it would}} not produce loud noises, smoke, dust, cinders and ashes, as steam fire engines did. Also, the cost of an electric fire engine would be about one-third that of <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> boiler fire engine. A typical electric fire engine weighed sixty percent less than <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> boiler of the same capacity.|$|E

5|$|A {{radioisotope}} building, <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> plant, {{and other}} structures were added in April 1946 {{to support the}} laboratory's peacetime educational and research missions.

5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E
5|$|There are {{competing}} claims {{for the title}} of first motorcycle, depending on whether <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> motorcycle, or only one with an internal combustion engine, counts as a true motorcycle, and the uncertainty as to which of the two earliest steam motorcycles, the Roper or the Michaux-Perreaux, was built first.|$|E
5|$|There were various {{experimental}} illustrations showing what {{an electrical}} fire engine {{could do better}} than <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> fire engine if the complete system was put into operation. One set up demonstration was at the Crystal palace electrical exhibition of 1892.|$|E

5|$|Therefore, {{the parish}} was {{in desperate need}} of a new rectory and the new project was begun in 1944. An engineer, Frank H. Recco, was the {{technical}} advisor of the project. Parishioners borrowed a bulldozer from the John F. Casey Company in Aspinwall, and <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> shovel from the Burrell Construction and Supply Company of New Kensington; and they dug the foundation for a two-level building.|$|E
5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>steam</b> {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively warm water.|$|E
5|$|Falkner Island Light {{was chosen}} for fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and whistles and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, <b>a</b> <b>steam</b> fog whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E
