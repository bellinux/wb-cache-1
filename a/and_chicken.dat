40|$|Abstract: A {{study was}} carried out in Japanese quails Coturnix coturnix japonica <b>and</b> <b>chickens</b> (Rhode Island Red) for {{comparative}} haematological and biochemical changes occurring due to Ascaridia galli infection. Quails as well as chickens were divided into four small groups, each consisting six numbers of birds in each group and were marked as q 1, q 2, q 3, qC and p 1, p 2, p 3, pC, respectively. Haematological study showed that the total erythrocytic count (TEC), packed cell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin (Hb) percentage decreased significantly in infected groups of quails <b>and</b> <b>chickens.</b> The total leucocytic count (TLC) showed significant increase in infected groups of quails <b>and</b> <b>chickens.</b> Heterophils <b>and</b> eosinophils were increased significantly in all the infected groups of quails <b>and</b> <b>chickens.</b> Lymphocytes decreased significantly in all the infected groups. Biochemical study showed that total serum protein decreased significantly in the infected groups of quails <b>and</b> <b>chickens.</b> Serum albumin level was significantly lower in all the infected groups of quails <b>and</b> <b>chickens.</b> Serum globulin <b>and</b> albumin: globulin (A:G) ratio failed to show any significant difference between control and infected groups of quails <b>and</b> <b>chickens...</b>|$|R

5|$|Although Wendy's was {{the first}} to have a value menu in 1989, Burger King decided to offer its own value menu in 1998. This menu {{featured}} seven products: the Whopper Jr., a five-piece Chicken Tenders, a bacon cheeseburger, medium-sized French fries, medium soft drink, medium onion rings, and a small milkshake – all priced at 99¢ (USD). In 2002 and 2006, BK revamped its value menu by adding and removing several products such as chili and the Rodeo Cheeseburger.

5|$|Burger King markets the Original Chicken Sandwich under several {{different}} names globally, including the Long Chicken, BK Chicken <b>and</b> <b>Chicken</b> Royal {{in the international}} markets it does business.

To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants in the line that have different toppings or ingredients such as ham, Italian sausage or pulled pork. Being one of the company's major offerings, the Specialty Sandwiches are sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few global trademarks to protect its investment in the products.|$|E

5|$|Common herbs such as sage, mustard, {{and parsley}} were grown {{and used in}} cooking all over Europe, as were caraway, mint, dill and fennel. Many of these plants grew {{throughout}} all of Europe or were cultivated in gardens, and were a cheaper alternative to exotic spices. Mustard was particularly popular with meat products and was described by Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) as poor man's food. While locally grown herbs were less prestigious than spices, they were still used in upper-class food, but were then usually less prominent or included merely as coloring. Anise was used to flavor fish <b>and</b> <b>chicken</b> dishes, and its seeds were served as sugar-coated comfits.|$|E
