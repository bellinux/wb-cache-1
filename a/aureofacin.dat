40|$|The {{potentiation}} of the antiviral {{activity of}} acyclovir [9 -[(2 -hydroxyethoxy) methyl]guanine] by polyene macrolide antibiotics {{has been studied}} {{as a function of}} the macrolide structure. The 12 polyenes chosen for this study represented the major structural groups of these antibiotics and induced in mammalian cells repairable membrane alterations or irreversible cell damage. The potentiating activity of the polyene macrolides was determined based on the differential decrease of in vitro production of infectious virions in the presence of acyclovir alone or in combination with the polyene. Pseudorabies virus, a representative herpesvirus susceptible to acyclovir, was replicated in BHK- 21 cells grown in serum-free medium to avoid the interference of serum factors in the polyene macrolide-cell interaction. The potentiation activity of the polyene antibiotics was concentration dependent. The enhancement of the antiviral activity of acyclovir was observed at polyene concentrations which had no direct effect on pseudorabies virus replication in BHK- 21 cells. The optimal potentiating concentrations of polyenes were 2 to 15 times lower than that inducing 50 % of potassium efflux from BHK- 21 cells. The highest potentiating activity was observed for the methyl ester of the trimethylammonium derivative of <b>aureofacin</b> B, which reduced the pseudorabies virus titer by two orders of magnitude. Potentiation by polyene macrolides appeared to coincide with the K+-dependent membrane repair process. The acyclovir potentiating activity was associated with polyene macrolide antibiotics having a large and rigid macrolide ring (amphotericin B and <b>aureofacin).</b> Polyene antibiotics with small and rigid (pimaricin and filipin) or large but flexible (nystatin A 1 and lienomycin) macrolide rings showed no potentiation of the antiviral effect of acyclovir...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{correlation}} between chemical characteristics of 13 polyene macrolide antibiotics {{and the ability to}} repair the membrane permeability changes induced by polyenes in BHK- 21 cells grown in shaker culture. It had been demonstrated that large-macrolide-ring polyenes with rigid molecules (heptaenes) induced specific membrane permeability pathways which were repaired by the eucaryotic cells under the proper conditions. The influence of environmental conditions on the repair process was examined. <b>Aureofacin</b> trimethylammonium methyl ester derivative was used as a selected representative of polyene macrolides inducing specific pathways. The factors influencing the repair process, monitored by measuring the ability of BHK- 21 cells to control K+ membrane transport, were examined during and after cell contact with the antibiotic. We found that the repair process was dependent upon the temperature, the concentration of the antibiotic, time of its contact with cells, potassium concentration in the medium, and availability of an energy source. The repair process occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, which inhibited protein synthesis in BHK- 21 cells. Results showed that the repair process {{plays an important role in}} mammalian cell recovery from the toxic effects of polyenes...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{contains}} data on {{the induction}} of K+ efflux and viability of baby hamster kidney (BHK- 21) cells after their treatment with macrolide antibiotics inducing specific pores in membrane. New water-soluble semisynthetic derivatives of amphotericin B and <b>aureofacin</b> (N-glycosyl and trimethylammonium methyl ester derivatives) {{as well as the}} parent compounds were used to compare the concentration of antibiotics inducing permeabilizing and cytostatic effects. We found that a two- to eight-times-higher concentration of polyene antibiotic was required to observe a cytostatic effect than for release of 50 % of the cellular potassium (K 50 concentration) from BHK- 21 cells. These differences were larger for water-soluble derivatives than for the parent compounds. The amount of intracellular potassium in treated cells incubated under optimal growth conditions was higher than in cells which had been further washed with K+-free maintenance medium. The membrane permeability changes induced by low concentrations of specific polyenes were observed to be reversible. BHK- 21 cells were able to repair polyene-induced membrane permeability within 3 to 12 h under optimal growth conditions, after cell treatment with K 50 concentration of specific macrolide antibiotics. The repair phenomenon is postulated as an explanation for the dissociation observed between permeabilizing and cytostatic effect of specific polyenes in BHK- 21 cells...|$|E
