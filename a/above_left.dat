5|$|The {{matching}} rules {{can be described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown <b>above</b> <b>left</b> in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E
5|$|Two Stars of David {{were added}} {{to the center of the}} facade. One is seen in the old {{photograph}} (<b>above</b> <b>left),</b> over a palmette ornament at the top of the window arch. The other, mounted above the top of the gable, remains visible in the modern photograph (top). The unusual cupola-like structure on legs seen above the gable in the old photograph, now gone, was also added by the synagogue, as was the square structure on which it sat. The panel with a large Hebrew inscription over the main doors was added in this period, before the older photograph. The decorations to the upper parts of the central section of the facade survived until at least 1974, as did the tracery to the square windows on the towers; this Gothic ornamentation was removed after it deteriorated.|$|E

25|$|Another {{well-known}} Marshall swindle is Marshall–MacClure, New York 1923 (diagram at <b>above</b> <b>left).</b> Marshall, a rook down, played 1.Rh6! Rxh6 2.h8=Q+! Rxh8 3.b5! A {{very unusual}} position has arisen: now Black is up two rooks and on move, {{but the only}} way to avoid stalemate is 3...Rd7 4.cxd7 (threatening 5.d8=Q+, forcing stalemate) c5?? 5.bxc6 Kb8 6.Kxb6, when White even wins. Decades later, someone pointed out an alternative draw with 1.Rg6! fxg6 2.h8=Q+ Rxh8 3.b5 or 1...Re8 2.Rg8 Rb8 3.b5.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps most significantly, {{with its}} short left field fence (only {{slightly}} longer to left field than Fenway Park), overall shorter dimensions, {{and exposure to}} the elements, including the humid Texas air, Enron Field played like a hitters' park. This was a dramatic difference from the Astrodome, which {{was considered to be}} an extreme pitchers' park. In a challenge to home run hitters, owner Drayton McLane's office windows, located in the old Union Station <b>above</b> <b>left</b> field, are made of glass and marked as 442' from home plate.|$|E
25|$|The {{role of the}} sun {{in recent}} climate change has been looked at by climate scientists. Since 1978, output from the Sun has been {{measured}} by satellites significantly more accurately than was previously possible from the surface. These measurements indicate that the Sun's total solar irradiance has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be directly attributed {{to an increase in}} total solar energy reaching the Earth (see graph <b>above,</b> <b>left).</b> In the three decades since 1978, the combination of solar and volcanic activity probably had a slight cooling influence on the climate.|$|E

500|$|A {{new design}} of {{nameplate}} was created, featuring a circular {{plate with a}} smaller circle in the centre. The inner circle carried the colours of the shipping company on a stylised flag, on an air force blue background. [...] Around the outer circle {{was the name of}} the locomotive, picked out in gilt lettering. [...] A horizontal rectangular plate was attached to either side of the circular nameplate, with [...] "Merchant Navy Class" [...] in gilt lettering. [...] This acted as a class plate, as indicated on the nameplate photograph, <b>above</b> <b>left.</b>|$|E
500|$|That night Coolidge {{received}} a telegram from AFL leader Samuel Gompers. [...] "Whatever disorder has occurred", Gompers wrote, [...] "is due to Curtis's {{order in which}} {{the right of the}} policemen has been denied…" [...] Coolidge publicly answered Gompers's telegram, denying any justification whatsoever for the strike – and his response launched him into the national consciousness (quoted, <b>above</b> <b>left).</b> Newspapers across the nation picked up on Coolidge's statement and he became the newest hero to opponents of the strike. In the midst of the First Red Scare, many Americans were terrified of the spread of communist revolution, like those that had taken place in Russia, Hungary, and Germany. While Coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor, conservatives across the nation had seen a rising star. Although he usually acted with deliberation, the Boston police strike gave him a national reputation as a decisive leader, and as a strict enforcer of law and order.|$|E
500|$|Although Warhol had {{produced}} silkscreens of comic strips and of other pop art subjects, he supposedly relegated himself to soup cans {{as a subject}} {{at the time to}} avoid competing with the more finished style of comics by Roy Lichtenstein. He once said [...] "I've got to do something that really will have a lot of impact that will be different enough from Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist, that will be very personal, that won't look like I'm doing exactly what they're doing." [...] In February 1962, Lichtenstein displayed at a sold-out exhibition of cartoon pictures at Leo Castelli's eponymous Leo Castelli Gallery, ending the possibility of Warhol exhibiting his own cartoon paintings. Castelli had visited Warhol's gallery in 1961 and said that the work he saw there was too similar to Lichtenstein's, although Warhol's and Lichtenstein's comic artwork differed in subject and techniques (e.g., Warhol's comic-strip figures were humorous pop culture caricatures such as Popeye, while Lichtenstein's were generally of stereotypical hero and heroines, inspired by comic strips devoted to adventure and romance). Castelli chose not to represent both artists at that time, but he would, in 1964, exhibit Warhol works such as reproductions of Campbell's Tomato Juice Box, 1964 (pictured <b>above,</b> <b>left),</b> and Brillo Soap Boxes. He would again exhibit Warhol's work in 1966. Lichtenstein's 1962 show was quickly followed by Wayne Thiebaud's April 17, 1962 one-man show at the Allan Stone Gallery featuring all-American foods, which agitated Warhol as he felt it jeopardized his own food-related soup can works. Warhol was considering returning to the Bodley gallery, but the Bodley's director did not like his pop art works. In 1961, Warhol was offered a three-man show by Allan Stone at the latter's 18 East 82nd Street Gallery with Rosenquist and Robert Indiana, but all three were insulted by this proposition.|$|E

2500|$|Schmidt–Schaefer, Rheinhessen 1997 (diagram at <b>above</b> <b>left),</b> {{is another}} {{straightforward}} example. Black has connected passed pawns, but if White can sacrifice his knights for them he {{can reach the}} drawn two knights versus lone king ending. Thus, 50.Nfe4! threatened to capture both pawns with the knights. 50...dxe4 51.Nxe4 Kd5 52.Nxc5! would also achieve that goal. Black tried 50...d4, but agreed to a draw after 51.Nxc5+ Kd6 52.Nb5+! Kxc5 53.Nxd4! ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{position}} <b>above</b> <b>left,</b> {{the conclusion}} of a chess problem by the American master Frederick Rhine, provides a more complicated example of forcing a draw by material insufficiency. [...] White draws with 5.Nxc4+! Nxc4 If 5...Kc6 6.Nxb6 Kxb6 7.Rxb2+, White's rook draws easily against Black's knight and bishop. 6.Rxb6+ Now Black's best try is 6...Kd5! or 6...Ke7!, when the endgame of rook against two knights and a bishop is a well-established theoretical draw. The more natural 6...Nxb6+ leads to a surprising draw after 7.Kd8! (diagram above), when any bishop move stalemates White, and any other move allows 8.Kxe8, when the two knights cannot force checkmate.|$|E
2500|$|The diagram at <b>above</b> <b>left,</b> a 1623 {{composition}} by Gioachino Greco, shows {{a straightforward}} example of forcing a draw by material insufficiency. Black, although two pawns down, draws easily with 1...Ra1+ 2.Rf1 Rxf1+ 3. Kxf1 Bh3! Then 4.gxh3 {{is a standard}} book draw, since White's bishop is of the [...] "wrong color" [...] from the rook pawns (i.e., it moves on the squares opposite in color {{to that of the}} pawns' queening square) and thus can never drive Black's king from the h8 corner. On other moves, Black will play 4...Bxg2!, again leaving White with a rook pawn and the wrong-colored bishop. Black implemented this idea in actual play in Carlsen–Aarland, Norwegian Championship final 2002. From the middle diagram above, Aarland played 52...Ba5!! 53.bxa5 Kc6, and the future world champion had to agree to a draw a few moves later.|$|E

60|$|I was now, as <b>above,</b> <b>left</b> loose to the world, {{and being}} still young and handsome, as {{everybody}} said of me, and I assure you I thought myself so, {{and with a}} tolerable fortune in my pocket, I put no small value upon myself. I was courted by several very considerable tradesmen, and particularly very warmly by one, a linen-draper, at whose house, after my husband's death, I took a lodging, his sister being my acquaintance. Here I had all the liberty and all {{the opportunity to be}} gay and appear in company that I could desire, my landlord's sister being one of the maddest, gayest things alive, and not so much mistress of her virtue as I thought as first she had been. She brought me into a world of wild company, and even brought home several persons, such as she liked well enough to gratify, to see her pretty widow, so she was pleased to call me, and that name I got in a little time in public. Now, as fame and fools make an assembly, I was here wonderfully caressed, had abundance of admirers, and such as called themselves lovers; but I found not one fair proposal among them all. As for their common design, that I understood too well to be drawn into any more snares of that kind. The case was altered with me: I had money in my pocket, and had nothing to say to them. I had been tricked once by that cheat called love, but the game was over; I was resolved now to be married or nothing, and to be well married or not at all.|$|E
