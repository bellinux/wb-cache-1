50|$|This {{unique and}} unusual article (added by Amendment 1) prohibits the General Assembly from making <b>appropriations</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of {{principal}} and interest on several bond issues from 1869 to 1871, {{commonly referred to as}} Holford bonds. They were passed during Reconstruction by the General Assembly. Some of the bonds refinanced disputed debt outstanding from shortly after Arkansas' statehood in 1836.

40|$|Share {{premiums}} now {{constitute a}} substantial proportion of UK company equity but rarely featured on nineteenth century company balance sheets. This paper discusses when and why this changed {{and why the}} definition of the share premium account as company capital took nearly a century to reach the statute books. From 1855 to 1948 any surplus above par on issued shares could be treated at the directors' discretion, including <b>appropriation</b> <b>for</b> the <b>payment</b> of dividends. This freedom was removed in the Companies Act 1948 (s. 56), after the Cohen Committee recommended that share premiums should normally be treated as share capital and employed in a very limited range of transactions. The paper outlines the accounting and legal history of the share premium account and argues that the growth of share premiums was due to a tax avoidance loophole, open from 1889 to 1973, which permanently changed company practice on share issues after 1920. The effect of legal restrictions {{on the use of the}} share premium account is also addressed. One possible future consequence of the loss of economic significance of the nominal value of a share is the total abolition of both this and the share premium account by adoption of no par value (npv) shares, a change which has recently been adopted in Australia and is again under consideration in the UK.
