5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was <b>achieved</b> <b>with</b> motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of Colin Walker's {{first start}} to a season as manager, York signed nine players before the summer {{transfer}} window closed. The season started with an eight-match unbeaten run, but Walker was dismissed in November 2008 after three successive defeats. Martin Foyle was appointed as his successor, {{and after the}} turn of the year York won only five league matches. Survival in the Conference Premier was <b>achieved</b> <b>with</b> a 17th-place finish. York reached the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium, being beaten 2–0 by Stevenage Borough. They were eliminated from the 2008–09 FA Cup in the fourth qualifying round, and from the 2008–09 Conference League Cup in the Northern section fourth round.|$|E

5|$|By October Axis {{operational}} objectives in Ukraine and the Baltic region were <b>achieved,</b> <b>with</b> only the sieges of Leningrad and Sevastopol continuing. A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; {{after two months}} of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive. Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The blitzkrieg phase {{of the war in}} Europe had ended.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{independence}} from the United Kingdom grew gradually {{over the course of}} many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. World War I and World War II, in particular, gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship. Legislative independence was established {{with the passage of the}} Statute of Westminster 1931, the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was <b>achieved</b> <b>with</b> the patriation of the constitution in 1982. Canada's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom. Legislation since the mid-20th century represents Canadians' commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, William Benjamin Carpenter wrote a {{critical}} {{evaluation of the}} Crookes experiments with Home in the Quarterly Review. Carpenter wrote that although Crookes, his assistant and Sergeant Cox claimed to have observed the accordion float in the cage; Dr. Huggins did not testify to this, and no information was given to whether the keys and bellows were seen to move. According to Carpenter no solid explanation could be given until the experiment is repeated, however, he suggested that the accordion feat that Home performed {{may have been a}} conjuring trick <b>achieved</b> <b>with</b> one hand. Carpenter concluded that Crookes should repeat the experiment in open daylight without the cage in the presence of other witnesses.|$|E
5|$|In fish {{such as the}} herring which live in {{shallower}} water, {{the mirrors}} must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks {{with a range of}} different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is <b>achieved</b> <b>with</b> many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The cephalopods, including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.|$|E

5|$|Le Père Goriot, {{especially}} in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly {{different times of}} life. Pleased with the effect he <b>achieved</b> <b>with</b> the return of Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in {{the first edition of}} Le Père Goriot that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions of the same people. Rastignac's appearance shows, {{for the first time in}} Balzac's fiction, a novel-length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium levels may be <b>achieved</b> <b>with</b> hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are <b>achieved</b> <b>with</b> a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
