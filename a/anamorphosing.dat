500|$|Gottschalk {{learned from}} one of his vendors that Bausch & Lomb, whom Fox had {{contracted}} to manufacture CinemaScope lenses, was having difficulty filling the lens orders for theatrical anamorphic projection equipment. He teamed up with William Mann, who provided optical manufacturing capability, and Walter Wallin, an optical physicist who was an acquaintance of Mann's. The anamorphic lens design they selected was prismatic rather than the cylindrical design of the Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lens. This design meant the anamorphic lens extension factor—how much the image is horizontally unsqueezed—could be manually shifted, useful for projectionists switching between nonanamorphic ("flat" [...] or [...] "spherical") trailers and an anamorphic feature. The result was the <b>anamorphosing</b> system, designed by Wallin, used in the Panatar lens; the patent for the system was filed on August 11, 1954, and awarded five years later.|$|E
50|$|However, with advancements {{in digital}} {{intermediate}} technology, the <b>anamorphosing</b> process {{can now be}} completed as a digital step with no degradation of image quality. Also, 3-perf and 2-perf pose minor problems for visual effects work. The area of the film in 4-perf work that is cropped out in the <b>anamorphosing</b> process contains nonetheless picture information which is useful for such visual effects tasks as 2D and 3D tracking. This mildly complicates certain visual effects efforts for productions using 3-perf and 2-perf, making anamorphic prints struck digitally from center cropped 4-perf Super 35 the popular choice in large budget visual effects driven productions.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} <b>anamorphosing</b> optics was {{developed}} by Henri Chrétien during World War I to provide a wide angle viewer for military tanks. The optical process was called Hypergonar by Chrétien and was capable of showing a field of view of 180 degrees. After the war, the technology was first used in a cinematic context in the short film Construire un Feu (To Build a Fire, based on the 1908 Jack London story of the same name) in 1927 by Claude Autant-Lara.|$|E

50|$|Although {{many films}} {{projected}} anamorphically {{have been shot}} using anamorphic lenses, there are often aesthetic and technical reasons that make shooting with spherical lenses preferable. If the director and cinematographer still wish to retain the 2.40:1 aspect ratio, anamorphic prints {{can be made from}} spherical negatives. Because the 2.40:1 image cropped from an Academy ratio 4-perf negative causes considerable waste of frame space, and since the cropping and <b>anamorphosing</b> of a spherical print requires an intermediate lab step, it is often attractive for these films to use a different negative pulldown method (most commonly 3-perf, but occasionally Techniscope 2-perf) usually in conjunction with the added negative space Super 35 affords.|$|E

50|$|To make {{full use}} of the {{available}} film, thereby increasing overall image detail, an anamorphic lens is used during photography to stretch the image vertically to fill the full (4 perf) frame. Up to the early 1960s, three major methods of <b>anamorphosing</b> the image were used: counter-rotated prisms (e.g., Ultra Panavision), curved mirrors {{in combination with the}} principle of Total Internal Reflection (e.g., Technirama), and cylindrical lenses (lenses curved, and hence squeezing the scene being photographed, in only one direction, as per a cylinder, e.g., the original CinemaScope system based on Henri Chrétien's design). Whatever the method used, the anamorphic lens leaves the image on film looking {{as if it had been}} stretched vertically. This deliberate geometric distortion is then reversed upon projection, resulting in a wider aspect ratio on-screen than that of the frame as recorded on film. An anamorphic lens consists of a regular spherical lens, plus an anamorphic attachment (or integrated lens element) that does the <b>anamorphosing.</b> The anamorphic element operates at infinite focal length (so that it has little or no effect on the focus of the prime camera lens onto which it is mounted), but still nevertheless anamorphoses the optical field. When an anamorphic attachment is used, one uses a spherical lens of a different focal length than one would for 1.85:1 (one sufficient to produce an image the full height of the frame and twice the width), and then the anamorphic attachment squeezes 2x horizontally. Specialized reverse anamorphic attachments existed that were relatively rarely used on projection and camera lenses to expand the image in the vertical space (e.g., the early Technirama system mentioned above), so that (in the case of the common two-times anamorphic lens) a frame twice as high as it might have been filled the available film area. Since a larger film area needed to be used in order to record the same picture, the quality was increased.|$|E

50|$|The {{distortion}} (vertical stretching) {{introduced in}} the picture must be corrected when the film is played back, so another lens is used during projection that either expands the picture back to its correct proportions or (as {{in the case of}} the now defunct Technirama system) squeezes the image vertically to restore normal geometry. It should be noted that the picture is not manipulated in any way in the dimension that is orthogonal to the one <b>anamorphosed.</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Basing on the {{measurement}} of pulse time-of-flight, 3 D imaging LADAR have ability to obtain the profile of target surface. As the convolution results of impulse response function of footprint and probe pulse, the reflected pulse will distort if the footprint contain a variety of distances. After discriminate process, this distort brings in a time error for distance measurement, which becomes the <b>anamorphose</b> on system imaging further more. According to the discussion of time-dependent scattering cross section, this kind of <b>anamorphose</b> is mainly decided by the slope of target surface when the system parameters and target distance are determined. A compensation method for height error based on detected slope has been put forward. First of all, the slope distribution of detected surface could be calculated from the point cloud data by two-way difference method. Then, the approximate compensation height error will be obtained, according to the slope-error relationship by assuming that each footprint be a tilting plane. After adding to the detected data, the first approximate target surface data has been acquired. The compensation result will approaching the real value by repeating the three steps above. As an example, simulation analysis of Gaussian pulse imaging detection has been given. The result shows that this compensation method is effective and efficient...|$|R
5000|$|The concept behind Super 35 {{originated}} with the Tushinsky Brothers' SuperScope format, particularly the SuperScope 235 specification from 1956. In 1982, Joe Dunton revived the format for Dance Craze, and Technicolor soon marketed {{it under the}} name [...] "Super Techniscope" [...] before the industry settled on the name Super 35. The central driving idea behind the process is to return to shooting in the original silent [...] "Edison" [...] 1.33:1 full 4-perf negative area (24.89 mm by 18.67 mm or 0.980 in by 0.735 in), and then crop the frame either from the bottom or the center (like 1.85:1) to create a 2.40:1 aspect ratio (matching that of anamorphic lenses) with an area of 24 mm by 10 mm (0.945 in by 0.394 in). Although this cropping may seem extreme, by expanding the negative area out perf-to-perf, Super 35 creates a 2.40:1 aspect ratio with an overall negative area of 240 square millimeters (0.372 sq in), only 9 mm2 (0.014 sq in) less than the 1.85:1 crop of the Academy frame (248.81 mm2 or 0.386 sq in). The cropped frame is then converted at the intermediate stage to a 4-perf anamorphically squeezed print compatible with the anamorphic projection standard. This allows an [...] "anamorphic" [...] frame to be captured with non-anamorphic lenses, which are much more common. Up to 2000, once the film was photographed in Super 35, an optical printer was used to anamorphose (squeeze) the image. This optical step reduced {{the overall quality of}} the image and made Super 35 a controversial subject among cinematographers, many who preferred the higher image quality and frame negative area of anamorphic photography (especially with regard to granularity). With the advent of Digital intermediates (DI) {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, however, Super 35 photography has become even more popular, since everything could be done digitally, scanning the original 4-perf 1.33:1 (or 3-perf 1.78:1) picture and cropping it to the 2.39:1 frame already in-computer, without <b>anamorphosing</b> stages, and also without creating an additional optical generation with increased grain. This process of creating the aspect ratio in the computer allows the studios to perform all post-production and editing of the movie in its original aspect (1.33:1 or 1.78:1) and to then release the cropped version, while still having the original when necessary (for Pan & Scan, HDTV transmission, etc.).|$|E

Le Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville is {{generally}} considered to constitute Diderot's principle literary contribution to primitivist thought. However, {{a study of the}} two different states of the same text (the "old man's farewell") reveals a more subtle reflection, {{at the end of which}} the author, while reviving primitivist clichés, emphasises its artificial literary character and the fact that it is epistemologically untenable. For the speech put in the old man's mouth can only be that of enlightened philosophy. Diderot's subtle textual manipulation manages to make the reader realise that this substitution of speech is both a literary subterfuge and the only possible answer to an ethical necessity. As a literary anamorphosis, the old man's farewell is both a literary artifice designed to educate the reader and an introduction to a more refined reading technique. Hartmann Pierre.
