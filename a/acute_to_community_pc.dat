40|$|Background Health care {{professionals}} {{in several countries}} are searching for alternatives <b>to</b> <b>acute</b> hospitalization. In Hallingdal, Norway, selected acute patients are admitted <b>to</b> a <b>community</b> hospital. The {{aim of this study}} was <b>to</b> analyse whether <b>acute</b> admission <b>to</b> a <b>community</b> hospital as an alternative to a general hospital had any positive or negative health consequences for the patients. Methods Patients intended for <b>acute</b> admission <b>to</b> the local <b>community</b> hospital were asked to join a randomized controlled trial. One group of the enrolled patients was admitted as planned (group 1, n[*]=[*] 33), while another group was admitted to the general hospital (group 2, n[*]=[*] 27). Health outcomes were measured by the Nottingham Extended Activity of Daily Living Questionnaire and by collection of data concerning specialist and community health care services in a follow-up year. Results After one year, no statistical significant differences in the level of daily function was found between group 1 (admissions <b>to</b> the <b>community</b> hospital) and group 2 (admissions to the general hospital). Group 1 had recorded fewer in-patient days at hospitals and nursing homes, as well as lower use of home nursing, than group 2. For outpatient referrals, the trend was the opposite. However, {{the differences between the two}} groups were not at a 5 % level of statistical significance. Conclusions No statistical significant differences at a 5 % level were found related to health consequences between the two randomized groups. The study however, indicates a consistent trend of health benefits rather than risk from <b>acute</b> admissions <b>to</b> a <b>community</b> hospital, as compared to the general hospital. Emergency admission and treatment at a lower-level facility than the hospital thus appears to be a feasible solution for a selected group of patients.

40|$|This trial {{compared}} {{the cost of}} an integrated home-based care model with traditional inpatient care for acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 25 patients with acute COPD were randomised to either home or hospital management following request for hospital admission. The acute care at home group costs per separation ($ 745, CI 95 % $ 595 -$ 895, n = 13) were significantly lower (p < 0. 01) than the hospital group ($ 2543, CI 95 % $ 1766 -$ 3321, n = 12). There was an improvement in lung function in the hospital-managed group at the Outpatient Department review, decreased anxiety in the Emergency Department in the home-managed group and equal patient satisfaction with care delivery.

Patient and carer experiences can inform and shape services. Objective: To develop service user-led recommendations enabling smooth transition for people living with memory loss from <b>acute</b> hospital <b>to</b> <b>community.</b> Design: Lead and co-researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 pairs of carers and patients with memory loss at discharge, 6 and 12 weeks post-discharge and one semi-structured interview with health and social care professionals and Admiral Nurses. Framework analysis was guided by co-researchers. Two focus groups of study participants, facilitated by co-researchers, met to shape and finalize recommendations. Setting and participants: Recruitment took place in acute hospitals in two National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England.

The study aimed to investigate care transitions of frail older people from <b>acute</b> hospital wards <b>to</b> <b>community</b> healthcare or community hospital wards, within {{a system that}} had vertically integrated acute hospital and community healthcare services. Theory and methods: The research design was a multimethod, qualitative case study of one healthcare system in England; four acute hospital wards and two community hospital wards were studied in depth. The data were collected through: interviews with key staff (n = 17); focus groups (n = 9) with ward staff (n = 36); interviews with frail older people (n = 4). The data were analysed using the framework approach. Findings: Three themes are presented: Care transitions within a vertically integrated healthcare system, Interprofessional communication and relationships; Patient and family involvement in care transitions. Discussion and conclusions: A vertically integrated healthcare system supported care transitions from acute hospital wards through removal of organisational boundaries. However, boundaries between staff in different settings remained a barrier to transitions, as did capacity issues in community healthcare and social care. Staff in acute and community settings need opportunities to gain better understanding of each other’s roles and build relationships and trust. </p...|$|R
40|$|Oxford University PressOBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the reported experiences of elderly patients regarding their transition from an <b>acute</b> hospital <b>to</b> independent <b>community</b> living. DESIGN: Observational longitudinal study based on semi-structured interviews conducted monthly for 6 months following discharge from hospital. SETTING: Four South Australian acute hospitals. PATIENTS: One hundred elderly patients who faced a long-term change in health status and/or {{in their ability}} to manage practical aspects of daily living. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Experiences in managing change in health status, social circumstances and independent community living. RESULTS: Few patients believed that discharge plans made in hospital had assisted their return <b>to</b> independent <b>community</b> living. Discharge planning addressed mainly formal health services rather than practical aspects of daily living. Many patients implemented innovative solutions when formal services were unavailable or inadequate. Pain, tiredness, loss of mobility, and grief over loss of previous abilities were frequent, long lasting sequelae to illness, and few discharge plans prepared patients to deal with this. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients who have left hospital to face a permanent change in health status often regret that they have not been better prepared for what lies ahead in terms of more specific information about their condition, linked with practical discharge plans that prepare them for their period of convalescence. We suggest that the underlying problem is a disjunction between the multiple systems involved in hospital discharge planning, primary medical care, disability-oriented community health services, and informal community services.

40|$|Aim: This thesis aimed <b>to</b> explore <b>community</b> nursing middle manager role {{enactment}} {{in managing}} change within Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) in three regions of Scotland from 2008 - 2011. Background: CHPs were established {{to play a}} key role in shifting care from the <b>acute</b> <b>to</b> the <b>community</b> setting. Within this context the community nursing workforce has been adapting roles in response to Scottish Government (SG) directives. However literature review demonstrated there has been very little research into the role of Community Nurse Middle Managers (CNMMs) in the midst of this change. This investigation sought to address this deficit in the literature. Design and Methodology: The study was conducted in four distinct phases comprising of the reflexive, foundational, recursive and expansive. A total of 42 semi-structured interviews were conducted over the period of investigation. The investigation was qualitative and phenomenological in character. A hermeneutic approach was adopted, broadly based on Heideggerian philosophy. More specifically this study drew on the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach of Jonathan Smith (1996). Main findings: In general CNMMs perceived that their jobs had become more complex, with the pace and intensity of work having increased. They held a wide range of responsibilities managing the challenges of driving change within a hierarchy and professional bureaucracy. Opportunities for education and learning were felt to have reduced. A small but significant proportion had left and some were considering leaving the NHS service. A primary motivation for CNMMs was maintaining an implicit connection with service users. They were proud to be members of the nursing profession and aligned their identity with their career history. This was perceived to influence their management and leadership style. In overcoming some of the personal challenges they faced they identified protective factors or “assets” to counteract stress. The application of a salutogenic perspective emerged as important in supporting this. Conclusion: The study has addressed a knowledge gap in literature. It contributes to understandings of NHS community nursing, middle management, role, change and Community Health Partnership literature. In particular it gives a voice to the perspectives of community nursing middle managers in Scotland. It suggests that much more attention needs to be paid to the needs, constitution and sustenance of middle managers in Scottish community nursing and that this has policy, practice, education and research implications.

Research has shown that the information needs of caregivers are not being met across healthcare settings. Thus, some attention must be given to the development of educational materials that address caregiver needs. In this study we interviewed caregivers to determine their perspectives on support and educational needs at two different stages in the recovery of the stroke survivor: the acute hospital and the community.

40|$|Dewatering {{methods for}} recuperative {{thickening}} and final dewatering can potentially impact methanogenic activity and microbial community. This influences both {{the feasibility of}} recuperative thickening to increase solids residence time within a digester, and the utilisation of dewatered digestate as inoculum for new digesters. Thickening technology can reduce methanogenic activity through either air contact (rotary drum, DAF, or belt filter press), or by lysing cells through shear (centrifuge). To assess this, two plants with recuperative thickening (rotary drum) in their anaerobic digester, and five without recuperative thickening, had specific methanogenic activity tested in all related streams, including dewatering feed, thickened return, final cake, and centrate. All plants had high speed centrifuges for final dewatering. The digester microbial community was also assessed through 16 s pyrotag sequencing and subsequent principal component analysis (PCA). The specific methanogenic activity of all samples was in the expected range of 0. 2 - 0. 4 gCOD gVS- 1 d- 1. Plants with recuperative thickening did not have lower digester activity. Centrifuge based dewatering had a significant and variable impact on methanogenic activity in all samples, ranging between 20 % and 90 % decrease but averaging 54 %. Rotary drum based recuperative thickening had a far smaller impact on activity, with a 0 % per-pass drop in activity in one plant, and a 20 % drop in another. However, the presence of recuperative thickening was a major predictor of overall microbial <b>community</b> (<b>PC</b> 1, p = 0. 0024). Microbial <b>community</b> <b>PC</b> 3 (mainly driven by a shift in methanogens) was a strong predictor for sensitivity in activity to shear (p = 0. 0005, p = 0. 00001 without outlier). The one outlier was related to a plant producing the wettest cake (17 % solids). This indicates that high solids is a potential driver of sensitivity to shear, but that a resilient microbial community can also bestow resilience. Sensitivity of methanogens to centrifuging does not rule out centrifuges for recuperative thickening (particularly where hydrolysis is rate-limiting), but may impose a maximum return rate to avoid digester failure...|$|R
