5|$|During summer {{holidays}} {{with his family}} in Dublin he met {{and fell in love with}} Cherrie Matheson, a friend of one of his cousins and a member of the Plymouth Brethren. He proposed to her in 1895 <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> next year, but she turned him down on both occasions because of their differing views on religion. This rejection affected Synge greatly and reinforced his determination to spend as much time as possible outside Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In June 1942, {{as part of}} the Japanese Midway operation, the Japanese {{attacked}} the Aleutian islands, off the south coast of Alaska.

5|$|Subject Committees are {{established}} {{at the beginning of}} each parliamentary session, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across Parliament. Typically each committee corresponds with one (or more) of the departments (or ministries) of the Scottish Government. The current Subject Committees in the fourth Session are: Economy, Energy and Tourism; Education and Culture; Health and Sport; Justice; Local Government and Regeneration; Rural Affairs, Climate Change and Environment; Welfare Reform; and Infrastructure and Capital Investment.|$|E

5|$|The B-52B was {{the first}} version to enter service with the USAF on 29 June 1955 with the 93rd Bombardment Wing at Castle AFB, California. This version {{included}} minor changes to engines and avionics, enabling an extra 12,000 pounds of thrust using water injection. Temporary grounding of the aircraft after a crash in February 1956 <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> following July caused training delays, and at mid-year there were still no combat-ready B-52 crews.|$|E
5|$|Trollope has {{described}} again <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> ravages of love... His story is always primarily a love-story, and a love-story constructed on an inveterate system. There {{is a young}} lady who has two lovers, or {{a young man who}} has two sweethearts; we are treated to the innumerable forms in which this predicament may present itself and the consequences, sometimes pathetic, sometimes grotesque, which spring from such false situations.|$|E
5|$|After the US {{strikes on}} Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, Blair {{released}} a statement supporting the actions; he lent military support to America's 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In March 2003, the Labour government, fearing Saddam Hussein's alleged access to weapons of mass destruction, participated in the American-led invasion of Iraq. British intervention in Iraq promoted public protest. Crowds numbering 400,000 and more demonstrated in October 2002, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> following spring. On 15th February 2003, over 1,000,000 people demonstrated {{against the war in}} Iraq, and 60,000 marched in Manchester before the Labour Party Conference, with the demonstrators' issues including British occupation of Afghanistan and the forthcoming invasion of Iraq.|$|E

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea <b>and</b> <b>again,</b> <b>the</b> high cost of this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during {{the whole of the}} 1980s.|$|E
5|$|At Issus in 333BC, {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Darius, {{he used the}} same deployment, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels {{to break up the}} phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the British pursuit, Bompart {{nevertheless}} {{continued to}} the north. Countess followed closely, and was joined on 18 September by HMS Amelia under Captain Charles Herbert. Initially {{north of the}} French, Amelia had spotted the chase the previous day and caught up during the night by passing silently through Bompart's squadron. The next day, Bompart attempted to throw off his pursuers by feinting towards Lorient, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> following day by feinting south, as if travelling towards the Antilles. However, the British captains remained on track, and by 20 September were only nine miles from Bompart's force, which was continuing south-west as though sailing for the Americas. HMS Anson, a large razee frigate under Captain Philip Charles Durham, joined the British force on 20 September.|$|E

5|$|Below the locks, a five-arched red {{sandstone}} viaduct, {{constructed in}} 1837, crosses the valley. It {{was built by}} Joseph Locke, and carried the Grand Junction Railway. Hunt's locks also consist of a pair, the smaller one from the 1860s and the larger one, with three sets of gates, from the 1890s. Steel semaphore signals control access to the locks, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> movement of the gates employs a Pelton turbine. The weir {{to the east of}} the locks has a walkway supported by rusticated piers and five cast iron arches, which also support the floodgates. The structure is Baroque in style.|$|E
5|$|By 1790, on the {{political}} front, the Commonwealth had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed, giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established {{the separation of the}} three branches of government, and eliminated the abuses of Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russia's permission, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> Empress Catherine II was angered; arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France. Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.|$|E
5|$|Its first {{involvement}} {{came during}} the 2004 series, where the home Great Britain and Ireland national team defeated the Australians 24–12, with Terry Newton and Andy Farrell both scoring in their home town of Wigan. The venue was again selected for the 2005 series, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> match was between Great Britain and Australia—this time the home team lost 6–20—with Greater Manchester born Adrian Morley scoring Great Britain's solitary try. Both matches were complete sell-outs, each having attendances above 25,000. The match in 2004 was the third highest attendance of the series, coming behind a match at the City of Manchester Stadium between Great Britain and Australia, and the series final between the same two teams at Elland Road.|$|E

5|$|Music for a Time of War is a 2011 concert {{program and}} {{subsequent}} album by the Oregon Symphony under the artistic direction of Carlos Kalmar. The program {{consists of four}} compositions inspired by war: Charles Ives The Unanswered Question (1906), John Adams The Wound-Dresser (1989), Benjamin Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem (1940) and Ralph Vaughan Williams Symphony No. 4 (1935). The program was performed on May 7, 2011, at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in Portland, Oregon, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> following day. Both concerts were recorded for album release. On May 12, the Oregon Symphony repeated the program at the inaugural Spring for Music Festival, at Carnegie Hall. The performance was broadcast live by KQAC and WQXR-FM, the classical radio stations serving Portland and the New York City metropolitan area, respectively. The concerts marked the Oregon Symphony's first performances of The Wound-Dresser as well as guest baritone Sanford Sylvan's debut with the company.|$|E
5|$|Non-citizens {{detained}} {{under the}} ISA {{do not have}} a right to make representations to an advisory board.

Any decision on such representations by the Minister is final and cannot be called into question in any court. The burden of proving that a person is a citizen lies on the person claiming to be one, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> Minister's decision on the matter is final.|$|E
5|$|Progressive Field {{set a new}} MLB record between June 12, 1995 and April 4, 2001 {{in selling}} out 455 {{straight}} games. Demand for tickets {{was so great that}} all 81 home games were sold out before opening day in five separate seasons. The Indians retired the number 455 in honor of the sellout record. The Boston Red Sox later surpassed this record when Fenway Park recorded 456 straight sellouts on September 9, 2008. The record for the largest attendance at Progressive Field was set in Game 3 of the 1997 ALDS when 45,274 people attended the game. On Saturday, April 2, 2011, the Indians' lowest attendance record was broken with a very small crowd of 9,853, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> following day with an even smaller attendance figure of 8,726.|$|E

5|$|The first {{accusation}} against Sherwood came {{to court}} in early 1697. Richard Capps alleged {{that she had}} used a spell to cause {{the death of his}} bull. The court made no decision, and the Sherwoods filed a defamation suit against Capps that was resolved by a settlement. In 1698, Sherwood was accused by her neighbor John Gisburne of enchanting his pigs and cotton crop. No court action followed this accusation, and another suit for defamation by the Sherwoods failed. In the same year Elizabeth Barnes alleged that Sherwood had assumed the form of a black cat, entered Barnes' home, jumped over her bed, drove and whipped her, and left via the keyhole. Again the allegation was unresolved, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> subsequent defamation action was lost. For each of the failed actions, Sherwood and her husband had to pay court-related costs.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{administration}} {{was marked by}} a relative absence of major military or political conflicts, Titus faced {{a number of major}} disasters during his brief reign. On August 24, 79, barely two months after his accession, Mount Vesuvius erupted, resulting in the almost complete destruction of life and property in the cities and resort communities around the Bay of Naples. The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under metres of stone and lava, killing thousands of citizens. Titus appointed two ex-consuls to organise and coordinate the relief effort, while personally donating large amounts of money from the imperial treasury to aid the victims of the volcano. Additionally, he visited Pompeii once after the eruption <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> following year. The city was lost for nearly 1700 years before its accidental rediscovery in 1748. Since then, its excavation has provided an extraordinarily detailed insight into the life of a city {{at the height of the}} Roman Empire, frozen at the moment it was buried on August 24, 79. The Forum, the baths, many houses, and some out-of-town villas like the Villa of the Mysteries remain surprisingly well preserved. Today, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Italy and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On-going excavations reveal new insights into the Roman history and culture.|$|E
5|$|Congress also {{proposed}} the Fourteenth Amendment to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures {{in a process}} in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, not the president. Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>the</b> President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition. When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.|$|E
