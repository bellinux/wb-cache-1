40|$|DNA-mediated {{transformation}} {{was used}} to correlate function with putative genes from three alternative <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> mating-type loci (<b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 1, <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 3, and <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 4) of Schizophyllum commune. Each DNA was tested in at least nine haploid strains, {{one for each of}} the nine <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> mating types found in the world-wide population of S. commune. The Y and Z genes (tentatively identified by sequence analysis elsewhere) individually activate A alpha-regulated development when transformed into any strain with <b>a</b> different <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> mating type. The only exceptions are when the Y alleles of <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 3 or <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 4 (i. e., Y 3 or Y 4, respectively) are introduced into <b>an</b> <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 1 strain (the <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 1 locus encodes Y 1 but lacks a Z gene). These observations indicate that A alpha-regulated development is activated by the interaction (direct or indirect) of products from different genes (e. g., Z 3 and Y 1) rather than from different alleles of the same gene (e. g., Y 1 and Y 3). Therefore, the activating interaction is of the form ZiYj where i not equal to j and i and j are the <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> mating types from which the Z and Y polypeptides, respectively, are derived. Transformations with truncated or mutagenized genes begin to define essential regions of the genes and their products. Activity is in some cases dependent upon the particular <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> mating type of the recipient. A working hypothesis for the activation of A alpha-regulated development is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> mating locus {{is one of}} four multiallelic loci {{that govern}} sexual {{development}} in the basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune. We have determined the nucleotide sequence encoding three <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> mating types, <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 1, <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 3, and <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 4. We have found that the locus for <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 3 and <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 4 consists of two genes: Y and Z. The locus for <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 1 encodes only one gene, Y. The Z polypeptides encoded by different alleles exhibit 42 % identity. The Y polypeptides exhibit 49 - 54 % identity. The finding that the deduced Z and Y polypeptides have homeodomain motifs suggests that these polypeptides may be DNA-binding regulatory proteins that control the expression of developmental genes. The deduced Z polypeptide also has acidic regions that might be functionally analogous to the acidic regions in yeast GAL 4 and GCN 4 that activate transcription. The Y polypeptide has a serine-rich region and a basic region that shows some identity to the lysine-rich region of H 1 histones...|$|R
40|$|Synthesis of Sp and Rp diastereomers of Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S {{has been}} {{characterized}} in two enzymatic systems, the lysyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli and the Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha,</b> beta-phosphorylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The synthetase {{was able to use}} both (Sp) ATP alpha S and (Rp) ATP alpha S as acceptors of adenylate thus yielding corresponding monothioanalogues of Ap 4 A,(Sp) Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S and (Rp) Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S. No dithiophosphate analogue was formed. Relative synthetase velocities of the formation of Ap 4 A,(Sp) Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S and (Rp) Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S were 1 : 0. 38 : 0. 15, and the computed Km values for (Sp) ATP alpha S and (Rp) ATP alpha S were 0. 48 and 1. 34 mM, respectively. The yeast Ap 4 A phosphorylase synthesized (Sp) Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S and (Rp) Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S using adenosine 5 '-phosphosulfate (APS) as source of adenylate. The adenylate was accepted by corresponding thioanalogues of ATP. In that system, relative velocities of Ap 4 A, (Sp) Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S and (Rp) Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S formation were 1 : 0. 15 : 0. 60. The two isomeric phosphorothioate analogues of Ap 4 A were tested as substrates for the following specific Ap 4 A-degrading enzymes: (asymmetrical) Ap 4 A hydrolase (EC 3. 6. 1. 17) from yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus) seeds hydrolyzed each of the analogues to AMP and the corresponding isomer of ATP alpha S; (symmetrical) Ap 4 A hydrolase (EC 3. 6. 1. 41) from E. coli produced ADP and the corresponding diastereomer of ADP alpha S; and Ap 4 A phosphorylase (EC 2. 7. 7. 53) from S. cerevisiae cleaved the Rp isomer only at the unmodified end yielding ADP and (Rp) ATP alpha S whereas the Sp isomer was degraded non-specifically yielding a mixture of ADP, (Sp) ADP alpha S, ATP and (Sp) ATP alpha S. For all the Ap 4 A-degrading enzymes, the Rp isomer of Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S appeared to be a better substrate than its Sp counterpart; stereoselectivity of the three enzymes for the Ap 4 <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> S diastereomers is 51, 6 and 2. 5, respectively. Basic kinetic parameters of the degradation reactions are presented and structural requirements of the Ap 4 A-metabolizing enzymes with respect to the potential substrates modified at the Ap 4 A-P alpha are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Fermi had {{the idea}} to resort to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, {{on the basis of}} his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted <b>an</b> <b>alpha</b> particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted <b>an</b> <b>alpha</b> particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|E

40|$|Fibrin {{polymerisation}} {{is mediated}} by interactions between knobs 'A' and 'B' exposed by thrombin cleavage, and holes 'a' and 'b'. We demonstrated markedly delayed thrombin-catalysed fibrin polymerisation, through B:b interactions alone, of recombinant gamma D 364 H-fibrinogen with impaired hole 'a'. To determine whether recombinant variant fibrinogens with no release of fibrinopeptide A (FpA) polymerise similarly to gamma D 364 H-fibrinoge, we examined two variant fibrinogens with substitutions altering knob 'A', <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 17 A- and <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 17 C-fibrinogen. We examined thrombin- or batroxobin-catalysed fibrinopeptide release by HPLC, fibrin clot formation by turbidity and fibrin clot structure by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and compared {{the results of the}} variants with those for gamma D 364 H-fibrinogen. Thrombin-catalysed FpA release of <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 17 A-fibrinogen was substantially delayed and none observed for <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 17 C-fibrinogen; fibrinopeptide B (FpB) release was delayed for all variants. All variant fibrinogens showed substantially impaired thrombin-catalysed polymerisation; for <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 17 A-fibrinogen it was delayed less, and for <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 17 C more than for gamma D 364 H-fibrinogen. No variants polymerised with batroxobin, which exposed only knob 'A'. The inhibition of variant fibrinogens' polymerisation was dose-dependent on the concentration of either GPRP or GHRP, and both peptides that block holes 'b'. SEM showed that the variant clots from <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 17 A- and gamma D 364 H-fibrinogen had uniform, ordered fibres, thicker than normal, whereas <b>A</b> <b>alpha</b> 17 C-fibrinogen formed less organised clots with shorter, thinner, and tapered ends. These results demonstrate that FpA release per se is necessary for effective B:b interactions during polymerisation of variant fibrinogens with impaired A:a interactions. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{difference}} between {{the male and female}} of a species apart from their sex organs is called sexual dimorphism, and in this regard little variance exists among the canids. A study of dire wolf remains dated 15,360–14,310YBP and taken from one pit that focused on skull length, canine tooth size, and lower molar length showed little dimorphism, {{similar to that of the}} gray wolf, indicating that dire wolves lived in monogamous pairs. Their large size and highly carnivorous dentition supports the proposal that the dire wolf was a predator that fed on large prey. To kill ungulates larger than themselves, the African wild dog, the dhole, and the gray wolf depend on their jaws as they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with prey, and they work together as a pack consisting of <b>an</b> <b>alpha</b> pair and their offspring from the current and previous years.
