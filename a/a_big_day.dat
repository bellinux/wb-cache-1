40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 yr, {{the number of}} tornadoes {{reported}} in the United States has doubled from about 600 {{per year in the}} 1950 s to around 1200 in the 2000 s. This doubling is likely not related to meteorological causes alone. To account for this increase a simple least squares linear regression was fitted to the annual number of tornado reports. A “big tornado day ” is a single day when numerous tornadoes and/or many tornadoes exceeding a specified intensity threshold were reported anywhere in the country. By defining <b>a</b> <b>big</b> tornado <b>day</b> without considering the spatial distribution of the tornadoes, <b>a</b> <b>big</b> tornado <b>day</b> differs from previous definitions of outbreaks. To address {{the increase in the number}} of reports, the number of reports is compared to the expected number of reports in a year based on linear regression. In addition, the F 1 and greater Fujita-scale record was used in determining <b>a</b> <b>big</b> tornado <b>day</b> because the F 1 and greater series was more stationary over time as opposed to the F 2 and greater series. Thresholds were applied to the data to determine the number and intensities of the tornadoes needed to be considered <b>a</b> <b>big</b> tornado <b>day.</b> Possible threshold values included fractions of the annual expected value associated with the linear regression and fixed numbers for the intensity criterion. Threshold values of 1. 5 % of the expected annual total number of tornadoes and/or at least 8 F 1 and greater tornadoes identified about 18. 1 <b>big</b> tornado <b>days</b> per year. Highe...|$|R

500|$|Shortly after, Byrom joined Northern Premier League First Division side Clitheroe on a {{short-term}} contract. He finished the 2006–07 season top scorer with 11 league goals despite only joining {{the club in}} January 2007, including a hat-trick against Kidsgrove Athletic. However, Byrom's Clitheroe contract expired and Conference North side Southport took him on non-contract terms {{for the start of}} the 2007–08 season, where he scored two goals in two games. Despite being offered a contract by Southport manager Peter Davenport, Byrom opted to re-join Clitheroe in August 2007. On signing a two-year deal with Clitheroe, Byrom said [...] "I thought about giving up football when I left Accrington, but I really enjoyed my time at Clitheroe, they've given me a new lease of life and a licence to do what I want on the park". Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said [...] "this is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>day</b> for Clitheroe. This is one of the biggest signings the club has made. He's a special player and a special talent". In the first half of the 2007–08 season, Byrom scored six goals in all competitions for Clitheroe, which caught the attention of Conference National team Northwich Victoria. He played his last game for the Northern Premier League club in a 3–3 draw with local rivals Rossendale United, a game in which he captained the side for the first time.|$|E
