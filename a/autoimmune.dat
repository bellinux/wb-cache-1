5|$|The {{classification}} of psoriasis as an <b>autoimmune</b> disease has sparked considerable debate. Researchers have proposed differing descriptions of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; some authors have classified them as <b>autoimmune</b> diseases {{while others have}} classified them as distinct from <b>autoimmune</b> diseases and referred to them as immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies {{to certain}} types of {{chromatin}} organization, in particular, nucleosomes, {{have been associated with}} a number of <b>autoimmune</b> diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These are known as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and have also been observed in concert with multiple sclerosis as part of general immune system dysfunction. As in the case of progeria, the role played by the antibodies in inducing the symptoms of <b>autoimmune</b> diseases is not obvious.|$|E
5|$|As the autobodies {{are found}} mainly in {{patients}} that have characteristics of several different <b>autoimmune</b> diseases, the clinical symptoms {{of these patients}} can vary widely. The symptoms that are seen most often are the typical symptoms of the individual <b>autoimmune</b> diseases and include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, myositis and scleroderma. Treatment of these patients is symptomatic and is similar to treatment for the individual <b>autoimmune</b> disease, often involving either immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autoimmune</b> {{thyroiditis}} {{is associated}} with other immune-mediated diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It may occur as part of <b>autoimmune</b> polyendocrine syndrome (type 1 and type 2).|$|E
5|$|Burnet's work on graft-versus-host was in {{collaboration}} with Lone Simonsen between 1960 and 1962. Simonsen had shown in 1957 that when a chick embryo was inoculated intravenously with adult-fowl blood, a graft-versus-host reaction occurred; this {{was known as the}} Simonsen phenomenon. Their work in this system would later help to explain passenger leukocytes in transplantation. The last project he worked on at the Institute was a study with assistant Margaret Holmes of <b>autoimmune</b> disease in the New Zealand black mouse model; this mouse has a high incidence of spontaneous <b>autoimmune</b> hemolytic anemia. They looked at the inheritance of <b>autoimmune</b> disease, and their use of immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide to treat the disease influenced the use of immunosuppressive drugs in human <b>autoimmune</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|Connective tissue {{diseases}} {{are caused by}} a complex array of <b>autoimmune</b> responses that target or affect collagen or ground substance.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{preferred}} {{theory of}} immuno-dysregulation held by most researchers, aphthous stomatitis behaves dissimilarly to <b>autoimmune</b> diseases in many regards. There is no association between aphthous stomatitis and other <b>autoimmune</b> diseases, which often accompany each other; common autoantibodies are not detected, the condition tends to resolve spontaneously with advancing age rather than worsen, and usually serum immunoglobulins are at normal levels.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{generating}} the activated form of NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression, proteasomal activity {{has been linked to}} inflammatory and <b>autoimmune</b> diseases. Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in <b>autoimmune</b> diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas of the world with sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the <b>autoimmune</b> disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic <b>autoimmune</b> thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E
5|$|Non-genetic, environmental, post-infectious, or psychosocial factors—while not causing Tourette's—can {{influence}} its severity. <b>Autoimmune</b> processes {{may affect}} tic onset and exacerbation in some cases. In 1998, a {{team at the}} US National Institute of Mental Health proposed a hypothesis based on observation of 50 children that both obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and tic disorders may arise in a subset of children {{as a result of}} a poststreptococcal <b>autoimmune</b> process. Children who meet five diagnostic criteria are classified, according to the hypothesis, as having Pediatric <b>Autoimmune</b> Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS). This contentious hypothesis is the focus of clinical and laboratory research, but remains unproven.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} that are closely linked to cerebellar degeneration include the idiopathic progressive neurological disorders multiple system atrophy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome type I, and the <b>autoimmune</b> disorder paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, in which tumors elsewhere in the body elicit an <b>autoimmune</b> response that causes neuronal loss in the cerebellum. Cerebellar atrophy can result from an acute deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) as seen in beriberi and in Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, or from vitamin E deficiency.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{function}} of the adrenal gland may be impaired by conditions such as infections, tumors, genetic disorders and <b>autoimmune</b> diseases, or as {{a side effect of}} medical therapy. These disorders affect the gland either directly (as with infections or <b>autoimmune</b> diseases) or {{as a result of the}} dysregulation of hormone production (as in some types of Cushing's syndrome) leading to an excess or insufficiency of adrenal hormones and the related symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} group's principal investigations concerned {{immunological tolerance}} (the body's acceptance of tissues, {{as opposed to}} rejection), <b>autoimmune</b> haemolytic anaemia (especially in mice), and immune responses to cancer in various animals. In his clinical role, Woodruff started a vascular surgery program and worked {{with the use of}} immunotherapy as a cancer treatment as well as the treatment of <b>autoimmune</b> haemolytic anaemia. However, his most important clinical accomplishments were in kidney transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{polyclonal}} response confers advantages on {{the immune}} system, in particular, greater probability of reacting against pathogens, it also increases chances of developing certain <b>autoimmune</b> diseases {{resulting from the}} reaction of the immune system against native molecules produced within the host.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. <b>Autoimmune</b> problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including <b>autoimmune</b> hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the first}} to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the Mayo Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other <b>autoimmune</b> diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the <b>autoimmune</b> nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in <b>autoimmune</b> diseases, {{inflammatory}} diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common <b>autoimmune</b> diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
5|$|Immunosuppressive {{drugs are}} used to control <b>autoimmune</b> {{disorders}} or inflammation when excessive tissue damage occurs, and to prevent transplant rejection after an organ transplant.|$|E
5|$|LEMS usually {{occurs in}} people over 40 years of age, but may occur at any age. The {{diagnosis}} is usually confirmed with electromyography and blood tests; these also {{distinguish it from}} myasthenia gravis, a related <b>autoimmune</b> neuromuscular disease.|$|E
5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} <b>autoimmune</b> disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an <b>autoimmune</b> reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E
5|$|The term {{pneumonia}} {{is sometimes}} more broadly applied to any condition resulting in {{inflammation of the}} lungs (caused for example by <b>autoimmune</b> diseases, chemical burns or drug reactions); however, this inflammation is more accurately referred to as pneumonitis.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid may be {{affected}} by several diseases. Hyperthyroidism occurs when the gland produces excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, {{the most common cause}} being Graves' disease — an <b>autoimmune</b> disorder. In contrast, hypothyroidism is a state of insufficient thyroid hormone production. Worldwide, the most common cause is iodine deficiency. Thyroid hormones are important for development, and hypothyroidism secondary to iodine deficiency remains the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability. In iodine-sufficient regions, {{the most common cause of}} hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis—also an <b>autoimmune</b> disease. In addition, the thyroid gland may also develop several types of nodules and cancer.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a small}} {{incidence}} of other conditions, such as <b>autoimmune</b> diseases and deafness in Labradors, either congenitally or later in life.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of hypothyroidism without any lumps or masses felt within the thyroid gland {{does not require}} thyroid imaging; however, if the thyroid feels abnormal, diagnostic imaging is then recommended. The presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) makes {{it more likely that}} thyroid nodules are caused by <b>autoimmune</b> thyroiditis, but if there is any doubt, a needle biopsy may be required.|$|E
5|$|Addison's disease {{refers to}} primary hypoadrenalism, {{which is a}} {{deficiency}} in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal gland. In the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly an <b>autoimmune</b> condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells of the adrenal cortex. Worldwide, the disease is more frequently caused by infection, especially from tuberculosis. A distinctive feature of Addison's disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Autoimmune</b> {{disorders}} {{can often}} be traced to antibodies that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{forms of}} human {{leukocyte}} antigen (HLA)especially B46, DR9, DQB1*0303, A2, Bw22, AW19, B17, and DRW8are more common in TPP. Linkage to particular forms of HLA, which plays {{a central role in}} the immune response, might imply an immune system cause, but it is uncertain whether this directly causes TPP or whether it increases the susceptibility to Graves' disease, a known <b>autoimmune</b> disease.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some <b>autoimmune</b> diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|Immune {{complexes}} (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) {{deposited in}} various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes {{between two and}} three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many <b>autoimmune</b> and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|In {{clinical}} immunology, {{levels of}} individual classes of immunoglobulins are measured by nephelometry (or turbidimetry) {{to characterize the}} antibody profile of patient. Elevations in different classes of immunoglobulins are sometimes useful in determining the cause of liver damage in patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear. For example, elevated IgA indicates alcoholic cirrhosis, elevated IgM indicates viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, while IgG is elevated in viral hepatitis, <b>autoimmune</b> hepatitis and cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|LEMS {{may also}} be {{associated}} with <b>autoimmune</b> diseases, such as hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland) or diabetes mellitus type 1. Myasthenia gravis, too, may happen {{in the presence of}} tumors (thymoma, a tumor of the thymus in the chest); people with MG without a tumor and people with LEMS without a tumor have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases. HLA-DR3-B8 (an HLA subtype), in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.|$|E
5|$|Proteasome inhibitors {{have also}} shown promise in {{treating}} <b>autoimmune</b> diseases in animal models. For example, studies in mice bearing human skin grafts found {{a reduction in}} the size of lesions from psoriasis after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. Inhibitors also show positive effects in rodent models of asthma.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is a {{long-lasting}} <b>autoimmune</b> disease {{characterized by}} patches of abnormal skin. These skin patches are typically red, itchy, and scaly. Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage. Injury {{to the skin}} can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which {{is known as the}} Koebner phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous {{adenitis}} is an <b>autoimmune</b> {{disease that}} affects sebaceous glands. It is mainly known {{to occur in}} dogs, particularly poodles and akitas, where it {{is thought to be}} generally autosomal recessively inherited. It has also been described in cats, and one report describes this condition in a rabbit. In these animals, it causes hair loss, though the nature and distribution of the hair loss differs greatly.|$|E
5|$|Several {{proteins}} in the exosome are {{the target of}} autoantibodies in patients with specific <b>autoimmune</b> diseases (especially the PM/Scl overlap syndrome) and some antimetabolic chemotherapies for cancer function by blocking {{the activity of the}} exosome. In addition, mutations in exosome component 3 cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and spinal motor neuron disease.|$|E
5|$|Some self {{reactive}} T cells {{escape the}} thymus {{for a number}} of reasons, mainly {{due to the lack of}} expression of some self antigens in the thymus. Another type of T cell T regulatory cells can down regulate self reactive T cells in the periphery. When immunological tolerance fails, <b>autoimmune</b> diseases can follow.|$|E
