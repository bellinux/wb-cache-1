40|$|The {{growth on}} pseudouridine of two {{pyrimidine}} auxotrophs of Escherichia coli (Bu− and W 63 - 86) was markedly enhanced when glycerol replaced glucose as a carbon source or when adenosine 3 ′: 5 ′-cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> {{was added to}} medium containing glucose. These results indicated that an enzyme catalyzing a reaction in the pathway of pseudouridine conversion to uracil was sensitive to catabolite repression. The following pathway is proposed for pseudouridine utilization: [Formula: see text] [Formula: see text] Pseudouridylate synthetase was sensitive to catabolite repression in strains Bu− and W 63 - 86. In contrast, strains B 5 RU and W 5 RU, mutants of Bu− and W 63 - 86 which were selected {{for their ability to}} grow rapidly on pseudouridine in the presence of glucose, had high levels of pseudouridylate synthetase in the presence of glucose. In the case of B 5 RU but not W 5 RU, synthetase activity was greater in cells grown on glycerol or on glucose plus adenosine 3 ′: 5 -cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> than on glucose...|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{compound of}} a series of phosphoric acids is sometimes called by its common name, orthophosphoric acid, but more often called by its IUPAC name, simply phosphoric acid, by both non-technical people and even many chemists. It has also been called <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid.</b> The chemical formula of orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4 and its chemical structure is shown in the illustration below. Two or more orthophosphoric acid molecules can be joined by condensation into larger molecules by elimination of water. This way, a series of polyphosphoric acids can be obtained.|$|R
40|$|Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +-ionophores X 537 A and A 23, 187 (10 (- 7) - 10 (- 6) M) induced {{the release}} of adenine {{nucleotides}} adenosine diphosphate (ADP, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), serotonin, beta-glucuronidase, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 + from washed human platelets. Enzymes present in the cytoplasm or mitochondria, and Zn 2 + were not released. The rate of ATP and Ca 2 + release measured by firefly lantern extract and murexide dye, respectively, was equivalent to that produced by the physiological stimulant thrombin. Ionophore-induced release of ADP, and serotonin was substantially (approximately 60 %) but not completely inhibited by EGTA, EDTA, and high extracellular Mg 2 +, without significant reduction of Ca 2 + release. The ionophore-induced release reaction is therefore partly dependent upon uptake of extracellular Ca 2 + (demonstrated using 45 Ca), but also occurs to a significant extent due to release into the cytoplasm of intracellular Ca 2 +. The ionophore-induced release reaction and aggregation of platelets could be blocked by prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The effects of PGE 1, and N 6, O 2 - dibutyryl adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (dibutyryl cAMP) were synergistically potentiated by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline. It is proposed that Ca 2 + is the physiological trigger for platelet secretion and aggregation and that its intracellular effects are strongly modulated by adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (cyclic AMP) ...|$|R
40|$|Catecholamines bound covalently to {{glass beads}} {{have been found}} to have {{biological}} activity in several systems. Experimental evidence has been found that immobilized epinephrine and isoproterenol accelerate the heart rate in dogs, chick embryo, and chick heart cells grown in culture, whereas immobilized propranolol results in a decrease in heart rate. Isoproterenol bound to glass beads has also been shown to markedly increase the level of adenosine 3 ′: 5 ′-cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> in glial cells. The effects of the immobilized catecholamines are of longer duration than when the compounds are administered in solution. The present data indicate that the compounds are exerting their action when bound to the beads...|$|R
40|$|Incubation of rat {{hepatoma}} {{cells with}} cAMP derivatives stimulates cell-associated plasminogen activator activity 8 - to 22 -fold and extracellular plasminogen activator activity 30 - to 1300 -fold. This time- and concentration-dependent increase {{is enhanced by}} phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, decreases the plasminogen activator activity of these cells, probably through induction of an inhibitor. Paradoxically, dexamethasone, added simultaneously with cAMP derivatives causes a further 4 -fold enhancement of the cAMP-mediated stimulation of plasminogen activator activity. Dexamethasone also alters {{the time course of}} cAMP-mediated enhancement of plasminogen activator activity: increased protease activity is detected at 4 hr in cells incubated with 8 -bromoadenosine- 3 ': 5 '-cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> and 1 -methyl- 3 -isobutylxanthine but not until 12 hr in cells incubated with dexamethasone as well. Glucocorticoids thus exert two separate and opposite effects on plasminogen activator activity: induction of an inhibitor and amplification of cyclic nucleotide action. Although permissive and synergistic effects of dexamethasone on cyclic nucleotide action have been reported previously, glucocorticoid regulation of plasminogen activator activity is unique in that the amplification of cyclic nucleotide effects by dexamethasone opposes its regulatory action toward a specific enzyme...|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} kinds of phosphoric acids and phosphates. Of the many {{phosphorus}} oxoacids, the phosphoric acids constitute {{the largest and most}} diverse group. The simplest phosphoric acid series begins with <b>monophosphoric</b> (orthophosphoric) <b>acid,</b> continues with many oligophosphoric acids such as diphosphoric (pyrophosphoric) acid and concludes in the polyphosphoric acids. But, phosphoric acid units can bind together into rings or cyclic structures, chains (catenas), or branched structures, with various combinations possible. Each of these can form phosphates (salts or esters of phosphoric acids).|$|R
40|$|Human monocytes cultured on surface-bound immune {{complexes}} {{exhibited a}} loss of ability to form rosettes with IgG-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (EA). This loss was not a result of inhibition of Fc receptors by solubilized complexes nor of release of soluble factors by the cells. Loss of EA rosetting was not prevented by culture of monocytes at 4 degrees C, or by treatment with colchicine, cytochalasin B, or local anethetic agents. These results suggested that the loss was not secondary to capping or interiorization of Fc receptors. The results of other studies indicated that the Fc receptors were not damaged by lysosomal enzymes or oxygen radicals. Maintenance of EA rosetting ability of monocytes cultured on surface-bound immune complexes was seen after a 3 -h preincubation of the cells in 100 mM 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (2 dG). A similar preincubation in ATP or in 8 -bromoadenosine 3 ': 5 '- cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> plus the phosphodiesterase inhibitor methyl isobutyl xanthine led to a partial loss of EA rosetting of cells on plain fibrin and to a partial reversal {{of the effects of}} 2 dG seen with cells on complexes. We conclude that EA rosetting of monocytes cultured on surface-bound immune complexes is reduced by cyclic nucleotide- mediated effects on Fc receptor number or function...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} polyadenylic: polyundylic acid {{complexes}} (poly A:U) {{on the amount}} of antibody on the surface of various populations of mouse lymphoid cells has been investigated by means of a sensitive measure of such activity—the binding by primed cell populations of β-galactosidase (βGZ) as an antigen. The sensitivity derives from the liberation of fluorescein from an artificial substrate, fluorescein-di-β-galactopyranoside (FDβG). After incubation with 100 ng/ml of poly A:U, only 40 % of the cells previously showing antigen-binding were still active. The optimum range of activity lay between 0. 01 – 1. 0 µg/ml poly A:U. Such cells showed increased RNA and protein synthesis as indicated by [3 H]uridine and [14 C]amino acid incorporation. The polynucleotide effect was abolished by incubation of the cells with sodium azide or iodoacetate, but not by puromycin. When the proteins on the cell surface were labeled by 125 I, poly A:U caused their release into the medium. Reports by others that the enhancing effect of polynucleotides on the immune response involves the adenylcyclase system are consistent with the finding reported here that reduction of binding by dibutryl 5 '-cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (cAMP) and poly A:U were parallel in extent, and that theophylline and poly A:U acted synergistically in suboptimal concentrations of each...|$|R
40|$|Glomerular cells {{grown in}} a defined medium {{consisting}} of Waymouth's MB 752 / 1 plus insulin, transferrin, sodium pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids {{were shown to}} require prostaglandin E 1 and either fibronectin, laminin, of heparan sulfate to form a confluent monolayer. Under these conditions cells did not grow on type IV collagen. Dibutyryladenosine- 3, 5 -cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> decreased the time needed for the cells to reach confluency. The results suggest a requirement for extracellular matrix molecules for growth of glomerular cells in defined medium, probably a requirement of adhesive molecules for cell attachment. The role of prostaglandins is less clear, but prostaglandin appears to be necessary for cell division. Since the cells growing in defined medium containing prostaglandin E 1 and extracellular matrix molecules are epithelial in morphology, we suggest they may represent the stem cell precursors of either glomerular visceral or parietal epithelial cells, or both. The growth of glomerular cells in medium containing prostaglandins and extracellular matrix molecules is completely inhibited by sodium butyrate. Immunofluorescent {{studies show that the}} majority of cells show only faint staining for fibronectin along peripheral cell membranes; this result is in contrast to the bright stippled perinuclear pattern seen in cells grown in calf serum. The results are discussed in terms of the pathogenesis of glomerular lesions involving epithelial cells (eg. crescents) ...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{potential}} {{was recorded}} intracellularly from rod outer segments in the isolated retina of Bufo marinus. The {{composition of the}} solution flowing over the exposed receptor side of the retina was changed rapidly and ionophoretic injections were made into single rod outer segments. Lowering the external Ca 2 + concentration, adding 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX) to the bath, or ionophoretic injections of guanosine- 3 ': 5 '-cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (cGMP) lead to depolarization of the rod membrane {{and an increase in}} the maximum peak amplitude of the receptor potential. Lowering the Ca 2 + concentration or adding IBMX to the bath shifted the curve of response amplitude vs. long intensity of stimulus and sigma (intensity at half saturation) towards dimmer intensities. The ionophoresis of cGMP did not shift the position of the curve along the log stimulus intensity axis. Changing the external concentration of Ca or IBMX changes the form of the response amplitude vs. log intensity curve. This is most obvious at dim intensities. The amplitude of receptor potentials elicited by dim light was decreased by lowering Ca but increased by IBMX. The kinetics of receptor potentials were affected differently by solutions with a low Ca 2 + concentration and those containing IBMX. The recovery phase of the receptor potential was slightly accelerated in the low Ca solution, whereas it was greatly slowed in the IBMX-containing solution. The ionophoretic injection of cGMP also slowed the recovery of the receptor potential. The data presented do not support the proposal that cGMP alone maintains membrane voltage in the dark and that the light-induced hydrolysis of cGMP results in the light-induced decrease in membrane conductance underlying the receptor potential. It is more likely that both Ca 2 + and cGMP interact in the modulation of membrane voltage, perhaps as interrelated messengers...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} which utilized elutriation {{was developed}} which permitted {{the separation of}} two populations of luteal cells from enzymatically dispersed corpora lutea taken from superovulated ewes on the 10 - 12 th day of the estrous cycle. One population consisted of cells which measured 23 - 35 pm in diameter, while the other consisted of cells with a diameter of 12 - 22 pm. Prepara-tions of both cell types were analyzed for rate of secretion of progesterone, responsiveness to secretagogues, and number of specific binding sites for luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin (LH/hCG), and prostaglandins E 2 and F 2 a (PGE 2 and PGF 2 a). Without stimulation, the secretion of progesterone by large cells was approximately 20 -fold greater than for {{an equal number of}} small luteal cells. However, the ability of large luteal cells to respond to LH (100 ng/mI) or N 6, 02 -dibutyryladenosine 3 ’: 5 ’-cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (dbcAMP, 10 mM) was minimal and approximately 10 % of that obtained with small luteal cells. Marked differences were also observed between the two cell types with respect to the number of specific binding sites for LH/hCG, PGE 2 and PGF 2 a. The large cells had very few receptors for LH/hCG compared to small cells (3074 receptors/large cell vs. 33, 260 /small cell during the breeding season). The majority of receptors for prostaglandins was found in large cells (68, 143 sites of PGF 2 a and 10, 955 sites for PGE 2 /large cells; 2115 sites for PGF 2 a and 904 sites for PGE 2 /small cell). These data suggest that functional differences exist between the large and small steroidogenic cells in the corpus luteum of the ewe. The large luteal cells appear to secrete most of the proges-terone produced by the corpus luteum, however, this secretion appears to be independent of LH and dbcAMP. In contrast, the small luteal cells secrete minimal quantities of progesterone in the unstimnulated state but respond dramatically to LH or dbcAMP...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{contractility}} and {{the levels}} of adenosine 3 ': 5 '-cyclic <b>monophosphoric</b> <b>acid</b> (cAMP) were assessed in isolated cat cardiac muscle in response to soluble isoproterenol and isoproterenol immobilized on glass beads. Drug-induced positive inotropic responses were compared to the maximum isometric force achieved with paired electrical stimulation, a potent physiological inotropic stimulus. Isoproterenol (1 muM) in solution increased the force of contraction 0. 832 plus or minus 0. 165 g at 60 sec in eight muscles tested, which at 60 and 120 sec averaged 65. 5 plus or minus 6. 5 % and 82. 9 plus or minus 8. 8 %, respectively, of the force with paired electrical stimulation. Isoproterenol immobilized on glass beads gave positive inotropic responses similar to those for the soluble form of the drug. Placement of only three isoproterenol-glass beads on the muscles increased the force of contraction 0. 742 plus or minus 0. 166 g at 60 sec (n equals 11), which at 60 and 120 sec averaged 45. 1 plus or minus 7. 0 % and 58. 6 plus or minus 6. 4 %, respectively, of the force with paired electrical stimulation. The magnitude of this response indicates that the increased force was developed by at least 60 % of the cells in each muscle. Control levels of cAMP were 0. 527 plus or minus 0. 049 pmol/mg of tissue wet weight, n equals 11. cAMP levels 60 sec after 1 muM soluble isoproterenol was added were 1. 212 plus or minus 0. 085 pmol/mg; in contrast, {{the levels of}} cAMP in response to isoproterenol immobilized on glass beads at 60 sec were 0. 490 plus or minus 0. 060 pmol/mg, {{not significantly different from}} control levels. These data indicate that cAMP may not be involved in the propagation of the inotropic response that must have occurred in these cardiac muscles and raise questions as to the physiological significance of the large cAMP increases that occur in response to soluble drugs and hormones...|$|R
