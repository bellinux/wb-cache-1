5|$|Giacomo Meyerbeer's {{early studies}} {{had been in}} Germany, but from 1816 to 1825 he worked in Italy. There he studied opera, then {{dominated}} by Gioachino Rossini, and wrote his own Italian operas, which were moderately successful and also had some performances in other European countries. The success of Il crociato in Egitto (1824) throughout Europe, including at Paris in 1825, persuaded Meyerbeer, who was already thirty-three years old, to fulfil at last his ambition to base himself in Paris, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> a suitable libretto for an opera to be launched there.|$|E

5|$|The {{constant}} {{glare of}} celebrity and the tribulations {{of the season}} forced Bradman to reappraise his life outside the game <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> a career away from his cricketing fame. Harry Hodgetts, a South Australian delegate to the Board of Control, offered Bradman work as a stockbroker if he would relocate to Adelaide and captain South Australia (SA). Unknown to the public, the SA Cricket Association (SACA) instigated Hodgetts' approach and subsidised Bradman's wage. Although his wife was hesitant about moving, Bradman eventually agreed to the deal in February 1934.|$|E

In early 1962, official support emerged {{in the form of the}} Operational Requirements branch of the Ministry of Aviation, which approached the Treasury seeking its sanction of a batch of nine production-standard aircraft to be operated by an evaluation unit to be administered by the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In light of open interest expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with the procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E

Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville (titled Marquess of Chandos following the death of his grandfather Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos in 1839) was appointed chairman of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) on 27May1857. After {{the death of his father}} on 29July1861 he became 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and resigned from chairmanship of the LNWR, returning to Wotton House to manage the family's estates. His efforts to pay debts incurred by his father earned praise from Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, and in 1875 he was appointed Governor of Madras, serving until 1880.|$|E

40|$|People {{may view}} {{counseling}} {{as a last}} resort to help with problems. Individuals may utilize other resources, such as friends and family, before seeking professional help (Hinson 2 ̆ 6 Swanson, 1993). Although the research on why people decide to avoid mental health counseling is abundant, the literature is unclear as to whether certain aspects of one’s life can affect whether or not an individual will seek counseling. Participants will complete several online measures {{to examine the relationship between}} gender, culture, shame, and stigma on one’s attitude <b>and</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> counseling. A series of One-Way Analysis of Variances will be conducted to determine if gender and cultural background affects self-stigma, public stigma <b>and</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> counseling. I predict that men will have more negative attitudes towards counseling than women and will be less willing <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> counseling services than women. I also predict that Caucasians will have more positive attitudes towards counseling <b>and</b> more willingness <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> help than people of other racial backgrounds. Lastly, I predict that both self-stigma and public stigma will be correlated <b>to</b> ones attitudes <b>and</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> counseling; however, self-stigma will have a larger correlation than public stigma...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the mediating roles of perceived social support and psychological distress {{on the relationship between}} adult attachment and help-seeking intentions. Participants were 355 college students at a large Midwestern university. The structural equation model results indicated that attachment anxiety in individuals was positively related <b>to</b> acknowledging distress <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>seeking</b> help. Conversely, individuals with attachment avoidance denied their distress <b>and</b> were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> help. However, both individuals with attachment anxiety and individuals with avoidance also perceived less social support, which negatively contributed to their experience of distress, and their distress then positively contributed to their help-seeking intention. Furthermore, attachment anxiety and avoidance, social support, and distress explained 17 % of the variance in intent <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> help...|$|R
