5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1950 season, Linde signed a new {{contract}} with the Indians, but was released in February and sent to the Portland Beavers in the PCL. Over the course of the season, Linde won 5 games and lost 13 in 47 appearances, 18 of them starts, and amassed an ERA of 4.66. The following year, in 1951, Linde became a regular starter on the team, and before the end of April he had won as many games as he had won <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> year. He finished the season with a 12–12 record and a 4.29 ERA in 32 starts. In 1952, Linde remained part of the core starting rotation of the past couple years alongside Red Adams and Marino Pieretti. His performances included one against the Angels in which Linde kept the team to five hits as the Beavers won 4–3 in 11 innings. He won 11 games, lost 15, threw 119 strikeouts, and brought his ERA down to 3.10 in 41 season appearances, 28 of them starts. In 1953, Linde started the season strong unlike his fellow pitchers, opening his season with a 2–1 victory against the Angels on April 3. In early May, he ended Ted Beard's streak of hitting safely in 12 straight at-bats, which tied the PCL record at the time. Shortly afterward, Linde won what was considered an odd performance as he allowed 15 hits and 20 runners on base, yet won a game against the Sacramento Solons 8–3. In his final professional season, Linde pitched in 36 games and finished with a 13–10 record and a 3.36 ERA.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his second}} {{appearance}} of the season, starter Jaime García turned in a career start against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 14. He pitched a complete game, one-hit shutout while striking out a career-high 13 batters and inducing 13 ground outs as St. Louis won, 7–0. He became the first left-handed pitcher in franchise history to achieve a one-hit shutout while striking out at least 13. [...] The 13 strikeouts were the most by a lefty since Steve Carlton struck out 16 in 1970, with García posting a game score of 97, a season-high for MLB through April 14. [...] The Cardinals {{did not have a}} nine-inning complete game by a starter <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> season.

[...] The 1896 Englewood team, led by Talcott and end Clayton Teetzel, won the Cook County football championship. [...] The season ended with a 386 victory over Hyde Park, which was described in the Englewood High School newspaper as follows: [...] "The final game with Hyde Park...was the greatest of all. To defeat our ancient rivals was the happiest ambition of the team. The defeat of '95 still rankles in the breasts of seven of the team, and they were determined to do or die. 'It was a glorious victory,' the score being 38 to 6, when time was called because of darkness with ten minutes yet to play." ...|$|E
