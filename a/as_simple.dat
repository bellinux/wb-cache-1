3000|$|... scoring at the exon {{level in}} effect designates the exon as the {{fundamental}} unit being counted {{rather than the}} gene, this avoids weighing more complex genes the same <b>as</b> <b>simpler</b> genes (that have fewer exons).|$|R
5|$|Bismuth {{oxychloride}} (BiOCl, {{see figure}} at right) and bismuth oxynitrate (BiONO3) stoichiometrically appear <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> anionic salts of the bismuthyl(III) cation (BiO+) which commonly occurs in aqueous bismuth compounds. However, {{in the case}} of BiOCl, the salt crystal forms in a structure of alternating plates of Bi, O, and Cl atoms, with each oxygen coordinating with four bismuth atoms in the adjacent plane. This mineral compound is used as a pigment and cosmetic (see below).|$|E
5|$|Breeding convicts is <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> {{as having}} a male and a female in the same tank with {{adequate}} water quality and feeding. There is no special conditioning required. Due to their prolific breeding in captivity, {{there is a very}} low demand for Convict fry, and one may easily find their aquarium overstocked with an inbreeding population of Convicts without any avenues for adoption.|$|E
5|$|Coexist {{features}} a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little dynamism, and experimentation with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse elements such <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Smith's production incorporates both programmed beats and live percussion instruments. Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, loneliness, and intimacy. The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, address a failing relationship {{and changes in}} a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors.|$|E
50|$|An {{engine that}} does not use {{compounding}} is referred to <b>as</b> a <b>simple</b> engine, {{particularly in the case}} of a steam locomotive, or more precisely <b>as</b> a <b>simple</b> expansion engine, particularly {{in the case of a}} marine steam engine.|$|R
50|$|Kinetic {{diagrams}} are {{not required}} to solve dynamics problems; their use in teaching dynamics is argued against by some in favor of other methods that they view <b>as</b> <b>simpler.</b> They appear in some dynamics texts but are absent in others.|$|R
50|$|Graves Superieur AOC is an {{appellation}} for sweet {{white wine}} covering {{the same area}} as Graves AOC. The wines are generally considered <b>as</b> <b>simpler</b> than those of Cérons AOC. About 500 ha of vineyards were dedicated {{to the production of}} Graves Supérieures in 2004.|$|R
5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{structure}} materials may be <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as mud, or mud {{mixed with}} straw to make cob. Sturdy dwellings may be also built from sod or turf. Soil may be stabilized {{by the addition}} of lime or cement, and may be compacted into rammed earth. Construction is faster with pre-formed adobe or mudbricks, compressed earth blocks, earthbags or fired clay bricks.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{some plants}} use fatty acid derivates, amino acids and even {{peptides}} as defenses. The cholinergic toxine, cicutoxin of water hemlock, is a polyyne {{derived from the}} fatty acid metabolism. β-N-Oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> amino acid {{is used by the}} sweet pea which leads also to intoxication in humans. The synthesis of fluoroacetate in several plants {{is an example of the}} use of small molecules to disrupt the metabolism of herbivores, in this case the citric acid cycle.|$|E
50|$|PMC, in theory, can {{scale to}} sizes {{much smaller than}} flash, {{theoretically}} {{as small as a}} few ion widths wide. Copper ions are about 0.75 angstroms, so line widths on the order of nanometers seem possible. PMC was promoted <b>as</b> <b>simpler</b> in layout than flash.|$|R

30|$|Every {{test signal}} is 10, 000 samples long, {{equivalent}} to 50  s time. We {{want to show}} how normal brain activity looks like in terms of complexity (the four entropies already mentioned) with respect to other typical signals. As expected, <b>as</b> <b>simpler</b> the signal <b>as</b> lower its complexity measures.|$|R
5|$|Mechanical {{pest control}} {{is the use}} of {{hands-on}} techniques as well <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> equipment and devices, that provides a protective barrier between plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage {{and is one of the}} oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.|$|E
5|$|Musical accompaniment may be <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as {{clapping}} {{hands and}} stomping feet, but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers, clappers, drums and talking drums, flutes, horns, rattles, scrapers, stringed instruments, whistles, and xylophones; the exact combination varies with ethnic group and region. Some performers sing complete songs by themselves, {{accompanied by a}} harplike instrument.|$|E
5|$|Some {{philosophers}} and Christians resisted {{the demands of}} the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted, and the rich retreated to the more limited self-sufficiency of their country estates. As an urban lifestyle came to be associated with decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen <b>as</b> <b>simple,</b> virtuous ways of life.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{struggled in}} devising gameplay features {{that would be}} enjoyed by the fans of the series. One of the hardest tasks chief director Kiyoshi Mizuki was assigned {{to do was to}} attract people who had no prior experience with the series; he decided to make the gameplay <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as possible. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto presented the staff with a variety of opinions which they in turn would have to incorporate into the game the best way possible. Miyamoto let the team decide which graphics they wanted to use without restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The film's opening voiceover from Wilton {{introduces}} its {{themes of}} chance and fate, which he characterises <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> luck, to him all-important. The sequence establishes the protagonist as an introvert, {{a man who}} mediates his experience of the world through deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from the outer world and that ramifications therein {{pale in comparison to}} the purity of interior experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{illustrations}} {{provide insight}} into life and festivities at the Heian Palace; which sometimes consisted of something <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as games on the lake although those might have been perceived differently {{at the time of}} manufacture. Like other picture scrolls on court life such as the Genji Monogatari Emaki or the Pillow Book Emaki (Makura no Sōshi Emaki) they provide valuable information on the architectural shinden-zukuri style (particularly on interiors) which is characterized by a mixture of Tang and traditional Japanese influences.|$|E

5|$|The striped honeyeater breeds {{throughout}} its distribution range, usually <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> pairs, with both sexes building the nest, incubating and feeding the young. However cooperative breeding has been observed, {{with a third}} adult bird involved in feeding nestlings. It nests solitarily, and pairs use the same or adjoining trees for nesting over two or more seasons.|$|E
5|$|Their {{answer was}} {{surprising}} in two ways. First, they proved that there were, in fact, {{limits to what}} mathematical logic could accomplish. But second (and more important for AI) their work suggested that, within these limits, any form of mathematical reasoning could be mechanized. The Church-Turing thesis implied that a mechanical device, shuffling symbols <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> as 0 and 1, could imitate any conceivable process of mathematical deduction. The key insight was the Turing machine—a simple theoretical construct that captured the essence of abstract symbol manipulation. This invention would inspire a handful of scientists to begin discussing the possibility of thinking machines.|$|E
5|$|American {{publisher}} William Randolph Hearst bought {{parts of}} the monastery in 1931 {{with the intention of}} using its stones in the construction of a grand and fanciful castle at Wyntoon, California, but after some 10,000 stones were removed and shipped, they were abandoned in San Francisco for decades. These stones are now in various locations around California: the old church portal was erected at the University of San Francisco, and the chapter house was reassembled by Trappist monks at the Abbey of New Clairvaux in Vina, California. Other stones are serving <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> decorative elements in Golden Gate Park's botanical garden. To support the chapter house project, a line of Belgian-style beers was produced by Sierra Nevada Brewing Company under the Ovila Abbey brand.|$|E
