However, in September 2007, DJ Kay Slay revealed that he and Papoose had left Jive, commenting that they had [...] "almost [...] victims of A hell."

2500|$|In 1973, film {{producer}} George Roy Hill contacted Schuller and Rifkin separately, asking each man {{to write the}} score for a film project he was working on: The Sting. Both men turned down the request because of previous commitments. Instead Hill found Marvin Hamlisch available, and brought him into the project as composer. Hamlisch lightly adapted Joplin's music for The Sting, for which he won an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and Adaptation on April 2, 1974. His version of [...] "The Entertainer" [...] reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the American Top 40 music chart on May 18, 1974, prompting The New York Times to write, [...] "The whole nation has begun to take notice." [...] Thanks to the film and its score, Joplin's work became appreciated in both the popular and classical music world, becoming (in the words of music magazine Record World), the [...] "classical phenomenon of the decade." [...] Rifkin later said of the film soundtrack that Hamlisch lifted his piano adaptations directly from Rifkin's style and his band adaptations from Schuller's style. Schuller said Hamlisch, [...] "...got the Oscar for music he didn't write (since it is by Joplin) and arrangements he didn't write, and 'editions' he didn't make. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> upset by that, but that's show biz!" ...|$|E

2500|$|PVRIS {{planned to}} call the album Haunt or have it self-titled, however they were quite indecisive. Eventually they agreed on naming it {{after one of the}} songs, [...] "White Noise".

She explained that the album's sound was [...] "rock mixed with electronic/pop kind of stuff", resulting in [...] "a lot of different vibes throughout the album." [...] Gunnulfsen was inspired by Saosin, Circa Survive, Ellie Goulding, Rihanna, and The Weeknd. Gavin Lloyd of Classic Rock wrote that the album featured [...] "infectious rock" [...] done by the likes of Paramore and We Are the In Crowd, and [...] "dark electro-pop" [...] performed by artists such as Purity Ring and Banks. Natasha Van Duser of Inked compared the [...] "steady bass lines, groovy backbeats, and melodic vocals" [...] to the likes of Taylor Swift's 1989 (2014).|$|E
