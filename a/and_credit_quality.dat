50|$|OOCRE is {{distinct}} from commercial investment property and is viewed differently. In investment properties the building generates cash flow that services the banks debt.

By the 1980s, WSFS had expanded from northern New Castle County into Kent and Sussex counties, and went public in 1986 on the NASDAQ market. By the early 1990s the bank was in poor financial shape, and was near bankruptcy. The Board of Directors hired Marvin [...] "Skip" [...] Schoenhals in 1990, and began a dramatic turnaround.

50|$|A power {{purchase}} agreement (PPA), or electricity power agreement, is a contract between two parties, one which generates electricity (the seller) and one which is looking to purchase electricity (the buyer). The PPA defines all of the commercial terms {{for the sale of}} electricity between the two parties, including when the project will begin commercial operation, schedule for delivery of electricity, penalties for under delivery, payment terms, and termination. A PPA is the principal agreement that defines the revenue <b>and</b> <b>credit</b> <b>quality</b> of a generating project and is thus a key instrument of project finance. There are many forms of PPA in use today and they vary according to the needs of buyer, seller, and financing counterparties.|$|E

In particular, the loan supply for northern regions seems more proportionate, and readily responsive to household and firm needs. The interdependence between the dynamics of price formation <b>and</b> <b>credit</b> <b>quality,</b> captured by a vector auto-regression for panel regressions, is also significant, with an intensity that varies according to loan maturity and the evolution of economic and financial variables.

40|$|We {{consider}} an economy where a lender finances loans by issuing a securitized product, <b>and</b> where <b>credit</b> <b>quality</b> {{of the product}} depends on the lender’s screening effort. Under asymmetric information between the lender and investors about the <b>credit</b> <b>quality</b> of potential borrowers, overvaluation of the low-quality securitized product may occur, inducing the lender to not screen the borrowers and to issue a securitized product of low <b>credit</b> <b>quality.</b> A minimum-retention-ratio regulation on the lender is not necessarily effective in solving this incentive problem. Even worse, such retention regulation may discourage the lender’s screening effort and reduce welfare...|$|R

A similar leverage impact for Canadian and U. S. LQ firms suggests that the Canada-U. S. bond market integration has mitigated the financial constraints for Canadian LQ firms.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{borrowing}} constraints on homeownership {{has been well}} established in the literature. Wealth {{is most likely to}} restrict homeownership followed by credit and income. Using recent movers from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and borrowing constraint definitions commonly used in the literature, we examine the impact of these constraints on the probability of homeownership during the housing market boom between 2003 and 2007. We show that whereas the pool of financially constrained households expanded, the marginal impact of borrowing constraints associated with income <b>and</b> <b>credit</b> <b>quality</b> declined during this period. The constraint associated with wealth, however, continued to {{have a negative impact on}} homeownership status, all else equal. The fact that lending standards became less strict is accepted; however the impact of this on homeownership has not been previously studied.

40|$|It {{has been}} long {{recognized}} {{that there are}} a number of barriers that limit access to homeownership for some households, most importantly, downpayment constraints. This paper extends the literature to test for the role of credit quality in limiting access to homeownership. Results show that both wealth <b>and</b> <b>credit</b> <b>quality</b> based constraints significantly reduce the likelihood of whether individuals and households opt to own a home. The wealth constraint has the largest impact, although its importance declined substantially during the 1990 s due to the increased availability of low-downpayment mortgages. In contrast to the declining influence of wealth-based constraints, credit quality based constraints have become more important barriers to homeownership during the 1990 s, mostly reflecting an increase in the number of households with impaired credit quality. ...|$|E
