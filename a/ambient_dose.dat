40|$|The {{accident}} at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant on March 11, 2011, released radioactive material {{into the atmosphere}} and contaminated the land in Fukushima and several neighboring prefectures. Five years after the nuclear disaster, the radiation levels have greatly decreased due to physical decay, weathering, and decontamination operations in Fukushima. The populations of 12 communities were forced to evacuate after the accident; as of March 2016, the evacuation order has been lifted in only a limited area, and permanent habitation is still prohibited {{in most of the}} areas. In order for the government to lift the evacuation order and for individuals to return to their original residential areas, it is important to assess current and future realistic individual external doses. Here, we used personal dosimeters along with the Global Positioning System and Geographic Information System to understand realistic individual external doses and to relate individual external <b>doses,</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>doses,</b> and activity-patterns of individuals in the affected areas in Fukushima. The results showed that the additional individual external doses were well correlated to the additional <b>ambient</b> <b>doses</b> based on the airborne monitoring survey. The results of linear regression analysis suggested that the additional individual external doses were on average about one-fifth that of the additional <b>ambient</b> <b>doses.</b> The reduction factors, which are defined as the ratios of the additional individual external doses to the additional <b>ambient</b> <b>doses,</b> were calculated to be on average 0. 14 and 0. 32 for time spent at home and outdoors, respectively. Analysis of the contribution of various activity patterns to the total individual external dose demonstrated good agreement with the average fraction of time spent daily in each activity, but the contribution due to being outdoors varied widely.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} is a {{key variable}} in the water cycle controlling the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and atmosphere. There {{is a need to}} measure soil moisture across a range of space and time scales. In this thesis, it is explored whether monitoring of terrestrial gamma radiation can be used to obtain soil moisture information. This is of interest because terrestrial dose rate is routinely measured within Europe-wide <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate monitoring networks after the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. If a reliable relationship between measured <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate and soil moisture could be established, {{it may be possible to}} obtain information on European-scale soil moisture variation with a high temporal resolution. The overall aim of this thesis is to assess the accuracy of soil moisture determination from measured <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate. First, the theory of gamma ray attenuation is presented. Here, an exponential equation is established to describe the relation between terrestrial dose rate and soil moisture content. In addition, this theoretical analysis shows that the footprint of a typical dose rate monitoring station at a height of 1 m has a radius of about 7 m. It is also shown that 90 % of the sensor response originates from depths between the top 12 to 25 cm of the soil. The average travel depth of a gamma ray is even shallower, and ranges from 2. 3 to 6. 7 cm depending on soil moisture content and soil density. Finally, this section presents a method to separate the contribution of terrestrial radiation and secondary cosmic radiation from the measured <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate. In this approach, it was assumed that the long-term contribution of secondary cosmic radiation was constant, and that variations were related to changes in air pressure and incoming neutrons. In addition, precipitation effects related to rain- and washout of radon progenies to ground that cause an increase of <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate are considered by excluding time periods with precipitation and time periods less than three hours after precipitation. In the experimental part of this thesis, the accuracy of soil moisture estimation from terrestrial gamma radiation was evaluated using data from four gamma radiation monitoring stations. At each station, four soil moisture sensors were installed at 5 and 15 cm depth to provide reference soil moisture measurements. To extract terrestrial dose rate from measured <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate, the predicted secondary cosmic radiation derived using the approach described above was subtracted from the measured <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate. The results showed a positive correlation (r = 0. 65 - 0. 71) between increase in <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate and precipitation, but the linearity is not strong. Therefore, it was concluded that the observed relationship is not suitable to predict precipitation amount or intensity from <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate measurements during precipitation events. The uncorrected <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate measurements were negatively correlated (r = - 0. 66 ~- 0. 54) to atmospheric pressure and positively correlated (r = 0. 3 ~ 0. 39) to the incoming neutron count rate. After removal of the predicted cosmic dose rate from the measured <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rate, an estimate of the terrestrial dose rate was obtained that was not correlated anymore to atmospheric pressure and the incoming neutron count rate. This provided confidence in the developed approach to predict the contribution of cosmic radiation to measured <b>ambient</b> <b>dose</b> rates. The estimated terrestrial dose rate was related to soil moisture content using an exponential function with two fit parameters and reference soil moisture content for all four radiation monitoring stations. For daily soil moisture content estimates, the goodness of fit ranged from R 2 = 0. 21 to 0. 48 and the RMSE ranged from 0. 048 to 0. 117 cm 3 /cm 3. The accuracy of the soil moisture content predictions improved considerably when a weekly resolution was used (RMSE ranged from 0. 029 to 0. 084 cm 3 /cm 3). The considerable difference between measured and predicted soil moisture content can at least partly be explained by the fact that the terrestrial gamma dose rate is strongly determined by the upper few centimeters of the soil, which may not be well represented by the reference soil moisture measurements at 5 and 15 cm depth due to near-surface gradients in soil moisture content associated with textural variation and the presence of litter layers...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: Endovascular aortoiliac {{aneurysm}} (EAIA) repair uses substantial fluoroscopic guidance {{that requires}} considerable radiation exposure. Doses were determined {{for a team}} of three vascular surgeons performing 47 consecutive EAIA repairs over a 1 -year period to determine whether this exposure constitutes a radiation hazard. Methods: Twenty-nine surgeon-made aortounifemoral devices and 18 bifurcated devices were used. Three surgeons wore dosimeters (1) on the waist, under a lead apron; (2) on the waist, outside a lead apron; (3) on the collar; and (4) on the left ring finger. Dosimeters were also placed around the operating table and room to evaluate the patient, other personnel, and <b>ambient</b> <b>doses.</b> Exposures were compared with standards of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). Results: Total fluoroscopy time was 30. 9 hours (1852 minutes; mean, 39. 4 minutes per case). Yearly total effective body doses for all surgeons (under lead) were below the 20 mSv/y occupational exposure limit of the ICRP. Outside lead doses for two surgeons approximated recommended limits. Lead aprons attenuated 85 % to 91 % of the dose. Ring doses and calculated eye doses were within the ICRP exposure limits. Patient skin doses averaged 360 mSv per case (range, 120 - 860 mSv). The ambient (> 3 m from the source) operating room dose was 1. 06 mSv/y. Conclusions: Although the total effective body doses under lead fell within established ICRP occupational exposure limits, they are not negligible. Because radiation exposure is cumulative and endovascular procedures are becoming more common, individuals performing these procedures must carefully monitor their exposure. Our results indicate that a team of surgeons can perform 386 hours of fluoroscopy per year or 587 EAIA repairs per year and remain within occupational exposure limits. Individuals who perform these procedures should actively monitor their effective doses and educate personnel in methods for reducing exposure. (J Vasc Surg 2000; 32 : 704 - 10. ...|$|R

40|$|For the {{protection}} of the LHC superconducting magnets about 2100 specially developed by-pass diodes have been manufactured in industry and more than one thousand of these diodes have been mounted into stacks and tested in liquid helium. By-pass diode samples, taken from the series production, have been submitted to irradiation tests at cryogenic temperatures together with some prototype diodes up to an accumulated dose of about 2 kGy and neutron fluences up to about 3. 0 1013 n cm- 2 with and without intermediate warm up to 300 K. The device characteristics of the diodes under forward bias and reverse bias have been measured at 77  K and <b>ambient</b> versus <b>dose</b> and the results are presented. Using a thermo-electrical model and new estimates for the expected dose in the LHC, the expected lifetime of the by-pass diodes has been estimated for various positions in the LHC arcs. It turns out that for all of the by-pass diodes across the arc elements the radiation resistance is largely sufficient. In the dispersion suppresser regions of the LHC, on a few diodes annual annealing during the shut down of the LHC must be applied or those diodes may need to be replaced after some time...|$|R
