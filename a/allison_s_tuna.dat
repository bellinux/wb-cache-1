40|$|The Pacific islands region {{encompasses}} a unique grouping {{of some of}} the world 2 ̆ 7 s smallest countries surrounded by a vast maritime estate. The combined exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the Pacific island States are home to the world 2 ̆ 7 s richest and largest tuna fisheries. The significance of these EEZs, and the rights and responsibilities attributed to coastal States by the Law of the Sea, assign a critical role to Pacific island States in {{the development and implementation of}} oceans governance throughout this region. The Pacific island States have established a number of cooperative agreements and institutions to support the management and conservation of these tuna fisheries and are a critical membership bloc of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). Despite these arrangements overfishing and overcapacity now threaten the long term sustainability {{of some of the}}se tuna fisheries and significantly lower the benefits available to coastal and distant water fishing States. These sustainability and economic concerns require national and regional policy and regulatory responses that are challenging to conceptualise, negotiate and implement.

40|$|This {{economic}} {{history of the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>tuna</b> industry focuses on the industry 2 ̆ 7 s technological and structural development during the last half century. Important technological changes include the growth in scale {{and complexity of the}} baitboat, the emergence of the modern tuna purse seiner, and the growth in scale of canneries. Important structural changes include the industry 2 ̆ 7 s early evolution from a competitive industry spun off from the sardine industry, to a tight vertically integrated oligopoly by WWII, to a weak unintegrated oligopoly today. Also examined are the roles of government policies and other institutions, the growth of foreign competition, imports, and industry globalization. A brief examination of the evolution of the 20 th-century Japanese tuna industry enables a comparison with the development of its U. S. rival. ^ Of special interest in the study is the question as to whether there is a causal link between the tuna industry 2 ̆ 7 s technological and structural evolution. That is, has the industry 2 ̆ 7 s technological evolution been shaped by its structural and competitive evolution, and vice versa? The general hypothesis of a link between technological change and competition has a long history, dating at least from the classical and Marxian economists, through to today 2 ̆ 7 s game theorists and modern institutionalists. Particular attention is paid to the hypotheses developed by Joseph Schumpeter, who most forcefully set forth the argument that imperfect competition is necessary (if not sufficient) for technological advance in a capitalist economy. The author also contributes some preliminary work on a dynamic isoquant {{that can be used to}} examine the replacement of old technology with new technology. The intuitive implications of these various theories and views concerning the technology-competition link are examined for their relevance and usefulness in explaining observed events in the tuna industry. The author concludes that there is sufficient support for the hypothesized link in the tuna industry, on the basis of an array of consistencies between the theories 2 ̆ 7 implications and observed events in the tuna industry 2 ̆ 7 s history. ...|$|R

40|$|More than {{a decade}} has passed since {{the passage of the}} Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. During that time the U. <b>S.</b> <b>tuna</b> purse seine neet reduced its {{incidental}} porpoise mortality rate more than 10 -fold. This was made possible through the development of gear and techniques aimed at reducing the frequency of many low probability events that contribute to the kill. Porpoise are killed by becoming entangled or entrapped in folds and canopies of the net and suffocating. The configuration of the net, both before and during the backdown release procedure, is a major determinant of the number of porpoise killed. Speedboats can be used to tow on the corkllne to prevent net collapse and also to adjust the net configuration to reduce net canopies prior to backdown. Deepening a net can reduce the probability of porpoise being killed by prebackdown net collapse. The effects of environmental conditions and mechanical failures on net configuration can result in high porpoise mortality unless mitigated by skilled vessel maneuvers or prevented by the timely use of speedboats to adjust the net. The backdown procedure is the only means to effectively release captured porpoise from a purse seine. It is also the time during the set when most of the mortality occurs. The use of small mesh safety panels and aprons in the backdown areas of nets reduces porpoise entanglement, and Increases the probability of an effective release. The tie-down points on the net for preparing the backdown channel must be properly located in order to optimize porpoise release. A formula uses the stretched depth of the net to calculate one of these points, making it a simple matter to locate the other. Understanding the dynamics of the backdown procedure permits a thorough troubleshooting of performance, thus preventing the repetition of poorly executed backdowns and thereby reducing mortality. Porpoise that cannot be released must be rescued by hand. A rescuer in a rigidly inflated raft can rescue porpoise effectively at any time during a net set. Hand rescue can make the difference between above average kill and zero kill sets. In all circumstances, the skill and motivation of the captain and his crew are the final determinants in the prevention of incidental porpoise mortality in tuna seining.

The optimal results indicate moving away from gears such as purse-seines and long-lines in favor of harpoons and rod-and-reels, and concentrating the catch {{towards the end of}} the season. The analyses further indicate that it is more profitable to harvest fewer tuna but of greater size and quality than to focus on a great number of fish captures.

Estimation of {{tulathromycin}} depletion in plasma {{and milk}} after subcutaneous injection in lactating goats using a nonlinear mixed-effects pharmacokinetic modeling approach. Bmc Veterinary Research, 12, 10. doi: 10. 1186 /s 12917 - 016 - 0884 - 4 Background: Extra-label use of tulathromycin in lactating goats is common and may cause violative residues in milk. The {{objective of this}} study was to develop a nonlinear mixed-effects pharmacokinetic (NLME-PK) model to estimate tulathromycin depletion in plasma and milk of lactating goats. Eight lactating goats received two subcutaneous injections of 2. 5 mg/kg tulathromycin 7 days apart; blood and milk samples were analyzed for concentrations of tulathromycin and the common fragment of tulathromycin (i. e., the marker residue CP- 60, 300), respectively, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Based on these new data and related literature data, a NLME-PK compartmental model with first-order absorption and elimination was used to model plasma concentrations and cumulative excreted amount in milk. Monte Carlo simulations with 100 replicates were performed to predict the time when the upper limit of the 95 % confidence interval of milk concentrations was below the tolerance. Results: All animals were healthy throughout the study with normal appetite and milk production levels, and with mild-moderate injection-site reactions that diminished by the end of the study. The measured data showed that milk concentrations of the marker residue of tulathromycin were below the limit of detection (LOD = 1. 8 ng/ml) 39 days after the second injection. A 2 -compartment model with milk as an excretory compartment best described tulathromycin plasma and CP- 60, 300 milk pharmacokinetic data. The model-predicted data correlated with the measured data very well. The NLME-PK model estimated that tulathromycin plasma concentrations were below LOD (1. 2 ng/ml) 43 days after a single injection, and 62 days after the second injection with a 95 % confidence. These estimated times are much longer than the current meat withdrawal time recommendation of 18 days for tulathromycin in non-lactating cattle. Conclusions: The results suggest that twice subcutaneous injections of 2. 5 mg/kg tulathromycin are a clinically safe extra-label alternative approach for treating pulmonary infections in lactating goats, but a prolonged withdrawal time of at least 39 days after the second injection should be considered to prevent violative residues in milk and any dairy goat being used for meat should have an extended meat withdrawal time...|$|R
40|$|Finding {{adequate}} {{solutions to}} wildlife conservation problems is rarely simple or straightforward. In developing acceptable domestic conservation policies, a nation must balance competing economic, political, biological and social concerns. When a wildlife problem is of international relevance, {{the range of}} competing interests is even broader. A nation 2 ̆ 7 s wildlife policies must then take into account not only various concerns of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s own citizenry, but also potential impacts on foreign policy. In addition, economic, political and cultural needs {{and values of the}} other nations whose interests are implicated must be recognized and weighed in the balance. The problem of dolphin mortality incidental to tuna fishing in the eastern Pacific Ocean is a case in point. For reasons still not understood by scientists, large schools of mature yellowfin tuna are often found in association with herds of dolphins. Fishermen take advantage of this association by encircling the dolphins with nets, trapping both the dolphins and the tuna underneath. Initially, such 2 ̆ 2 fishing on dolphins 2 ̆ 2 caused hundreds of thousands of dolphins to drown after becoming entangled. Although special nets and fishing techniques have been adopted over the last decade to substantially reduce incidental mortality, thousands of dolphins are still killed each year in the eastern Pacific Ocean tuna fishery. The problem is of grave concern to fishermen, scientists and the global citizenry. However, because tuna fishing in this area occurs on the high seas, no one nation has jurisdiction to establish universal dolphin-protective rules. Instead, under customary international law each nation regulates the activity of its own fishermen, except where the nations involved have agreed to adopt regulations established by an international organization. The United States first addressed the dolphin by-catch problem with the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA), which attempted to balance the need for dolphin protection with the economic interests of U. <b>S.</b> <b>tuna</b> fishermen. Over the succeeding years, various provisions in the MMPA were strengthened and new provisions were adopted in an attempt to reduce to insignificant levels the number of dolphins incidentally killed during tuna fishing. Among these were provisions for trade embargoes to enforce U. S. dolphin protection standards in non-U. <b>S.</b> <b>tuna</b> fisheries. The United States has also tried to develop an international solution to the problem through its participation in the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). For example, in an agreement entered into in 1992 with eight other member nations, the United States affirmed its commitment to reducing dolphin mortality in the eastern Pacific Ocean through a 2 ̆ 2 multilateral program with the objectives of (1) [...] . reducing [such] mortality [...] . to levels approaching zero [...] . and, (2) [...] . se eking ecologically sound means of capturing tunas. 2 ̆ 2 Despite the success of the MMPA and IATTC programs in reducing the dolphin mortality levels, dolphins were still being killed in the eastern Pacific tuna fishery. For this reason, the U. S. Congress responded to pressures to step up the pace of dolphin protection and enacted the International Dolphin Conservation Act (IDCA) in 1992. The IDCA imposes a five-year moratorium on fishing on dolphins and allows the lifting of trade sanctions from those nations which were embargoed under the MMPA if such nations agree to the moratorium. In addition, the Act requires the posting of observers on all vessels fishing for tuna in areas where there is a regular and significant association between marine mammals and tuna; bans purse-seine fishing on eastern spinner and coastal spotted dolphins; and forbids U. S. citizens from selling, purchasing, transporting or shipping to the United States, tuna caught in association with dolphins. The passage of the IDCA was not without controversy, however. A strong faction of interested parties supported enforcement of the progressive approach to reducing dolphin mortality that the IATTC adopted. The moratorium approach for dealing with the dolphin mortality problem had previously been presented to and rejected by Congress because of opposition from both the fishing industry and environmentalists. After environmental groups reversed their positions and with strong endorsement of the IDCA by the Administration, Congress ultimately chose the moratorium approach. This decision may have satisfied the desire for more urgent action but may be counterproductive in terms of development of international legal norms and perhaps ecologically as well. The choice Congress made in 1992 raises several important questions regarding international law. First, how should a state attempt to solve an international wildlife conservation problem? Second, is a state 2 ̆ 7 s use of its economic power to impose its point of view on more dependent states valid under international law? Third, is such validity affected when that point of view is shared by a majority of the states involved in the problem? Finally, what approach to addressing conservation of common resources best serves the purposes of the international legal order? Part II of this Comment will describe the political and economic background of the dolphin by-catch controversy including an analysis of U. S. attempts to reduce dolphin mortality by threat of trade sanctions under domestic legislation. It will also examine the efforts of the multilateral organization, IATTC, to reduce dolphin by-catch in the Pacific tuna fishery. Part III sets forth the significant provisions of the International Dolphin Conservation Act and discusses its legislative history, in which Congress had a choice between a multilateral approach and a unilateral trade sanctions approach. Part IV then analyzes these approaches in light of applicable international law. This Comment will conclude by asserting that of the two approaches presented to Congress in 1992, IATTC 2 ̆ 7 s multilateral agreement ultimately would better serve the interests of both the United States and the international legal order...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale systems, such as rail networks, {{air traffic}} control systems, and {{networked}} defence systems are vital to national well-being. However, modern systems are becoming increasingly complex in nature and their development is proving problematical both in Australia and around the World. The paper opens by describing {{the nature of the}} problem and the best-practice approach taken to overcome the difficulties. From here, the Australian needs for systems integration research and skills development are discussed and finally the paper outlines a proposal to form a defence centre of excellence in systems integration that will form a coherent basis for a national response to the Nation’s systems integration research and skill-base capability requirements.

40|$|Bluefin tuna is {{regarded}} as a high-quality product in the Japanese market and is characterized by an unusual marketing system by seafood industry standards. Each fish is individually inspected for various quality attributes before being flown to Japan for the fresh tuna market. The first objective {{of this study is to}} formally evaluate the degree to which the price of U. <b>S.</b> fresh bluefin <b>tuna</b> is determined by quality attributes of each fish, rather than by just the quantity supplied. This is accomplished using a Hedonic model. The results support the hypothesis that the fresh bluefin tuna price is, in fact, significantly influenced by the quality attributes of the fish, including the freshness, fat content, color, and shape. Interesting implications for public management of this highly valued resource arise from the results. [Econ-Lit citation: L 150, L 190, L 660 ] © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ...|$|R
