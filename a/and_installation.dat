5|$|As {{there are}} {{a limited number of}} stalls in the Chapel, only the most senior Knights and Dames Grand Cross are installed. A stall made vacant by the death of a {{military}} Knight Grand Cross is offered to the next most senior uninstalled military GCB, and similarly for vacancies among civil GCBs. Waits between admission to the Order <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> may be very long; for instance, Marshal of the Air Force Lord Craig of Radley was created a Knight Grand Cross in 1984, but was not installed until 2006.|$|E
5|$|Between 5–28 June 1926, {{the station}} was closed to allow the Southern Railway to carry out various works, {{including}} the rebuilding of the platforms, relaying of the tracks <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> of {{a new system of}} electrical signalling – the four-aspect colour light scheme. The station was also renovated and the glass roof cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five set aside for the new electric trains. The signal box spanning the width of the railway bridge was removed. In July 1939, Cannon Street was closed for a week following a fire in Borough Market which prevented any trains accessing it.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2 of the Centre was {{designed}} by the then newly qualified Tim Green and Keith Vince of Capita Architecture, formerly called Capita Percy Thomas and now part of Capita Symonds, with Arup Acoustics again providing the acoustic design. The main contractor was again Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, with MJN Colston Ltd responsible for the design <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> of all the mechanical, electrical and public health services in the building.

5|$|The {{network has}} over 390 artworks by over 170 artists across its stations, ranging from {{historic}} murals to modern art. Styles also vary, from mosaic to fileteado, sculpture <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> pieces. Many stations {{are decorated with}} intricate ceramic tile work, some of which date back to 1913 when the Underground first opened its doors. Featured artists include painters and reproductions by Quino, Molina Campos, Raúl Soldi, Rodolfo Medina and Jorge Schwarz. In addition, they provide spaces for music and theatre events, including an underground iteration of the Pepsi Music Festival on Line H.|$|E
5|$|Vestgrensa {{was part}} of Holmenkolbanen's {{operating}} network until 1975, when the municipality of Oslo bought all the company's stock. In the early 1990s, the stations on the Sognsvann Line were upgraded to metro standard, which involved a heightening and lengthening of the platforms, <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> of a third rail power supply and a new signaling system. The electrified third rail {{made it impossible for}} passengers to cross at track level, and under- or overpasses had to be built at all stations.|$|E
5|$|Widening of the Kwinana Freeway with {{an extra}} {{southbound}} lane between Roe Highway and Armadale Road began in mid-2014. The project aims to increase the freeway's reliability, efficiency, and safety, as the current two-lane configuration is subject to {{a large proportion of}} heavy vehicles and severe peak hour congestion. The project also involves the realignment of ramps at Berrigan Drive and Armadale Road, construction of noise barriers and noise walls where required, <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> of components for intelligent transport systems – optic fibre communications, vehicle detection devices, and closed circuit cameras.|$|E

5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} commercial service, the Comets began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to overstressing of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of the fatigue failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square avionics windows <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement, and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Emeka Ogboh (born 1977) is a Nigerian sound <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> artist {{best known}} for his soundscapes of life in Lagos. Trained as an artist, he began working with sounds that {{characterize}} cities following an Egyptian multimedia art program. He presents unmodified field recordings from Lagos city lifefor instance, its danfo share taxi systemin gallery installations with headphones and speakers. His non-audio work uses iconography from Lagos city life. He participated in the DAAD Artists-in-Berlin Program and 2015 Venice Biennale, and received the 2016 Bremen Böttcherstraße Art Award. His work has exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum, American National Museum of African Art, Menil Collection, Casino Luxembourg, and Kiasma. Critics noted his soundscapes' chaos and complexity, and his focus on recontextualizing rather than transforming the city's sounds.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Han was the {{founding}} President of the Sculpture Society (Singapore), and remains its Honorary President. In May 2009, {{she was the}} first artist in residence at the Society's Sculpture Pavilion at Fort Canning Park where she worked on sculptures made from the trunks of tembusu trees. The project, sponsored by the Asia Pacific Breweries Foundation Inspire Programme, was intended to provide sculptors <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> artists with studio space and a chance to interact with the public in a park environment. Han {{was a member of the}} Fourth Singapore Note and Coin Advisory Committee between 1 July 2008 and 30 June 2011, where her duties included advising the Monetary Authority of Singapore on designs for new currency.|$|E

5|$|One World Trade Center's steel {{structure}} topped {{out at the}} nominal 104th floor, with a total height of , in August 2012. The tower's antenna was then shipped from Quebec to New York in November 2012, and {{the first section of}} the antenna was hoisted {{to the top of the}} tower on December 12, 2012, and was installed on January 15, 2013. By March 2013, two sections of the antenna had been installed. The spire's completion was scheduled for April 29, 2013, but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces. On May 10, 2013, the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of One World Trade Center, bringing the tower to its full height of , and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world. In subsequent months, the exterior elevator shaft was removed; the podium glass, interior decorations, and other finishings were being installed; <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{still do}} not know the exact {{mechanisms}} by which most tornadoes form, and occasional tornadoes still strike without a tornado warning being issued. Analysis of observations including both stationary and mobile (surface and aerial) in-situ and remote sensing (passive and active) instruments generates new ideas and refines existing notions. Numerical modeling also provides new insights as observations and new discoveries are integrated into our physical understanding and then tested in computer simulations which validate new notions as well as produce entirely new theoretical findings, many of which are otherwise unattainable. Importantly, development of new observation technologies <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> of finer spatial and temporal resolution observation networks have aided increased understanding and better predictions.|$|E
5|$|The first submarine, , {{was laid}} down in February 1990. Collins launch was {{originally}} planned for 1994, but was later set for 28 August 1993. Although launched on schedule, she was not complete: {{the design of the}} submarine had not been finalised, important internal pipes and fittings were not installed, the components of the combat system had yet to be delivered, and some hull sections were actually sheets of timber painted black so the submarine would appear complete in photographs of the launching ceremony. Within weeks of the launch, Collins was removed from the water, and it was not until June 1994 that the submarine was completed. Progress on the other five submarines was delayed by the extra effort required to meet Collins launching date and the subsequent work to complete her. Collins was not commissioned into the RAN until 27 July 1996; eighteen months behind schedule, because of several delays and problems, most relating to the provision <b>and</b> <b>installation</b> of the combat data system software. Collins was not approved for operational deployments until 2000.|$|E
