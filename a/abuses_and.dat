5|$|The Weiquan {{movement}} is a non-centralized group of lawyers, legal experts, and intellectuals in China {{who seek to}} protect and defend {{the civil rights of}} the citizenry through litigation and legal activism. The movement, which began in the early 2000s, has organized demonstrations, sought reform via the legal system and media, defended victims of human rights <b>abuses,</b> <b>and</b> written appeal letters, despite opposition from Communist Party authorities. Among the issues adopted by Weiquan lawyers are property and housing rights, protection for AIDS victims, environmental damage, religious freedom, freedom of speech and the press, and defending the rights of other lawyers facing disbarment or imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Although Eve {{initially}} {{believes that}} her baby died, she learns that he survived when she discovers Vincent Clarkson in 2007. Hidden Passions identifies Vincent as born on Christmas Day. The book states that Alistair arranged for Vincent's death, but the hitman Jack placed the baby into social services without Alistair's knowledge. The series changed Alistair's involvement in Vincent's life; instead, Alistair <b>abuses</b> <b>and</b> manipulates Vincent {{as a tool}} for his plans to maintain power over Harmony. For most of the series, Eve and Julian's child is believed to be Chad Harris-Crane, who is later shown to be Liz's child from her rape by Alistair. After the apparent death of her child, Eve leaves Boston and gives up music to attend medical school. Alistair sends her money (which she uses to pay her tuition) to keep quiet about her relationship—and child—with Julian. Eve eventually moves to Harmony and becomes a respected physician at Harmony Hospital. She marries T. C. and has two children, Whitney and Simone.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions on Iran after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most sanctions against Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights <b>abuses,</b> <b>and</b> ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for victims and their families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E

40|$|This {{resource}} sheet examines expenditure {{related to}} child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect {{that is made}} by departments responsible for child protection services in Australia.

More importantly, the prevention of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect is a critical priority because of the social costs of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect and the imperative to prevent children from experiencing its devastating effects.

The purpose of this resource is to indicate the potential long-term effects of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect that may extend into adulthood. Child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect refers to any behaviour by parents, caregivers, other adults or older adolescents that is outside the norms of conduct and entails a substantial risk of causing physical or emotional harm to a child or young person. Such behaviours may be intentional or unintentional and can include acts of omission (i. e., neglect) and commission (i. e., abuse). The five main subtypes of child <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect are physical abuse, emotional maltreatment, neglect, sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> witnessing family violence...|$|R

40|$|Objective: There {{were two}} aims to this study: first {{to examine whether}} {{emotional}} <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect are significant predictors of psychological and somatic symptoms, and lifetime trauma exposure in women presenting to a primary care practice, and second to examine the strength of these relationships after controlling {{for the effects of}} other types of childhood <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> trauma. Method: Two-hundred and five women completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (Bernstein et al., 1994), Trauma History Questionnaire (Green, 1996), the Symptom Checklist-revised (Derogatis, 1997), and the Revised Civilian Mississippi Scale for posttraumatic stress disorder (Norris & Perilla, 1996) when presenting to their primary care physician for a visit. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine unique contributions of emotional <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect variables on symptom measures while controlling for childhood sexual <b>and</b> physical <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> lifetime trauma exposure. Results: A history of emotional <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect was associated with increased anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress and physical symptoms, as well as lifetime trauma exposure. Physical <b>and</b> sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> lifetime trauma were also significant predictors of physical and psychological symptoms. Hierarchical multiple regressions demonstrated that emotional <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect predicted symptomatology in these women even when controlling for other types of <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> lifetime trauma exposure. Conclusions: Long-standing behavioral consequences may arise as a result of childhood emotional <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> neglect, specifically, poorer emotional and physical functioning, and vulnerability to further trauma exposure.

The present study utilizes data on criteria for cannabis <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> dependence from a large, nationally representative sample (National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions) of 8, 172 lifetime cannabis users to investigate whether gender contributes to heterogeneity in the underlying construct of cannabis <b>abuse</b> <b>and</b> dependence, and in each individual criterion as well. Analyses, {{all of which were}} conducted in MPlus, included factor analysis, as well as MIMIC and multiple-group models for an examination of dimensionality and gender heterogeneity, respectively. Results favor a uni-dimensional construct for cannabis abuse/dependence, as seen in prior research. We also identify 2 <b>abuse</b> (Legal <b>and</b> Hazard) and 2 dependence (Quit and Problems) criteria, which show significant gender heterogeneity with the abuse criteria exhibiting higher thresholds in women and the dependence criteria in men.
