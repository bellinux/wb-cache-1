The player assumes the role of the commander of XCOM, <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> engage in a war against an extraterrestrial enemy with overwhelming technological superiority.|$|E
5|$|Before {{heading out}} to a {{baseball}} game at a nearby ballpark, sports fan Mr. Brown drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E

5|$|Haydn's {{choice of}} D major for this quartet, {{with the second}} {{movement}} in D minor, optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set. The first movement opens peculiarly: the first violin starts on an E, <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> play a four-measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord. The use of a closing phrase to start the movement {{is the first of}} a number of unsettling incidents in the movement. The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends. And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D-minor Adagio than a proper conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{at first}} {{goes to the}} Kwik-E-Mart and {{purchases}} Buzz Cola, then gets into more routine tasks, such as giving Lisa her science project or going to work. At {{the end of the}} day, Homer is sent home from work and watches a news report on TV, which informs him that the mysterious cameras and black vans are being spotted all across town. He notices one of the vans spying on him outside the house, and decides to pursue it, leading him to Mr. Burns' mansion. Homer concludes that Mr. Burns is responsible, and goes to confront him. However, Burns reveals that the black vans were pizza delivery vans, <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> fire and release his guard dogs on Homer.|$|E
5|$|NY10 begins {{concurrent}} with NY8 at an interchange {{with the}} Quickway (NY17) {{southeast of the}} village of Deposit near the Broome-Delaware County line. The two routes continue north along the eastern extents of Deposit to {{the banks of the}} west branch of the Delaware River, where NY8 breaks from NY10 to cross over the river. NY10, however, continues northeast along the riverbank, passing south of the Cannonsville Dam and the resulting Cannonsville Reservoir behind it. Near the midpoint of the water body, NY10 crosses over the reservoir on the Cannonsville Bridge <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> follow the northern edge of the reservoir. As the reservoir begins to narrow, NY10 intersects NY268, a connector route leading south to the village of Hancock.|$|E

5|$|Skírnir {{requests}} that Freyr {{give him}} a horse and Freyr's sword; a sword which fights jötnar by itself. Under the cover of darkness, Skírnir rides the horse over nations and dew-covered mountains until he reaches Jötunheimr, {{the home of the}} jötnar, <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> Gymir's courts. Ferocious dogs are tied before the wooden fence that surrounds Gerðr's hall. Skírnir rides out to a herdsman (unnamed) sitting on a mound, greets him, and asks the herdsman how he may speak to the maiden beyond Gymir's dogs. An exchange occurs between the herdsman and Skírnir, during which the herdsman tells Skírnir that he will never speak to the girl.|$|E

Buck (Nathan Fillion) arrives and introduces Dare (Tricia Helfer). Romeo wakes the Rookie {{and the team}} enter their HEVs and drop through the atmosphere; at the last minute, Dare changes their trajectory to miss the ship. The Covenant ship enters slipspace, sending a shockwave toward the ODSTs; the Rookie's pod collides with Mickey's and crashes into a building on the ground, knocking him unconscious for six hours. He awakens <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> find clues {{as to what happened}} to his squadmates.|$|E
5|$|Adapted from The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens, {{the film}} has been {{shortened}} and streamlined for the single reel format. The film focuses on a grandfather who gambles himself into poverty. He dotes on his granddaughter, Little Nell, and desires to give her every luxury. The grandfather turns to gambling to try and earn money, firmly believing that luck would favor him. His gambling results in losing everything and Nell fears {{that he will be}} taken away to an asylum. At night, Nell flees with him and they find refuge and shelter with Mrs. Jarley. The grandfather, seeking to win money, robs Nell of her money <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> gamble it away. The grandfather is coerced by men to steal to pay the debts, but Nell intervenes and flees with her grandfather again. Exhausted and feeble in health, Nell meets a kind schoolmaster and appeals to him for aid before falling unconscious at his feet.

5|$|Arianna {{refuses to}} talk to anyone, however, so Layton and Luke {{continue}} to question the townspeople while Emmy goes to the Scotland Yard for information regarding Evan Barde's death. With the aid of Inspectors Chelmey and Grosky, she uncovers the records for the case before heading back to Misthallery to reunite with Layton and Luke. Inspector Grosky returns with her, hoping that his own influence will help convince the town's Chief of Police, Chief Jakes, to provide further information on the case. Regardless, Chief Jakes remains adamantly opposed to the investigation of Barde's death, and demands that Layton and company leave the town within 24 hours. Despite Jakes' threats, they visit Arianna {{to explain to her}} {{what has happened to the}} town and to her father. Arianna opens up to them, <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> guide them to the nearby lake before playing the Specter's Flute, which causes a prehistoric aquatic creature named Loosha to rise from the lake.|$|E
5|$|Dong Zhuo's defeat {{has left}} him holed up in Luoyang, so Sun Jian and his army attack and defeat him in the city, finding the Imperial Seal in the process ("Tales"). Sun Jian then leads his army home, but finds out that Liu Biao has taken over Jing Province, Yan Baihu, Wang Lang, and Liu Yong have conquered the Wu Territory, and Liu Xun has allied with Yuan Shu. At Xiangyang in 192 AD, Sun Jian falls into a trap in the castle but survives and defeats the attackers. His generals also kill off many of Liu Biao's generals and defeat Yuan Shao's reinforcements, and Liu Biao is {{defeated}} after interrogating why he invaded Jing. His son Sun Ce continues his conquest, <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> conquer the Wu Territory from the regional lords; Zhou Yu plans his campaign for the lands. With Wu secure, the Sun Family continues on to Mt. Xingshi, where they attack Jiangdong and defeat the armies of Liu Xun and Yuan Shu in 198 AD. If only Liu Xun has been defeated, Sun Jian and his family will participate in a unification of Jing Province, securing all of the cities from the forces of Liu Biao and the three Wu lords.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance. The boys attempt to get the pig and the elephant drunk and to mate, {{but it does not}} seem to be working until Chef stops by and sings to the animals with a little help from Elton John. The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's ranch <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair. Mephesto shows up and shoots the clone, but Stan is afraid he will be in trouble for everything the clone did. However, in a brief moment of kindness, Shelley takes the blame, after which she beats up Stan.|$|E

5|$|RE11 {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with FM 1929, {{to the north}} of a small farm. The roadway proceeds as a two-lane, paved road, traveling northward through rural areas on a large peninsula on the lake. The road continues north, traveling through scrub land before it intersects the Ray Stoker Jr. Highway, and bends slightly northeast for a short distance. After continuing north, the roadway bends northeast, as it intersects the former route of RM 2134. The highway intersects a small road leading to a residential community on the lake, before continuing northeast, where it intersects County Road 4763 (CR 4763), which leads to a small residential area. It turns north and continues for a short distance, after which the highway bends northwest, <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> its northern terminus, a boat-launch ramp on the coast of the lake. The highway is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). No portion of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Shephard soon {{encounters}} more stranded Marine {{units in}} {{the wreckage of the}} base, and tries to break through the black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.|$|E
5|$|The {{first chapter}} of Team of Rivals portrays four major contenders for the 1860 Republican presidential {{nomination}} on May 18, 1860, awaiting {{the results of the}} national convention by telegraph: New York Senator and former governor William H. Seward, widely considered the frontrunner; Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, a favorite of the party's more radical wing; former Missouri Attorney General Edward Bates, preferred by more conservative elements of the party; and Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois. Goodwin then describes how each candidate rose to national political prominence: Seward through a long alliance with New York political boss Thurlow Weed, Chase through his early advocacy of the abolition of slavery, Bates through a speech opposing President James K. Polk at the 1847 River and Harbor Convention, and Lincoln through a series of debates with Democratic rival Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate election. Lincoln is ultimately the victor at the 1860 convention through a superior political operation and by making himself the unobjectionable second choice of all Republican factions, <b>and</b> <b>proceeds</b> <b>to</b> win the presidency.|$|E
