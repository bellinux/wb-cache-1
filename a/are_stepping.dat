25|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} primary campaign, Romney called Arizona’s approach to illegal immigration “a {{model for the}} nation.” He vowed that {{on his first day}} in office as president, he would {{bring an end to the}} lawsuits the Obama Administration’s Justice Department had brought challenging Arizona’s immigration policy. He also praised the anti-illegal immigration efforts of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a law professor who had drafted much of Arizona’s SB 1070 immigration enforcement law and similar measures around the country. Campaigning with Kobach in January 2012, Romney said, “We need more conservative leaders like Kris willing to stand up for the rule of law. With Kris on the team, I look forward to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that <b>are</b> <b>stepping</b> forward to address this problem.” When the Supreme Court struck down parts of Arizona's SB 1070 in June 2012, a Romney campaign spokesman said that Romney supports the rights of states to make their own immigration laws when the federal government has failed to address illegal immigration.|$|E

25|$|Others such as Francis Collins, Kenneth R. Miller, George Coyne and Francisco J. Ayala {{argue for}} {{compatibility}} {{since they do}} not agree that science is incompatible with religion and vice versa. They argue that science provides many opportunities to look for and find God in nature and {{to reflect on their}} beliefs. According to Kenneth Miller, he disagrees with Jerry Coyne's assessment and argues that since significant portions of scientists are religious and the proportion of Americans believing in evolution is much higher, it implies that both are indeed compatible. Elsewhere, Miller has argued that when scientists make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and <b>are</b> <b>stepping</b> beyond the scope of science into discourses of meaning and purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place. Furthermore, he notes that since evolution made the brain and since the brain can handle both religion and science, there is no natural incompatibility between the concepts at the biological level.|$|E

The rebel force of 3,000 defeated the Spanish in various encounters, such as the battle of La Reforma and the surrender of Las Tunas on August 30, and the Spaniards were kept on the defensive.

I do not say, for a moment, that the flight to this narrower life may not be the right thing for the individual, any more than I say the same thing about flight into a monastery. But I do say that anything is bad and artificial which tends to make these people succumb to the strange delusion that they <b>are</b> <b>stepping</b> into a world which is actually larger and more varied than their own.
