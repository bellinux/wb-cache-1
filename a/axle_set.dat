50|$|In 1945, a Spanish engineer, Alejandro Goicoechea, {{developed}} a streamlined articulated train {{able to run}} on existing tracks at higher speeds than contemporary passenger trains. This was achieved by providing the locomotive and cars with a unique axle system that used one <b>axle</b> <b>set</b> per car end, connected by a Y-bar coupler. Amongst other advantages, the centre of mass was only half as high as usual. This system became famous {{under the name of}} Talgo (Tren Articulado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol), and for half a century was the main Spanish provider of high-speed trains.|$|E
50|$|In Europe usually both rear tractor axles have dual wheels, while {{single or}} dual wheels {{are used for}} the cargo trailer. The most common {{combination}} used in Europe is a semi tractor with three axles, one a lift axle, and a cargo trailer with three axles, one also a lift axle, giving six axles and 22 wheels in total. This format is now common across Europe, due to reduced road-loading requirements, especially for bridges. The lift axles used on both tractors and trailers allow the trucks to remain legal, but reduce tyre scrub and wear while carrying lighter loads by raising an <b>axle</b> <b>set</b> off the roadway. For greater detail, see the United Kingdom section, below.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911 a {{party of}} senior L&YR {{officials}} from Horwich had visited Flamme in Belgium. They were {{particularly interested in the}} Type 10 and also the related [...] 2-10-0. These two designs shared the same boiler. The L&YR had little use for such a powerful passenger locomotive, but the 2-10-0 was of great interest. The 2-10-0 was of conventional layout, with the two rear driving <b>axles</b> <b>set</b> beneath the firebox grate and ashpan. The pacific though, with the same boiler, required its higher axles to be placed ahead of the firebox. This required a carrying axle below the firebox and also placed the four cylinders ahead of the smokebox, beneath a prominent flat platform.|$|R

5000|$|The {{design by}} Borsig, under the {{supervision}} of chief engineer August Meister, was ready in 1919 but, due to material shortages, no locomotives were produced until 1922. They were three-cylinder locomotives, all cylinders driving the second coupled <b>axle.</b> Three <b>sets</b> of Walschaerts valve gear were used, the one for the inside cylinder being mainly located inside the frame, but driven from the same eccentric crank as the valve gear on the left-hand side; two eccentric rods of different lengths being attached to the same crank.|$|R
50|$|A B-double (B-train) {{consists}} of a prime mover towing a specialised lead trailer that has a fifth-wheel mounted on the rear towing another semi-trailer, resulting in two articulation points. Around container ports in Australia there may also have {{what is known as}} a super B-double, i.e. a B-double with a quad axle lead trailer capable of holding one 40-foot shipping container or two 20-foot shipping containers, and the rear trailer being capable of the same with either a tri or quad rear <b>axle</b> <b>set.</b> However, because of their length and low accessibility into narrow streets, these vehicles are restricted in where they can go and are generally used for terminal-to-terminal work, i.e. wharf to container holding park or wharf-to-wharf. The rear axle on each trailer can also pivot slightly while turning to prevent scrubbing out the edges of the tyres due to the heavy loads placed on them.|$|E
50|$|In New Zealand, an {{oversize}} load is a vehicle and/or load that is wider than 2.50 m or higher than 4.25 m. Overlength limits {{vary depending on}} the type and the configuration of vehicle, but the overall maximum forward distance (i.e. the length {{from the front of the}} vehicle to the centre axis of the rear <b>axle</b> <b>set)</b> is 9.5 m, the overall maximum single vehicle length is 12.6 m (some buses can be longer), and the overall maximum combination length is 22.0 m. Loads must be indivisible, except when the vehicle is oversize itself where it can carry divisible loads as long as the divisible load fits within the standard load limits. Permits are not required for oversize vehicles which are under 25.0 m long, under 5.00 m high, and fit within a set combination of width and forward distance; but they must comply with certain rules regarding piloting, travel times and obstructions.|$|E
50|$|The first {{successful}} sleeve valve was patented by Charles Yale Knight, and used twin alternating sliding sleeves. It {{was used in}} some luxury automobiles, notably Willys, Daimler, Mercedes-Benz, Minerva, Panhard, Peugeot and Avions Voisin. Mors adopted double sleeve-valve engines made by Minerva.The higher oil consumption was heavily outweighed by the quietness of running and the very high mileages without servicing. Early poppet-valve systems required decarbonization at very low mileages. The Burt-McCollum sleeve valve was named for the two inventors that applied for similar patents {{within a few weeks}} of each other. The Burt system was an open sleeve type, driven from the crankshaft side, while the McCollum design had a sleeve in the head and upper part of the cylinder, and a more complex port arrangement (Source: 'Torque Meter' Magazine, AEHS). The design that entered production was more 'Burt' than 'McCollum.' It was used by the Scottish company Argyll for its cars, and was later adopted by Bristol for its radial aircraft engines. It used a single sleeve which rotated around a timing <b>axle</b> <b>set</b> at 90 degrees to the cylinder axis. Mechanically simpler and more rugged, the Burt-McCollum valve had the additional advantage of reducing oil consumption (compared to other sleeve valve designs), while retaining the combustion chambers and big, uncluttered, porting area possible in the Knight system.|$|E

40|$|On June 4, 2003, a 49 year-old male {{millwright}} {{employed at}} a magnetic powder manufacturing company sustained fatal injuries when an {{aerial work platform}} (an extensible articulating boom lift) he was operating tipped over. On {{the day of the}} incident, the victim and a co-worker operated the lift that was leased from a local leasing company to perform maintenance tasks. The aerial lift was equipped with a stabilizing device: an extendable axle to enhance the vehicle’s stability. The manufacturer stated in the Operators and Safety Manual that all operators must properly position the extendable axle and lock it into position before raising the platform or extending the boom. There were two safety features on the lift that were designed to ensure the use of the stabilizing device: an <b>axle</b> <b>set</b> indicator light and an interlock. A post incident test showed that while the indicator light worked, the interlock was inoperable. The plant maintenance crew did not receive the Operators and Safety Manual from the leasing company nor did they receive any training on how to operate the lift. According to the witnesses, the extendable axle was never set out during the entire day of the incident. At approximately 3 : 30 PM, the victim was performing a visual inspection of the exterior of a bucket elevator that was about 70 feet high.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this calculation {{is to determine the}} peak radiant heat flux that would be given off by a set of burning tires to see what affect it would have on the spent fuel shipping cask and tires on an adjacent axle. The calculation will determine: 1. The radiant heat flux from the flame of 8 burning tires. 2. The affect of the heat flux on the shipping cask. 3. The affect of the heat flux on an adjacent axle of tires. CALCULATION METHOD I ASSUMPTIONS Method: The calculation will utilize typical radiant heat transfer formulas to determine the radiant heat flux of the burning tires. Assumptions: 1. From Ref. 1 (a typical heavy haul trailer), use trailer tire size 255 / 70 R x 22. 5 16 PR Radials. These tires are 10 in. wide x 36. 5 in. high. Therefore, a double <b>axle</b> <b>set</b> of dual tires will be approximately 1 m high x 1 m wide x 3 m long. 2. Use heat release rate of 1500 kW/m 2 for burning tires. This is conservative based on similar fuels listed in Table 5 - 5. 2 (a) of Reference 3. 3. Assume closest set of axles on trailer to shipping cask bum to calculate part 2.

50|$|The T600 was {{a radical}} shift in truck design {{compared}} to its cousin the W900 (on {{which it was}} based). The major {{difference between the two}} was the massive aerodynamic facelift the T600 received, which resulted in up to 22% better fuel economy due to decreased drag. This meant that engines of about 100 horsepower less could be used, with knock-on effects in the form of lower weight which equals a higher payload. A better forward view was an additional bonus. Behind the hood, the T600A's cab structure was all W900. The <b>axle</b> was <b>set</b> back farther, allowing for better springing and eight per cent more turning lock. The T600A also received a digital dashboard, developed in conjunction with Boeing.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This thesis {{uses the}} axle weights and axle {{spacings}} of heavy vehicles recorded by weigh-in-motion (WIM) sensors {{to calculate the}} load effects on single lane, simply supported structures spanning up to 30 m. The main objective was to compare the load effects caused by the recorded vehicles with those calculated using TMH 7 Part 2 and the alternative live load models proposed in subsequent research. Through the probabilistic analysis of the truck survey data, the thesis predicts the magnitude of extreme events that may occur within a bridge structure's design life. The results reinforce the deï¬ ciencies of TMH 7 Part 2 's NA loading curve to cater for normal traffic conditions on spans of 10 m and less. They also highlight the conservative assumptions made in the conï¬ guration of vehicle convoys used to simulate serviceability loads in 20 m to 30 m spans. The ï¬ ndings of the thesis support {{the need for the}} rational calibration of the partial factors used in limit state design. The WIM data was analysed to highlight the extent of overloading. The results provide evidence that the overloading of individual <b>axles</b> and <b>axle</b> <b>sets</b> is prevalent and that overloading has a greater impact on 5 m and 10 m spans than 30 m spans. Research was carried out into the basis of the bridge live load models in TMH 7 Part 2 and those recently developed in Europe, the United States and Canada. The thesis documents the advancement of rationally based live load models derived from actual vehicle data. Alternative live load models were calibrated against the extreme events predicted by the WiM data. The results independently validate the alternative live load model proposed by the latest research commissioned by the Department of Transport. This live load model takes a similar form to the one proposed in the Eurocode - ENV 1991 - 3...|$|R
