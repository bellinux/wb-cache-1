5|$|Critics of Eragon often {{point out}} its {{similarities}} to other works such as Earthsea, Dragonlance, and Star Wars. Reviewers have also called the book a notable <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> such a young author as Paolini.|$|E
5|$|HCI {{offers a}} host of {{exchange}} programmes with schools spread across the Asia-Pacific, including University of Tsukuba in Japan, Philippine Science High School in the Philippines and the Bugil Academy in South Korea.

5|$|On 9 July 1918 McCudden {{was killed}} in a flying {{accident}} when his aircraft crashed following an engine fault. His rank {{at the time of his}} death was major, a significant <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> a man who had begun his career in the RFC as an air mechanic. McCudden is buried at the British war cemetery at Beauvoir-Wavans.|$|E
5|$|The Open Cup is {{not held}} in as high regard as the MLS Cup, {{but it is}} still an {{important}} <b>achievement.</b> <b>For</b> Philadelphia, it represented their first-ever chance at a trophy, whereas Seattle had been to the finals five times in the club's six-year history. With a victory, the Sounders would tie the Fire with four overall wins by an MLS team.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Ordnance QF 25-pounder Short was an important <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> Australia's defence industry, and provided the Army with a weapon suited to conditions in the South West Pacific. Nevertheless, the gun's performance was inferior {{to that of the}} standard 25-pounder, and it received a mixed reception from artillerymen.|$|E

5|$|Bruce led the Australian {{delegation}} to the 1932 Imperial Economic Conference in Ottawa. He redoubled his efforts to improve Australian economic prospects with the empire, and the conference agreed to a limited form of his long-sought imperial preference scheme that would give Australia greater access and competitiveness in imperial markets over five years, an <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> which Bruce received much praise from the Lyons government. The closer trading arrangements of the Ottawa Agreements would set the pattern for Australian-British trade relations until Britain's entry in the European Common Market in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Capper {{oversaw the}} first Army aeroplanes. He briefly flew Dunne's first glider, the D.1, during secret trials at Blair Atholl in Scotland in 1907. The flight had {{lasted only a}} few seconds when the glider crashed into a wall, with Capper {{sustaining}} a cut to the head. The next year, Cody flew the first British-built aeroplane at Farnborough, which earned it the title British Army Aeroplane No.1. This was an ironic <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> Capper's command, as he had pinned his personal hopes on Dunne, whose D.4 achieved {{no more than a few}} hops.|$|E

Hambleton Seals Water Polo are a newly formed team which aims to attract local children to a quite small, yet fun sport.|$|E
5|$|Shrek {{was also}} {{nominated}} for 6 BAFTA Awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Film. Eddie Murphy {{became the first}} actor to ever receive a BAFTA nomination for a voice-over performance. The film was also nominated for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, Best Film Music, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

5|$|Taking {{five or more}} wickets in {{a single}} innings (called a five-wicket haul, fifer or five-for) is {{considered}} a notable <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> a bowler. Muralitharan is well well ahead of other bowlers by number of five-wicket hauls in Tests with 67 to his name; Australian cricketer Shane Warne ranks in second place with only 37, 30 below Murali. Which shows the class of Murali in bowling compared to Warne.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Russo-Turkish War brought on universal conscription of young men. At his family's urging, Adler bribed his way into becoming a sanitar, an assistant in the Red Cross Medical Corps. He was selected (apparently on little more than his appearance) by Prince Vladimir Petrovich Meshersky {{to work at a}} German hospital in Bender, Moldova, dealing mainly with typhus patients. In his four months there, he became a favorite with the established Jewish families there, and earned a Gold Medal for Outstanding <b>Achievement</b> <b>for</b> his brief service to the Tsar.|$|E
5|$|The role {{garnered}} Louis-Dreyfus several milestone accolades: her fourteenth Primetime Emmy Award {{nomination for}} {{a role in the}} regular cast of a comedy series surpassed Lucille Ball as the most ever. Her Primetime Emmy Award for her third different regular cast role also was a record-setting <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> a comedy actress. Her five consecutive Primetime Emmy Lead Actress wins break a record and her six overall Primetime Emmy Lead Actress wins also break a record.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1850, Honório Hermeto {{was back}} in Rio de Janeiro. He had found the months in Pernambuco excruciating. Being named provincial {{president}} {{would have been considered}} a great <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> a young politician, but it added no luster to the reputation of a seasoned politician and a founding member of his party. Instead of being at the center of power, he was put in the humiliating position of having to submit to a cabinet composed of men with less political experience, such as Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Paulino Soares de Sousa (Honório Hermeto's colleague along with Rodrigues Torres in Coimbra) and Eusébio de Queirós. It was particularly grating being subordinated to Paulino Soares and Eusébio de Queirós, protégés whom Honório Hermeto had advanced during the 1830s. While in Pernambuco, Honório Hermeto's actions were frequently reviewed and overturned by the cabinet, often with Eusébio de Queirós leading the criticism.|$|E

5|$|In {{its third}} weekend, Srimanthudu {{stood at the}} {{second place in the}} Indian films at the United States box office. It {{collected}} US$94,498 (6.257 million) from 46 screens. The United States box office total stood at US$2,820,214 (188 million), which was considered quite a remarkable <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> a South Indian film. After losing 49% of screens due to new releases, Srimanthudu collected US$27,647 from 24 screens in its fourth weekend. The United States box office total stood at US$2,869,560 (190.7 million). By then, the film's screening had ended in Canada, the United Arab Emirates, and other key international markets. Srimanthudu lost eighteen screens to Bhale Bhale Magadivoy and other new releases, thus witnessing a drop of 75% in its business. Collecting US$7,538 from six screens, the film's 31-day United States box office total stood at US$2,882,809 (192.6 million), with a per-screen average of US$1,256.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2008 the Cubs {{won for the}} 10,000th time in {{the history}} of the {{franchise}} on the road against the Colorado Rockies. Like the 9,000th win, the 10,000th win came in a 76 victory at Coors Field. The Cubs were the second franchise to achieve 10,000 regular season wins; the San Francisco Giants/New York Giants were the first. The franchise flew a special 10,000th win flag along with a Cubs Win flag to commemorate the landmark <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> the franchise. This was unusual not just for the 10,000th win, but also for flying the flag in reference to a road game. The special flag flew from the afternoon of April 24, 2008 until immediately prior to the next home game on April 29, 2008 at 7:05pm against the Milwaukee Brewers. After the flag was taken down, it was autographed by all members of the 2008 Chicago Cubs and auctioned off for charity.|$|E
5|$|Sigi Schmid {{was born}} in Tübingen, West Germany, on March 20, 1953. At the age of four, he moved {{with his family to}} the United States; they took up {{residence}} in Torrance, California, in 1962. Schmid's father, Fritz, who had been a prisoner of war during World War II, worked at Pabst Brewing; his mother, Doris, ran a Los Angeles-based German deli, where Schmid worked on weekends. Schmid's family spoke German at home, making him feel German despite spending so much of his life in America. He began school in the United States with little understanding of English and a stuttering speech disorder he did not overcome until high school. In his youth, Schmid visited Germany every summer, playing soccer with the local children and watching Bundesliga clubs play exhibition matches in neighboring towns. In 1964, Schmid played for the inaugural American Youth Soccer Organization team, an <b>achievement</b> <b>for</b> which he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 1996.|$|E
