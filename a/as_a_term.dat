5|$|From {{around the}} Late Middle Ages, the word elf {{began to be}} used in English <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> loosely synonymous with the French loan-word fairy; in elite art and literature, at least, it also became {{associated}} with diminutive supernatural beings like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, and the Northumbrian English hob.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in Ancient Greece, {{homophony}} indicated {{music in}} which a single melody is performed by two or more voices in unison or octaves, i.e. monophony with multiple voices. Homophony <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> first appeared in English with Charles Burney in 1776, emphasizing the concord of harmonized melody.|$|E
5|$|The Rommel myth, {{also known}} as the Rommel legend, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> used by {{critical}} historians, refers to common depictions of German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in popular culture and academic writings as an apolitical, brilliant commander, and a victim of the Third Reich due to his participation in the 20 July plot against Adolf Hitler. According to critical historians, such depictions are not accurate.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes, {{the term}} {{hypertensive}} emergency {{is also used}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> generic <b>term,</b> comprising both hypertensive emergency, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> specific <b>term</b> for <b>a</b> serious and urgent condition of elevated blood pressure, and hypertensive urgency, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> specific <b>term</b> of <b>a</b> less serious and less urgent condition (the terminology hypertensive crisis is usually used in this sense).|$|R

5|$|The word Allah {{has been}} used by Arabic people of {{different}} religions since pre-Islamic times. More specifically, it {{has been used}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> for God by Muslims (both Arab and non-Arab) and Arab Christians. It is also often, albeit not exclusively, used in this way by Bábists, Bahá'ís, Indonesian and Maltese Christians, and Mizrahi Jews. Similar usage by Christians and Sikhs in West Malaysia has recently led to political and legal controversies.|$|E
5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to codify the compositions {{in a uniform}} manner impossible. An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>term,</b> neo {{soul was}} coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records {{in the late}} 1990s as a {{marketing}} category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell. The success of D'Angelo's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term's origin. While some artists have ignored the label, others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended {{at some point in}} time. In a 2002 interview for Billboard, Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short-lived trend. However, although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music, Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying.|$|E

50|$|Corporate {{media is}} <b>a</b> <b>term</b> {{which refers to}} a system of mass media production, distribution, ownership, and funding which is {{dominated}} by corporations and their CEOs. It is sometimes used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pejorative <b>term</b> in place of mainstream media, which tends to also be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> derisive <b>term,</b> to indicate <b>a</b> media system that does not serve the public interest.|$|R
5000|$|Banana is <b>a</b> <b>term</b> for <b>an</b> East Asian person {{living in}} a Western country (e.g., an Asian American) who has lost touch with the {{cultural}} identity {{of his or her}} parents. The term is derived from the fruit banana, which is [...] "yellow on the outside, white on the inside". It may be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pejorative <b>term</b> or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> non-pejorative <b>term.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1955, Thornton {{returned}} to New Zealand {{to serve as}} the Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Army, and this was followed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> from 1956 to 1958 as its Adjutant General. During this period, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1955, New Zealand {{became a member of the}} South East Asian Treaty Organisation (SEATO) and in July 1958, Thornton moved to Bangkok, where he served as head of the Military Planning Office of SEATO. In this capacity, he gained valuable insight in the scenarios in which New Zealand's military might be expected to play a part. The following year he was promoted to acting major general and appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS), the youngest ever to serve in this role which was effectively the commander of the New Zealand Army. This was to prove a challenging term for Thornton for, driven by the Labour Government, there was a significant change in New Zealand defence policy. Since the Second World War, defence planning had been based around the concept of an infantry division being raised largely from the Territorial Force. This had now changed to a self-sufficient brigade-sized force made up of a combination of Regular and Territorial Force personnel. While not a policy Thornton personally agreed with, he oversaw the reorganisation that was required to achieve the desired structure and this saw some longstanding regiments being amalgamated. In 1962, part way through his term as CGS, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|The name Malkin {{has several}} {{possible}} derivations: {{it was a}} familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman; the similar mawkin was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut. Malkin was also used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>term</b> for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in grimalkin or grey malkin, and was an old northern English name for a hare, into which witches {{were said to be}} able to transfigure. It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of mal and kin as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower, which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time. Another possibility is a corruption of malt kiln, which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.|$|E
