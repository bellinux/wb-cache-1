5|$|An allocator, A, for {{objects of}} type T {{must have a}} member {{function}} with the signature A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly <b>allocated</b> array large enough to contain n objects of type T; only the memory is <b>allocated,</b> and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional pointer argument (that points to an object already <b>allocated</b> by A) {{can be used as}} a hint to the implementation about where the new memory should be <b>allocated</b> in order to improve locality. However, the implementation is free to ignore the argument.|$|E

40|$|Packet {{scheduling}} {{scheme is}} an important component of a network node. The choice of a scheme dictates the allocation of network resources a- mong contending flows of the network. In this paper we study packet scheduling in the context of active net- works. Traditionally, packet scheduling schemes are used to fairly <b>allocate</b> a single resource. This cannot be directly applied to active nodes beacause active nodes contain multiple resources, such as CPU and bandwidth. Moreover, these resources are inter-dependent. Hence, fairly <b>allocating</b> one resource does not entail <b>allocating</b> the other resources fairly. We describe a simple packet scheduling algorithm to fairly <b>allocate</b> multiple resources in an active node. Using simulations, we show that the algorithm effectively <b>allocates</b> both CPU and bandwidth resources fairly among the contending flows...|$|R

5|$|Northcott {{spent much}} of his time from 1943 on in a long battle with the {{government}} over the number of men and women <b>allocated</b> to the Army. He attempted to do so without Blamey being dragged into a political fight but this proved to be impossible. In September 1944, the government reduced the Army's monthly intake of women from 925 to 500, while it only received 420 out of 4,020 men <b>allocated</b> to the three services. Such a meagre allocation was below what the Army needed to maintain its strength, and formations had to be disbanded. Blamey took up the matter with Prime Minister John Curtin, and managed to get a more satisfactory monthly allocation of 1,500 men per month out of 3,000 <b>allocated</b> to the three services.|$|E
