5|$|Coon {{assumed the}} role of {{superintendent}} of shops in 1896. During his tenure at Georgia Tech, he moved the curriculum away from vocational training. Coon emphasized a balance between the shop and the classroom. Coon taught his students more modern quantification methods to solve engineering problems instead of outdated and more costly trial and error methods. He also {{played a significant role in}} developing mechanical engineering into a professional degree program, with a focus on ethics, design and testing, analysis <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving, and mathematics.|$|E

Subsequently, Caldwell's efforts in formulating NEPA, and later promoting it, led to formation of the National Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP), a national professional association of persons who prepare EISs.|$|E

White women with carcinoma of the breast experience particular needs <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> related to psychosocial, economic, sexual and religious matters.

Apart from the tension caused by a diagnosis of carcinoma, and particularly one of carcinoma of the breast, the treatment which these women receive contributes to their needs <b>and</b> <b>problems.</b> The research clearly showed that the majority of women did not experience serious problems in coping with their illness • there was a universally low average intensity of needs <b>and</b> <b>problems.</b> They did, however, require help and support in coping with and accepting the consequences of the carcinoma and the attendant treatment...|$|R

5|$|The {{executive}} {{function of the}} brain is the set of cognitive processes that allow the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, the ability to process and manipulate information held in working memory, {{the ability to think}} about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action. Higher order {{executive function}}s, require multiple cognitive processes including planning, reasoning, <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> solving.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Lexus {{underwent}} a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives. Sales in the U.S. held steady despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included Lexus models. The ES 350 and certain IS models {{were affected by}} a recall for potentially jamming floor mats, while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls <b>and</b> <b>problem</b> rates per-vehicle. The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily recalled in April 2010 for a software update, one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation not to buy the SUV, citing a possible rollover risk following the slow stability control response to a high-speed emergency turn. Although the publication knew of no reported incidents, the GX 460 received updated stability control software.|$|E
5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence <b>and</b> <b>problem,</b> leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E

40|$|Individuals {{suffering}} from ADHD tend to develop various ADHD-related problems over time. Possibly the Early Maladaptive Schema’s {{as defined by}} Jeffrey Young {{play a role in}} this accumulation of problems. Therefore the relationships between these schema’s <b>and</b> ADHD-related <b>problems</b> were investigated in a non-clinical sample of students (N= 141) of a medical pedagogical and didactical centrum, aged 12 - 16 years. ADHD-related problems were divided into ADHD symptoms (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity <b>Problems</b> <b>and</b> Attention <b>Problems),</b> <b>and</b> externalising <b>problems</b> (Externalising, Rule-Breaking Behaviour, Aggressive Behaviour, Oppositional Defiant <b>Problems,</b> <b>and</b> Conduct <b>Problems).</b> First, a correlational analysis was conducted to explore the relationship between the schema’s <b>and</b> ADHD-related <b>problems.</b> Thereafter multiple regression analyses were conducted to further investigate the found relationships. Insufficient Self-Control explained most of the variance in ADHD symptoms <b>and</b> externalising <b>problems.</b> For externalising problems, Enmeshment proved to be an import predictor as well. This schema had a protective effect onExternalising,Rule-Breaking Behaviour <b>and</b> Oppositional Defiant <b>Problems.</b> Overall, the results showthat there is indeed a meaningful relation between schema’s <b>and</b> ADHD-related <b>problems,</b> suggesting schema’s mayindeed {{play an important role in}} the course of ADHD <b>and</b> related <b>problems...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to broadly explore both the achievements <b>and</b> needs <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> of the diverse Hmong American community across the United States, with a particular emphasis on felt needs <b>and</b> <b>problems.</b> Felt needs <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> are defined as needs <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> ”perceived by individuals experiencing the problem, may be equated with want and are phenomenological in character ” (Cox, Erlich, Rothman & Tropman, 1984, p. 9). Taken from this perspective, among the <b>problems</b> <b>and</b> needs discussed in this paper are those that were identified by key informants or members of the Hmong American community, {{who live in the}} community and are well informed of the acute issues experienced by their fellow co-ethnics. Felt needs <b>and</b> <b>problems,</b> in addition to other needs, are very important issues for Hmong community gatekeepers, social workers and service providers to know and understand, in order to effectively work with a particular community (Cox, et al. 1984). The phenomena identified in this exploratory paper are intended to provide a departure point for researchers undertaking future relevant studies of social issues important to the Hmong community...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{a number of}} Presburger liveness problems for nondeterministic reversal-bounded multicounter machines with a free counter (NCMFs). We show the following: – The-Presburger-i. o. <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> the-Presburger-eventual <b>problem</b> are both decidable. So are their duals, the-Presburger-almost-always <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> the-Presburger-always <b>problem.</b> – The-Presburger-i. o. <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> the-Presburger-eventual <b>problem</b> are both undecidable. So are their duals, the-Presburger-almost-always <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> the-Presburger-always <b>problem.</b> These results {{can be used to}} formulate a weak form of Presburger linear temporal logic and develop its model-checking theories for NCMFs. NCMFs can be used to model reactive systems with counts on external events. ...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{identify}} the perceptions, practices <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> {{in the implementation of}} the School-Based Assessment (SBA) in the Standard Curriculum for Primary School (SCPC) in Kluang, Johor. The questionnaire which consists of four sections was used as instrument in this study. The sample consisted of 267 teachers from 20 Primary Schools in Kluang, Johor. Computer program SPSS Version 20. 0 was used to analyze the data. The results showed that the perceptions, practices <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> have high mean values with each having a mean value of 3. 93, 3. 84 and 3. 95 respectively. Perceptions of teachers who teach in urban schools do not differ from teachers teaching in rural schools, but in terms of practices <b>and</b> <b>problems,</b> the teachers in urban schools have higher mean values. The mean values for practices <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> of teachers who teach in urban schools are 4. 01 and 3. 93 respectively. This indicates that teachers in urban schools have problems in the implementation of SBA in SCPC. In addition, teachers teaching more than 10 years had a higher mean value in terms of perceptions, practices <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> of SBA in the SCPC with a mean of 4. 09, 4. 06 and 3. 96 respectively. Their mean values are higher compared to those who teach less than 10 years. The study also shows that there are significant differences between aspects of perception, practices <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> with teaching experiences among teachers. In addition, there are also significant differences between practices <b>and</b> <b>problems</b> with the schools category. However, there is {{no significant difference between the}} perceptions of teachers with the categories of schools.
