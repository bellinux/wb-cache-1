40|$|Previous neuroimaging {{findings}} suggest a {{sensitivity of the}} pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (i. e. a core subregion of Broca's area) {{to a number of}} linguistic dependencies governing the linear sequencing of information in a sentence (e. g. subjects should precede objects; the participant role hierarchy should be respected). The present study used event-related fMRI to examine the hitherto untested hypothesis that the violation of a linearization principle that is purely semantic in nature (animate arguments should precede inanimate arguments) would also lead to increased pars opercularis activation. To this end, we manipulated the features animacy and argument order in German sentences and found a significant increase of activation in the pars opercularis for a violation of the animacy principle even when the other factors mentioned above were controlled for. This result therefore calls for a “supra-syntactic” <b>account</b> of <b>pars</b> opercularis function in the real-time understanding of sentences...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{negation}} plays a special role in non-classical logics {{and also in}} knowledge representation formalisms where negative information {{has to be taken}} into <b>account</b> on <b>par</b> with positive information. In the tradition of mathematical logic, there is a general preference to consider positive information as basic and treat negative information as derived. This has also been the approach in relational databases, in normal logic programs, and is now again the approach in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) that has recently been proposed as a general language for representing propositional information on the Web by the World Wide Web Committee (W 3 C). However, as we argue in this article, any practical knowledge representation formalism, especially for the Web, {{has to be able to}} deal with knowledge items involving partial predicates for which negative information is as informative as positive information, and which may have truth-value gaps and truth-value clashes. This kind of knowledge is best represented and processed with the help of the two negations of partial logic, one expressing explicit falsity and the other one expressing non-truth...|$|R
40|$|In {{the history}} of psychiatry, “schizophrenia” has often been portrayed as the discipline’s pars pro toto, which prototypically {{represents}} mental illness as such and which draws together the fundamental questions concerning psychiatric epistemology and practice. Taking a conceptual history approach, this essay examines how “schizophrenia” is represented in psychiatric discourse and what aspects of its representation <b>account</b> for the <b>pars</b> pro toto status. Three such aspects are identified: a pragmatic, an existential and a justificatory aspect. Following up these aspects in present day psychiatric discourse, it is concluded that “schizophrenia” is losing its special status as the representations of psychiatry and of mental illness have changed and become more diverse. Tentative conclusions regarding current debates about the abolition of “schizophrenia” are drawn...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} the {{existence}} of CEO private control benefits complements managerial reputation in counteracting costly shareholder risk-shifting incentives during severe financial distress, when job-loss may be imminent. We examine this argument empirically using bankruptcy filings in Sweden, where a filing automatically terminates CEO employment and requires the firm to be sold in an open auction. The median CEO income loss is a dramatic 40 %, suggesting that bankruptcy filing damages CEO reputation. Empirical proxies for both CEO reputation and control benefits are significant determinants of the probability of the CEO being rehired by the buyer in the auction, as predicted. Moreover, we find that the rehired CEOs generate a post-bankruptcy <b>accounting</b> performance at <b>par</b> with industry rivals. The surprisingly strong survival characteristics of the reorganized firms are consistent with managerial conservatism ex ante, and help alleviate creditor concern with costly asset substitution designed to delay filing in an automatic bankruptcy auction system. bankruptcy; CEO turnover; executive compensation; post-bankruptcy performance; private benefits of control; risk-shifting incentives...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} at hand {{focuses on}} the enforcement of accounting standards in Germany. The legal basis of the external enforcement of accounting standards in Germany {{was created by the}} „Bilanzkontrollgesetz” (Financial Reporting Enforcement Act) at the end of 2004. An enforcement mechanism was installed to enforce accounting standard compliance by regular reviews of disclosed financial statements. The system was established as implementation of EU guidelines. Since 2005, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) shall be applied for consolidated financial statement of firms listed on a regulated market segment within the European Union (EU) (Regulation EC No. 1606 / 2002). Simultaneously to the harmonization of accounting standards, the EU fostered the standardization of enforcement systems to ensure compliance with international <b>accounting</b> standards. <b>Par.</b> 16 of the so-called “IAS Regulation” mandates the “Committee of European Securities Regulators” (CESR) to “develop a common approach to enforcement". Germany’s unique two-tiered system operates since July 2005; it involves the “Deutsche Pruefstelle fuer Rechnungslegung” (Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel), a newly established private organization primarily assigned to conduct the reviews. As the second tier, the „Bundesanstalt fuer Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht” (Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) has the sovereign authority to order the publication of errors („error announcements“) and if necessary, to force the cooperation of firms in the review process. The dissertation is structured as follows. A general introduction {{focuses on the}} theoretical background and the reasoning for the need of external enforcement mechanisms. The common approach to enforcement in the European Union is described. Building on this, the thesis consists of three individual essays that analyze three specific questions {{in the context of the}} enforcement of financial reporting standards in Germany. The first paper focuses on the systematical evaluation of the information contained in 100 selected error announcements (from a total population of 151 evaluable announcements). The study finds that error announcements on average contain 3. 64 single errors and 77...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that {{photosynthesis}} and morphogenesis of Porphyra plants could be affected by solar UV radiation (UVR: 280 - 400 nm). However, {{little is known about}} the sensitivity of their conchocelis stage to UVR. We investigated the photosynthetic performance of P. haitanensis conchocelis under natural and simulated solar radiation with or without UVR and compared its responses among different developmental stages (vegetative and sporangial phases). High solar <b>PAR</b> <b>accounted</b> for most of the reduction of the effective quantum yield of PS II. Presence of UVR further reduced the yield by 53 - 55 % in contrast to PAR alone treatment under solar radiation (UV-A of 33. 2 W m(- 2) and UV-B of 0. 85 W m(- 2)) or a xenon lamp (UV-A of 25. 5 W m(- 2) and UV-B of 1. 15 W m(- 2)). CO 2 fixation was more reduced by UVR in the free-living vegetative (38 %) than in the sporangial conchocelis (14 %). Photosynthetic tolerance of UVR increased from vegetative to sporangial phase, then to thallus stage, correlating with the increased contents of UV-absorbing compounds and/or differentiated structure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractExperimental and {{theoretical}} flux {{models have been}} developed to reveal the influence of sun flecks and increasing CO 2 concentrations on the energy and entropy balances of the leaf. The rapid and wide range of fluctuations in light intensity under field conditions were simulated in a climatic gas exchange chamber and we determined the energy and entropy balance of the leaf based on radiation and gas exchange measurements. It was estimated that the energy of photosynthetic active radiation (<b>PAR)</b> <b>accounts</b> for half of transpiration, which is the main factor responsible for the exportation of the entropy generated in photosynthesis (Sg) out of the leaf in order to maintain functional the photosynthetic machinery. Although the response of net photosynthetic production to increasing concentrations of CO 2 under fluctuating light is similar to that under continuous light, rates of transpiration respond slowly to changes of light intensity and are barely affected by the concentration of CO 2 in the range of 260 – 495 ppm, in which net photosynthesis increases by more than 100 %. The analysis of the results confirms that future increases of CO 2 will improve the efficiency of the conversion of radiant energy into biomass, but will not reduce the contribution of plant transpiration to the leaf thermal balance...|$|R
50|$|The {{table of}} probabilities for a {{specific}} machine is called the Probability and <b>Accounting</b> Report or <b>PAR</b> sheet, also PARS commonly understood as Paytable and Reel Strips. Mathematician Michael Shackleford revealed the PARS for one commercial slot machine, an original International Gaming Technology Red White and Blue machine. This game, in its original form, is obsolete, so these specific probabilities do not apply. He only published the odds after a fan of his sent him some information provided on a slot machine that was posted on a machine in the Netherlands. The psychology of the machine design is quickly revealed. There are 13 possible payouts ranging from 1:1 to 2,400:1. The 1:1 payout comes every 8 plays. The 5:1 payout comes every 33 plays, whereas the 2:1 payout comes every 600 plays. Most players assume the likelihood increases proportionate to the payout. The one midsize payout {{that is designed to}} give the player a thrill is the 80:1 payout. It is programmed to occur an average of once every 219 plays. The 80:1 payout is high enough to create excitement, but not high enough that it makes it likely that the player will take his winnings and abandon the game. More than likely the player began the game with at least 80 times his bet (for instance there are 80 quarters in $20). In contrast the 150:1 payout occurs only on average of once every 6,241 plays. The highest payout of 2,400:1 occurs only on average of once every 643=262,144 plays since the machine has 64 virtual stops. The player who continues to feed the machine is likely to have several midsize payouts, but unlikely to have a large payout. He quits after he is bored or has exhausted his bankroll.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1985 The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project {{was to determine the}} relative contribution of cognitive and non-cognitive variables to accounting achievement and to determine which variables have the greatest influence on accounting achievement so that these variables can be used to predict accounting achievement. To reach the aim of the study, a literature study was undertaken which was followed by an empirical investigation. The literature study was divided into a study of cognitive {see chapter 2) and non-cognitive (see chapter 3) variables. It was found that cognitive variables had the greater influence on academic achievement with previous achievement and intelligence as the main contributors. Research findings indicated that cognitive variables were responsible for 25 to 50 {{percent of the variance in}} academic achievement. In search for the remaining 75 to 50 percent, researchers included non-cognitive variables in their research attempts. Most researchers came to the conclusion that academic achievement could be better predicted when both cognitive and non-cognitive variables were included in research attempts, although no one was willing to report a definite increase in percentage. The empirical investigation made use of the information gathered in 1980 in the Orange Free State {see chapter 4). All the Afrikaans speaking pupils in die Orange Free State during 1980 were included in the research program. Different measuring instruments {see par. 4. 4) were used to identify a large variety of independent variables (see par. 4. 5. 1). The dependent variable for {{this research}} was standard ten <b>Accounting</b> (see <b>par.</b> 4. 52). The different statistical techniques are described in par. 4. 6. 2. A factor analysis was carried out to group the different variables according to their correlation coefficients with standard ten Accounting (see table 5. 1). The 61 independent variables were grouped into 17 different factors. On these factors, together with average standard seven marks and six individual standard seven subjects, several multiple regression analysis were executed to find the best collection of predictors and their contribution to R 2 {see tables 5. 4 to 5. 11). The Mallows Cp-value was used as criterium in finding the best collection of predictors. In chapter five the results of the research were reported. The main findings of this research are: 1) Cognitive variables contribute more than non-cognitive variables to the prediction of standard ten accounting achievement although non-cognitive variables contribute considerable. 2) Previous academic achievement is the single variable with the largest contribution to the prediction of standard ten accounting achievement. 3) Study habits, attitudes and affect are the non-cognitive variables with the largest contribution to the prediction of standard ten accounting achievement. 4) The standard ten accounting achievement of boys and girls are influenced by different independent variables. 5) Personality, family and school variables do not have a considerable influence on standard ten accounting achievement, although personality variables B contributes considerable to the standard ten accounting of boys and schoolfactors and family circumstances to that of girls. In chapter six certain conclusions were made, implications of the research findings were given, shortcomings of the research findings were given and certain recommendations were made. While it is true that little can be done to the intelligence of a person, the results of this research that previous academic achievement, study methods and intellectual factors were the three most important factors for standard ten accounting achievement are of great value for teachers. Teachers must make sure that every child knows each part of the work before they carry on with new work and must help or provide children with the best study methods. By doing so, the teacher can do a great deal in attaining high accounting achievement. Master...|$|R
