But this eternal cackle, cackle, cackle about things in general is only fit for old, old, OLD people. I suppose it means something to them: theyve had their fling.

60|$|Wonderful {{to go out}} on {{a frozen}} road, to see the grass in shadow bluish with hoar-frost, to see the grass in the yellow winter-sunrise beams melting and going cold-twinkly. Wonderful the bluish, cold air, and things {{standing}} up in cold distance. After two southern winters, with roses blooming all the time, this bleakness and this touch of frost in the ringing morning goes to my soul like an intoxication. I am so glad, on this lonely naked road, I don't know what to do with myself. I walk down in the shallow grassy ditches under the loose stone walls, I walk on the little ridge of grass, the little bank on which the wall is built, I cross the road across the frozen cow-droppings: and it is all so familiar to my feet, my very feet in contact, that I am wild as if I had made a discovery. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> I hate lime-stone, to live on lime-stone or marble or any of those limey rocks. I hate them. They are dead rocks, they have no life--thrills for the feet. Even sandstone is much better. But granite! Granite is my favorite. It is so live under the feet, it has a deep sparkle of its own. I like its roundnesses--and I hate the jaggy dryness of lime-stone, that burns in the sun, and withers.|$|E

He soon also lifted the security roadblocks within the city and installed surveillance cameras covering critical locations in the city for crime prevention.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{possibilities}} of treating the contents of the blood stream as a hemolytic system in which a more or less steady state is maintained by the production of new red cells to replace those which are destroyed. The attempt will raise both new questions and questions which have been the subject of investigation already, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> it will often do no more than outline the problems still to be solved. In their essentials, these problems are those of the nature of the in vivo lysins, the nature of their accelerators and inhibitors, the rules which apply to the mixtures of lysins, accelerators, and inhibitors which compose the in vivo hemolytic systems, and the kinetics which describe the way in which red cell destruction by the hemolytic mixtures is balanced by the production of new red cells. 1. The Lyric Effect of Mixtures of Lysins, Accderators, and Inhibitors In vivo hemolytic systems consist of mixtures of many lysins, accelerators, and inhibitors, and relations must exist between the hemolytic activity of these mixtures and the activity of the lysins acting singly, accelerated or inhibited b...|$|E
40|$|When {{reviewing}} international strategy relevant theory, I {{found very}} interesting the born global firm’s theory. I chose NDrive <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the company fitted {{well in this}} context. Although this theory {{was introduced in the}} 90 s, it continues to have relevance today with more and more companies in the same situation. This case study and the theory embedded will allow students to develop knowledge in strategic management with focus in internationalization strategies and apply important strategic frameworks. In that sense, the purpose is getting students to discuss international strategies relating this case study with the theory of born global Firms. When asked about implementing a good business idea, João Neto, NDrive Chairman, is peremptory “The only advice I can give is internationalization". With just over five years of existence, NDrive is an interesting success story {{in one of the most}} sophisticated markets in the world, the navigation software market. Being in a very competitive market, NDrive is gaining important scope and relevance. The company describes innovative commercialization models based on three core areas: agreements with major international equipment manufacturers as LG, partnerships with mobile Telco´s as Vivo or by managing direct presence in apps stores. Taking advantage of partnerships and apps stores phenomena, the company is gaining an important global presence...|$|E

40|$|I wish {{to thank}} the {{organizers}} of this conference for inviting me to participate in Project 2061 ’s exciting, and daunting, effort to transform science education as it exists in the United States. I am not a science educator, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> I {{run the risk of}} sounding naïve regarding issues of “scientific literacy. ” Nevertheless, I am excited about the prospects of school science and mathematics coming to complement each other at levels deeper than each being a context or tool for the other. I will briefly develop three themes, and later show that the first two are aspects of the third. The first theme is that mathematics and science education share a significant common problem: the improvement of elementary and secondary teacher education programs, with the former being the more urgently needed. The second theme is that imagery built up by students through their experiences in elementary school has a far deeper influence on their ability to construct mathematical and scientific concepts than we had thought. The third is that school science and mathematics instruction and curricula, including those envisioned in the Benchmarks, need to pay greater attention to students ’ conceptualization of physical quantities and quantitative reasoning than is presently the case...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} fifteen years, I have worked as a music therapist, usually {{engaging}} with a diverse clientele. My profession is a practice of leadership, yet {{there are very few}} studies relating music therapy to leadership. This paper explores music therapy as a creative approach to leadership. Moreover, it focuses on music therapy leadership in a multicultural context that represents an opportunity for leading a social justice movement. This essay is certainly not exhaustive and does not have the pretension to cover all aspects of the cultural issues in the leadership, therapeutic and music arenas. This is a revised version of a paper I wrote for one of my professors in my doctoral program in Leadership and Change. The literature I have used from Leadership Studies is considered to be core in this program <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> there is leadership literature in other languages. But much of it has not been translated into English or French. I am also reflecting upon my own experience which is influenced by my Western music and music therapy trainings. This represents both strengths and limitations when it comes to leadership in the multicultural area. One of the goals {{of this paper is to}} "inform" the reader, as the concept instrument implies. Instrument is derived from the Greek and Latin roots instrumentum and instruere which means "to inform", "to equip with tools" (Robert, 2000). In that sense, multicultural music therapy and leadership practices can benefit from "teaching" each other. This paper looks at the constituent parts of multicultural music therapy and leadership which I will argue share the basic concepts of Listening, Vision and Process. These concepts emerged from making a parallel between my experience as a music therapist and the leadership literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} my {{study is to}} {{highlight}} how children at preschool are affected by adult’s awareness of norms and interpretations of masculinity and femininity. The essay shows examples of boys’ and girls´ expectations {{of each other and}} the preconceived notions of what boys and girls should or can do, and how we pedagogues relate to this matter. One example is about an encounter with a mother, where we have different opinions about her son´s wishes to be Lucia instead of Santa Claus. I had to reconsider my pre-understanding <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> we can create opportunities to receive and give, without preconceived notions of what is "right" or "wrong". Main issues are: What is controlling our thoughts and actions and hence causes us to act stereotypically? How can we pedagogues give children the opportunity to establish their identity beyond taken for granted notions of gender? Is it possible to be a conscious and sensitive gender pedagogue all the time, and what does it mean? My study is based on hermeneutics as a method. This means that I interpret and show various perspectives from my horizon of understanding. I look into different situations from other´s perspectives, theories and literature together with the experience I posses as a pedagogue. Related to this experience, the essay shows that pedagogues often believe that they meet and treat each child as individuals, and that the children are given the same opportunities and rights. I also study power theory based on the philosopher Michel Foucault´s works and I find that it is a difficult balance between the beliefs of pedagogues and some parents have. I refer to the pre-revised curriculum that emphasizes that we must counteract traditional gender patterns and gender roles (Lpfö 98, revised 2010). But despite the wording of the curriculum, I find that we establish gender patterns and reproduce its many times stereotypical way of considering what is male or female. The essay also discusses ideas about how gender affects the various ways in which children are allowed to play and, in turn, affect how pedagogues relate to and challenge the children’s play and learning...|$|E
