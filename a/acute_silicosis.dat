40|$|ABSTRACT Chronic necrotizing {{pulmonary}} aspergillosis (CNPA), a form {{of chronic}} pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), affects immunocompetent or mildly immunocompromised persons with underlying pulmonary disease. These conditions are associated with high morbidity and mortality and often require long-term antifungal treatment. The long-term prognosis for patients with CNPA and the potential complications of CNPA have not been well documented. The {{aim of this study}} was to review published papers that report cases of CNPA complications and to highlight risk factors for development of CNPA. The complications in conjunction associated with CNPA are as follows: pseudomembranous necrotizing tracheobronchial aspergillosis, ankylosing spondylarthritis, pulmonary <b>silicosis,</b> <b>acute</b> respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease, superinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and and pneumothorax. The diagnosis of CNPA is still a challenge. Culture and histologic examinations of bronchoscopically identified tracheobronchial mucus plugs and necrotic material should be performed in all immunocompromised individuals, even when the radiographic findings are unchanged. Early detection of intraluminal growth of Aspergillus and prompt antifungal therapy may facilitate the management of these patients and prevent development of complications...|$|R

By measuring a few basic parameters and using a graph, a drill operator or engi 2 can estimate the relative severity of drill dust emissions {{as well as how}} much of a reduction in ARD can be obtained by changing any given parameter. Geometric parameters include: drill deck cross-sectional area, shroud leakage associated with the deck shroud as well as the operational parameters of bailing air 2, and dust collector airflow.

5000|$|The {{preventable}} {{disabling disease}} of silicosis has three main types, chronic, acute and accelerated. Chronic silicosis {{is the most}} common occurring after 10-20 years of low to moderate exposure of respirable crystalline silica. [...] Current studies have shown workers exposed to silica at the current recommend exposure limits (REL) during a lifetime of work develop chronic silicosis. A chest x-ray is used to diagnose chronic silicosis, which has similar symptoms as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). General symptoms are shortness of breath, productive or nonproductive cough, fatigue, and occasionally respiratory failure. ccelerated silicosis has similar symptoms as chronic silicosis, however it develops rapidly in 5-10 years of high exposure to respirable crystalline silica. Lastly, <b>acute</b> <b>silicosis</b> is less prevalent than the other types, however it is a more severe disease with a high occurrence of disability and death. <b>Acute</b> <b>silicosis</b> develops between several months to years with extreme levels of silica exposure, and severe symptoms include shortness of breath, weakness, cough, fever and weight loss.

5000|$|After the Civil War, {{the area}} {{began to grow}} as coal {{production}} escalated {{in the state of}} West Virginia and abundant water made the generation of power inexpensive. In {{the early part of the}} 1900s, a dam was constructed across the river from Glen Ferris. Trains operated on both sides of the river, carrying passengers as well as coal. In 1917, Union Carbide purchased a small hydro electrice plant in Glen Ferris, the brick remains of which can still be seen on the edge of the Kanawha River and which is being presently renovated. While continuing to operate this small plant, in 1929-30, Carbide built a much larger ferro-alloys plant at Alloy, a few miles downriver from Glen Ferris, which, at that time, was the world's largest ferro-alloys plant, employing some 2800 people, during its heyday from the time of its construction through the early 1960s. In order to generate power for the larger plant by diverting water from the New River, the company had a 3-mile long tunnel built through the mountain at Hawks Nest. The rock through which the tunnel was built consisted of 98% pure silica and caused acute silica poisoning among hundreds of unprotected workers, many of whom died. Many who died were buried close by in mass graves on the property which is now the Hawks Nest Country Club. At the time, the nearby town of Gauley Bridge became known as [...] "the town of the walking dead". The disaster became the focus of Congressional hearings in Washington, D.C., in the mid-thirties, and <b>acute</b> <b>silicosis</b> was identified as an occupational illness for the first time. The town of Glen Ferris followed the pattern already set by mine companies in the area. Union Carbide built a majority of the homes in Glen Ferris, as well as in other towns in the Upper Kanawha Valley and leased them to workers and their families. During its heyday, Union Carbide also provided a recreation hall in the upper end of the village. A post office/general store, an elementary school, a tennis court, a bowling alley, and a playground also served the residents. After the 1950s, as plant production declined, Union Carbide began to sell the houses to their occupants. In the 1970s, several homes were constructed on the mountainside above Glen Ferris in the north end of town; these would be Glen Ferris' largest homes and lead to its continued development as a place where people chose to live, primarily for its scenic views and in contrast to surrounding towns along Route 60. In recent years, several even larger homes have been built on the northern edge of Glen Ferris, close to Gauley Bridge. The elementary school was closed in 1961; the apostolic church stands there now. The town remains a picturesque spot for photographers. Views of the falls at the northern end of town and views of the Kanawha River and Gauley Bridge at the southern end of the village offer exceptionally scenic [...] "photo ops" [...] during every season. Nearby whitewater rafting on the New River Gorge has brought many tourists to the town.|$|E

40|$|Three {{pulmonary}} disease conditions {{result from the}} accumulation of phospholipids in the lung. These conditions are the human lung disease known as pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, the lipoproteinosis that arises in the lungs of rats during <b>acute</b> <b>silicosis,</b> and the phospholipidoses induced by numerous cationic amphiphilic therapeutic agents. In this paper, the status of phospholipid metabolism in the lungs {{during the process of}} each of these lung conditions has been reviewed and possible mechanisms for their establishment are discussed. Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is characterized by the accumulation of tubular myelin-like multilamellated structures in the alveoli and distal airways of patients. These structures appear to be formed by a process of spontaneous assembly involving surfactant protein A and surfactant phospholipids. Structures similar to tubular myelin-like multilamellated structures {{can be seen in the}} alveoli of rats during <b>acute</b> <b>silicosis</b> and, as with the human condition, both surfactant protein A and surfactant phospholipids accumulate in the alveoli. Excessive accumulation of surfactant protein A and surfactant phospholipids in the alveoli could arise from their overproduction and hypersecretion by a subpopulation of Type II cells that are activated by silica, and possibly other agents. Phospholipidoses caused by cationic amphiphilic therapeutic agents arise as a result of their inhibition of phospholipid catabolism. Inhibition of phospholipases results in the accu...|$|E

40|$|Inhaled {{particles}} such as {{crystalline silica}} (CSP) may induce {{the development of}} chronic lung inflammation (alveolitis), fibrosis and cancer. Inflammatory cells that accumulate in the lung in response to CSP are, in part, responsible {{for the release of}} growth factors and cytokines (e. g. IL- 1 β, TNFα, PDGF and TGF-β) that amplify alveolitis and activate fibroblasts. Here we addressed early aspects of silicosis and focused on the role played by inflammatory mediators in the initial steps of CSP-induced toxicity in mice. The study reveals that CSP induce a type I interferon signature (IFN-β, IRF- 7, OAS) qualitatively similar to viral infection in the lung of mice. The use of mice deficient for type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) showed that this response contributes to maintain the pulmonary inflammation induced by CSP. An implication of pulmonary neutrophils in this mechanism is suggested, underlining a potentially new function for these cells. The thesis also shows that the IL- 1 pathway (MyD 88, ASC, IL- 1 R 1) plays a role in the development and maintenance of the pulmonary inflammation induced by CSP. Blockade of the IL- 1 pathway did, however, not prevent the development of silicotic nodules and moreover induced alveolar proteinosis and diffuse fibrosis in mice deficient for MyD 88 or IL- 1 R 1, similar to <b>acute</b> <b>silicosis</b> in humans. These results indicate that blocking the IL- 1 pathway is probably not a useful therapeutic approach in silicosis. (SBIM 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|E
40|$|Silica {{exposure}} {{results in}} an increased lifelong risk of developing mycobacterial pulmonary infections. To date, there are no animal models that replicate this finding to permit assessment of the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to mycobacterial infection. To test the hypothesis that prior silica exposure increases risk of mycobacterial infection, we intratracheally (I. T.) administered silica, a control dust (Al 2 O 3) or saline into mechanically ventilated C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Later, the mice received Mycobacterium avium or Mycobacterium tuberculosis I. T. Mice were sacrificed at defined time points and mycobacteria in lung homogenates were quan-tified. M. avium or M. tuberculosis infection was markedly increased in silica-exposed mice compared with mice exposed to either Al 2 O 3 or saline beginning 3 wk after silica exposure. Similarly, lung sections from silica-exposed mice had many more acid fast bacilli (AFB) organisms than from control mice. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) from bronchoalveolar lavage of silica-exposed mice also revealed a higher number of mycobacteria compared with mice treated with Al 2 O 3 or saline. In addition, passive transfer of AMs from silica-exposed mice to control mice increased M. tuberculosis susceptibility. These results indicate that silica exposure converts mycobacteria-resistant mice into mycobacteria-susceptible mice via a process that likely involves a new population of AMs that {{are more susceptible to}} mycobacterial infection.

40|$|Exposure to mineral aerosol is an {{occupational}} health hazard in mining and mineral processing industries {{because of the}} risk of developing pneumoconiosis. Agricola (1556) described this hazard for metal mining in Carpathia. He described shortness of breath and consumption, conditions that are now associated with asthma and emphysema. By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, several respiratory diseases were known to affect miners, including silicosis and coal workers' pneumoconiosis (Fletcher, 1948; Seaton et al., 1981). For example, silicosis, not tuberculosis, was clearly recognized as the hazard in the Vermont granite quarries and stone-cutting sheds (McFarland, 1927). The Gauly Bridge Tunnel disaster in the mid- 1930 s caused the deaths of an estimated 700 workers by <b>acute</b> <b>silicosis</b> and focused the nation's attention on this disease (Cherniack, 1986). By the mid-twentieth century, it was clear that risk of simple pneumoconiosis is associated with a miner's cumulative exposure to mine aerosol in the respirable size range and that prevention lies in reducing that exposure through regulation (Seaton, 1986). In the United States, regulation of mine worker exposure to airborne mine dust is the responsibility of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in the U. S. Department of Labor. The key legislation relating to improved mine worker health was the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, enacted in 1969 (U. S. Congress, 1969) and subsequently amended as the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (U. S. Congress, 1977). MSHA receives technical assistance from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). NIOSH also provides recommended exposure limits (RELs) for contaminants to MSHA. MSHA's regulation of mines includes the establishment of a dust standard administratively based on the these RELs. Some mine operators must submit a dust control plan designed to meet the dust standard. Periodic mine inspections determine if mines are com- plying with both the dust standard and the dust control plans (MSHA, 1991). The most common dust measurements are those for respirable dust (according to the definition given in Fig. 26 - 7), that is, the fraction of aerosol particles able to reach the gas exchange region of the lungs. The other health-related size fractions (inhalable and thoracic-see Fig. 25 - 1, and "total" dust) are also occasionally measured. A "total" dust measurement is defined by the common practice of the last 30 years or so, using 25 mm or 37 mm plastic cassettes (e. g., from PAL, MIL, SKC).

40|$|Researchers {{studying}} dust generation from blasthole drills {{developed a}} simple, quick fix that reduced respirable dust concentrations {{by more than}} 63 % at the dump point. This device, which requires almost no maintenance, is small and inexpensive, and it will help operators maintain compliance to the dust standard. The thought process was that a reduction of respirable dust {{at any of the}} multiple sources on the drill, in this case the dust collector dump point, should reduce the total respirable dust generated by the drill. The U. S. Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA) has a coal respirable dust standard of 2 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m 3) for an 8 -hour shift. MSHA and mine operators periodically collect personal dust samples to determine compliance with this dust standard. Drill operators have one of the highest exposure levels to respirable dust. This has been proven through many reviews of the MSHA dust sampling database. Prior to 1987, the highwall driller at surface coal mines had the most severe exposure to respirable silica dust, a trend that continues today based on MSHA's respirable dust sampling database. A review of the MSHA database for the years 1985 through 1992 shows that 81 % of the respirable silica dust samples taken exceeded the permissible exposure limit for the highwall drill operator at surface coal mines. A more recent review of the MSHA database, for the years 1996 through 2000, shows that only 31 % of the respirable silica dust samples taken exceeded the respirable silica dust limit for the highwall driller at surface coal mines. This suggests a substantial improvement in preventing the exposure of silica dust to the highwall drill operator. The drill operator, however, still tops the list of job occupations that have the highest exposure to respirable silica dust Respirable dust {{has been shown to be}} harmful to human health, especially when silica is present in the dust. It causes a disease known as silicosis, which can occur in three levels: chronic silicosis, which occurs after 10 years of exposure; accelerated silicosis, which occurs between 5 and 10 years of exposure; and <b>acute</b> <b>silicosis,</b> which can occur within a few weeks to five years of very high exposure to silica dust. Respirable dust consists of the dust particle size fraction whose median diameter is 4 micrometers (m). The drilling machine generates high concentrations of respirable dust from several sources: drill table shroud leakage, dust leakage through the table bushing, dust discharge from the dust collector exhaust due to impaired filters, and dust entrained from the dust collector fines dumped onto the bench. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's (NIOSH) Pittsburgh Research Lab (PRL) has been studying different methods to reduce respirable dust from these sources. During its testing, the institute identified a simple solution that reduces the amount of respirable dust generated at the collector dump point...|$|E
