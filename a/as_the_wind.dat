Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows. The {{magnetic field}} of the star interacts with the wind, which applies a drag to the stellar rotation. As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to the wind, and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E

40|$|Vortex, <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> of a {{vector field}} in two dimensions, has its core the field {{singularity}} and its topological charge defined by <b>the</b> quantized <b>winding</b> angle of <b>the</b> vector field. Vortices {{are one of}} the most fundamental topological excitations in nature, widely known in hair whorls <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> of hair strings, in fluid dynamics <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> of velocities, in angular-momentum beams <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> of phase angle and in superconductors and superfluids <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> of order parameters. Nevertheless, vortices have hardly been observed other than those in the real space. Although band degeneracies, such as Dirac cones, can be viewed as momentum-space vortices in their mathematical structures, there lacks a well-defined physical observable whose winding number is an arbitrary signed integer. Here, we experimentally observed momentum-space vortices <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> of far-field polarization vectors in the Brillouin zone (BZ) of periodic plasmonic structures. Using a home-made polarization-resolved momentum-space imaging spectroscopy, we completely map out the dispersion, lifetime and polarization of all radiative states at the visible wavelengths. The momentum space vortices were experimentally identified by their <b>winding</b> patterns in <b>the</b> polarization-resolved iso-frequency contours and their diverging radiative quality factors. Such polarization vortices can exist robustly on any periodic systems of vectorial fields, while they are not captured by the existing topological band theory developed for scaler fields. This work opens up a promising avenue for exploring topological photonics in the momentum space, studying bound states in continuum (BICs), as well as for rendering and steering vector beams and designing high-Q plasmonic resonances.

5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, Furieuse disappeared ahead, Mounsey pursuing in {{the hope}} of rediscovering his opponent during the night. At 03:00 on 6 July, the British lookouts spotted the French ship in the distance and the chase began again, Bonne Citoyenne proving much faster than the French ship <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> strengthened. At 09:10 it became clear to Kerdaniel that he could not escape his opponent and instead turned to meet her, opening fire five minutes later as Bonne Citoyenne came within range. Mounsey replied immediately, the two ships exchanging fire at close range for nearly seven hours, the smaller and more manoeuvrable Bonne Citoyenne successfully turning several times to vary her broadsides and prevent her guns overheating. In the exchange, the British ship fired 129 broadsides, while Furieuse only managed 70: Bonne Citoyenne lost three cannon to fractures caused by the intense heat generated by repeated firing. With his ammunition spent, Mounsey swung towards Furieuse at 18:16 to board and capture her, at which point Kerdaniel, whose ship was battered and unmanoeuvrable, surrendered.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> shear decreased, the {{convection}} increased further, and the IMD upgraded {{the system}} to a deep depression at 00:00UTC on June1. Later that day, the system began rapidly intensifying while moving on a northwest trajectory; the IMD upgraded {{the system to}} a cyclonic storm at 09:00UTC, naming it Phet. An eye became evident during a Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) pass of the storm; its appearance {{and the development of}} rainbands showed Phet was intensifying. Late on June1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, estimating 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), after the eye became better defined and the tightly-curved thunderstorm activity. The IMD upgraded Phet to severe cyclonic storm status at 00:00UTC on June2, and further to a very severe cyclonic storm six hours later.|$|E

5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E
5|$|After re-attaining {{tropical}} storm status, Kyle turned {{more to the}} northeast and parallel to the coastline, making landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina as a minimal {{tropical storm}}. The storm briefly moved over open waters before again making landfall near Long Beach, North Carolina late on October 11. By early on October 12, the storm had weakened to tropical depression status. At the time of it moving ashore, there was a separate non-tropical low to the northeast of the depression, and shear had greatly increased, which made re-intensification unlikely. However, convection redeveloped baroclinically with the approaching cold front, and Kyle attained tropical storm status {{for the fifth time}} over the eastern Pamlico Sound. The restrengthening was short-lived, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> field expanded while the convection transitioned into that of a frontal band. After emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Kyle merged with a cold front late on October 12. The remnants of Kyle continued eastward, executing a loop on October 14 before turning northeastward and impacting the Azores on October 17. The next day, the remnants of Kyle were absorbed by an extratropical cyclone to its northwest, which continued northeastward and moved near the British Isles on October 23.|$|E

5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E
5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move in the same direction <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use of a branch of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E

25|$|Karachi has an arid climate, {{albeit a}} {{moderate}} {{version of this}} climate. Karachi {{is located on the}} coast and as a result has a relatively mild climate. Karachi has two main seasons; Summer & Winter, while spring and autumn are very short. Summer season persists for longest period during the year.

25|$|These passes {{include the}} Soledad Pass, the Cajon Pass, and the San Gorgonio Pass, all {{well known for}} exaggerating Santa Anas as they are funneled through. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> narrows and is {{compressed}} into the passes its velocity increases dramatically, often to near-gale force or above. At the same time, as the air descends from higher elevation to lower, it is heated adiabatically, warming about 5°F for each 1,000feet it descends (10°C for each 1,000m). As it warms, its capacity to hold moisture increases, so its relative humidity decreases. The air has already been dried by orographic lift before reaching the Great Basin, {{as well as by}} subsidence from the upper atmosphere, so this additional warming often causes relative humidity to fall below 10 percent. The end result is a strong, warm, and very dry wind blowing out of the bottom of mountain passes into the valleys and coastal plain.|$|E
