Median eminence tissue transplanted from immature rats or from mature rats in various phases of the vaginal oestrous cycle had no effects on ovulation when transplanted alone.

40|$|Anabaenopeptins (AP) are {{bioactive}} cyclic hexapeptides synthesized nonribosomally in cyanobacteria. APs {{are characterized}} by several conserved motifs, including the ureido bond, N-methylation in position 5, and D-Lys in position 2. All other positions of the AP molecule are variable, resulting in numerous structural variants. We have identified a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) operon from Planktothrix agardhii strain CYA 126 / 8 consisting of five genes (apnA to apnE) encoding six NRPS modules and have confirmed its role in AP synthesis by the generation of a mutant via insertional inactivation of apnC. In order to correlate the genetic diversity among adenylation domains (A domains) with AP structure variation, we sequenced the A domains of all six NRPS modules from seven Planktothrix strains differing {{in the production of}} AP congeners. It is remarkable that single strains coproduce <b>APs</b> <b>bearing</b> either of the chemically divergent amino acids Arg and Tyr in exocyclic position 1. Since the A domain of the initiation module (the ApnA A 1 domain) has been proposed to activate the amino acid incorporated into exocyclic position 1, we decided to analyze this domain both biochemically and phylogenetically. Only ApnA A 1 enzymes from strains producing AP molecules con-taining Arg or Tyr in position 1 were found to activate these two chemically divergent amino acids in vitro. Phylogenetic analysis of apn A domain sequences revealed that strains with a promiscuous ApnA A 1 domain are derived from an ancestor that activates only Arg. Surprisingly, positive selection appears to affect only thre...|$|R
40|$|The c-Fos protein {{has three}} {{activation}} modules at its C-terminus, {{two of which}} contain motifs (HOB 1 and HOB 2) which are also present in the activation domains of c-Jun. Here we show the existence of two additional activation modules at the N-terminus of c-Fos, one of which contains a second HOB 1 motif (HOB 1 -N). The N-terminus also contains an inhibitor domain (ID 1) which silences HOB 1 activity. GAL 4 fusion experiments showed that ID 1 can specifically silence HOB 1 -containing activation domains from c-Fos or c-Jun when linked in cis, but will not affect other distinct activation domains. The c-Fos related protein, FosB, also contains an inhibitor domain. Mutagenic and deletion analyses identify an inhibitor motif (IM 1) conserved between c-Fos and FosB, which is required for inhibitor function. Mutagenesis of IM 1 enhances the ability of c-Fos to activate an <b>AP</b> 1 <b>bearing</b> promoter. Finally, squelching experiments suggest that c-Fos ID 1 binds a limiting protein involved in inhibition. These results demonstrate {{the existence of a}} new class of inhibitor domain within transcriptional activators, which acts in a sequence specific manner to inhibit a subset of activation domains...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Unicompartmental knee {{replacements}} (UKRs) are {{an alternative}} to total knee replacements (TKRs) for treating isolated medial compartment knee osteoarthritis. However, revision rates are consistently higher than for TKR and UKRs are commonly revised for “unexplained” pain, a possible cause of which is elevated proximal tibial bone strain. The influence of implant design on this strain has not been previously investigated. Aims: The aims of this thesis are {{to determine the effect}} of medial UKR tibial component design on proximal tibial strain and ongoing pain. Methods: A retrospective clinical cohort study was performed comparing patient reported outcome and implant survival of a metal backed mobile bearing UKR implant (n= 289) and an all-polyethylene (<b>AP)</b> fixed <b>bearing</b> UKR implant (n= 111) with minimum 5 year follow up. A method of digital radiological densitometry, the greyscale ratio b (GSRb), was developed, validated and applied to plain radiographs to measure changes in bone density over 5 years in both the metal backed (n= 173) and all-polyethylene (n= 72) UKR patients. A finite element model (FEM) was validated against previous mechanical testing data and was used to analyse the effect of metal backing and implant thickness on proximal tibial cancellous bone strain in fixed bearing UKR implants. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} patient reported outcomes between implants throughout follow up. Ten year all cause survival was 90. 2 (95...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare three {{questions}} on knee pain {{with respect to}} determined prevalence and associations with disability and structural change. METHODS: Postal survey to 4057 men and women aged 40 - 79 years. Knee pain was defined by {{three questions}}: (A) "Have you ever had pain in or around the knee on most days {{for at least a}} month? If so, have you experienced any pain during the last year?" (B) "Have you had pain within the last year in or around the knee that occurred on most days for at least a month?" (C) "Have you had knee pain on most days of the last month?" [American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for knee osteoarthritis]. Disability was assessed with the SF- 36 health status questionnaire. Radiographs (<b>AP</b> weight <b>bearing</b> and skyline) were obtained on a proportion (n = 459) and graded for maximum osteophyte in any compartment. RESULTS: Prevalence of knee pain for questions A, B, and C were 28. 3 %, 25. 3 %, and 19. 3 % respectively. Highest rates of disability were observed for question C (71. 3 % compared with 60. 9 % for question A). There was no major difference between questions in terms of percentage with > or = grade 1 osteophyte or > or = grade 2 osteophyte. Sensitivity and specificity of each question for > or = grade 1 osteophyte did vary, with question A being most sensitive but least specific (58. 7 % and 59. 1 %) and question C most specific (72. 7 %) but least sensitive (45. 4 %). CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of knee pain and disability are influenced by even minor changes in question content. The ACR criteria question may be a better predictor of disability but is relatively insensitive for use in the community...|$|R
40|$|Introductions. Several {{studies have}} shown that the acute phase {{response}} may take place in osteoarthritis, suggesting that low grade systemic inflammation may be present in patients with osteoarthritis. Materials and methods. This study was aimed to measure the c-reactive protein level of knee osteoarthritis, to determine radiographic grading of knee osteoarthritis according to Kellgren-Lawrence grading, and to determine correlation between level of c-reactive protein and radiographic grading of knee osteoarthritis. This study used observational cross sectional design. Samples were 65 postmenopausal women with clinical knee osteoarthritis, aged 50 to 70 years old. Clinical and radiologic diagnoses of knee osteoarthritis were determined by clinical and radiographic examination with <b>AP</b> weight <b>bearing</b> position. Grade < 3, grade 3 and grade 4 were radiographic grading of knee osteoarthritis according to Kellgren-Lawrence classification. Results. From 65 samples, 28 (43 %) samples had grade < 3 with level of c-reactive protein 0. 2 - 1. 0 mg/dl (0. 54 ± 0. 23 mg/dl), 22 (34 %) samples had grade 3 with level of c-reactive protein 0. 3 - 1. 4 mg/dl (0. 70 ± 0. 33 mg/dl) and 15 (23 %) samples had grade 4 with level of c-reactive protein 0. 3 - 1. 3 mg/dl (0. 80 ± 0. 26 mg/dl). The cumulative of level of c-reactive protein was 0. 2 - 1. 4 mg/dl (0. 65 ± 0. 29 mg/dl). There is correlation between level of c-reactive protein and radiographic grading of knee osteoarthritis (p= 0. 04), with Spearman rho correlation of 0. 349 and α= 5 %. The level of c-reactive protein in grade < 3, grade 3 and grade 4 overlaps, so the level of c-reactive protein could not be used to determine radiographic grading of knee osteoarthritis. Conclusions. There is no correlation between level of c-reactive protein and radiographic grading of knee osteoarthritis, there is a tendency that the level of c-reactive protein is higher in high grade knee osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{presents}} {{clinical and}} radiological {{outcome of a}} percutaneous technique for the correction of hallux valgus and lesser toe deformities. Methods: We present a 36 months follow-up series of 32 patients who have been treated with the Reverdin- Isham osteotomy for the correction of hallux valgus, and a percutaneous technique for the correction of lesser toes deformities and metatarsalgia. Clinical outcome data were recorded with the AOFAS score. Radiologic evaluation consisted of weight <b>bearing</b> (<b>AP,</b> lateral and Walter-Muller) views pre and postoperatively at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 36 months after surgery. Results: At three year follow-up, the mean difference of the HVA was 9. 2 (p< 0. 0001), of the IMA was 0. 4 (p< 6719), and the mean difference of the PASA was 15. 9 (p< 0. 001). The AOFAS rose from 48. 4 to 87. 6. Most encountered complication was oedema that lasted for 6 months, especially in the patients who underwent the Weil osteotomy of II, III and IV metatarsal bone head {{for the treatment of}} metatarsalgia. Conclusion: Many minimal invasive techniques {{are becoming more and more}} recognized, with some indisputable advantages but also not free of objective difficulties. We believe that percutaneous distal metatarsal bone osteotomy represents a good option for the treatment of mild- to moderate hallux valgus, lesser toes deformities and metatarsalgia...|$|R

The {{purposes of this study}} were to compare the radiation dose from quantitative fluoroscopy of the lumbar spine with lumbar spine radiographs, and identify opportunities for dose reduction in quantitative fluoroscopy. MethodsInternationally reported dose area product (DAP) and effective dose data for lumbar spine radiographs were compared with the same for quantitative fluoroscopy and with data from a local hospital for functional radiographs (weight <b>bearing</b> <b>AP,</b> lateral, and/or flexion and extension) (n =  27). The effects of procedure time, age, weight, height and body mass index on the fluoroscopy dose were determined by multiple linear regression using SPSS v 19 software (IBM Corp., Armonck, NY, USA). Results and conclusionThe effective dose (and therefore the estimated risk) for quantitative fluoroscopy is 0. 561  mSv which is lower than in most published data for lumbar spine radiography. The dose area product (DAP) for sagittal (flexion + extension) quantitative fluoroscopy is 3. 94  Gy cm 2 which is lower than local data for two view (flexion and extension) functional radiographs (4. 25  Gy cm 2), and combined coronal and sagittal dose from quantitative fluoroscopy (6. 13  Gy cm 2) is lower than for four view functional radiography (7. 34  Gy cm 2). Conversely DAP for coronal and sagittal quantitative fluoroscopy combined (6. 13  Gy cm 2) is higher than that published for both lumbar AP or lateral radiographs, with the exception of Nordic countries combined data. Weight, procedure time and age were independently positively associated with total dose, and height (after adjusting for weight) was negatively associated, thus as height increased, the DAP decreased...|$|R

40|$|Timken South Africa {{manufacture}} and assemble <b>AP</b> tapered roller <b>bearings</b> {{which are used}} on rail journals. These are also assembled in numerous other facilities worldwide. The bearings are large and cumbersome to handle. On the assembly line there is no method of detecting the presence of cup (outer ring) nicks during the assembly process. A nick is a displacement of metal of very small size on the raceways. High spots of metal also exist. They are most frequently caused during the assembly of bearings. Cup nicks are known for repeat customer complaints due to rough rotation. The presence of the nick can induce premature fatigue spalling on the raceways, thus compromising {{the life of the}} bearing. Accelerometers were mounted on nicked and non-nicked cups and were analysed by completing Fast Fourier Transforms and Power Spectral Densities (PSD) while the assembly was rotated in a Lateral Machine. When analyzing the results with a PSD it was found {{that it was possible to}} define a baseline for a good defect-free bearing at different sampling rates. These were then transposed onto the PSD’s of defective nicked bearings and it was found that the nicked bearings could be distinguished as having exceeded baseline limits. The frequencies at which this trigger occurred were not the associated bearing frequencies calculated for the ball pass outer frequencies. The energy associated with the rollers rotating over the nicked portion of the raceway excites frequencies with sufficient energy to transpose into the machine running frequency range as well natural frequencies of the bearing components. Different severity nicks were detectable as well as roller-spaced and non-roller-spaced nicks. The nicks with high spots excited the most energy. Tests were performed to show that a cone (inner ring) nick was also detectable by exceeding the baseline limit. Testing performed showed that the limits were also applicable when the accelerometer was mounted on a machine component and not directly on the cup. Recommendations include the implementation of the testing on the production line to increase the sample size of acceptable bearings for the baseline definition. The data analysis method can be fully automated to compare measured results to set limits in a reasonable time frame to not compromise production output. Nicks are detectable as long as a whole spectrum of frequencies is considered in the baseline limits and detection is not reliant on one defined frequency...|$|R
