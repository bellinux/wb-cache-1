40|$|This article {{traces the}} {{philosophical}} idea of self-perception from {{the times of}} ancient Stoicism to the thirteenth century by analyzing the views of Seneca, Augustine, and Olivi. The central argument is that they defend the same idea according to which self-preservation and the appropriate use of one’s body requires awareness thereof, despite the obvious contextual differences and the uncertainty of direct historical connections between the authors. They think {{that this kind of}} self-awareness does not belong only to human beings, because irrational animals need to perceive their bodies, the functions of their bodily parts, and to perceive themselves as living beings in order to act appropriately and survive. The attribution of self-perception to animals is based on a distinction between the experiential awareness of the soul and the intellectual understanding of its essence, a distinction postulated by all three authors. The philosophical <b>affinities</b> <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>views</b> show that ideas that originate in Stoic thought were transmitted, directly or indirectly, to medieval philosophical psychology...|$|R

40|$|The article compares Rousseau’s and Wollstonecraft’s {{views on}} the imagination. It is argued that though Wollstonecraft was evidently {{influenced}} by Rousseau, there are significant differences <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>views.</b> These differences are grounded in <b>their</b> different <b>views</b> {{on the faculty of}} reason and its relation to the passions. Whereas Rousseau characterizes reason as a derivative faculty, grounded in the more primary faculty of perfectibility, Wollstonecraft perceives reason as the faculty defining human nature. It is argued that contrary to what is often assumed, Wollstonecraft’s conception of the imagination is not primarily characterized by its Romantic features, but rather by the close <b>affinity</b> she posits <b>between</b> reason and the imagination. This close affinity has several consequences. One consequence is that she is less worried than Rousseau about the imagination wandering without external constrains, because she believes in reason’s ability to guide the imagination by choosing its objects. Ultimately the difference between Rousseau’s and Wollstonecraft’s {{views on the}} imagination helps us understand why she was a passionate philosopher of the Enlightenment while he was one of its first, perceptive and most articulate critics...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} with the inflationary finance story, inflation acceleration in Latin America has been explained {{as the result of}} the interaction of inflation dynamics and the frequency of wage adjustments. Accordingly, small inflation disturbances are connected with a shift from moderate to high inflation (or beyond to hyperinflation) though a mechanism that makes adjustment intervals in wage contracts endogenous. Rudiger Dornbusch (1986) labeled this process the "Pazos-Simonsen mechanism". In this note we summarize the basic contribution of both Felipe Pazos (1978) and Mario Henrique Simonsen (1983) and find crucial differences <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>views</b> on wage dynamics, specifically regarding the endogeneity of the time interval between wage readjustments.

40|$|Writing as the {{recognizable}} modern idea of {{the state}} was being framed, Hugo Grotius (1583 - 1645), Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679) and Samuel Pufendorf (1632 - 94) each took distinctive approaches {{to the problems of}} whether and how there could be any legal or moral norms between these states in their emerging forms.

Four of these were declared independent by the South African government: Transkei in 1976, Bophuthatswana in 1977, Venda in 1979, and Ciskei in 1981 (known as the TBVC states).Once a homeland was granted its nominal independence, its designated citizens had their South African citizenship revoked and replaced with citizenship in their homeland. These people were then issued passports instead of passbooks. Citizens of the nominally autonomous homelands also had their South African citizenship circumscribed, meaning they were no longer legally considered South African.

40|$|Effective local {{leadership}} {{is at the}} heart of the Government's ‘modernisation agenda’. Official pronouncements suggest a fairly straightforward division of roles between elected members who, it is argued, are responsible for community leadership, and officers who should provide corporate leadership of the local authority organisation. In practice, however, executive members frequently find themselves involved in decisions relating to the management and delivery of services. Where the leadership responsibilities of councillors and officers coincide, the compatibility of their different perspectives assumes critical importance. Large scale surveys of officers' and members' perceptions, conducted in 2001, 2002 and 2003, suggest that whereas the views of leading members are in tune with those of corporate officers, there are significant differences <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>views</b> and those of chief officers and service managers.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} students’ views on the orientation of science and to investigate the relationship <b>between</b> <b>their</b> <b>views</b> and decision-making on socio-scientific issues (SSI). In this study, 27 university students attending a science course were asked to discuss four controversial issues: the Toyota recall, the green car, the global warming and swine influenza (influenza A (H 1 N 1)). The study was comprised of two stages. At the first stage, we examined students’ views on the nature of science and on the orientation of science with the open-ended questionnaire based on VNOS and VOSTS. While they held relatively similar views on the nature of science, <b>their</b> <b>views</b> on the orientation of science were distinct as pragmatic, intrinsic, communal and ethical views. At the second stage, to examine the role of <b>their</b> <b>views</b> on the orientation of science in decision-making, we selected four students who had similar views on NOS but different views on the orientation of science. The four students were selected from each group of views on the orientation of science and their decision-making processes were analyzed following grounded theory. Across SSIs, they relied upon <b>their</b> <b>views</b> on the orientation of science as the strategies for decision, though considered different perception, and causal and contextual conditions. This study indicates that understanding students’ views on the orientation of science would be helpful for achieving scientific literacy for informed decision...|$|R
40|$|The {{receptor}} binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a major target of protective immunity in vivo. Although a large number of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have been devel-oped, it remains unclear if a single RBD-targeting nAb or two in combination can prevent neutralization escape and, if not, at-tenuate viral virulence in vivo. In this study, we used a large panel of human nAbs against an epitope that overlaps the interface between the RBD and its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), to assess their cross-neutralization activities against a panel of human and zoonotic SARS-CoVs and neutralization escape mutants. We also investigated the neutralization escape profiles of these nAbs and evaluated their effects on {{receptor binding}} and virus fitness in vitro and in mice. We found that some nAbs had great potency and breadth in neutralizing multiple viral strains, including neutralization escape viruses derived from other nAbs; however, no single nAb or combination of two blocked neutralization escape. Interestingly, in mice the neu-tralization escape mutant viruses showed either attenuation (Urbani background) or increased virulence (GD 03 background) consistent with the different binding <b>affinities</b> <b>between</b> <b>their</b> RBDs and the mouse ACE 2. We conclude that using either single nAbs or dual nAb combinations to target a SARS-CoV RBD epitope that shows plasticity may have limitations for preventing neutralization escape during in vivo immunotherapy. However, RBD-directed nAbs may be useful for providing broad neutral-ization and prevention of escape variants when combined with other nAbs that target a second conserved epitope with less plas-ticity andmore structural constraint...|$|R

However in the UK the attention of the art world shifted to conceptualism. Steele and his associates may also have suffered from a perception of their art as cold or inscrutable.

Results: Four themes were revealed, constituting key parts in the design of the WBSS: Communicating the message, Ideational working principles, User interaction and User interface. Furthermore, decisive differences between the views of participants and PRs were found. Conclusion: The four key parts should be considered in a WBSS directed to young carers.
