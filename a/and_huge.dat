5|$|Fragmentation of {{woodland}} {{can lead}} to local losses of breeding birds, but the species' range is still expanding. It has a large population <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> breeding area, and is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being of least concern.|$|E

5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
5|$|ARPA {{responded by}} forming Project Defender, {{initially}} considering {{a wide variety}} of far-out concepts like particle beam weapons, lasers <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> fleets of space-borne interceptor missiles, the latter known as Project BAMBI. In May 1958, York also began working with Lincoln Labs, MIT's radar research lab, to begin researching ways to distinguish warheads from decoys by radar or other means. This project emerged as the Pacific Range Electromagnetic Signature Studies, or Project PRESS.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} the European {{population of the}} yellowhammer to be from 54–93million individuals, suggesting a Eurasian total of 73–186million birds. Although the population {{appears to be in}} a decline, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. The large numbers <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> breeding range of about 12.9million km2 (5million sq mi), mean that this bunting is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E

5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck feeds in wetlands by day {{or night}} on seeds {{and other parts of}} plants. It is sometimes regarded as a pest of rice cultivation, and is also shot for food in parts of its range. Despite hunting, poisoning by pesticides and natural predation by mammals, birds and reptiles, the large numbers <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> range of this duck mean that it is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Within Britain, {{there has}} been {{continuing}} interest in Lucan's fate. Since Rivett's murder, hundreds of reported sightings {{have been made in}} various countries around the world; none have been substantiated. Despite a police investigation <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> press interest, Lucan has not been found and is presumed dead; a death certificate was issued in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E

5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of 12 October, a gale sprang up which inflicted further damage to the battered ships and caused water to gush through the many shot holes in the ships' hulls. Aboard the Dutch ships, the situation was especially dangerous. Casualties had been significantly higher, particularly on Vrijheid, than on board the British vessels and the small numbers of British sailors placed aboard as prize crews were unable to cope alone, and in the high winds many masts collapsed to the deck <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> quantities of water leaked into the hulls.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being stripped {{away by the}} solar wind. Venus and Mars do not have {{magnetic field}}s, {{and as a result}} the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> quantities of material {{from the surface of the}} Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E

5|$|Enemies {{range from}} camouflaged plants to large {{vultures}} to Komodo dragon-like lizards <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> leviathan in water. Many enemies can kill the Slugcat in one hit, and some species have internal variation, {{such as the}} pink lizards that can climb. The enemies spawn at random, such that the player cannot progress {{through trial and error}} experimentation. These creatures possess dynamic AI and exist in the game's world perpetually, even when not on the same screen as the player. The player does, however, need to experiment with spears to climb walls and knock fruit out of trees. The Slugcat can hold two objects at once and switch between them. It can also eat power-up plants, which grant status effects, such as slowing time.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle also {{despatched}} several officers, including Hoste, {{to operate}} independently. Hoste in Bacchante returned to Apulia and attacked {{a string of}} ports, castles and anchorages, while Captain George Cadogan in HMS Havannah effectively halted the movement of supplies along the northern Italian coast {{in support of the}} approaching Austrian armies. In June, Fremantle himself led his whole squadron against the important port city of Fiume, seizing or burning 90 vessels from the harbour <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> quantities of naval stores after a sharp battle in the city streets. Three months later, Fremantle attacked the city of Trieste, blockading it from the sea, bombarding its defences and landing marines and cannon to join with the besieging Austrian armies and force the city's surrender.|$|E
5|$|In 1640, {{masses of}} Chinese peasants who were starving, {{unable to pay}} their taxes, and no longer in fear of the {{frequently}} defeated Chinese army, began to form into huge bands of rebels. The Chinese military, caught between fruitless efforts to defeat the Manchu raiders from the north <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> peasant revolts in the provinces, essentially fell apart. Unpaid and unfed, the army was defeated by Li Zicheng – now self-styled as the Prince of Shun – and deserted the capital without much of a fight. On 26 May 1644, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng when the city gates were opened by rebel allies from within. During the turmoil, the last Ming emperor hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City.|$|E

5|$|Manuel Marques de Sousa {{was born}} on 13 June 1804 (sometimes erroneously given as 1805) in Rio Grande. The town was located in Rio Grande do Sul, a {{southern}} captaincy (later province) of Brazil, then part of the Portuguese Colonial Empire. His parents were Manuel Marques de Sousa and Senhorinha Inácia da Silveira. He had four younger siblings: two sisters and two brothers. An archetypal leading family of Rio Grande do Sul, Marques de Sousa's Portuguese-descended family was wealthy and influential, owning ranches <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> cattle herds. His father and his paternal grandfather, both also named Manuel Marques de Sousa, were seasoned soldiers {{who took part in}} the colonial wars. His grandfather, the elder Marques de Sousa, was the wealthiest person in Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a perch. It hunts by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. Its eyes are relatively large, each with a reflective layer, which improves night vision. It appears not to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not echolocate. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The European {{population}} of the Eurasian nuthatch has been estimated as 22.5–57million birds, suggesting a global total of 45.9–228million individuals. China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Russia each have between 10,000 and 100,000 breeding pairs. The known breeding area is about 23.3million km2 (9million sq mi), which is {{a large proportion of}} the potential suitable habitat, and the population appears to be stable. The large numbers <b>and</b> <b>huge</b> breeding range mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
