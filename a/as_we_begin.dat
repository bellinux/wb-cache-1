500|$|After {{awakening}} at 8:31 UTC, {{the crew}} {{set to work}} preparing to release Hubble from the payload bay of Atlantis. Using the shuttle's robotic arm, McArthur grappled Hubble at 10:45 UTC, and lifted {{it out of the}} orbiter's payload bay to prepare for the release. Good and Massimino were standing by ready to perform a spacewalk in the event that something went wrong during the telescope's deployment. After working through the checklist to prepare the telescope for release, managers on the ground gave the go to Altman to release Hubble, and at 12:57 UTC, McArthur successfully released the telescope as the vehicles flew over Africa. Performing a small separation burn, Johnson backed the orbiter away from the telescope, and Altman called down to managers on the ground confirming the deployment of Hubble. Commending the crew, Altman said [...] "And Houston, Hubble has been released, it's safely back on its journey of exploration <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> steps to conclude ours. Not everything went as we planned, but we planned a way to work around everything and with the whole team pulling together... we've been able to do some incredible things. And now Hubble can continue on its own, exploring the cosmos, and bringing it home to us as we head for home in a few days. Thank you." [...] Hubble's new equipment and upgraded systems would be tested for several months prior to resuming operation, but if all tests are successful, operation of the telescope would resume in early September.|$|E

An' while they're doin' that, an' our bunch on the poop is takin' 'em in, you an' me can make a pretty big hole in them that's left. What d'ye say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We hear {{considerable}} of the [...] "conventional people" [...] of this world, {{but seldom}} meet with them; for, as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> {{to know a}} person, we discover peculiarities that quite remove him {{from the ranks of}} the conventional--if such ranks exist at all. The remark of the old Scotch divine to his good wife: [...] "Everybody's queer but thee and me, Nancy, and sometimes I think thee a little queer," [...] sums up human nature admirably. We seldom recognize our own queerness, but are prone to mark the erratic temperaments of others, and this is rather more comfortable than to be annoyed by a consciousness of our personal deficits.|$|E
60|$|I {{was made}} much more uneasy by {{the effect of}} our failure on Monkton than by the failure itself. His {{resolution}} appeared to break down altogether <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to retrace our steps.|$|R

6000|$|Thus as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> {{to speak}} of [...] "genius," [...] we are {{involved}} in speculations, psychological, psychical, physical, and metaphysical; in difficulties of all sorts not at present to be solved either by physiological science or experimental psychology, or by psychical research, or by the study of heredity. When I speak of [...] "the genius of Shakespeare," [...] of Jeanne d'Arc, of Bacon, even of Wellington, I possibly have a meaning which is not in all respects the meaning of Mr. Greenwood, when he uses the term [...] "genius"; so we are apt to misunderstand each other. Yet we all glibly use the term [...] "genius," [...] without definition and without discussion.|$|E
60|$|In my experience, persons, {{when they}} are made the subject of conversation, though with a Friend, are {{commonly}} the most prosaic and trivial of facts. The universe seems bankrupt as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to discuss the character of individuals. Our discourse all runs to slander, and our limits grow narrower as we advance. How {{is it that we}} are impelled to treat our old Friends so ill when we obtain new ones? The housekeeper says, I never had any new crockery in my life but I began to break the old. I say, let us speak of mushrooms and forest trees rather. Yet we can sometimes afford to remember them in private.|$|E
60|$|But if we stop there; if we only admire what is good, {{without trying}} to copy it, we shall lose that light. Our corrupt and diseased nature (and corrupt and diseased it is, as we shall surely find, as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> {{to try to do}} right) will quench that heavenly spark in us more and more, till it dies out--as God forbid that it should die out in any of us. For if it did die out, we should care no more for what is good. We should see nothing beautiful, and noble, and glorious, in being just, and loving, and merciful. And then, indeed, we should see nothing worth loving in God himself:- and it were better for us that we had never been born.|$|E
5000|$|According to Tristano, [...] "As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> playing, the {{engineer}} {{threw up his}} hands and left his machine. The A&R man and management thought I was such an idiot that they refused to pay me for the sides and to release them." ...|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - Twenty {{days out}} from Papeete. Yes, sir, all that, and only (for a guess) in 4 degrees north {{or at the}} best 4 degrees 30 minutes, though already the wind seems to smell {{a little of the}} North Pole.

6000|$|We {{have before}} had {{occasion}} to protest against Mr. Whittier's carelessness in accents and rhymes, as in pronouncing [...] "ly'ceum," [...] and joining in unhallowed matrimony such sounds as awn and orn, ents and ence. We {{would not have the}} Muse emulate the unidiomatic preciseness of a normal school-mistress, but we cannot help thinking that, if Mr. Whittier writes thus on principle, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to suspect, he errs in forgetting that thought so refined as his can be fitly matched only with an equal refinement of expression, and loses something of its charm when cheated of it. We hope he will, at least, never mount Pega'sus, or water him in Heli'con, and that he will leave Mu'seum to the more vulgar sphere and obtuser sensibilities of Barnum. Where Nature has sent genius, she has a right to expect that it shall be treated with a certain elegance of hospitality.|$|E

60|$|The only {{difficulty}} {{was that}} dinner time began to approach.

6000|$|... 'These {{questions}} are the next questions to which research {{will bring us}} answers,' said Karenin. 'While we sit here and talk idly and inexactly of what is needed and what may be, {{there are hundreds of}} keen-witted {{men and women who are}} working these things out, dispassionately and certainly, for the love of knowledge. The next sciences to yield great harvests now will be psychology and neural physiology. These perplexities of the situation between man and woman and the trouble with the obstinacy of egotism, these are temporary troubles, the issue of our own times. Suddenly all these differences that seem so fixed will dissolve, all these incompatibles will run together, and we shall go on to mould our bodies and our bodily feelings and personal reactions as boldly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> now to carve mountains and set the seas in their places and change the currents of the wind.' ...|$|E
60|$|You see how {{the game}} goes on. We land and alter things, and build and rearrange, and hoist paper flags on pins, and subjugate populations, and confer all the blessings of civilization upon these lands. We keep them going for days. And at last, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to tire of them, comes the {{scrubbing}} brush, and we must burn our trees and dismantle our islands, and put our soldiers in the little nests of drawers, and stand the island boards up against the wall, and put everything away. Then perhaps, after a few days, we begin upon some other such game, just as we feel disposed. But it is never quite the same game, never. Another time it may be wildernesses for example, and the boards are hills, and never {{a drop of water}} is to be found except for the lakes and rivers we may mark out in chalk. But after one example others are easy, and next I will tell you of our way of making towns.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course it}} is not by {{argument}} that we originally come by our belief in an independent external world. We find this belief ready in ourselves as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to reflect: it is what may be called an instinctive belief. We {{should never have been}} led to question this belief but for the fact that, at any rate in the case of sight, {{it seems as if the}} sense-datum itself were instinctively believed to be the independent object, whereas argument shows that the object cannot be identical with the sense-datum. This discovery, however--which is not at all paradoxical in the case of taste and smell and sound, and only slightly so in the case of touch--leaves undiminished our instinctive belief that there are objects corresponding to our sense-data. Since this belief does not lead to any difficulties, but on the contrary tends to simplify and systematize our account of our experiences, there seems no good reason for rejecting it. We may therefore admit--though with a slight doubt derived from dreams--that the external world does really exist, and is not wholly dependent for its existence upon our continuing to perceive it.|$|E
6000|$|We made an {{accurate}} {{examination of the}} place, the Professor saying <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>began,</b> [...] "The first thing is {{to see how many}} of the boxes are left, we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest." ...|$|R

'You don't deserve any mercy at our hands,' {{said his}} captor 'but {{as you are}} such a good shot you may be of great use to us, so we shall spare your life, if you will do us a service. Not far from here there stands a castle, in which the king's {{daughter}} lives; we are at war with the king, and want to get the upper hand of him by carrying off the princess, but the castle is so well guarded that there is no getting into it. By our skill in magic we have cast sleep on every living thing in the castle, except a little black dog, and, as long as he is awake, we are no better off than before; for, as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to climb over the wall, the little dog will hear us, and its barking will waken all the others again. Having got you, we can place you where {{you will be able to}} shoot the dog before it begins to bark, and then no one can hinder us from getting the princess into our hands. If you do that, we shall not only let you off, but reward you handsomely.' ...|$|E
60|$|There {{seems to}} be a period in the history of every one when the fair aspect of this world is darkened--when everything, whether past, present, or future, assumes a hue of the deepest gloom; a period when, for the first time, the sun, which has shone in the mental {{firmament}} with more or less brilliancy from childhood upwards, entirely disappears behind a cloud of thick darkness, and leaves the soul in a state of deep melancholy; a time when feelings somewhat akin to despair pervade us, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> gradually to look upon the past as a bright, happy vision, out of which we have at last awakened to view the sad realities of the present, and look forward with sinking hope to the future. Various are the causes which produce this, and diverse the effects of it on differently constituted minds; but there are few, we apprehend, who have not passed through the cloud in one or other of its phases, and who do not feel that this first period of prolonged sorrow is darker, and heavier, and worse to bear, than many of the more truly grievous afflictions that sooner or later fall to the lot of most men.|$|E
60|$|The {{value of}} {{philosophy}} is, in fact, to be sought largely {{in its very}} uncertainty. The man who has no tincture of philosophy goes through life imprisoned in the prejudices derived from common sense, from the habitual beliefs of his age or his nation, and from convictions which {{have grown up in}} his mind without the co-operation or consent of his deliberate reason. To such a man the world tends to become definite, finite, obvious; common objects rouse no questions, and unfamiliar possibilities are contemptuously rejected. As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to philosophize, on the contrary, we find, as we saw in our opening chapters, that even the most everyday things lead to problems to which only very incomplete answers can be given. Philosophy, though unable to tell us with certainty what is the true answer to the doubts which it raises, is able to suggest many possibilities which enlarge our thoughts and free them from the tyranny of custom. Thus, while diminishing our feeling of certainty as to what things are, it greatly increases our knowledge as to what they may be; it removes the somewhat arrogant dogmatism of those who have never travelled into the region of liberating doubt, and it keeps alive our sense of wonder by showing familiar things in an unfamiliar aspect.|$|E

60|$|With {{the same}} roar and crack and slide of rocks as had {{attended}} our descent, Jones {{bore down on}} us. For an old man it was a marvelous performance. He walked on the avalanches as though he wore seven-league boots, and presently, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>began</b> to dodge whizzing bowlders, he stepped down to us, whirling his coiled lasso. His jaw bulged out; a flash made fire in his cold eyes.|$|R
