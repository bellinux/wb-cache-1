5|$|Cloverleaf {{announced}} Rosecroft {{would close}} on July 1, 2010. Live racing ended in 2009, {{and the track}} only had simulcasts as revenue from off-track betting. After several of the surrounding states legalized casinos, Rosecroft was unable to continue as a successful business. Cloverleaf Enterprises filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June 2009. Mark Vogel loaned the track $350,000 and offered to buy the track, but a bankruptcy court judge refused to <b>approve</b> the plan. Rosecroft officials had hoped that the Maryland General Assembly would <b>approve</b> legislation allowing casino-style gambling at Rosecroft, {{but that did not}} occur. In early June 2010, Cloverleaf filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.|$|E
