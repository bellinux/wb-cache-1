This problem is also referred to as phoneme segmentation. An accurate and fast alignment procedure is a necessary tool for developing speech recognition and text-to-speech systems.

40|$|Motivation: The need {{to align}} spectra to correct for mass-to-charge {{experimental}} variation {{is a problem}} that arises in mass spectrometry (MS). Most MS-based proteomic data analysis methods involve a two-step approach, identify peaks first and then do the alignment and statistical inference on these identified peaks only. However, the peak identification step relies on prior information on the proteins of interest or a peak detection model, which are subject to error. Also numerous additional features such as peak shape and peak width are lost in simple peak detection, and these are informative for correcting mass variation in the alignment step. Results: Here we present a novel Bayesian approach to align the complete spectra. The approach is based on a parametric model which assumes the spectrum and <b>alignment</b> <b>function</b> are Gaussian processes, but the <b>alignment</b> <b>function</b> is monotone. We show how to use the expectation-maximization algorithm to find the posterior mode of the set of alignment functions and the mean spectrum for a patient population. After alignment, we conduct tests while controlling for error attributable to multiple comparisons on the level of the peaks identified from the absolute mean spectra difference of two patient populations.

40|$|We study optimal {{synchronization}} {{of networks}} of coupled phase oscillators. We extend previous theory for optimizing the synchronization properties of undirected networks to the important case of directed networks. We derive a generalized synchrony <b>alignment</b> <b>function</b> that encodes {{the interplay between}} network structure and the oscillators' natural frequencies and serves as an objective measure for the network's degree of synchronization. Using the generalized synchrony <b>alignment</b> <b>function,</b> we show that a network's synchronization properties can be systematically optimized. This framework also allows us to study the properties of synchrony-optimized networks, and in particular, investigate the role of directed network properties such as nodal in- and out-degrees. For instance, we find that in optimally rewired networks the heterogeneity of the in-degree distribution roughly matches the heterogeneity of the natural frequency distribution, but no such relationship emerges for out-degrees. We also observe that a network's synchronization properties are promoted by {{a strong correlation between}} the nodal in-degrees and the natural frequencies of oscillators, whereas the relationship between the nodal out-degrees and the natural frequencies has comparatively little effect. This result is supported by our theory, which indicates that synchronization is promoted by a strong alignment of the natural frequencies with the left singular vectors corresponding to the largest singular values of the Laplacian matrix...|$|E

40|$|FORTRAN 90 {{and other}} data-parallel {{languages}} express parallelism {{in the form}} of operations on data aggregates such as arrays. Misalignment of the operands of an array operation can reduce program performance on a distributed-memory parallel machine by requiring nonlocal data accesses. Determining array alignments that reduce communication is therefore a key issue in compiling such languages. We present a framework for the automatic determination of array alignments in array-based, data-parallel languages. Our language model handles array sectioning, reductions, spreads, transpositions, and masked operations. We decompose <b>alignment</b> <b>functions</b> into three constituents: axis, stride, and offset. For each of these subproblems, we show how to solve the alignment problem for a basic block of code, possibly containing common subexpressions. Alignments are generated for all array objects in the code, both named program variables and intermediate results. We assign computation to processors by virtue of explicit alignment of all temporaries; the resulting work assignment is in general better than that provided by the 'owner-computes' rule. Finally, we present some ideas for dealing with control flow, replication, and dynamic alignments that depend on loop induction variables...|$|R

40|$|Based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR 6 (SDSS) and Millennium Simulation (MS) we {{investigate}} the alignment between galaxies and large-scale structure. For this purpose we develop two new statistical tools, namely the <b>alignment</b> correlation <b>function</b> and the cos(2 theta) -statistic. The former is a two-dimensional {{extension of the}} traditional two-point correlation function and the latter {{is related to the}} ellipticity correlation function used for cosmic shear measurements. Both are based on the cross correlation between a sample of galaxies with orientations and a reference sample which represents the large-scale structure. Applied to the SDSS galaxy catalog the <b>alignment</b> correlation <b>function</b> reveals an overabundance of reference galaxies along the major axes of red, luminous (L > L*) galaxies out to projected separations of 60 Mpc/h. No alignment signal is detected for blue galaxies. The cos(2 θ) -statistic yields very similar results. Starting from a MS semi-analytic galaxy catalog we assign an orientation to each red, luminous and central galaxy, based on the central region of the host halo. Alternatively, we use the orientation of the host halo itself. We find a mean projected misalignment between a halo and its central region of 25 deg. Agreement with the SDSS results is good if the central orientations are used. Using the halo orientations overestimates the observed alignment by more than a factor of 2. The large volume of the MS allows to generate two-dimensional maps of the <b>alignment</b> correlation <b>function</b> which show the reference galaxy distribution to be flattened parallel to the orientations of red luminous galaxies with axis ratios of 0. 5 and 0. 75 for halo and central orientations,respectively.

40|$|Abstract For two {{strings of}} length m and n (m n), optimal {{sequence}} <b>alignment</b> (as a <b>function</b> of the <b>alignment</b> scoring <b>function)</b> {{takes time and}} space proportional to mn to compute. The time actually consists of two parts: computing the score of the best align-ment (calculating (m+ 1) (n+ 1) values), and then extracting the alignment (by reading the computed values). The space requirement is usually prohibitive. Hirschberg's algorithm reduces the space needs to roughly 2 m, but doubles the cost of computing and extract-ing the alignment. This paper introduces the FastLSA algorithm that is adaptive {{to the amount of}} space available. At one extreme, it uses linear space, while at the other it uses quadratic space. Based on the memory resources available, the algorithm saves the maximum amount of information to achieve the lowest extraction cost. The algorithm is shown to be analytically and experimentally superior to Hirschberg's algorithm...|$|R

We then investigate a tractable, restricted-focus version of graph matching, which is only concerned with adjacency involving vertices in a partial ob-servation of the latent alignment; we prove that a logarithmic number of vertices in the known partial latent alignment is sufficient for this restricted-focus version of graph matching to yield a strongly consistent estimate of the latent alignment of the remaining vertices. Lastly, we show how Frank-Wolfe methodology for approximate graph matching, when there is a known partial latent alignment, inherently incorporates this restricted-focus graph matching...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{postoperative}} <b>alignment</b> and sensory <b>functions</b> {{in patients with}} primary exotropia who had been operated {{at an early age}} ( 7 years). METHODS: In a consecutive retrospective cohort study, 112 patients who had had a surgical intervention for primary exotropia between 1997 and 2003 were evaluated for postoperative results. After applying criteria for eligibility, the group of patients was divided into two groups: those who had had surgery before the age of seven years (n = 24) and those who had had surgery after the age of seven years (n = 36). Age at surgery, preoperative <b>alignment</b> and sensory <b>functions</b> were correlated with the postoperative status. The follow-up was at least one year (1. 0 year to 7 years; median: 2. 3 and 3. 5 years, respectively). RESULTS: Patients who had had surgery before the age of seven had significantly better <b>alignment</b> and sensory <b>functions.</b> The univariate logistic regression model confirmed a statistically significant association between motor outcome (exodeviation less than 10 diopters) and age at the time of surgery (before or after the age of seven; p = 0. 002).
