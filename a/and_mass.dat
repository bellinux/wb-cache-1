This letter is showing possibility in explaining the decelerating expansion and accelerating expansion due to density difference of positive <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> negative <b>mass</b> because negative <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> positive <b>mass</b> conducts different forms of movement depending on the density difference of positive <b>mass</b> <b>and</b> negative <b>mass.</b> As change of total gravitational potential energy sign occurs from UT= 0 and total gravitational potential energy oscillates based on 0.
