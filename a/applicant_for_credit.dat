40|$|Nepalese {{banks have}} {{witnessed}} a considerable shift {{in recent years}} towards its loans and advances by focussing on consumer credit. The traditional method of evaluating applicants {{that is based on}} the judgmental system is increasingly becoming inappropriate for the large volume of applicants. As a result of the shift in the lending market and the increased emphasis placed by the regulator on risk management, Nepalese banks have to rethinking on the way they assess their <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>credit.</b> Traditionally, the credit decision whether to accept/reject an applicant has been based on the subjective evaluation of the credit application forms and supporting documents. The literature advocates an objective approach on the lines of credit scoring which is fast, reliable, consistent and risk-based. On the strengths of this argument, this thesis presents the qualitative and quantitative considerations including issues relating to data capture, model development and implementation of a formal credit scoring model within the Nepalese Banking sector. The questionnaire was administered with the non-managerial level staff, the respondents in the expert interviews were managerial level staff and the database for model development were taken from a home loans customer database of a typical Nepalese bank.

40|$|We {{consider}} a new variety of sequential information gathering {{problems that are}} applicable for Web-basedapplications in which data provided as input may be distorted by the system user, such as an <b>applicant</b> <b>for</b> a <b>credit</b> card. We propose two methods to compensate for input distortion. The first method, termed knowledge base modification, considers redesigning the knowledge base of an expert system to best account for distortion in the input provided by the user. The second method, termed input modification, modifies the input directly to account for distortion and uses the modified input in the existing (unmodified) knowledge base of the system. These methods are compared with an approach where input noise is ignored. Experimental results indicate that both types of modification substantially improve the accuracy of recommendations, with knowledge base modification outperforming input modification in most cases. Knowledge base modification is, however, more computationally intensive than input modification. Therefore, when computational resources are adequate, the knowledge base modification approach is preferred; when such resources are very limited, input modification {{may be the only}} viable alternative.

40|$|Mathematical {{programming}} (MP) can be {{used for}} developing classification models for the two–group classification problem. An MP model {{can be used}} to generate a discriminant function that separates the observations in a training sample of known group membership into the specified groups optimally in terms of a group separation criterion. The simplest models for MP discriminant analysis are linear programming models in which the group separation measure is generally based on the deviations of misclassified observations from the discriminant function. MP discriminant analysis models have been tested extensively over the last 30 years in developing classifiers for the two–group classification problem. However, in the comparative studies that have included MP models for classifier development, the MP discriminant analysis models either lack appropriate normalisation constraints or they do not use the proper data transformation. In addition, these studies have generally been based on relatively small datasets. This thesis investigates the development of MP discriminant analysis models that incorporate appropriate normalisation constraints and data transformations. These MP models are tested on binary classification problems, with an emphasis on credit scoring problems, particularly application scoring, i. e. a two–group classification problem concerned with distinguishing between good and bad <b>applicants</b> <b>for</b> <b>credit</b> based on information from application forms and other relevant data. The performance of these MP models is compared with the performance of statistical techniques and machine learning methods and it is shown that MP discriminant analysis models can be useful tools for developing classifiers. Another topic covered in this thesis is feature selection. In order to make classification models easier to understand, it is desirable to develop parsimonious classification models with a limited number of features. Features should ideally be selected based on their impact on classification accuracy. Although MP discriminant analysis models can be extended for feature selection based on classification accuracy, there are computational difficulties in applying these models to large datasets. A new MP heuristic for selecting features is suggested based on a feature selection MP discriminant analysis model in which maximisation of classification accuracy is the objective. The results of the heuristic are promising in comparison with other feature selection methods. Classifiers should ideally be developed from datasets with approximately the same number of observations in each class, but in practice classifiers must often be developed from imbalanced datasets. New MP formulations are proposed to overcome the difficulties associated with generating discriminant functions from imbalanced datasets. These formulations are tested using datasets from financial institutions and the performance of the MP-generated classifiers is compared with classifiers generated by other methods. Finally, the ordinal classification problem is considered. MP methods for the ordinal classification problem are outlined and a new MP formulation is tested on a small dataset...|$|R
