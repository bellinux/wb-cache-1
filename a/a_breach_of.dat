5|$|A {{photograph}} of Schlosshotel Kronberg (then called Schloss Friedrichshof after its owner Kaiserin Friedrich) became famous {{due to its}} accidental inclusion of the photographer's wing tips.

5|$|A {{series of}} legal {{disputes}} between Reynolds and General Motors (GM) began in 2007. Through a GM program called the Integrated Dealership Management System (GMIDMS), Reynolds provided software to GM dealerships through GM. When Reynolds {{would not make}} changes to its software requested by GM, GM alleged it was <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract. A settlement was reached in 2008, which ended Reynolds' participation in GM's program.|$|E
5|$|Foreign {{domestic}} workers' {{wages are}} subject to a statutory minimum, <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> which is sanctionable under the Employment Ordinance. An employer convicted of paying less than the minimum allowable wage (MAW) is subject to a maximum fine of HK$350,000 and three years' imprisonment.|$|E
50|$|Condition or Warranty. Conditions are terms {{which go}} to the very root <b>of</b> <b>a</b> contract. <b>Breach</b> <b>of</b> these terms {{repudiate}} the contract,allowing the other party to discharge the contract. A warranty is not so imperative so the contract will subsist after <b>a</b> <b>breach.</b> <b>Breach</b> <b>of</b> either will give rise to damages.|$|R
50|$|Conditions are {{terms that}} go to the very root <b>of</b> <b>a</b> contract. <b>Breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{condition}} will entitle the innocent party to terminate the contract. A warranty is less imperative than a condition, so the contract will survive <b>a</b> <b>breach.</b> <b>Breach</b> <b>of</b> either <b>a</b> condition or a warranty will give rise to damages.|$|R
50|$|If {{a former}} {{employee}} brings <b>a</b> claim for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract, then the defending employer has a limited right to bring <b>a</b> counter-claim for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract against <b>a</b> former employee. However, an employer may not bring <b>a</b> claim for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract if <b>an</b> employee is complaining simply of unfair dismissal (which is not <b>a</b> claim for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract but <b>a</b> statutory claim). In all cases, the employment tribunal may not award damages that exceed £25,000 for all claims for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of war, the King and Government began to disagree. While the Government argued that the German invasion had violated Belgian neutrality and made Belgium one of the Allies, Leopold argued that Belgium was still a neutral country and had no obligations beyond defending its borders. Leopold opposed allowing British and French forces into Belgian territory to fight alongside Belgian troops, as <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> its neutrality.|$|E
5|$|StarCrafts success also {{inspired}} {{third-party developer}} Microstar Software to release an unauthorized add-on, entitled Stellar Forces, in May 1998. Blizzard Entertainment consequently {{filed a lawsuit}} against Microstar for selling the add-on, arguing that as the product was unauthorized and created using StarCrafts level editing software, it was <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the end user license agreement.|$|E
5|$|The European Parliament can {{dissolve}} the Commission {{as a whole}} following a vote of no-confidence but only the President can request the resignation of an individual Commissioner. However, individual Commissioners, by request of the Council or Commission, can be compelled to retire on account of <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> obligation(s) and if so ruled by the European Court of Justice (Art. 245 and 247, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).|$|E

5000|$|The {{circumstances}} in which an employee is entitled are defined in common law. The notion of constructive dismissal most often arises from <b>a</b> fundamental <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the term of trust and confidence implied in all contracts of employment. In order to avoid such <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> [...] "an employer must not, without reasonable or proper cause, conduct himself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence between the employer and the employee." [...] Whilst <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> can be <b>of</b> the implied term of trust and confidence, <b>a</b> fundamental <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> any of the express or implied {{terms of a contract}} of employment is sufficient.|$|R

5|$|A {{crime is}} {{committed}} if any person posts or distributes a placard, circular or other document which contains an incitement to violence, counsels disobedience {{to the law}} or a lawful order, or is {{likely to lead to}} <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the peace. Spreading false reports or making false statements likely to cause public alarm orally, in writing, or in any newspaper, periodical, book, circular or other printed publication is also an offence.|$|E
5|$|After his death, MGM {{tried to}} {{continue}} with Romance of the Pink Panther and offered the role of Clouseau to Dudley Moore, who turned it down. The studio subsequently turned back to Blake Edwards, who was adamant not to recast the character, feeling certain {{that no one could}} adequately replace Sellers. In 1982 Edwards released Trail of the Pink Panther, which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three Panther films. Frederick sued, claiming the use of the clips was <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract; the court awarded her $1million ($ million today), plus 3.15 per cent of the film's profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E

5|$|Customers {{with their}} own {{installations}} include the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The station also reads and distributes data from the Japanese Hinode solar research satellite. The facility has seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces. There is a disagreement as to whether this constitutes <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the Svalbard Treaty.|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} its battle against censorship {{of art and}} literature. In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed results from the Supreme Court, winning the appeal of Carl Jacob Kunz, who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of Irving Feiner who was arrested to prevent <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion. The ACLU lost the case of Joseph Beahharnais, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.|$|E
5|$|First World {{commentators}} {{had already}} speculated that Brezhnev had {{died when he}} failed to sign a message of congratulations to José Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, for the Angolan Independence Day. This was <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature was seen as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen by some First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the Soviet leadership over who would succeed him. Konstantin Chernenko {{was seen as the}} most likely candidate to succeed Brezhnev.|$|E

5|$|Fleming's second novel, Live and Let Die {{shows that}} in his early twenties, Leiter wrote a few pieces on Dixieland jazz for the New York Amsterdam News. Bond scholar John Griswold notes that in the {{original}} draft of the story, Fleming killed Leiter off in the shark attack; when Naomi Burton, Fleming's US agent with Curtis Brown, protested {{about the death of}} the character, Fleming relented and Leiter lived, albeit missing an arm and half a leg. Espionage scholar Rupert Allason, writing as Nigel West, noted that Leiter's involvement in a domestic US matter was <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the CIA's charter, as laid out in the National Security Act of 1947.|$|E
5|$|October 4 also {{provided}} another worrying incident to Egyptian commanders, who {{became aware that}} evening that EgyptAir, the country's national airline, had canceled all its flights and was arranging the protection of its civil air fleet by dispersing its aircraft to refuges outside Egypt. The orders came from the Minister of Aviation, Ahmed Nuh. General Headquarters quickly intervened to reverse the dispersal orders, and by October 5 flights were back to their normal schedule. It was believed the incident was <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> security and a leak on Egyptian plans for war. It was not clear to Egyptian commanders however, whether the Israelis {{were aware of the}} incident.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 2006, a {{judge in}} Cook County, Illinois, {{determined}} that Jordan did not owe his alleged former lover Karla Knafel $5million in <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> contract claim. Jordan had allegedly paid Knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret. Knafel claimed Jordan promised her $5million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991. A DNA test showed Jordan was not {{the father of the}} child.|$|E

5|$|The British {{authorities}} in the area refused to support the raid, which they considered <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> Spanish neutrality. Permission for the operation to go ahead eventually came from the Foreign Office in London. On 14 January 1942, while the ships' officers were attending a party arranged by an SOE agent, the commandos entered the port aboard two tugs, overpowered the ships' crews and sailed off with the ships, including the Italian merchant vessel Duchessa d'Aosta. The raid boosted SOE's reputation at a critical time and demonstrated its ability to plan and conduct secret operations no matter the political consequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{eruption}} of Thera and volcanic fallout may have inspired the myths of the Titanomachy in Hesiod's Theogony. The Titanomachy could {{have picked up}} elements of western Anatolian folk memory, as the tale spread westward. Hesiod's lines have been compared with volcanic activity, citing Zeus's thunderbolts as volcanic lightning, the boiling earth and sea as <b>a</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the magma chamber, immense flame and heat as evidence of phreatic explosions, among many other descriptions.|$|E
