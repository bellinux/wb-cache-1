However, Ahidjo remained {{in control of}} the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>democratic</b> government, but a failed coup d'état nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|At first, the revolutionaries {{used the}} {{constitutional}} machinery {{of the old}} confederal republic. They resumed where they had left off after the purge in 1787 of Patriot regents, taking over {{the offices of the}} Orangist regents that were now purged in their turn. Though the political make-up of the States-General changed appreciably because of this change in personnel, it retained a number of defenders of the old particularist interests. The first order of business of the revolutionaries therefore was to strive for the reform of the confederal state, with its discrimination of the Generality Lands, and of particular minorities (Catholics, Jews), {{in the direction of a}} unitary state, in which the minorities would be emancipated, and the old entrenched interests superseded by <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>democratic</b> political order. As a first step the representatives of Brabant were admitted to the States-General.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, {{there was a}} growing number of intellectuals (Samir Kassir, Ziad Majed, Elias Khoury) and a network of {{independent}} student groups ("Independent Leftist Groups") who advocated democracy, individual liberties, secularism and center-left economic policies in Lebanon. On the other hand, a growing number Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) members were dissatisfied with the status of their party: the rise of Islamic Fundamentalism, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the failure of the LCP to assume <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>democratic</b> socialist platform ushered in an era of political decline for the party. This, coupled with perceived Syrian domination of its leadership, led to increasing frustration among rank-and-file communists against the upper echelons of the party.|$|E

5|$|The King and his {{advisers}} {{were concerned about the}} rise of socialism and the growing labour movement, which they mistakenly associated with republicanism. The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready {{to come to terms with}} the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>democratic,</b> inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class—a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour party politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} {{sought to}} supplant the prevailing anarchy fostered {{by some of}} the country's magnates with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>democratic</b> constitutional monarchy. It introduced elements of political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. It banned parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who could revoke all the legislation that had been passed by that Sejm. The Commonwealth's neighbours reacted with hostility to the adoption of the constitution. Frederick William II's Kingdom of Prussia broke its alliance with the Commonwealth, which was attacked and then defeated in the War in Defence of the Constitution by an alliance between Catherine the Great's Imperial Russia and the Targowica Confederation of anti-reform Polish magnates and landless nobility. The King, a principal co-author, eventually capitulated to the Confederates.|$|E
5|$|The political, {{economic}} and social reforms that were brought about during the relatively short duration of the Batavian Republic have had a lasting impact. The confederal structure of the old Dutch Republic was permanently replaced by a unitary state. For {{the first time in}} Dutch history, the constitution that was adopted in 1798 had a genuinely democratic character. For a while the Republic was governed democratically, although the coup d'état of 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power, after another change in constitution. Nevertheless, the memory of this brief experiment with democracy helped smooth the transition to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>democratic</b> government in 1848 (the constitutional revision by Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, limiting the power of the king). A type of ministerial government was introduced {{for the first time in}} Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period.|$|E

5|$|Dolan was {{dismissed}} in May 2003, the new board citing financial {{reasons for his}} departure. At 27 years, York player Chris Brass was appointed player-manager in June 2003, which made him the youngest Football League managerial appointment since 1946. The club's lease of Bootham Crescent was extended to May 2004, and plans proceeded to develop Huntington Stadium ahead of a possible move, but problems bringing the ground to Football League standards were encountered. The board preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent, and they bought the site in February 2004 {{after six months of}} negotiations. The deal came after York were lent £2million by The Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF), with which they bought 75.89% of BCH shares and all of the 20,000 shares owned by Persimmon. Once plans for a new stadium were settled, the loan would be converted a grant to help fund the move. York equalled a club record by winning the first four matches of 2003–04, and by mid January 2004 were 10th in the table. They won none of their final 20 fixtures, garnering only five more points as they finished bottom of the Third Division. York were relegated to the Conference National after 75 years of Football League membership. Beck renounced his title of chairman in September 2004 because he favoured <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>democratic</b> approach for a fan-owned club.
