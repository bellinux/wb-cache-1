500|$|The {{shale oil}} derived from oil shale does not {{directly}} substitute for crude oil in all applications. It may contain higher concentrations of olefins, oxygen, and nitrogen than conventional crude oil. [...] Some shale oils may have higher sulfur or arsenic content. By comparison with West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark standard for crude oil in the futures-contract market, the Green River shale oil sulfur content ranges from near 0% to 4.9% (in average 0.76%), where West Texas Intermediate's sulfur content has a maximum of 0.42%. The sulfur content in shale oil from Jordan's oil shales may rise even up to 9.5%. [...] The arsenic content, for example, becomes an issue for Green River formation oil shale. The higher concentrations of these materials means that the oil must undergo considerable upgrading (hydrotreating) before serving as oil-refinery feedstock. [...] Above-ground retorting processes tended to yield a lower <b>API</b> <b>gravity</b> shale oil than the in situ processes. Shale oil serves best for producing middle-distillates such as kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel fuel. Worldwide demand for these middle distillates, particularly for diesel fuels, increased rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s. [...] However, appropriate refining processes equivalent to hydrocracking can transform shale oil into a lighter-range hydrocarbon (gasoline).|$|E

40|$|Unambiguous {{detection}} of oil slicks by remote sensing techniques has proven an elusive goal. This article presents new thermal infrared spectra of oil slicks made from five different crude oil samples {{with a wide}} range of <b>API</b> <b>gravities</b> and compositions. After a brief outgassing phase, all oil slick spectra are quite similar and little affected by thickness, extended exposure to air or sunlight, and even by emulsification with seawater (mousse formation). Thus, oil slicks provide a remarkably unvarying spectral signature as remote sensing targets in the thermal infrared compared to other regions of the spectrum. This spectral signature in the 8 - 14 micron atmospheric window is flat, with an average reflectance of 4 percent. Seawater, on the other hand, has a spectrum that varies in reflectance with wavelength in the 8 - 14 micron window from 0. 90 to 3. 65 percent. In addition, we show that sea foam displays a reflectance spectrum quite similar to that of seawater in the 8 - 14 micron region. This results in a relatively uniform spectral background, against which oil slicks can be detected, based on their different spectral signature...|$|R
30|$|<b>API</b> <b>gravities</b> of {{original}} {{heavy crude oil}} and oil samples catalyzed by oil-soluble catalysts Mn(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 and Cu(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2, were 19.2, 23.3, and 24.7, respectively. Because even {{a small fraction of}} bond splitting can lead to a significant improvement of the flow properties of heavy oil, the cleavage of some C–R (R=S, N, and O) bonds favors reducing crude oil viscosity eventually with the quality slightly upgraded after oxidation. In addition, when many heavy oil molecules split into fragments, the total number of rings is reduced and some of saturated fragments will release light components, leading to an increase in the content of saturates and aromatics. In general, the changes of heavy oil compositions and molecular structures are responsible for viscosity reduction and quality improvement. The changes of elemental contents after catalytic oxidation over the catalyst Cu(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 are more obvious than that over the catalyst Mn(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2, which means that the catalyst Cu(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 is superior to the catalyst Mn(C 11 H 7 O 2) 2 for splitting heavy oil molecules.|$|R
2500|$|Overall, {{long-term}} {{environmental effects}} of the spill seemed to be minimal. [...] In a [...] "no strings attached" [...] study funded by the Western Oil and Gas Association, through the Allan Hancock Foundation at the University of Southern California, the authors suggested several hypotheses {{for the lack of}} environmental damage to biologic resources in the Channel aside from pelagic birds and intertidal organisms. [...] First, creatures there may have evolved a tolerance to oil in the water due to the presence of natural seeps in the vicinity for at least tens of thousands of years; the area around Coal Oil Point {{has one of the most}} active natural underwater oil seeps in the world. [...] Second, the abundance of oil-eating bacteria in the water may be greater because of that routine presence of oil in the water. [...] Third, the spill happened between two large Pacific storms; the storms broke up the oil, scattering it more quickly than happens in many other oil spills, and additionally the sediment load in the seawater from freshwater runoff would have been greater, and this assisted the oil in quickly sinking. [...] Fourth, Santa Barbara Channel crude oil is heavy, having <b>API</b> <b>gravity</b> between 10 and 13, and is both minimally soluble in water, and sinks relatively easily. [...] Therefore, fish and other organisms were exposed to the oil for a shorter time than was the case with other oil spills, such as the 1967 Torrey Canyon spill in which the crude was lighter, and emulsified during treatment with massive quantities of toxic dispersants and detergents, causing it to remain in place longer.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is to provide improved strategies for enhanced oil recovery from the Tensleep Sandstone oil reservoirs in the Bighorn and Wind River basins, Wyoming. Because of the great range of <b>API</b> <b>gravities</b> of the oils produced from these reservoirs, the proposed study concentrates on understanding the spatial variation and anisotropy of relative permeability within the Tensleep Sandstone. This research will associate those spatial distributions and anisotropies with the depositional subfacies and zones of diagenetic alteration found within the sandstone. The associations of the above with pore geometry will link relative permeability with the dimensions of lithofacies and authigenic mineral facies. Hence, the study is to provide criteria for scaling this parameter {{on a range of}} scales, from the laboratory to the basin-wide scale of subfacies distribution. Effects of depositional processes and burial diagenesis will be investigated. Image analysis of pore systems will be done to produce algorithms for estimating relative permeability from petrographic analyses of core and well cuttings. In addition, these studies are being coupled with geochemical modeling and coreflood experiments to investigate the potential for wellbore scaling and formation damage anticipated during EOR, eg., CO{sub 2 } flooding. This will provide a regional basis for EOR strategies for the largest potential target reservoir in Wyoming; results will have application to all eolian reservoirs through correlations of relative permeability variation and anisotropy with eolian depositional lithofacies...|$|R

The principal objective {{of this paper is}} to obtain exact models that can successfully predict these two important fluid properties covering a wide range of temperatures. In this study, heavy oil density was predicted from API and temperature, and then the predicted values of the densities were used in the second step to develop the viscosity correlation. A total of 30 heavy oil samples of different <b>API</b> <b>gravities</b> ranging from 11.7 to 18.8 were tested. Viscosity and density were measured in the temperature range from 20 to 160  °C. The accuracy of the experimental density data was determined using Standing and Katz method. Published correlations were also used to evaluate the experimental viscosity data. The comparison between the experimental data and the predicted values indicated that the proposed model successfully predicted the experimental data with an average absolute relative error of less than 8  % and correlation coefficients (R 2) of 0.97 and 0.92 at normal and high temperatures, respectively. The proposed model and the literature models were tested on heavy oil samples. It was found that it is not possible to generalize a correlation for the heavy oil viscosity using only API and temperature. However, the proposed model significantly minimizes the relative error and increases the correlation between the predicted and experimental data compared with other published methods.|$|R
40|$|The Miocene Monterey Formation {{constitutes}} a fracture-controlled petroleum reservoir, with interca-lated calcareous and fine-grained siliceous rocks serving {{as both the}} source and reservoir for oil accumulations. Petroleum is produced from macroscopic fractures, and numerous tar and asphalt seeps at the surface attest to the present-day movement of hydrocarbons through fractures in the Monterey Formation. Many fractures are filled with carbonate (mostly calcite and dolomite), quartz, baryte and anhydrite. These same fractures often contain tar or oil filling openings, and occasionally {{a thin layer of}} oil can be seen coating rowth surfaces between two generations ofvein-filling minerals. Evidence for migration of fluids through these fractures in the geological past is provided by aqueous and petroleum fluid inclusions contained within vein-filling minerals. Vein-filling dolomite from Jalama Beach contains three different ypes of primary petroleum inclusions (based on fluorescence charac-teristics) [...] indicating that oils with significantly different <b>API</b> <b>gravities</b> flowed through the fractures. Petrographic and microthermometric analyses of oil and coexisting aqueous inclusions indicate that the fracture-filling minerals precipitated from aqueous olutions of seawater salinity at- 75 - 100 ~ and that oil was introduced into the fracture system episodically during mineral growth. A sample from the Lion's Head area consists of early calcite and late quartz, both of which contain aqueous inclusions with seawater salinity. Inclusions in quartz homogenize at slightly higher temperatures than those in calcite. These data are consistent with calcite deposition during an early heating event, followed by quartz deposition during cooling. No petroleum inclusions were observed in the Lion's Head sample...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated approach for scheduling and forecasting {{oil and gas}} production by integrating models of the entire value chain, from the reservoirs to the sales points. The methodology ensures maximum oil production at each time step of the reservoir simulator while honoring all operational constraints of the system. The proposed method is applied to a small North Sea offshore field consisting of two oil reservoirs with <b>API</b> <b>gravities</b> of 37 and 39. 3 gas-lifted wells are producing in each reservoir. They are arranged in a production network connected to a surface process. Control variables include individual well choke opening (early stage) and gas lift injection rate (later stage). The system is subject to numerous operational constraints (e.g., maximum field liquid production, maximum gas lift injection rate). The proposed solution is built in a commercial IAM platform that connects the models and orchestrates the software execution and optimization. The optimization problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Program. The well and flowline performance curves are approximated with piecewise linear functions. Results show that such an integrated approach can significantly affect the production profile (up to 15 % difference against traditional “silo” approach). The proposed integrated solution is two-to-three times faster than traditional non-linear optimization methods, guarantees convergence towards the global maximum and it represents with an appropriate level of accuracy the original black-box model. This allows to run a lot of different scenarios making it a suitable tool for field development and planning optimization. The proposed method is used to optimize the field design and schedule. Optimal surface capacities are determined by brute force exploration of net present value function.|$|R

Their remarkably uniform composition suggests a common source: marine shale containing sulphur-rich Type II kerogen, probably deposited during an Early Cretaceous oceanic anoxic event (OAE). Suitable hydrocarbon kitchens may exist in the offshore Bight and Otway basins. The physical character of the asphaltites, including laminations and flow structures, and their degree of alteration, {{which is not the}} result of biodegradation or extensive water washing, suggest an origin from subsurface tar mats subsequently exposed by the incision of submarine canyons, with the possible formation of asphaltic volcanoes. <b>API</b> <b>gravities</b> of 4 – 18 ° impart quasi-neutral buoyancy, implying many asphaltites were submerged drifters prior to stranding, their degree of weathering reflecting, at least in part, the residence time in the marine environment.

The techniques measure emission of trace fluorescence from reservoir grains and their solvent extracts using a spectrophotometer. The first one, called Quantitative Grain Fluorescence plus (QGF+), directly measures dry, disaggregated reservoir grains after a robust cleaning procedure involving solvent, hydrogen peroxide and aqua regia or dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl). The second technique measures crushed Inclusion solvent extracts from the grains cleaned for QGF+ using the Total Scanning Fluorescence method (iTSF). Fluorescence spectra of 43 oil inclusion-bearing samples from seven basins in Australia, Papua New Guinea, SE Asia and China were obtained using QGF+ and iTSF. The fluorescence intensities (QGF+ Index and iTSF Intensity) correlate moderately {{well to the}} yields of the total n-alkanes obtained by the molecular compositions of oil inclusions (MCI) method, with linear correlation coefficients (R²) of > 0. 6. The QGF+ spectral peaks (λmax) and the iTSF spectral ratio R 1 broadly reflect the thermal maturity or <b>API</b> <b>gravities</b> of the inclusion oils. The fluorescence spectra of the samples display a variety of signatures that can be generally correlated with the n-alkane profiles of the inclusions.

The Pineville Tripolite is the primary producing formation of this field having major isopach variations, possibly influencing production. The hypothesis that the field is highly compartmentalized is from the varied production, isopach {{and structure of the}} field. This study investigated the Pineville Tripolite facies in the Spivey-Grabs-Basil Oil Field, with the Basil area the predominant focus, and its possible compartmentalization by looking at the gas chromatograms and their biomarker signatures. This field has had several studies investigating the geophysical attributes, depositional setting and large-scale compartmentalization. Post depositional sea-level changes and possibly syntectonics exposed the Reeds Spring to a sub-aerial environment where meteoric alteration created immense porosity and the Pineville Tripolite facies. Geochemical data shows evidence that this section of the field is sourced from both a marine shale and carbonate source at peak oil maturity, deposited in an anoxic environment. Biodegradation appears very slight, with most alterations transpiring in the alkane ranges only, leaving all other susceptible hydrocarbons unaltered. Compartments within the field are harder to identify when comparing geological data to oil data. Isopach data shows altered thickness of the Pineville Tripolite from well to well, as do Pineville structure values. The isopach and structural data point to possible areas for compartments, but it is from oil geochemical data that compartments become more visible. <b>API</b> <b>gravities</b> and GOR show motley values, but do indicate two significant areas of segregation. The deepest, most southern end of the study showed lighter gravity oils than the middle, suggesting possible fill and spill between the two. However, biomarker abundance indicates three possible compartments. The southern compartment has many more biomarker volumes than do the middle compartment, both divided by a reservoir pinch-out. The third most northeastern well has high biomarker abundance, but shows no geological separators from the other wells. Production from this field may be improved by investigating the biomarkers to allocate these compartments and possible barriers close to wells...|$|R
