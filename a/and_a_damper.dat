5000|$|In a {{hydropneumatic}} suspension system, each wheel is connected, {{not to a}} spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a hydraulic accumulator sphere of about 12 cm in diameter containing pressurised nitrogen, a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> valve between the piston and the sphere. A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a height corrector, a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five heights: normal riding height, two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, oleopneumatic (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. Hydropneumatic (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The shock {{absorber}} usually {{consists of two}} parts: a spring <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>damper</b> or dashpot. The spring may be implemented with a steel or titanium coil, an elastomer, or even compressed air. The choice of spring material has a fundamental effect {{on the characteristics of}} the fork as a whole. Coil spring forks are often heavier than designs which use compressed air springs, but they are more easily designed to exhibit a linear, Hookean response throughout their travel. Replacing steel coils with titanium coils in a design can decrease the weight of the design but leads to an increase in expense. Air springs utilize the thermodynamic property of gases that their pressures increase as they are compressed adiabatically. As the [...] "spring" [...] is provided by air rather than a coil of metal, forks with air springs are often lighter. This makes their use more common in XC designs. Another advantage of this type of fork design is that the spring constant can be adjusted by adjusting the air pressure. This allows a fork to be tuned to a rider's weight. One disadvantage of this design is the difficulty in achieving a linear response, as pressure varies approximately inversely (not linearly) with volume in a gas. As the fork compresses, the effective spring constant of the fork increases. Increasing the volume of the air inside the spring can reduce this effect, but the volume of the spring is ultimately limited, as it needs to be contained within the dimension of the fork blade.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is performed to investigate free and forced oscillation of <b>a</b> gas bubble <b>and</b> cavitation in viscoelastic liquids of a three‐parameter Oldroyd model. The first‐order perturbation method for small amplitudes has been employed to obtain periodic {{solutions to the}} bubble dynamics equation. Consideration {{is given to the}} influence of surface tension, vapor pressure, and thermodynamic behavior of the gas inside the bubble. It is disclosed that transient behavior of the bubble in viscoelastic liquids is governed by five dimensionless parameters. Conditions for stable bubbles are obtained. Free oscillation consists of a decaying exponential component <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>damped</b> sinusoidal oscillation associated with the natural frequency of the bubble‐liquid system. The effects of the five governing parameters on the natural frequency are determined. The radial motion of the bubble in an oscillating pressure field includes a sinusoidal oscillation associated with the forcing frequency, a decaying exponential component, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>damped</b> sinusoidal oscillation associated with the natural frequency.
