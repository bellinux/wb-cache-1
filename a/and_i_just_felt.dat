500|$|I've {{been in a}} {{reflective}} state of mind. I've done lot of soul searching <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> in a romantic mood when I was writing for [...] so that's what I wrote about... I decided that I {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E
500|$|The {{reunion of}} the band has been {{characterized}} as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge. Hoppus commented on this era {{of the band}} in a later interview: [...] "Everything was always very contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] I {{knew there was something}} wrong." [...] In his memoir, Can I Say, Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was [...] "introverted" [...] until [...] "money started coming in," [...] after which [...] "he'd get excited about Blink." [...] He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day. The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015, which had continually seen delays. [...] "I'd do interviews <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it," [...] Barker later said. A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended to spend more time on [...] "non-musical activities" [...] and indefinitely depart the group. In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he [...] "Never planned on quitting, just find it hard as hell to commit." [...] After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: [...] "Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable." ...|$|E
2500|$|And then Bernie [...] who {{is totally}} non-technical and had always left that side {{completely}} to me, {{started to get}} involved on the technical side.

5000|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Public Radio International's The Sound of Young America, Hodgson {{said of his}} departure from MST3K, [...] "I was, like, totally happy at Mystery Science Theater. I loved it. I wanted to stay, but I was basically having a fight with my partner, Jim Mallon. So we weren't getting along <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like -- <b>I</b> thought it really could possibly jeopardize the show. It {{would have been easy}} to create factions out of the group. And by that time {{it would not have been}} a fun show to work on. <b>And</b> so, <b>I</b> felt like I saw it coming <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> thought leaving was the best thing at the time." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Start All Over", a song co-written by Dobson and {{featuring}} her on background vocals, {{was recorded}} by Miley Cyrus for her album [...] (2007) {{and was released}} as a single, reaching number 57 on the Billboard Pop 100. During a 2009 interview Dobson said, [...] "I wrote a song, she dug it, and she sang it. But I didn't want it for my record. It just wasn't right for me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like it was better for someone else, and she {{does a great job}} on it. I was really impressed. She sounded great. I'm actually happier she did it than I did it." ...|$|E
2500|$|I went to {{the front}} office all the time, and I would say, [...] "John is kicking the dogs and putting them into freezers." [...] Or I would say, [...] "They are {{stepping}} on the animals, crushing them like grapes, and they don't care." [...] In the end, I would go to work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals myself. Because I couldn't stand to let them go through that. I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day. Some of those people would take pleasure in making them suffer. Driving home every night, I would cry just thinking about it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt,</b> to my bones, this cannot be right.|$|E
2500|$|Pierre {{has since}} looked back on Go with mixed emotions; he later cited {{it as his}} {{personal}} least favorite album by the band. He remembered the band were [...] "burnt out and miserable" [...] while recording, noting that drummer Thaxton left the band a year later due to depression. He personally was struggling with dark thoughts as well: [...] " [...] I was thinking about death a lot and {{had a lot of}} back pain and was grumpy and it was winter. [...] A {{lot of people who were}} close to me died around that time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> this strange floating sensation like I was sleepwalking through life. It wasn't bad or good, it was just weird and I feel like that somehow translated to that record." ...|$|E
5000|$|Henderson {{announced}} the single's release by uploading an audio teaser video to his Vevo account on 11 June 2014. [...] "Already Gone" [...] was then {{made available for}} digital download on 20 June 2014. Speaking of his decision to release [...] "Already Gone" [...] as the next single from Burnt Letters, Henderson said: [...] "The thing is that if I brought out another love song, I'd be shot. I'm constantly singing about love, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> wanted to change it up a bit lyrically with the new single, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> also wanted {{to pick up the}} tempo to show off the diversity on the album." [...] An acoustic version of the song is included on Henderson's extended play, The Acoustic Sessions.|$|R
5000|$|While {{collecting}} {{articles about}} {{things he was}} interested in, Fountain was riveted by Haiti, regarding it [...] "like a laboratory, almost ... Everything that’s gone on {{in the last five}} hundred years—colonialism, race, power, politics, ecological disasters—it’s all there in very concentrated form. <b>And</b> also <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt,</b> viscerally, pretty comfortable there." [...] Speaking little French, let alone Haitian Creole, he went for his first trip abroad there in 1991 and at least thirty more times. From this came four of the best regarded stories in his 2006 breakthrough collection of short stories: Brief Encounters With Che Guevara; a late bloomer, he was forty-eight. He was interviewed following the publication of this book by Rain Taxi in the winter of 2006. He has won numerous awards and inclusion of his work in New Stories from the South: The Year's Best (2006).|$|R
5000|$|I {{was over}} it laughs. I feel like I {{grew out of}} it and the team changed so much over the years that <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> like, [...] "this shit ain’t for me anymore," [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> needed to feel more stoked on the company I ride for, so I had to change it up ... Yeah it was hard to leave, but it’s a {{business}} move. Ya know? If someone’s gonna be your friend, it shouldn’t depend on what company you ride for. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> had to make a power move to benefit myself. I’m really stoked on the choice I made. It was difficult but {{it had to be done}} ... I mean, I had a lot of options <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> figured that Element best suits my vibe.

2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt,</b> I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E
2500|$|Duff herself co-wrote three {{tracks on}} the album: [...] "Mr. James Dean", [...] "Haters" [...] and [...] "Rock This World", {{the first two}} of which, along with [...] "The Last Song", Haylie co-wrote. Hilary said she refrained from co-writing the entire album because [...] "I don't know if I'm secure enough with myself to do that". She has characterised [...] "Haters" [...] as [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] and said people would {{know what it is}} about when they heard it, and it {{attracted}} substantial publicity when rumors circulated that it was about actress Lindsay Lohan, with whom Duff was alleged to have been feuding. The Scoop, a gossip section of the website MSNBC, quoted an insider who had said, [...] "Hilary thinks that Lindsay has been directing negativity at her for too long." [...] Duff denied that the rumors were true, saying she did not know Lohan and would not write a song about her. She said that at the time she wrote it she was feeling she had to openly discuss her personal life because [...] "people make accusations and there are lies and rumors constantly ... people are so negative. They love to read what's coming out next on Page Six [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like it was appropriate."

5000|$|Ciara {{spoke on}} the concept of the video saying the {{following}} [...] "It’s so exciting! It was so much energy. We actually rocked in the desert and it was like 108 degrees. It was so hot, but I feel like the energy of dance and working with 8 Flavahz and my dancers just kinda kept me really upbeat. I didn’t even recognize how hot it was <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thank God for the umbrella man because he also saved me. It’s non-stop dancing. The peek that I gave was the only snippet that I could find where there wasn’t dancing ’cause I didn’t want to give it away. We are literally moving from top to bottom <b>and</b> having fun. <b>I</b> feel like that’s very important. The record’s a very fun song and it’s also with a love energy, but fun <b>and</b> light. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> it was kinda cool to bring that energy through the dance." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Kim Newman in his book, Nightmare Movies, when Reeves made a {{suggestion}} on the set, Price objected {{and told the}} director: [...] "I've made 87 [...] films. What have you done?" [...] And Reeves responded: [...] "I've made three good ones." [...] "Reeves hated me," [...] Price later recalled. [...] "He didn't want me at all for the part. I didn't like him, either. It {{was one of the}} first times in my life that I've been in a picture where the director <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> clashed."Price <b>felt</b> that all the actors on the set had a difficult time with the director, explaining: [...] "Michael Reeves could not communicate with actors. He would stop me and say, 'Don't move your head like that.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> would say, 'Like what? What do you mean?' He'd say, 'There — you're doing it again. Don't do that'." [...] Price reportedly became so upset with Reeves that he refused to watch the film's dailies.|$|R
5000|$|In Sept 2015, Joe Satriani {{confirmed}} that the band {{was working on a}} new song with possibly more to come - [...] "I think all my complaining and foot stomping really had an effect, because it was really bothering me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> still, philosophically, <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like there was a really big disconnect there between me {{and some of the other}} members of Chickenfoot". He went on to add [...] "and I can happily tell you now that there is a track that is circulating through the band".

5000|$|The slipmat {{was invented}} by hip-hop pioneer Grandmaster Flash to improve its sound and move the vinyl {{counterclockwise}} without causing too much drag and too much friction. In a Washington Post interview, he recalls “My mother was a seamstress so I knew different types of materials,” he continues. Having settled on felt, Flash encountered another issue. “The problem with felt is that it draped, it was limp,” he recalls. “So <b>I</b> ran home <b>and</b> got a copy of my album <b>and</b> <b>I</b> bought <b>just</b> enough <b>felt</b> to cut out two round circles {{the same size as}} a 33’ LP and — when my mother wasn’t looking — I turned the iron all the way up high <b>and</b> <b>I</b> used my mother’s spray starch.

However she admitted: [...] "I think that my relationships with women were always much more emotionally satisfying and comfortable with men.

[...] Joni Mitchell also commented [...] "From the time music video began well into the late eighties there was a monstrous image of females being perpetrated without much exception.

While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, [...] "We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today.
