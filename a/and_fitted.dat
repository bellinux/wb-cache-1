He and Beryl also set up their own charities, such as the OK Club for Kids, whose aim was to provide cigarettes for Yorkshire soldiers, and the Jump Fund, to provide home-knitted balaclavas, scarves and socks to servicemen. Formby also joined the Home Guard as a dispatch rider, where he took his duties seriously, <b>and</b> <b>fitted</b> them around his other work whenever he could.|$|E

While there is still discussion as to the method of evolution, none the less, as a process sufficient to explain all biological phenomena, all differentiations of life into widely diverse species, families, and even kingdoms, evolution is flatly accepted. Likewise has been accepted its law of development: That, in the struggle for existence, the strong <b>and</b> <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> the progeny of the strong <b>and</b> <b>fit</b> have a better opportunity for survival than the weak <b>and</b> less <b>fit</b> <b>and</b> the progeny of the weak <b>and</b> less <b>fit.</b>|$|R

It first flew on 23 November 1943 but the manufacturer's flight tests were not completed until June 1944. Since several other aircraft with about {{the same level of}} performance were already available, it was not placed into production.|$|E
5|$|The team {{received}} {{a number of}} Western Electric Type 316A large acorn vacuum tubes in early 1937. These were suitable for building transmitter units of about 20W continual power for wavelengths of 1 to 10m (300 to 30MHz). Percy Hibberd built a prototype transmitter with pulses {{of a few hundred}} watts <b>and</b> <b>fitted</b> it to the Heyford in March 1937.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade with}} the North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union, when high salt duties {{prevented}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an economic depression, as the local traders were not as skilled in trading salted fish.

He also added a spinner from a captured enemy aircraft which he believed added an extra 3mph to his speed while also reducing the wing dihedral to increase agility.|$|E

5|$|Building {{began in}} 1909, using oak from the estate, {{metalwork}} from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, {{brought to the}} site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, so instead of using a saw powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in a saw pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved into them, with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite {{the grandeur of the}} building, the Biddulph's lived in some small rooms <b>and</b> <b>fitted</b> the large reception rooms for community use.

5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} began between late 1863 and early 1864 and they were still being built {{when the war ended}} in early 1865. Construction was {{suspended}} on all four on 17 November 1865; they remained on the stocks. The ships were renamed, usually twice, in 1869 to conform to several new ship naming conventions. Vice Admiral David D. Porter ordered that Colossus be rebuilt to carry 10 large broadside guns <b>and</b> <b>fitted</b> with iron masts in a ship rig, but this never happened. The unseasoned wood in their hulls quickly began to rot after construction was suspended and they were broken up beginning in 1874. Unusually, Passaconaway was condemned by an Act of Congress on 5 August 1882 before she was finally broken up in 1884.|$|E

5|$|In {{the century}} after the {{collapse}} of the Romano-British economy, very few substantial buildings were constructed and many villas and towns were abandoned. New long- and round-houses were constructed in some settlements, while in others timber buildings were built imitating the older Roman styles. The Germanic immigrants constructed small rectangular buildings from wood, and occasionally grander halls. However, the conversion to Christianity in the 6th and 7th centuries reintroduced Italian and French masons, and these craftsmen built stone churches, low in height, following a narrow, rectangular plan, plastered inside <b>and</b> <b>fitted</b> with glass and colourful vestments. This Romanesque style developed throughout the period, featuring characteristic circular arches. By the 10th and 11th centuries, much larger churches and monastery buildings were being built, featuring square and circular towers after the contemporary European fashion. The palaces constructed for the nobility centred on great timber halls, while manor houses began to appear in rural areas.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how {{advertisements}} for extensions contribute to consumers' attitudes towards new line and brand extensions of highly familiar brands. We investigate {{the relative importance}} of attitude toward the advertisement (Aad), parent brand quality, <b>and</b> <b>fit</b> between the extension and the parent brand for extension evaluations with a sample of 754 Belgians. Hierarchical regressions showed that Aad is the major influencer of extension evaluation. The importance of Aad, quality, <b>and</b> <b>fit</b> on extension evaluation is moderated by extension type (line or brand extension), advertising strategy (informational, positive emotional, negative emotional), and product involvement (low or high involvement). Quality transfer from the parent brand was more outspoken for line than for brand extensions; Aad was relatively more important for low product involvement <b>and</b> <b>fit</b> for high involvement conditions. Informational appeals, compared to emotional appeals, reduced the effects of parent brand quality <b>and</b> <b>fit,</b> but Aad was all the more important...|$|R
