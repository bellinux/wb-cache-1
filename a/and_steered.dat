5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright <b>and</b> <b>steered</b> straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean and steer angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned <b>and</b> <b>steered.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} Zeranol and {{castration}} on organoleptic and mechanically assessed tenderness were studied using the 193 young beef cattle {{described in the}} companion paper (Impact of castration and zeranol implants on bullocks: I. Behavior, growth and carcass traits). Sensory panel evaluations showed that steaks from control <b>and</b> implanted <b>steer</b> carcasses had higher mean scores for tenderness, juiciness, flavor and overall palatability than those from control and implanted bulls. Implanting did not influence juiciness or flavor within the bull or steer groups, but control bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> were significantly (P<. 005) more tender and more palatable overall than were implanted bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers.</b> When comparing the mechanical measurements there was considerable variation among the instruments. The Armour tenderometer ranked meat from the implanted steers significantly tougher than either the control or implanted bulls. The Warner-Bratzler shear, Krammer shear and Instron Press ranked steaks from steers significantly more tender than those from bulls. Implanted and control groups of animals were similar in tenderness when judged by the mechanical measurements. Behavior and palatability characteristics of implanted and control bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> were also studied. Implantation made bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> more docile. The libido measurements were also lower for the implanted bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers.</b> Within group of implanted bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> those that were least aggressive {{tended to be more}} tender than their more aggressive counterparts...|$|R

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned <b>and</b> <b>steered.</b> In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} cyclone, Laura never approached land, and no damages or fatalities occurred. Since the storm remained over open waters {{for most of}} its life, several ships and oil platforms recorded tropical storm-force winds. The highest recorded winds were at an oil platform with the call sign VEP717 at 03:00UTC on October1. Winds were recorded up to 47knots (54mph; 87km/h). Despite the lack of impact, the storm's remnants were caught in an upper-level jet stream, <b>and</b> <b>steered</b> towards Europe. There, they contributed to heavy rainfall across portions of Britain on October5, causing localized accumulation of flood waters. As a result, Glebe Road near Windermere, England was closed in both directions, and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale, previously saturated soil, combined with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding. Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed due to poor driving conditions. One person had to be rescued from her car after driving into a flooded street. The UK Environment Agency issued 76 flood watches and 21 severe flood warnings {{as a result of the}} rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Captain Pulteney Malcolm on Donegal {{attacked}} Brave directly, firing his starboard {{guns and}} then crossing Braves stern, inflicting severe damage with a raking broadside, before pulling alongside again and engaging from close range. Badly damaged, Brave surrendered. Malcolm then ordered Captain Richard Dunn in Acasta to take possession as Donegal moved forward to engage Jupiter. With Donegal alongside Jupiter, Captain Samuel Pym in Atlas abandoned his brief {{engagement with the}} French ship <b>and</b> <b>steered</b> for the melee surrounding the increasingly isolated Impérial. Taking advantage of his ship's superior speed, Malcolm pulled ahead of Jupiter and then rammed her bow, securing the ships together to prevent the French vessel from escaping. Recognising that further resistance was hopeless, Captain Gaspard Laignel surrendered immediately. Malcolm then sent 100 men on board as a prize crew and attached a towline to the French ship, just as the trailing Agamemnon finally reached the battle.|$|E

5|$|The realist Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} 19th- and 20th-century Serbian painters. He was a native of the town of Vršac, then part of the Hungarian-administered Banat region of Austria-Hungary, which had a mixed population of Serbs, Hungarians and Germans. Most of the Serbs were descended from 14th-century migrants fleeing the Ottoman advance following the Battle of Kosovo in June 1389. Such diversity and multiculturalism ensured the town's reputation for prosperity and cultural enlightenment. Jovanović's artistic abilities were noticed at an early age, and nourished by his father, a professional photographer. His early development was informed by the portraits and religious paintings of artists such as Pavel Đurković, Jovan Popović and Arsenije Teodorović. Jovanović's early copies of the artworks available to him in Vršac brought him instant recognition <b>and</b> <b>steered</b> him towards a career in the arts. In his adolescence, the artist had observed people from the Vršac countryside and their customs, and compiled sketches of natural and man-made structures in and around the town. While a student, he was commissioned to draw a series of preparatory sketches for the bell tower of his hometown's main church.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} a new owner in Lerner and of manager Martin O'Neill marked {{the start of a}} new period of {{optimism}} at Villa Park and sweeping changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge, a new kit sponsor and team changes in the summer of 2007. The first Cup final of the Lerner era came in 2010 when Villa were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup Final. Villa made a second trip to Wembley in that season losing 3–0 to Chelsea in the FA Cup semifinal. Just five days before the opening day of the 2010–11 season, O'Neill resigned as manager, and after one year with Gérard Houllier in charge, Birmingham City manager Alex McLeish, despite numerous protests from fans against his appointment; this was the first time that a manager had moved directly between the two rivals. McLeish's contract was terminated at the end of the 2011–12 season after Villa finished in 16th place, and he was replaced by Paul Lambert. In February 2012, the club announced a financial loss of £53.9million, and Lerner put the club up for sale three months later, with an estimated value of £200 million. With Lerner still on board, in the 2014–15 season Aston Villa scored just 12 goals in 25 league games, the lowest in Premier League history, and Lambert was sacked in February 2015. Tim Sherwood succeeded him, <b>and</b> <b>steered</b> the club away from relegation while also leading them to the 2015 FA Cup Final, but he was sacked in the 2015–16 season, as was his successor Rémi Garde, in a campaign ended with Villa relegated for the first time since 1987.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} Prayer Book, the origins and {{participants}} {{in the work of}} its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project <b>and</b> <b>steered</b> its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision. The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New rubrics noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the curate, thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead, as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory. The Act of Uniformity 1552, which authorised the book's use, specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute, due to Dudley's intervention. While travelling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, John Knox, then based in Newcastle. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On 27 September 1552, the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy. On 22 October, the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called Black Rubric, which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.|$|E

5|$|Di Grassi {{took over}} the lead with d'Ambrosio second; both drivers were half a lap ahead of the battling drivers, who had more {{available}} electrical energy. Félix da Costa and his teammate Frijns joined the leading group of drivers after being under the minimum pit stop time by three seconds. The safety was deployed for the third (and final) time when Duval stopped on track after leaving the chicane with a battery issue, prematurely ending his race. This allowed the field to close up to di Grassi and d'Ambrosio. The safety car drove into the pit lane on lap 30 and di Grassi held the lead at the restart. Vergne immediately pushed hard and attempted to pass López for third but the two drivers made contact at the turn three chicane. He attempted the same manoeuvre one lap later but López cut the chicane to avoid hitting Vergne and the latter demanded on his radio that López cede the position. Both Andretti cars were investigated because their pit stop times were faster the minimum permitted time of one minute because the team believed it was 57 seconds. López drew near to d'Ambrosio and Vergne remained close behind López. The battle allowed di Grassi {{to pull away from}} the field. Félix da Costa slowed and stopped his car on the 33rd lap with a broken driveshaft, causing him to retire. His teammate Frijns was issued with a drive-through penalty for being below the minimum pit stop time. Two laps later, López pushed hard <b>and</b> <b>steered</b> onto the outside line in an attempt to pass d'Ambrosio but spun under braking for the first corner, sliding off into the turn's run-off area. Buemi activated FanBoost and lined up an overtake on Rosenqvist (who locked his front tyres) but spun under braking for turn one, and narrowly avoided striking López's stranded car. Both drivers fell down the order. The electrical power in Engel's car depleted slowly after exiting turns five and six, ending his race. Buemi recorded the race's fastest lap on lap 40, completing a circuit at one minute and 3.102 seconds. This earned him one championship point. D'Ambrosio continued to hold back Vergne and the remaining seven cars behind him had more electrical energy available. D'Ambrosio locked his tyres under braking for the first corner, allowing Vergne to pass him for second place. Vergne then started to draw closer to di Grassi.|$|E

40|$|In New Zealand, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} influence of dairy breeds {{in the production of}} beef. First-cross beef-cross-dairy cows have shown potential as beef breeding cows due to their greater milk yield than straight-bred beef cows. There have been few studies examining the finishing characteristics of the progeny of such cows. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of breed-cross on growth, carcass characteristics and meat quality attributes for progeny of beef and beef-cross-dairy cows grown in a New Zealand pastoral production system. This study also aimed to determine if there were differences in breed effects between heifers <b>and</b> <b>steers.</b> Growth, carcass characteristics and the meat quality were assessed for <b>steers</b> <b>and</b> heifers from beef and beef-cross-dairy cows. Heifers (n= 53) <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> (n= 50) were born to Angus (AA), Angus-cross-Friesian (AF), Angus-cross- KiwiCross (AK) and Angus-cross-Jersey (AJ) cows and sired by Charolais (C) bulls. Heifers <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> were grazed on pasture until slaughter at 574 and 784 days of age respectively. Live animal measurements were considered separately for heifers <b>and</b> <b>steers.</b> Carcass characteristics <b>and</b> meat quality attributes were compared among breed-crosses and between heifers <b>and</b> <b>steers.</b> The C-AA heifers (226. 8 ± 4. 7 kg) <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> (238. 8 ± 4. 6 kg) were lighter at weaning than the beef-cross-dairy breed heifers (C-AJ = 239. 9 ± 4. 6 kg, C-AK = 254. 7 ± 6. 3 kg, C-AF = 258. 9 ± 5. 7 kg) <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> (C-AJ = 256. 1 ± 4. 9 kg, C-AK = 257. 0 ± 7. 2 kg, C-AF = 267. 0 ± 5. 7 kg) (P 0. 05). The C-AA (53. 1 ± 0. 3 %) steers had a greater dressing-out percentage than C-AF (51. 9 ± 0. 4 %) and C-AJ (51. 5 ± 0. 3 %) steers (P 0. 05). Steers were longer, heavier, had a greater fat depth C and greater proportion of intramuscular fat than heifers (P 0. 05), except that C-AJ cattle had yellower fat than C-AA, and C-AA and C-AF cattle had redder fat than C-AK. There was no interaction of breed-cross with sex effects. Therefore, the C-AA cattle were more suited to a finishing system than C-AF, C-AK and C-AJ cattle...|$|R
