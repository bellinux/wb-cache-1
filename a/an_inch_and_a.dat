Although he remained otherwise in good health this was a sign of his increasing age, and the disabilities that came with it began to affect his judgments as well. While speaking at Cumberland Lodge in 1980 he forgot the details of the case, something shocking for a judge noted for his excellent memory.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{concentrated}} rainfall {{in the history of}} the United States has occurred in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles and Orange Counties. On April 5, 1926, a rain gauge in the San Gabriels collected one inch in one minute. In January, 1969, more water fell on the San Gabriels in nine days than New York City sees in a year. In February 1978, almost a foot of rain fell in 24 hours, and, in one blast, <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half in five minutes. This storm caused massive debris flows throughout the region, one of them unearthing the corpses in the Verdugo Hills Cemetery and depositing them in the town below. Another wiped out the small town of Hidden Springs in a tributary of the Big Tujunga River, killing 13 people.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most concepts, the 2000 Viper Concept {{was made}} as a {{complete}} car. It features a complete functional interior with air conditioning, adjustable pedals, and a premium sounds system. Only one 2000 GTS-R Concept was made featuring a dry-sump engine producing 500 horsepower, fifty more than current production, and 500lb-ft of torque. The body is a single moulding of carbon-fibre, but with some subtle changes compared with the existing cars. <b>An</b> <b>inch</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half has been taken out between the sill and the roof, which together with a chassis sitting two inches lower, gives the car a lower profile. Three inches {{have been added to}} the wheelbase and two inches to the track. The doors have also been lengthed, which combined with the longer wheelbase makes entry and exit from the car easier. Brakes are 14-inch ventilated discs with four-piston calipers and the front has the 19-inch wheels with P285/30 ZR Goodyear tires up and 20-inch rear wheels with P335/30 ZR tires.|$|E
25|$|Max Heindel {{divided the}} subtle body into: Vital Body made of Ether, our {{instrument}} for specializing the vital {{energy of the}} sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half outside the body; the Desire body, which is our emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16inches outside our visible body, related to the Desire World; and the Mental body, which functions like a mirror, reflects the outer world and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The human being {{is seen as a}} threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold Soul. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.|$|E
500|$|The {{national}} {{financial crisis}} reached its nadir in February 1797, when the Bank of England stopped redeeming its bills for gold. [...] In {{an effort to}} get more money into circulation, the Government adopted a plan to issue large quantities of copper coins, and Lord Hawkesbury summoned Boulton to London on 3 March 1797, informing him of the Government's plan. [...] Four days later, Boulton attended a meeting of the Privy Council, and was awarded a contract {{at the end of the}} month. [...] According to a proclamation dated 26 July 1797, King George III was [...] "graciously pleased to give directions that measures might be taken for an immediate supply of such copper coinage as might be best adapted to the payment of the laborious poor in the present exigency... which should go and pass for one penny and two pennies". The proclamation required that the coins weigh one and two ounces respectively, bringing the intrinsic value of the coins close to their face value. Boulton made efforts to frustrate counterfeiters. Designed by Heinrich Küchler, the coins featured a raised rim with incuse or sunken letters and numbers, features difficult for counterfeiters to match. The twopenny coins measured exactly <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half across; 16 pennies lined up would reach two feet. The exact measurements and weights made it easy to detect lightweight counterfeits. [...] Küchler also designed proportionate halfpennies and farthings; these were not authorised by the proclamation, and though pattern pieces were struck, they never officially entered circulation. [...] The halfpenny measured ten to a foot, the farthing 12 to a foot. The coins were nicknamed [...] "cartwheels", both because of the size of the twopenny coin and in reference to the broad rims of both denominations. [...] The penny was the first of its denomination to be struck in copper.|$|E

[...] Here, the chains are made from flat wrought iron plates, eight inches (203 mm) wide by <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half (38 mm) thick, rivetted together.|$|E

[...] In March 1639, 17-year-old John Dwight disappeared near Wigwam Pond, an area known to be particularly infested with wolves. A 20 shilling bounty per bobcat was established in 1734, and the last person to claim it did so in 1957.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Doppler radar weather sensors {{detected}} {{millions of}} mayflies heading for Presque Isle in {{blue and green}} splotches on the radar in clouds measuring [...] long. These insects were a sign of Lake Erie's move back to health, since the mayflies require clean water to thrive. Biologist Masteller of Penn State Erie declared the bugs to be a [...] "nice nuisance" [...] since they signified the lake's return to health after forty years of absence. Each is <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half long; the three main species of mayflies are Ephemera simulans, Hexagenia rigida and Hexagenia limbata. The insects mate over a 72-hour period from June through September; they fly in masses up to the shore, mate in the air, then females lay up to 8,000 eggs each over the water; the eggs sink back down and the cycle repeats. Sometimes the clouds of mayflies have caused power outages as well as causing roads to become slippery with squashed insects. Since zebra mussels filter extra nutrients from the lake, it allows the mayfly larvae to thrive.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 Chevrolet Nova was the most-changed Chevy car {{for that}} model year. [...] "Now it's beautiful," [...] said the {{brochure}} of Nova's all-new sheet metal, [...] "refined {{along the lines}} of elegant European sedans." [...] Chevrolet wisely maintained a visual kinship with the 1968–1974 design, and also retained Nova's efficiently sized 111-inch wheelbase. Front tread grew by <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, and the front stabilizer bar had a larger diameter. Novas now had standard front disc brakes and steel-belted radial tires. The front suspension and subframe assembly was similar to the one used in the second generation GM F-body cars (the Camaro and Pontiac Firebird), whereas the rear axle and suspension were carried over from the previous generation. Coupes, including the hatchback, had fixed side windows (or optional flip-out windows) and vertical vents on the B-pillar. All Novas now had cut-pile carpeting, formerly installed only in the Custom series. Speedometers had larger, easier-to-read graphics. Windshields offered greater glass area. Front-door armrests were redesigned with integral pull bars. The base model carried the inline Six-cylinder , , three V8 engines ( [...] , a 1975-only option, a [...] and a [...] ) for 1976 only, were offered. Mated to a three-speed automatic, 3-speed manual or 4-speed – V8s only – Which remained the norm {{through the end of the}} decade (and the end of the rear-wheel drive X platform).|$|E
