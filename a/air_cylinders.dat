It carries extra <b>air</b> <b>cylinders</b> for the Breathing Apparatus as well as gas tight suits, atmospheric monitoring equipment, and other specialised equipment.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of an apparatus for manipulating a vacuum hose in a reactor vessel comprising a housing with two opposing openings, an arm carried by the housing and deployable from a stowed position essentially completely within the housing to an extended position where the arm extends through the two openings in a generally horizontal position. The arm preferably has a two-fingered gripping device for gripping the vacuum hose but may carry a different end effector such as a grinding wheel. The fingers are opened and closed by one <b>air</b> <b>cylinder.</b> A second <b>air</b> <b>cylinder</b> extends the device. A third <b>air</b> <b>cylinder</b> within the housing pivotally pulls the opposing end of the arm into the housing via a pivoting member pivotally connected between the third <b>air</b> <b>cylinder</b> shaft and the arm...|$|R

25|$|A unique {{feature of}} these units {{is that there}} is a {{variable}} traction control system in their computer systems. One of the differences between an ES44AC and an ES44C4 are the <b>air</b> <b>cylinders</b> and linkages on the truck sideframes of the ES44C4; these are part of the traction control system. Every time a variation in grade, traction, or wheel slip occurs, the computer will adjust the pressure in these cylinders to maintain sufficient adhesion, by varying the weight on the drive axles.|$|E
25|$|Two {{substantial}} foghorns {{with concrete}} housings {{were built in}} 1866, one {{at the north end}} of the island near the Swine Cave reached by 'the Loups' path and the other at East Trammins on the south end. Both were powered by compressed air that was piped from the lighthouse, where a gas powered compressor was housed until 1911 when oil-powered engines were installed. One of the compressed air pipelines can still be seen within 'the Loups' path that was constructed above it. The compressed <b>air</b> <b>cylinders</b> that held the required store of air are still prominent features, especially at the Trammins foghorn. Both foghorns were decommissioned in 1966 and a Tyfon fog signal was used until 1987 when improvements in ship navigation made it also redundant.|$|E
25|$|Many {{training}} {{agencies such}} as PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI train their divers to personally check the oxygen percentage content of each nitrox cylinder before every dive. If the oxygen percentage deviates by more than 1% from the value written on the cylinder by the gas blender, the scuba diver must either recalculate his or her bottom times with the actual mix, or else abort the dive to avoid increased risk of oxygen toxicity or decompression sickness. Under IANTD and ANDI rules for use of nitrox, which are followed by most dive resorts around the world, filled nitrox cylinders are signed out personally in a gas blender log book, which contains, for each cylinder and fill, the cylinder number, the measured oxygen percent composition, the signature of the receiving diver (who should have personally measured the oxygen partial pressure before taking delivery), and finally a calculation of the maximum operating depth for that fill/cylinder. All of these steps minimize danger but increase complexity of operations (for example, personalized cylinders for each diver must generally be kept track of on dive boats with nitrox, {{which is not the}} case with generic compressed <b>air</b> <b>cylinders).</b>|$|E

2500|$|Open-circuit {{industrial}} breathing {{sets are}} filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. <b>Air</b> <b>cylinders</b> are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The [...] "positive pressure" [...] type is common, which supplies {{a steady stream of}} air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA´s are of the [...] "demand" [...] type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons.|$|E
2500|$|Small <b>air</b> <b>cylinders,</b> {{acting on}} the {{rotating}} heads of the coupler, ensure the Schaku coupler engagement, making it unnecessary to use shock {{to get a good}} coupling. Joining portions of a passenger train can be done at very low speed (less than [...] in the final approach), so that the passengers are not jostled about. Rail equipment manufacturers such as Bombardier offer the Schaku coupler as an option on their mass transit systems and their passenger cars and locomotives. In North America all the trains of the Montreal Metro are equipped with it, as are new light rail systems in Denver, Baltimore and New Jersey. It is also used on light rail vehicles in Portland, Minneapolis, the Vancouver Skytrain, and the Scarborough RT in Toronto. It also equips all the dedicated rolling stock used for the shuttle services in the Channel Tunnel.|$|E
