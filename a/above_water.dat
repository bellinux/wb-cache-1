5|$|Day-to-day {{killer whale}} {{behaviour}} generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Killer whales engage in frequent behaviour {{at the surface}} such as breaching (jumping {{completely out of the}} water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping, a behaviour in which a whale holds its head <b>above</b> <b>water,</b> helps the animal view its surroundings.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, Köln operated Flettner Fl 282 helicopters as an experiment. She provided gunfire support to German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion of}} the Soviet Union in 1941, and returned to Norway in 1942. Ultimately, she was sunk in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945 by American bombers. Her guns were still <b>above</b> <b>water,</b> which allowed her to support the defending German army against British ground forces until {{the final days of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; <b>above</b> <b>water,</b> {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. The fact that it is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.|$|E
5|$|River otters swim by quadrupedal paddling, forelimb paddling, {{alternate}} hind-limb paddling, simultaneous hind-limb paddling, or {{body and}} tail dorsoventral undulation. The tail, which is stout and larger in surface area than the limbs, {{is used for}} stability while swimming and for short bursts of rapid propulsion. While swimming at the surface, the dorsal portion of the river otter's head, including nostrils, ears, and eyes, is exposed <b>above</b> <b>water.</b> It must remain in motion to maintain its position at the surface.|$|E

5|$|Defence against torpedo boats was {{provided}} by eight QF 6-pounder guns, although the exact type of gun is not known. Four of these were mounted on the main deck in casemates {{on the sides of}} the hull and suffered from the same problems as the six-inch guns. Hood also mounted a dozen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns mounted in the superstructure and fighting tops. Like her sisters, the ship was fitted with seven 18-inch Torpedo tubes. Two of these were mounted in the bow below the waterline, four were placed in the sides of the hull, two on each broadside, and one in the stern. These last five tubes were all <b>above</b> <b>water.</b> She also was fitted with a plough-shaped underwater ram.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 29 March 1945, Kommandøren was docked at the remains of Søndre Nykirkekai in Bergen. At around 01:00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat {{anchored}} {{on the opposite side}} of Vågen bay. The torpedo explosion threw debris from Kommandøren over a wide area, and left the ship lying on the harbour bed. Only the mast and a section of the bow remained <b>above</b> <b>water.</b> The midship and aft sections of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo. The only crew member on board at the time, Able Seaman Alf Larsen, was killed in the incident.|$|E
5|$|In mid 1944, Schlesiens and Schleswig-Holsteins {{anti-aircraft}} armaments were considerably strengthened so {{they could}} used as air defense ships in the port of Gotenhafen. In April 1945, Schlesien was moved to Swinemünde to restock her ammunition supply as well as evacuate 1,000 wounded soldiers from the front. On 3 May she struck a mine at Zinnowitz outside Swinemünde and beached in shallow water. Much of the ship remained <b>above</b> <b>water,</b> including her main armament; {{she was able to}} provide artillery support for retreating German units. Between 1949 and 1956, the wreck was demolished and then scrapped in situ by an East German company. However, some remains from the ship were still visible in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Köln was {{the only}} ship of the class to survive the {{operations}} off Norway. After returning to Germany, she was modified {{to serve as a}} testbed for the Flettner Fl 282 helicopter. She thereafter served in the Baltic, providing gunfire support to advancing German troops in 1941. In mid 1942, she returned to Norwegian waters, and unsuccessfully attempted to attack Convoy PQ 18 along with several other German warships. She was then ordered back to Germany, where she served in a variety of roles, including training ship and convoy escort, before again returning to Norway. She was damaged by British bombers in December 1944 and forced to return to Germany for repairs. While in dock in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945, she was attacked and sunk by American heavy bombers. She sank on an even keel, with her guns still <b>above</b> <b>water,</b> which permitted their use against advancing British forces until {{the final days of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Limnoperdon is a fungal genus in the {{monotypic}} family Limnoperdaceae. The genus is also monotypic, as {{it contains}} a single species, the aquatic fungus Limnoperdon incarnatum. The species, described as new to science in 1976, produces fruit bodies that lack specialized structures such as a stem, cap and gills common in mushrooms. Rather, the fruit bodies—described as aquatic or floating puffballs—are small balls (0.5–1mm diameter) of loosely interwoven hyphae. The balls float {{on the surface of}} the water above submerged twigs. Experimental observations on the development of the fruit body, based on the growth on the fungus in pure culture, suggest that a thin strand of mycelium tethers the ball <b>above</b> <b>water</b> while it matures. Fruit bodies start out as a tuft of hyphae, then become cup-shaped, and eventually enclose around a single chamber that contains reddish spores. Initially discovered in a marsh in the state of Washington, the fungus has since been collected in Japan, South Africa, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Male adults may patrol individually, {{but most}} congregate in swarms a few metres <b>above</b> <b>water</b> with clear open sky above it, and perform a nuptial (courtship) dance. Each insect has a {{characteristic}} up-and-down pattern of movement; strong wingbeats propel it upwards and forwards with the tail sloping down; when it stops moving its wings, it falls passively with the abdomen tilted upwards. Females fly into these swarms, and mating {{takes place in}} the air. A rising male clasps the thorax of a female from below using his front legs bent upwards, and inseminates her. Copulation may last just a few seconds, but occasionally a pair remains in tandem and flutters to the ground. Males may spend the night in vegetation and return to the nuptial dance the following day. Although they do not feed, some briefly touch the surface to drink a little water before flying off.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 1314 December, Köln was {{attacked}} by British bombers in Oslofjord; several near misses caused damage to her propulsion system that required repair in Germany. She departed Norway on 23 January 1945 in company with Admiral Hipper and a destroyer, and arrived in Kiel on 8 February. She then proceeded to Wilhelmshaven, where she was again attacked by Allied bombers repeatedly. On 30 March, B-24 Liberators from the Eighth Air Force attacked the harbor; Köln was hit and sank on an even keel. Since her guns remained <b>above</b> <b>water,</b> the ship {{was used as an}} artillery battery to defend the city from advancing Allied forces. She served in this capacity {{until the end of the}} war in May. She was partially dismantled in situ after the end of the war, and finally raised in 1956 for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|Schlesien saw limited combat during World War II, {{including}} {{the invasion of}} Norway in 1940. After {{the conclusion of the}} operation, the ship was again given secondary duties. She ended her career as an anti-aircraft ship in the Baltic; in April 1945 Schlesien steamed to Swinemünde to restock her ammunition and evacuate wounded soldiers when she struck a mine on 3 May. She sank in shallow water, though much of her superstructure, including her main battery, remained <b>above</b> <b>water.</b> In the remaining days of the war, Schlesien used her heavy artillery to provide support for retreating German ground troops. After the end of the war, she was broken up, though some parts of the ship remained until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 dive season {{concentrated}} on raising the ship's steam engine and condenser. Hull plates {{had to be}} removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had to be separated from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff <b>above</b> <b>water.</b> The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the crane barge Wotan. Saturation diving was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on Monitor and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom. The surface-supplied divers evaluated the use of heliox due to the depth of the wreck. It also proved to be successful once the dive tables were adjusted.|$|E
