The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.|$|E

5|$|Moakes has {{indicated}} that there was no worry about whether a song could be recreated live in concert {{in the same way as}} it would appear on record. A brass section and a chamber choir were hired as additional musicians. Drum machines and distorted guitars were used more extensively than in Bloc Party's previous works to create a sense of manipulation to the basic rock palette. Drummer Matt Tong was initially sceptical of moulding songs with programmed drums, as opposed to using his physical output, but agreed to the idea when the band recorded some of the tracks in their entirety. On some songs, the guitars were disregarded and the band focused solely on the beat. Okereke's voice was often used <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> by being looped, vocoded, or run through effects pedals.|$|E
5|$|Other Marxists, such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner, {{have argued}} that Childe's archaeological work should not {{correctly}} be considered Marxist because he failed {{to take into account}} the existence of class struggle <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> of social change, something which was a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor he considered in his archaeological work, Childe did accept that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, and that most of his contemporaries were producing studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe also diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. Furthermore, he denied Marxism's ability to predict the future development of human society, and did not consider humanity's development into pure communism to be inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct instead.|$|E

5|$|Rural {{and urban}} cantons {{had the same}} {{standing}} in the federation. Each canton was sovereign within its territory, pursuing its own foreign policy and also minting its own money. The diet and central council of the federation, the Tagsatzung, held no real power and served more <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> of coordination. The reformation in the early 16th century had led to a confessional division amongst the cantons: the central Swiss cantons including Lucerne had remained Catholic, while Zürich, Bern, Basel, Schaffhausen, and also the city of St. Gallen had become Protestant. The Tagsatzung was often paralysed by disagreements between the equally strong factions of the Catholic and Protestant sides.|$|E
5|$|Students of Swiss {{educator}} Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, {{a proponent}} of social reform, applied his teachings when founding some singing groups <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> for cultural change. One of his students was Carl August Zeller, who helped establish the sängerbund movement throughout Prussia in 1809. Pestalozzi's protégé Hans Georg Nägeli was a composer, music teacher and songbook publisher who made numerous journeys across Germany from 1819 to encourage the formation of male singing groups for social reform. Nägeli established several sängerbunds in Switzerland, which became {{the inspiration for the}} 1824 establishment of the Stuttgarter Liederkranz. Following the 1819 Carlsbad Decrees in Germany, male-only choral celebrations with hundreds or thousands of vocalists were popular with the masses and often part of political events.|$|E
5|$|As Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Japan, MacArthur and {{his staff}} helped Japan rebuild itself, {{eradicate}} militarism and ultra-nationalism, promote political civil liberties, institute democratic government, and chart a new course that ultimately made Japan one of the world's leading industrial powers. The U.S. was firmly in control of Japan to oversee its reconstruction, and MacArthur was effectively the interim leader of Japan from 1945 until 1948. In 1946, MacArthur's staff drafted a new constitution that renounced war and stripped the Emperor of his military authority. The constitution—which became effective on 3 May 1947—instituted a parliamentary system of government, under which the Emperor acted only {{on the advice of}} his ministers. It included the famous Article 9, which outlawed belligerency <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> of state policy and the maintenance of a standing army. The constitution also enfranchised women, guaranteed fundamental human rights, outlawed racial discrimination, strengthened the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet, and decentralized the police and local government.|$|E
