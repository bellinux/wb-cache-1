5|$|Most {{mutations}} within {{genes are}} neutral, having {{no effect on}} the organism's phenotype (silent mutations). Some mutations do not change the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (synonymous mutations). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g. conservative mutations). Many mutations, however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to spontaneous mutation in the affected individual, or can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution.|$|E

40|$|Introduction There {{are many}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> in proteomes {{which are not}} {{homologous}} to any other sequences. Therefore, methods to classify proteins independent of the sequence homology are strongly required for computational analysis of proteomes. Proteins may {{be divided into two}} categories: soluble and membrane proteins. Since membrane proteins are characterized by the existence of long hydrophobic transmembrane helices, the classification of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> into two types of proteins, soluble and membrane proteins, is possible with considerably high accuracy. The classification of all <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> in several proteomes was reported recently, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} fraction of membrane proteins is about 30 % [1]. However, those methods provided only the information about the number of transmembrane helices. We have previously proposed a new method (SOSUI) to classify <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> by two types of transmembrane helices, primary and secondary tr...|$|R

5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of a gene's DNA specifies the <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> of a protein through the genetic code. Sets of three nucleotides, known as codons, each correspond {{to a specific}} amino acid. The principle that three sequential bases of DNA code for each amino acid was demonstrated in 1961 using frameshift mutations in the rIIB gene of bacteriophage T4 (see Crick, Brenner et al. experiment).|$|E
5|$|Prions are {{proteins}} {{of particular}} amino acid sequences in particular conformations. They propagate themselves in host cells by making conformational changes in other molecules of protein {{with the same}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence,</b> but with a different conformation that is functionally important or detrimental to the organism. Once the protein has been transconformed to the prion folding it changes function. In turn it can convey information into new cells and reconfigure more functional molecules of that sequence into the alternate prion form. In some types of prion in fungi this change is continuous and direct; the information flow is Protein→Protein.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} for unfolding of globular proteins is necessarily general, but somewhat {{dependent on the}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence.</b> Long sequences of alternating glycine and alanine {{have been shown to}} inhibit substrate unfolding, decreasing the efficiency of proteasomal degradation; this results in the release of partially degraded byproducts, possibly due to the decoupling of the ATP hydrolysis and unfolding steps. Such glycine-alanine repeats are also found in nature, for example in silk fibroin; in particular, certain Epstein–Barr virus gene products bearing this sequence can stall the proteasome, helping the virus propagate by preventing antigen presentation on the major histocompatibility complex.|$|E

5|$|Isoform “a” {{of human}} CASS4 is {{considered}} the predominant species, and at 786 amino acids is the longest one. <b>Amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> homology of this isoform of human CASS4 with other family members is 26% overall identity and 42% similarity. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, the CASS4 protein SH3 domain was shown {{to interact with the}} FAK C-terminus, despite the lowest overall similarity to other SH3 domains in the CAS group. In addition, human CASS4 has a limited number of candidate SH2-binding sites, estimated at 10, which is similar to EFS (estimated at 9) and in contrast to p130Cas/BCAR1 and NEDD9, which have 20 and 18 respectively. The CASS4 C-terminus has a short region of CAS family homology, but lacks obvious similarity at the level of primary <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence.</b> It also lacks a YDYVHL sequence at the N-terminal end of the FAT-like carboxy-terminal domain, even though this motif is conserved among the other three CAS family proteins and is an important binding site for the Src SH2 domain. Although this lack of sequence similarity may mean a reduced functionality of the CASS4 protein, molecular modeling analysis performed by Singh and colleagues using p130CAS/BCAR1 structures as templates suggested an almost identical fold between CASS4 and p130CAS/BCAR1 within their SH3 domains, and substantial similarity within 432-591 residues of CASS4 and 449-610 residues of p130Cas/BCAR1 at the level of secondary and tertiary structures. Also, the similar periodicity of α-helices and β-sheets in both CASS4 and p130Cas/BCAR1 provides another confirmation for the idea of well-conserved structures within the family members.|$|E
5|$|The Drosophila melanogaster genome {{contains}} 29 serpin encoding genes. <b>Amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> {{analysis has}} placed 14 of these serpins in serpin clade Q and three in serpin clade K {{with the remaining}} twelve classified as orphan serpins not belonging to any clade. The clade classification system is difficult to use for Drosophila serpins and instead a nomenclature system has been adopted {{that is based on}} the position of serpin genes on the Drosophila chromosomes. Thirteen of the Drosophila serpins occur as isolated genes in the genome (including Serpin-27A, see below), with the remaining 16 organised into five gene clusters that occur at chromosome positions 28D (2 serpins), 42D (5 serpins), 43A (4 serpins), 77B (3 serpins) and 88E (2 serpins).|$|E
5|$|The {{infectious}} isoform of PrP, {{known as}} PrPSc, {{is able to}} convert normal PrPC proteins into the infectious isoform by changing their conformation, or shape; this, in turn, alters the way the proteins interconnect. PrPSc always causes prion disease. Although the exact 3D structure of PrPSc is not known, it has {{a higher proportion of}} β-sheet structure in place of the normal α-helix structure. Aggregations of these abnormal isoforms form highly structured amyloid fibers, which accumulate to form plaques. It is unclear as to whether these aggregates are the cause of cell damage or are simply a side-effect of the underlying disease process. The end of each fiber acts as a template onto which free protein molecules may attach, allowing the fiber to grow. Under most circumstances, only PrP molecules with an identical <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> to the infectious PrPSc are incorporated into the growing fiber. However, rare cross-species transmission is also possible.|$|E

40|$|The <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> of {{proteins}} determine their three-dimensional structures and functions. However, how sequence information {{is related to}} structures and functions is still enigmatic. In this study, we show that at least {{a part of the}} sequence information can be extracted by treating <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> {{of proteins}} as a collection of English words, based on a working hypothesis that <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> of proteins are composed of short constituent <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> (SCSs) or "words". We first confirmed that the English language highly likely follows Zipf's law, a special case of power law. We found that the rank-frequency plot of SCSs in proteins exhibits a similar distribution when low-rank tails are excluded. In comparison with natural English and "compressed" English without spaces between words, <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> of proteins show larger linear ranges and smaller exponents with heavier low-rank tails, demonstrating that the SCS distribution in proteins is largely scale-free. A distribution pattern of SCSs in proteins is similar among species, but species-specific features are also present. Based on the availability scores of SCSs, we found that sequence motifs are enriched in high-availability sites (i. e., "key words") and vice versa. In fact, the highest availability peak within a given protein sequence often directly corresponds to a <b>sequence</b> motif. The <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> composition of high-availability sites within motifs is different from that of entire motifs and all protein sequences, suggesting the possible functional importance of specific SCSs and their compositional <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> within motifs. We anticipate that our availability-based word decoding approach is complementary to sequence alignment approaches in predicting functionally important sites of unknown proteins from their <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences...</b>|$|R
