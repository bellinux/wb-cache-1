40|$|The {{spiral arm}} tangencies are ideal lines of sight {{in which to}} {{determine}} the distribution of interstellar gas components in the spiral arms and study the influence of spiral density waves on the interarm gas in the Milky Way. We present a large scale (~ 15 deg) position-velocity map of the Galactic plane in [CII] from l = 326. 6 to 341. 4 deg observed with Herschel HIFI. We use [CII] l-v maps along with those for Hi and 12 CO to derive the average spectral line intensity profiles over the longitudinal range of each tangency. Using the VLSR of the emission features, we locate the [CII], HI, and 12 CO emissions along a cross cut of the spiral arm. In the spectral line profiles at the tangencies [CII] has two emission peaks, one associated with the compressed WIM and the other the molecular gas PDRs. When represented as a cut across the inner to {{outer edge of the}} spiral arm, the [CII]-WIM peak appears closest to the inner edge while 12 CO and [CII] associated with molecular gas are at the outermost edge. HI has broader emission with an intermediate peak located nearer to that of 12 CO. The velocity resolved spectral line data of the spiral arm tangencies unravel the internal structure in the arms locating the emission lanes within them. We interpret the excess [CII] near the tangent velocities as shock compression of the WIM induced by the spiral density waves and as the innermost edge of spiral arms. For the Norma and Perseus <b>arms,</b> we estimate <b>widths</b> of ~ 250 pc in [CII]-WIM and ~ 400 pc in 12 CO and overall spiral <b>arm</b> <b>widths</b> of ~ 500 pc in [CII] and 12 CO emissions.

Therefore, {{it is important to}} increase our understanding of collagen remodeling in soft tissues to understand the mechanisms behind pathologies and to control the development of the collagen network in engineered tissues. In the present study, a constitutive model was developed by coupling a recently developed model describing the orientation and contractile stresses exerted by cells in response to mechanical stimuli to physically motivated collagen remodeling laws. In addition, cell-mediated contraction of the collagen fibers was included as a mechanism for tissue compaction. The model appeared to be successful in predicting a range of experimental observations, which are (1) the change in transition stretch of periosteum after remodeling at different applied stretches, (2) the compaction and alignment of collagen fibers in tissue-engineered strips, (3) the fiber alignment in cruciform gels with different <b>arm</b> <b>widths,</b> and (4) the alignment of collagen fibers in engineered vascular grafts.

For this purpose, the mandrel peel test was compared to the standardized DCB test. Unstable crack propagation (stick-slip) was observed in both testing techniques. Nevertheless, each time unstable crack propagation occurs it is arrested by the mandrel. As a result more crack re-initiations were observed per unit crack length. This effect is expected to increase the statistical relevance of a single test and thereby increases the reliability of the test. As an additional advantage the mandrel peel test is very easy to perform compared to the DCB test.

40|$|We fit model {{spectral}} energy distributions to each pixel in 67 nearby (= 0. 0057) galaxies using broadband photometry {{from the}} Sloan Digital Sky Survey and GALEX. For each galaxy, we compare the stellar mass derived by summing {{the mass of}} each pixel to that found from fitting the entire galaxy treated as an unresolved point source. We find that, while the pixel-by-pixel and unresolved masses of galaxies with low specific star formation rates (such as ellipticals and lenticulars) are in rough agreement, the unresolved mass estimate for star-forming galaxies is systematically lower then the measurement from spatially-resolved photometry. The discrepancy is strongly correlated with sSFR, with the highest sSFRs in our sample having masses underestimated by 25 % (0. 12 dex) when treated as point sources. We found a simple relation to statistically correct mass estimates derived from unresolved broad-band SED fitting to the resolved mass estimates: m_{resolved} = m_{unresolved}/(- 0. 057 log(sSFR) + 0. 34) where sSFR is in units of yr^{- 1 }. We study the effect of varying spatial resolution by degrading the image resolution of the largest images and find a sharp decrease in the pixel-by-pixel mass estimate at a physical scale of approximately 3 kpc, which is comparable to spiral <b>arm</b> <b>widths.</b> The effects we observe {{are consistent with the}} "outshining" idea which posits that the youngest stellar populations mask more massive, older [...] and thus fainter [...] stellar populations. Although the presence of strong dust lanes can also lead to a drastic difference between resolved and unresolved mass estimates (up to 45 % or 0. 3 dex) for any individual galaxy, we found that resolving dust does not affect mass estimates on average. The strong correlation between mass discrepancy and sSFR is thus most likely due to the outshining systematic bias. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
