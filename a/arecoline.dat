5000|$|Though {{the exact}} cause of Alzheimer’s disease is still unclear, {{evidence}} points to the utility of increasing acetylcholine (ACh) levels for treating that condition. Most approaches are aimed at devising inhibitors of cholinesterase, the enzyme that destroys ACh. A quite different tack involves developing compounds that have cholinergic activity in their own right. The tetrazole alvameline (8), for example, was developed as a bioisostere of the muscarinic cholinergic compound <b>arecoline.</b> The design devolves {{on the fact that}} the proton on a free tetrazole shows a (pKa) comparable to that of a carboxylic acid.

5000|$|The {{areca nut}} ( [...] or [...] ) is {{the seed of}} the areca palm (Areca catechu), which grows {{in much of the}} {{tropical}} Pacific (Melanesia and Micronesia), Southeast and South Asia, and parts of east Africa. This seed is commonly referred to as betel nut so it is easily confused with betel (Piper betle) leaves that are often used to wrap it (paan). The term areca originated from a South Asian word, Malayalam: Adakka (അടക്ക) during the 16th century, when Dutch and Portuguese sailors took the nut from Kerala to Europe. Consumption has many harmful effects on health and is carcinogenic to humans. Various compounds present in the nut, most importantly <b>arecoline</b> (the primary psychoactive ingredient which is similar to nicotine), contribute to histologic changes in the oral mucosa. As with chewing tobacco, its use is discouraged by preventive efforts.|$|E
5000|$|Current {{science is}} {{confident}} that areca nut chewing is carcinogenic. Research suggests this is probably at least partly because of <b>arecoline</b> itself, although {{it could also be}} from the other constituents of the nut as well, some of which are precursors to nitrosamines that form in the mouth during chewing. Section 5.5 Evaluation on page 238 of IARC Monograph 85-6 states the following: * ...* There is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of betel quid without tobacco.

50|$|For example, {{researchers}} have recently sought {{to understand why}} humans began using tobacco {{in spite of the}} consequences and adverse reactions commonly associated with its use. Hagen and colleagues propose that, as in other species, humans began using tobacco and other plant toxins as a way of controlling infection by parasitic diseases, including helminths. Tobacco, as well as <b>arecoline</b> and cannabis, two other plant neurotoxins that are widely used as recreational drugs in humans, {{have been found to be}} toxic to parasitic worms that affect humans and other mammals, as well as plants. Modern anthelminthics function as well by targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on somatic muscle cells of parasites, producing paralysis and expelling the parasite, the same receptors which are targeted by nicotine (Roulette et al., 2014). Moreover, it has also been found that nicotine is equally or more effective than commercial anthelmintics at killing leeches, including those that infect humans. Similarly, Roulette et al. (2014) found in a study comparing male smoking prevalence and parasite load among Aka hunter-gatherers that treatment with commercial anthelmintics was associated with a decrease in cotinine concentrations (a measure of current tobacco use), thereby supporting their theory that humans regulate the amount of tobacco used in response to current helminth infection. The study also found that men with higher initial tobacco use also had lower worm burdens one year later, suggesting that nicotine not only eliminates parasites, but also protects from reinfection.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological {{evidence}} of co-use {{of alcohol and}} areca nuts suggests a potential central interaction between <b>arecoline,</b> a major alkaloid of areca and a muscarinic receptor agonist, and ethanol.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of <b>arecoline</b> on pentobarbital- and ethanol-induced hypnosis in mice. METHODS: Male ICR mice were tested for locomotor activity following acute systemic administration of ethanol alone, <b>arecoline</b> alone, or ethanol plus <b>arecoline.</b> For the loss of the righting reflex (LORR) induced by pentobarbital and ethanol, sleep latency and sleeping duration were evaluated in mice treated with <b>arecoline</b> alone or the combination of <b>arecoline</b> and scopolamine or methscopolamine. RESULTS: Ethanol (1. 0 to 3. 0 g/kg, i. p.) reduced locomotor activity significantly and a declining trend was observed after treatment with <b>arecoline</b> (0. 25 to 1. 0 mg/kg, i. p.), but there were no synergistic effects of ethanol and <b>arecoline</b> on locomotor activity. The experiments on LORR demonstrated that <b>arecoline</b> (0. 125 to 1. 0 mg/kg, s. c.) shortened the duration of sleeping induced by ethanol (4. 0 g/kg, i. p.), but not pentobarbital (45 mg/kg, i. p.). In addition, alterations of sleep latency were not obvious in both pentobarbital- and ethanol-induced LORR. Statistical analyses revealed that scopolamine (centrally acting), but not methscopolamine (peripherally acting), could antagonize the effect of <b>arecoline</b> on the duration of ethanol-induced LORR in mice.

40|$|<b>Arecoline</b> and {{nicotine}} are two psychoactive cholinergic alkaloids. <b>Arecoline</b> {{is primarily}} a muscarinic agonist while nicotine, at low doses, is a nicotinic agonist. The experiments in this dissertation investigated two major areas: (1) the role of different factors {{in the development of}} tolerance to the behavioral effects of <b>arecoline</b> and nicotine, and (2) the possible mechanism and site of action of the discriminative stimulus (DS) effects of <b>arecoline</b> and nicotine. The role of dispositional and physiological factors comﬁared to behavioral factors in the development of tolerance to the effects of <b>arecoline</b> and nicotine on operant behavior was assessed in Experiments I and II, respectively. In part one of Experiment I, rats were trained to respond (M 1 a variable-interval 15 second (VI- 15) schedule for milk reinforcement. Dose-effect relationships were assessed prior to and during chronic <b>arecoline</b> (1. 74 mg/kg/day) treatment. After 21 days Of <b>arecoline</b> administration prior to the session, the dose-effect relationship for total responses was not shifted. However, the dose-effect relationship for total reinforcements was shifted to the right. In part two of Experiment I, rats were trained to respond on a fixed-ratio 20 (FR-ZG) schedule for milk reinforcement. Dose-effect relationships were assessed prior to and during chronic <b>arecoline</b> (0. 87 mg/kg/day) administration. One group of rats received daily injections of <b>arecoline</b> prior to the seSsion and a second group received <b>arecoline</b> injections after the session. Daily administration of <b>arecoline</b> resulted in a greater shift {{to the right of the}} dose-effect relationship in the pre-session group compared to the post-session group. These data demonstrate the importance cﬂf behavioral factors in the development of tolerance to <b>arecoline.</b> In Experiment II, rats were trained to respond on a VI- 15 second schedule of milk reinforcement. Dose-effect relationships were determined prior to and during chronic nicotine (2. 28 mg/kg/day) administration. One group of rats received daily injections Of nicotine prior to the session, another group received nicotine injections after the session. After 36 days of chronic treatment, similar degrees of tolerance were observed in both groups, however the group receiving post-session nicotine developed tolerance at a faster rate. The data suggested that 21 complex interaction of nicotine and the experimental environment affected the rate of tolerance development. Experiment III characterized the DS effect of <b>arecoline.</b> Using a two-lever operant paradigm, rats were trained to discriminate <b>arecoline</b> from saline on a VI- 12 second schedule of milk reinforcement. Rats could learn to discriminate 1. 74 mg/kg <b>arecoline</b> from saline, but not 0. 58 mg/kg from saline. Agonist and antagonist studies demonStrated that the DS effect of <b>arecoline</b> is mediated through central muscarinic receptors. In Experiment IV, the ability of physostigmine to interact ﬁith the DS effect of nicotine (1. 14 mg/kg) and <b>arecoline</b> (1. 74 mg/kg) was assessed. Physostigmine (0. 125 mg/kg) pretreatment shifted the dose-effect relationship for <b>arecoline</b> to the left but did not affect that of nicotine. Physostigmine (0. 25 mg/kg) almost completely generalized to the DS effect of <b>arecoline</b> but not to the DS effect of nicotine. These data suggest an interaction of endogenous acetylcholine with muscarinic receptors but not with nicotinic receptors. In Experiment V, the ability hf <b>arecoline</b> and nicotine injected directly into the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) to generalize to the DS effect of peripherally administered <b>arecoline</b> (1. 74 mg/kg) and nicotine (1. 14 mg/kg) was assessed; Nicotine injected into these sites generalized in a dose-related manner to nicotine.

40|$|Abstract Background Approximately 600 {{million people}} chew Betel nut, making this {{practice}} the fourth most popular oral habit in the world. <b>Arecoline,</b> the major alkaloid present in betel nut {{is one of}} the causative agents for precancerous lesions and several cancers of mouth among those who chew betel nut. <b>Arecoline</b> can be detected in the human embryonic tissue and is correlated to low birth weight of newborns whose mothers chew betel nut during pregnancy, suggesting that <b>arecoline</b> can induce many systemic effects. However, few reports exist as to the effects of <b>arecoline</b> in human tissues other than oral cancer cell lines. Furthermore, in any system, virtually nothing is known about the cellular effects of <b>arecoline</b> treatment on membrane associated signaling components of human cancer cells. Results Using the human Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell line, we investigated the effects of <b>arecoline</b> on expression, localization and functional connections between the ZO- 1 tight junction protein and the HER 2 EGF receptor family member. Treatment of Ishikawa cells with <b>arecoline</b> coordinately down-regulated expression of both ZO- 1 and HER 2 protein and transcripts in a dose dependent manner. Biochemical fractionation of cells as well as indirect immunofluorescence revealed that <b>arecoline</b> disrupted the localization of ZO- 1 to the junctional complex at the cell periphery. Compared to control transfected cells, ectopic expression of exogenous HER 2 prevented the <b>arecoline</b> mediated down-regulation of ZO- 1 expression and restored the localization of ZO- 1 to the cell periphery. Furthermore, treatment with dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid reported to up-regulate expression of HER 2 in Ishikawa cells, precluded <b>arecoline</b> from down-regulating ZO- 1 expression and disrupting ZO- 1 localization. Conclusion <b>Arecoline</b> is known to induce precancerous lesions and cancer in the oral cavity of betel nut users. The <b>arecoline</b> down-regulation of ZO- 1 expression and subcellular distribution suggests that <b>arecoline</b> potentially disrupts cell-cell interactions mediated by ZO- 1, which {{may play a role in}} arecoline-mediated carcinogenesis. Furthermore, our study has uncovered the dependency of ZO- 1 localization and expression on HER 2 expression, which has therefore established a new cellular link between HER 2 mediated signaling and apical junction formation involving ZO- 1. </p...|$|E

40|$|There {{are over}} 600 million people {{worldwide}} covering Asian and Oceanic countries including India have {{the habit of}} chewing areca nut as masticator in different forms. <b>Arecoline</b> (C 8 H 13 NO 2) has been reported {{as one of the}} abundant constituents of areca nut. A good number of scientific publications have made <b>Arecoline</b> responsible for oral cancer. Based on observation from clinical situation in North East India, one of the most betel quid chewing region of the country, we suspected a link between consumption of areca nut and Cerebro Vascular Disease like stroke.

Also we considered High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) receptor as another target to see if <b>Arecoline</b> has any binding potential with it over and above LDL receptor. Docking result indicated that <b>Arecoline</b> and Cholesterol both, have affinity towards extracellular domain of Human LDL receptor but affinity of <b>Arecoline</b> is much higher (- 12. 3560.) than that of Cholesterol(- 0. 1810).

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the inhibitory effects of <b>arecoline,</b> the major alkaloid of areca nut, on murine immortalized cementoblast cell line (OCCM. 30). Materials and methods: Cytotoxicity was judged using tetrazolium bromide reduction assay. Cell migration was evaluated by Transwell assay. In vitro mineral nodule formation was assayed by von Kossa staining. Cell differentiation was examined by alkaline phosphatase activity with substrate assay. The production of osteoprotegerin was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: <b>Arecoline</b> demonstrated cytotoxicity to cementoblasts in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner (P <  0. 05). <b>Arecoline</b> attenuated cell migration in a dose-dependent manner (P <  0. 05). <b>Arecoline</b> treatment markedly suppressed cementoblast-mediated biomineralization in vitro compared to untreated cells at Day 8. <b>Arecoline</b> was found to inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in a time-dependent manner (P <  0. 05). In addition, <b>arecoline</b> decreased the secretion of osteoprotegerin in a dose-dependent manner (P <  0. 05).

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) {{is due to}} {{a complex}} interplay between the production and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) protein components. In tissue fibrosis, there is a net accumulation of collagen {{as a result of an}} imbalance between enhanced production, deposition and impaired degradation of ECM components. OSMF is a chronic inflammatory condition of the oral cavity and regulation of a number of pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic cytokines such as interleukine- 1, - 6 and - 8 isoforms, TGF-β, PDGF, bFGF, IFN-γ and TNF-α has been reported in OSMF tissues. The expression of these growth factors has a bearing on the epithelial changes as well as proliferation and differentiation of oral fibroblasts into ECM protein producing myofibroblast cells. One key modulator of fibrosis in several organs has been TGF-β. Overproduction of TGF-β mRNA and protein has been reported in several fibrotic disorders including that of skin, lungs, liver, kidney and heart. This is mainly due to stimulation of ECM genes by TGF-β. Although there have been few reports suggesting the over production of TGF-β in OSMF tissues, the specific isoforms involved or the mechanisms are poorly understood. Areca nut components, especially <b>arecoline</b> have been implicated in the pathophysiology of OSMF. Few reports indicate the involvement of <b>arecoline</b> in the regulation of collagen production and activity of collagenases and their inhibitors in oral fibroblast cells. Moreover, the alkaloid is involved in initiating epithelial inflammation by inducing COX- 2, prostaglandin E 2, IL- 1 α, IL- 6 and IL- 8 in KB oral carcinoma cells and oral fibroblast cells. These and other reports strongly suggest that changes in gene expression mediated by <b>Arecoline</b> may be central to the progression of OSMF. Not much is known about arecoline-mediated cellular signaling events except for few recent reports that suggest the activation of MAPK pathways. In neuronal and colonic smooth muscle cells of mouse, rat and rabbit, the actions of <b>Arecoline</b> have been reported to be through the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Direct binding of <b>arecoline</b> to human M 1, 2 and 3 muscarinic receptor isoforms have been shown in brain tissues. Stimulation of these receptors alters the intracellular levels of Ca+ 2 and cAMP, which are important second messengers. The cholinergic potential of <b>arecoline</b> may be important for their roles in arecoline-mediated signaling events. The expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors has been reported in several cell types besides neuronal and excitatory cells. Although several gene expression changes have been reported following <b>Arecoline</b> treatment of a variety of cells, the mechanism of such regulations is not established. Hence in order to understand the role of <b>arecoline</b> in OSMF disease process, we undertook studies that provide insights into <b>arecoline</b> action in epithelial and fibroblast cells and possible molecular mechanisms. The objectives are to study: 1. The role of <b>arecoline</b> in cellular proliferation, cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis in human normal keratinocytes. 2. Mechanism 	of regulation of gene expression by <b>arecoline</b> in normal keratinocytes. 3. Mechanism of regulation of gene expression by <b>arecoline</b> in human normal oral fibroblasts. In order to achieve the above objectives, a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT and an oral periodontal fibroblast cell line (PDC) were utilized. The cells were treated with <b>arecoline</b> and a variety of assays including RT-PCR analysis of mRNA of several genes, phosphorylation status of MAPK pathway intermediates, cell cycle analysis and other cellular and molecular methods have been employed. Following <b>arecoline</b> treatment, there is induction of oxidative stress, growth arrest and epithelial cell death. Since actions of TGF-β are central to most fibrotic disorders and <b>arecoline</b> has been implicated in OSMF, it is hypothesized that <b>arecoline</b> may influence fibrosis via TGF-β pathway. Towards this, several TGF-β target genes that may have a possible role in fibrosis have been studied in <b>arecoline</b> treated epithelial and fibroblast cells. Since <b>arecoline</b> mediated oxidative stress has been reported, the regulation of genes that are involved in stress response pathway have been studied for induction by <b>arecoline</b> in epithelial cells. The results presented in this thesis suggest the up regulation of oxidative stress-responsive genes in HaCaT cells including HOX- 1, FTL, G 6 PD, GCLC and GRD in HaCaT cells. Oxidative stress is a major inducer of inflammatory response in the epithelial tissues. The expression of IL- 1 α, an important inflammatory cytokine is induced by <b>arecoline</b> in HaCaT cells in response to oxidative stress via the activation of p 38 MAPK pathway. Interestingly, activation of MAPK pathways by <b>arecoline</b> is involved in the regulation of common target genes of <b>arecoline</b> and TGF-β and also in the induction of TGF-β−responsive promoter reporter construct, p 3 TP-lux activity in HaCaT cells. Due to the involvement of TGF-β in fibrosis, regulation of TGF-β pathway genes by <b>arecoline</b> has been studied both in HaCaT and PDC cells. In HaCaT cells, <b>arecoline</b> induces the expression of TGF-β 2 mRNA while TβRII expression is down regulated. The expression of the rest of TGF-β/SMAD pathway genes including TGF-β 1, β 3, TβRI, SMAD 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 are not affected by <b>arecoline</b> in HaCaT cells. Over expression of TGF-β 2 is also observed in most of the OSMF tissues compared to normal oral tissues. However, in normal oral fibroblast cells, we observed that the TGF-β/SMAD pathway genes are not regulated by <b>arecoline.</b> These results suggest the possible involvement of arecoline-mediated induction of TGF-β 2 in epithelial cells in OSMF disease development. We investigated the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of TGF-β 2 and found that stimulation of M 3 muscarinic receptor by <b>arecoline</b> leads to the induction of TGF-β 2 expression in HaCaT cells via PKC pathway. TGM- 2 is an important TGF-β target gene involved in the cross linking of ECM proteins. Arecoline-mediated induction of TGM 2 mRNA and transglutaminase activity are observed in oral fibroblast cells, PDC. The induction of TGM- 2 was found to be independent of oxidative stress and TGF-β, but dependent on muscarinic acid receptor activation by <b>arecoline</b> and involves cytosolic cAMP. When tested in OSMF tissues, there was an increased expression of TGF-β 2, TSP 1 and TGM 2 as compared to normal tissues suggesting a possible role of these genes in arecoline-mediated progression of OSMF. Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), which is involved in inflammation has been reported to be regulated by TGF-β in a cell type specific manner. In several cell types including human endometrial stromal cells, LnCaP (prostate cancer cells), human retinal pigment epithelial cells and rat lung alveolar epithelial (LM 5) cells etc., TGF-β up regulates the expression of IL- 8 mRNA. <b>Arecoline</b> was found to down regulate IL- 8 expression in PDC cells as measured by RT-PCR. Interestingly, the presence of serum along with <b>arecoline</b> induces the expression of IL- 8 in PDC cells suggesting the modulation of arecoline-mediated gene regulation by a serum activated signaling pathway. Intriguingly, <b>arecoline</b> treatment led to down regulation of collagens in PDC cells. However, collagen genes are induced in PDC cells in the presence of HaCaT spent medium by <b>arecoline</b> suggesting a role for factor(s) secreted by epithelial cells in the regulation of collagen genes by <b>arecoline.</b> This factor could be an isoform of TGF-β as shown by blocking the induction of collagens by the TGF-β inhibitor, βLAP. Taken together, all these results indicate the ability of <b>arecoline</b> to cause fibrosis in a tissue environment where both epithelial and fibroblasts respond to <b>arecoline</b> and mutually contribute to the disease manifestation. Major conclusions from this study includes, 1] cell death in epithelial cells due to oxidative stress following <b>arecoline</b> treatment, 2] regulation of gene expression by <b>arecoline</b> involves MAPK, PKC pathways, 3] muscarinic acid receptor and oxidative stress are also important for regulation gene expression by <b>arecoline.</b> The most important inference from this study is the possible paracrine influence of TGF-β isoforms secreted by epithelial cells on the oral fibroblasts in determining the progression of OSMF. In summary, in this thesis, an attempt has been made to study the molecular mechanisms and role of <b>arecoline,</b> an alkaloid in conferring gene expression changes that may lead to the initiation and progression of oral sub mucous fibrosis...|$|E

Strips of longitudinal muscle from the distal colon were suspended in organ baths containing Krebs solution. Isometric contraction of colonic smooth muscle in the presence of <b>arecoline</b> was measured. The effects of tetrodotoxin, atropine, 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -diphenylacetoxypiperidiniumiodide (4 -DAMP), nifedipine and Ca 2 +-free Krebs solution on arecoline-induced responses were also assessed. The results showed that <b>arecoline</b> (0. 1 - 100 µM) enhanced the contraction of the longitudinal smooth muscle of rat colon in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-treatment with the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 µM) did not block the effect of <b>arecoline.</b> Muscarinic (M) receptor antagonist atropine (10 µM) and M 3 receptor antagonist 4 -DAMP (1 nM- 1 µM) blockaded the arecoline-induced contraction. L-type Ca 2 + channel antagonist nifedipine (1 µM) and Ca 2 +-free (0. 1 mM EGTA) Krebs solution abolished the arecoline-induced contraction. These results suggest that <b>arecoline</b> increases colonic motility via the M 3 receptor, which depends on the influx of Ca 2 +...|$|E
