500|$|... "Missing link" [...] {{is still}} a popular term, well {{recognized}} by the public and often used in the popular media. It is, however, avoided in the scientific press, {{as it relates to}} the concept of the great chain of being and to the notion of simple organisms being primitive versions of complex ones, both of which have been discarded in biology. In any case, the term itself is misleading, as any known transitional fossil, like Java Man, is no longer missing. While each find will give rise to new gaps in the evolutionary story on each side, the discovery of more and more transitional fossils continues to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of evolutionary transitions.|$|E
500|$|Because {{it crosses}} genres, {{fragments}} the characters' experiences, and resists straightforward narrative resolution, Barton Fink is often considered {{an example of}} postmodernist film. In his book Postmodern Hollywood, Booker says the movie renders the past with an impressionist technique, not a precise accuracy. This technique, he notes, is [...] "typical of postmodern film, which views the past not as the prehistory of the present but as a warehouse of images to be raided for material". In {{his analysis of the}} Coens' films, Palmer calls Barton Fink a [...] "postmodern pastiche" [...] which closely examines how past eras have represented themselves. He compares it to The Hours (2002), a film about Virginia Woolf and two women who read her work. He asserts that both films, far from rejecting the importance of the past, <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> understanding of it. He quotes literary theorist Linda Hutcheon: the kind of postmodernism exhibited in these films [...] "does not deny the existence of the past; it does question whether we can ever know that past other than through its textualizing remains".|$|E
500|$|The Byzantine culture was, initially, {{the same}} as Late Greco-Roman, but over the {{following}} millennium of the empire's existence it slowly changed into something more similar to modern Balkan and Anatolian culture. The cuisine still relied heavily on the Greco-Roman fish-sauce condiment garos, but it also contained foods still familiar today, such as the cured meat pastirma (known as [...] "paston" [...] in Byzantine Greek), baklava (known as koptoplakous κοπτοπλακοῦς), tiropita (known as plakountas tetyromenous or tyritas plakountas), and the famed medieval sweet wines (Commandaria and the eponymous Rumney wine). Retsina, wine flavored with pine resin, was also drunk, as it still is in Greece today, producing similar reactions from unfamiliar visitors; [...] "To <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> calamity the Greek wine, on account of being mixed with pitch, resin, and plaster was to us undrinkable," [...] complained Liutprand of Cremona, who was the ambassador sent to Constantinople in 968 by the German Holy Roman Emperor Otto I. The garos fish sauce condiment was also not much appreciated by the unaccustomed; Liutprand of Cremona described being served food covered in an [...] "exceedingly bad fish liquor." [...] The Byzantines also used a soy sauce like condiment, murri, a fermented barley sauce, which, like soy sauce, provided umami flavoring to their dishes.|$|E

500|$|The {{style of}} the poem has been {{described}} as [...] "sagalike in its sparse use of language combined with ample specific detail." [...] According to George Anderson, since the poem comes so late in the Old English period, it gives evidence of the continuing attraction of the [...] "warrior tradition": it is [...] "clear and convincing testimony to the vitality of the Old English battle-epic tradition; the authentic ring sounds out years after the Beowulf Poet, Caedmon, and Cynewulf have been laid to rest." [...] Donald Fry compares passages from Beowulf and Brunanburh (concerning the boarding of ships) and remarks on the [...] "similar diction and imagery". According to Malcolm Godden, the language resembles that of the Old English Genesis A. The poem is not without its detractors: an early critic, Walter J. Sedgefield, in a 1904 study of the poems in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, said [...] "even the longest and best written of their number, the Battle of Brunanburh, is but a simulacrum, a ghost of the older epos". That the poem should not be treated as a historical text, and that panegyric was the appropriate genre, was argued by Alistair Campbell: [...] "The poet's subjects are the praise of heroes and the glory of victory. When this is realised, the oft-repeated criticism, that he does not greatly <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of the battle, falls to the ground. It was not his object to do so. He was not writing an epic or a 'ballad.' He was writing a panegyric." [...] Townend agrees, and notes that praise-poems on contemporary men are completely missing from the Anglo-Saxon period until a cluster of four panegyrics including Brunanburh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{printed catalogue}} of 1741 gives {{the range of}} readers' tastes, for the members' requirements shaped the collection. Excluding gifts, {{a third of the}} holdings of 375 titles were historical works, geographies and accounts of voyages and travels, a category the Library Company has collected energetically throughout its history. A fifth of the titles were literature, mostly in the form of poetry and plays, for the prose novel was still in its infancy: as late as 1783, in the first orders from London after the war years, the directors thought [...] "we should not think it expedient to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> present stock, anything in the novel way." [...] Another fifth of the titles were devoted to works of science. Theology and sermons, however, accounted for only a tenth of the titles, which set the Free Library apart from collegiate libraries at Harvard and Yale. The Company's agent in London was Peter Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society, the Quaker mercer-naturalist of London, who corresponded with John Bartram.|$|E
2500|$|The archive was {{established}} as a web-based library {{to ensure that the}} oral record of modern poets is not lost, as it has been with writers such as Thomas Hardy, D. H. Lawrence and A. E. Housman whose voices were never recorded, despite the technology being available at the time. The resource is built on the idea that poets have a unique relationship with their own work and are often able to communicate the nuance, musicality and subtlety of it, with a deeper understanding than actors. Texts to the poems and other resources are available but the poet's voice is the main concern of the site. [...] Motion has stated [...] "To hear the speed at which a poet reads, to hear their accent, to hear how they inflect their voice, to hear how they create a space around their words - or don't - all <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> using of what the meaning of poem might be." [...] Contemporary studio recordings for the project began in 2000, shortly after Motion was appointed a Poet Laureate, and the site went live in 2005. Most of the recordings are created especially for the organisation, however some historic readings are archived. Poets are chosen by a selection panel, chaired by Andrew Motion and works added to the site every month. CDs of archive works are available. Launched in 2014, there is also a download store which allows people to purchase and download audio poetry directly from the website.|$|E
2500|$|Marples had a {{background}} with a successful road construction company. When opening the M1 motorway he said: [...] "This motorway starts {{a new era}} in road travel. It is in keeping with the bold scientific age in which we live. It is a powerful weapon to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> transport system." [...] His association with the high-profile construction company Marples Ridgway became a matter of concern to both the public and politicians. As is customary, he resigned as a director of the company in 1951 on becoming a junior minister, but he only sold his shares in the company in 1960 after the company won a contract to build the Hammersmith Flyover, when questions were asked both in the media and also in the Commons on 28 January 1960; he made a statement to the House later that day confirming that the sale of shares was in hand and would be completed [...] "very soon", noting that as part of the agreement he could be required to buy the shares from the purchaser at the original price after he ceased to hold office, if so desired by the purchaser. In July 1964, Marples Ridgway and partners were awarded a £4.1 million contract for the [...] "Hendon Urban Motorway" [...] extension of the M1, in the same year that the company was taken over by the Bath and Portland Group. There was no evidence of any wrongdoing on anyone's part in this {{or any of the other}} contracts awarded to the company during his term of office, it did however lead to a sense of unease, not least within the railway sector.|$|E
