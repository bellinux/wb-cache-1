5|$|Quatermass deduces that {{an alien}} {{life-form}} {{which comes from}} one of the moons of Saturn, which lives on ammonia, hydrogen and methane, but to which oxygen is a deadly poison, travels to earth in the meteorites, and in the few seconds they spend out of their shells before dying they possess human minds, and transmit knowledge to each other in a collective consciousness. From this, they <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the population of Winnderden Flats itself who demolished the village and built the plant. Quatermass decides that they can use the remaining Quatermass II rocket like a nuclear bomb and destroy the asteroid, much to Leo's protest at the rocket being unsafe to fly. Fowler tries to steal information about the other plants from the ministry, but is overcome and possessed by a makeshift meteorite hidden inside a filing cabinet.|$|E

If, as the evidence suggested, the struggle between Rasmussen and her attacker had begun upstairs and then continued downstairs, that stack would likely have been knocked downstairs and scattered as well. It made more sense to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been stacked afterwards, when an actual burglar would have fled the scene immediately after the shooting.|$|E
25|$|The map {{currently}} in Ryūkoku University (hereafter, Ryūkoku copy) has gathered scholarly attention {{since the early}} 20th century. It is 158cm by 163cm, painted on silk.

One claims that it was purchased by Ōtani Kōzui and others <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was obtained during the invasion of Korea (1592-1598) and given to the West Honganji temple by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. It contains some place names of Korea that are newer than 1402, suggesting that the Ryūkoku copy was partially modified from the 1402 original around the 1470s and 1480s.|$|E
25|$|Guwahati's {{myths and}} history go back several {{thousands}} of years.

Epigraphic sources place the capitals of many ancient kingdoms in Guwahati. It was the capital of the kings Narakasura and Bhagadatta according to the Mahabharata. Located within Guwahati is the ancient Shakti temple of Goddess Kamakhya in Nilachal hill (an important seat of Tantric and Vajrayana Buddhism), the ancient and unique astrological temple Navagraha in Chitrachal Hill, and archaeological remains in Basistha and other archaeological locations of mythological importance.|$|E

25|$|The RCM {{created a}} {{medallion}} to honour Elvis Presley. The medal features the word Graceland (above {{an image of}} the mansion and its gates) and an actual denomination of $10. The reverse of the medal features an engraving of Elvis, along with the words The Man/The Music/The Legend. The medallion itself is undated, but as the medal is 10 ounces, one would <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was made for the 10th anniversary of the singer's death. Additional information {{can be found in the}} certificate of authenticity which states that this Elvis Presley medal was authorized by Legendary Coins and struck by the Royal Canadian Mint. The packaging bears a copyright date of 1987, and states that the medal is for commemorative purposes only and is not legal tender.|$|E
25|$|When {{we think}} of {{interactivity}} and its meaning, we <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is only prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does {{not allow us to}} see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E
25|$|Black-body radiation, the {{emission}} of electromagnetic energy {{due to an}} object's heat, could not be explained from classical arguments alone. The equipartition theorem of classical mechanics, the basis of all classical thermodynamic theories, stated that an object's energy is partitioned equally among the object's vibrational modes. But applying the same reasoning to the electromagnetic emission of such a thermal object was not so successful. That thermal objects emit light had been long known. Since light {{was known to be}} waves of electromagnetism, physicists hoped to describe this emission via classical laws. This became known as the black body problem. Since the equipartition theorem worked so well in describing the vibrational modes of the thermal object itself, it was natural to <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would perform equally well in describing the radiative emission of such objects. But a problem quickly arose: if each mode received an equal partition of energy, the short wavelength modes would consume all the energy. This became clear when plotting the Rayleigh–Jeans law which, while correctly predicting the intensity of long wavelength emissions, predicted infinite total energy as the intensity diverges to infinity for short wavelengths. This became known as the ultraviolet catastrophe.|$|E
