5|$|Single-sensed souls, however, called nigoda, and element-bodied souls pervade all {{tiers of}} this universe. Nigodas are souls {{at the bottom}} end of the existential hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even {{individual}} bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of nigodas {{can also be found}} in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies. Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub–sub categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>as</b> they cycle within samsara.|$|E

The Drammen Line, {{consisting}} of commuter trains, and regional and intercity trains from the Sørland Line and the Vestfold Line, terminated at OsloV. The Østfold, Trunk and Gjøvik Lines terminated at OsloØ. Between the two stations ran the Oslo Port Line, which in part {{ran in the}} city streets and was only used for {{a limited number of}} freight trains. Several plans had been launched to connect the two stations, with the most prominent being a line running west of Oslo and merging with the Gjøvik Line at Grefsen, and an elevated line from OsloV to Tordensskiolds plass, in a tunnel under Akershus Fortress <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>as</b> an elevated line past Oslo Stock Exchange to OsloØ.|$|E
5|$|In 1187 Walter, {{along with}} Glanvill and King Henry II, {{attempted}} to mediate a {{dispute between the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Baldwin of Forde, and the monks of the cathedral chapter. Their efforts were fruitless, and Walter was later drawn back into the dispute, in early 1189 <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>as</b> archbishop. The dispute centred on the attempt by Baldwin to build a church dedicated to Saint Thomas Becket, just outside the town of Canterbury. The plan was to staff the church with canons instead of monks, which the monks of Canterbury's cathedral chapter feared {{was an attempt to}} take away the cathedral chapter's right to elect the archbishop. The attempt in 1189 was settled by Baldwin giving up the site near Canterbury for one further away at Lambeth, which was less threatening to the monks.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Traktor, and was developed as an independent video from the film but contained Bond influences. It depicts Madonna as a prisoner in a torture chamber, alternating with scenes of a fencing duel between good (clad in white) and evil (clad in black) personas of the singer. Wounds inflicted on both fencers are mirrored on the imprisoned Madonna, {{and in the end}} she escapes being electrocuted in the chamber. The usage of Jewish religious texts and objects in the music video led to controversy, with scholars of Judaism deeming it sacrilegious. Madonna has included the song on two of her world tours; the first being the 2004 Re-Invention World Tour <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>as</b> a video interlude on the 2008–09 Sticky & Sweet Tour.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{complete}} list of Vice-Presidents of the Philippines, who were inaugurated as Vice-President of the Philippines following the ratification of a constitution that explicitly declared the existence of the Philippines. The inclusion of Mariano Trías in the list is disputed, for Trias was chosen as vice-president at the Tejeros Convention, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>as</b> vice-president for the short-lived Republic of Biak-na-Bato, which was dissolved after the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato and Aguinaldo's exile. Neither the reassumption of power by Emilio Aguinaldo when the revolution was resumed in May 1898 nor his formal proclamation and inauguration as President under the First Philippine Republic in 1899 were regimes that provided for a vice-presidency. The vice-presidency {{within the context of the}} Philippine government was formally created by the constitution in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>as</b> they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence}} of food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E
