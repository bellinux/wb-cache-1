5|$|The {{principal}} conditions are: decompression illness (which covers {{decompression sickness}} and arterial gas embolism); nitrogen narcosis; high pressure nervous syndrome; oxygen toxicity; and pulmonary barotrauma (burst lung). <b>Although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these may occur in other settings, {{they are of}} particular concern during diving activities.|$|E

5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its stones were looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the seamounts in the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain {{appear to}} follow the {{expected}} age progression for a mantle plume trail, others, such as Denson Seamount, are older than that hypothesis would suggest. As a result, the Kodiak-Bowie Seamount chain has also been proposed by geoscientists to be a mix of ridge and mantle plume volcanism.|$|E

5|$|Although {{theoretically}} a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi {{dominated the}} RCC, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the others attempted to constrain {{what they saw}} as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government's public face, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970. All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|E
5|$|As {{a widely}} used {{international}} standard, ISO 3166-1 is implemented in other standards {{and used by}} international organizations to allow facilitation of the exchange of goods and information. However, {{it is not the}} only standard for country codes. Other country codes used by many international organizations are partly or totally incompatible with ISO 3166-1, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them closely correspond to ISO 3166-1 codes.|$|E
5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, the finished product quite often was different from the original text. <b>Although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E

5|$|Chaffee {{was given}} a variety of assignments, and participated in {{numerous}} training duties {{over the next few}} years, spending {{most of his time in}} photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and quality control officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a quality control manual for the squadron, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his peers saw this as too demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over Cape Canaveral, during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.|$|E
5|$|Drymoreomys albimaculatus {{appears to}} be a {{specialist}} of dense, moist, montane and premontane forest. It has been found in disturbed and secondary forests as well as in pristine forest, but probably needs contiguous forest to survive. Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. <b>Although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are suggestive of arboreal (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens were collected in pitfall traps on the ground.|$|E
5|$|During the Antarctic {{winter of}} 1902 Discovery became {{locked in the}} ice. Efforts to free her {{during the summer of}} 1902–03 failed, and <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the expedition's members (including Ernest Shackleton) left in a relief ship, Crean and the {{majority}} of the party remained in the Antarctic until the ship was finally freed in February 1904. After returning to regular naval duty, Crean was promoted to petty officer, first class, on Scott's recommendation.|$|E

5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.|$|E
5|$|Henri IV was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy {{built to}} test {{some of the}} ideas of the prominent naval architect Louis-Émile Bertin. She began World War I as guardship at Bizerte. She was sent to reinforce the Allied naval force in the Dardanelles campaign of 1915, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her secondary armament had been removed for transfer to Serbia in 1914. Afterwards, she was relegated to second-line roles before being sent to Taranto as a depot ship in 1918. She was struck from the navy list in 1920 and scrapped the following year.|$|E

5|$|Production {{began in}} 1939 for {{deliveries}} to the Army and Luftwaffe, although the exact numbers {{will never be}} known as they were often not broken out separately in the production reports. At any rate Adler built 1054 between 1939 and February 1943, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these were completed as 10/5s beginning in 1942. MWC was awarded two contracts for 975 10/5s to be delivered in 194344, but 13 of these were delivered as ordinary Sd.Kfz. 10s in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Shilts {{praised the}} Public Health Department of San Francisco's {{handling}} of the new communicable disease as they tracked down people who were sick and linked them to other people who had symptoms, <b>although</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> them were living {{in different parts of}} the country. He criticized the New York City Public Health Department for doing very little, specifically when Public Health Director David Sencer refused to call AIDS an emergency and stated that the Public Health Department need not do anything because the gay community was handling it sufficiently.|$|E
