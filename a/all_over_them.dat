There was so much racial baiting that it was terrifying. I was called names. ... My posters had black paint <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>them</b> with racial epithets. It was very disturbing.|$|E
500|$|Mark Lepage of Blender {{claimed that}} Is This It {{is similar to}} the works of 1970s bands the Velvet Underground, Television and the Feelies. Pitchforks Ryan Schreiber {{suggested}} that, while the work of the Velvet Underground is an obvious inspiration for the Strokes, the band's only similarity to the other groups is the confidence with which they perform. AllMusic's Heather Phares concluded, [...] "Granted, their high-fashion appeal and faultless influences... have 'critics' darlings' written <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>them.</b> But like the similarly lauded Elastica and Supergrass before them, the Strokes don't rehash the sounds that inspire them—they remake them in their own image." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1927, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) was {{established}} by Louis B. Mayer, originator of Louis B. Mayer Pictures Corporation, which then would be joined into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Mayer's purpose in creating the award was to unite the five branches of the film industry, including actors, directors, producers, technicians, and writers. Mayer commented {{on the creation of}} the awards [...] "I found {{that the best way to}} handle [...] was to hang medals <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>them</b> ... If I got them cups and awards they'd kill them to produce what I wanted. That's why the Academy Award was created". Mayer asked Cedric Gibbons, art director of MGM, to design an Academy Award trophy. Nominees were notified through a telegram in February 1928. In August 1928, Mayer contacted the Academy Central Board of Judges to decide winners. However, according to the American director King Vidor, the voting for the Academy Award for Best Picture was in the hands of the AMPAS founders Douglas Fairbanks, Sid Grauman, Mayer, Mary Pickford, and Joseph Schenck.|$|E

2500|$|This {{practice}} (excessive compression, {{dynamic range}} reduction, loudness level enhancement, etc.) has been condemned by several recording industry professionals including Alan Parsons, Geoff Emerick (noted {{for his work}} with the Beatles from Revolver to Abbey Road), and mastering engineers Doug Sax, Steve Hoffman, and many others, including music audiophiles, hi-fi enthusiasts, and fans. Musician Bob Dylan has also condemned the practice, saying: [...] "You listen to these modern records, they're atrocious, they have sound <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>them.</b> There's no definition of nothing, no vocal, no nothing, just like—static." [...] The compact disc editions of Dylan's more recent albums Modern Times and Together Through Life are examples of heavy dynamic range compression, although Dylan himself {{might not have been}} responsible for it.|$|E
2500|$|Accounts {{from various}} parents and school staffers {{describe}} bullying {{at the school}} as [...] "rampant." [...] Nathan Vanderau, a friend of Klebold, and Alisa Owen, Harris's eighth-grade science partner, reported that Harris and Klebold were constantly picked on. Vanderau noted that a [...] "cup of fecal matter" [...] was thrown at them. [...] "People surrounded them in the commons and squirted ketchup packets <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>them,</b> laughing at them, calling them faggots," [...] Brooks Brown says. [...] "That happened while teachers watched. They couldn't fight back. They wore the ketchup all day and went home covered with it." [...] In his book, No Easy Answers: The Truth Behind Death at Columbine, Brown wrote that Harris was born with mild chest indent. This made him reluctant to take his shirt off in gym class, and other students would laugh at him.|$|E

In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders {{as part of a}} mission called [...] "Operation Lifeline". Because of civil war, food from aid {{agencies}} had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to southern Sudan. Hepburn said, [...] "I saw but one glaring truth: These are not natural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution – peace." [...] In October 1989, Hepburn and Wolders went to Bangladesh. John Isaac, a UN photographer, said, [...] "Often the kids would have flies <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>them,</b> but she would just go hug them. I had never seen that.

2500|$|Pharaoh ant colonies contain many queens. The {{ratio of}} queens to workers is {{variable}} and {{dependent on the}} size of the colony. An individual colony normally contains 1,000–2,500 workers, but often a high density of nests gives the impression of massive colonies. In a small colony, there will be more queens relative to workers. In addition, individuals will be larger than those in a more populous colony. This ratio is controlled by the workers in the colony. Larvae that will produce workers have characteristic hairs <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>them,</b> while larvae that will produce sexual males or females are bare. It is thought that workers can use these distinguishing features to identify larvae. Workers may cannibalize larvae in order to ensure a favorable caste ratio. This decision to cannibalize is largely determined by the present caste ratio. If plenty of fertile queens are present, for example, the workers may eat sexual larvae. [...] The caste ratios are controlled in an attempt to maximize the growth of the colony. For example, in a small colony, the ratio of queens to workers is increased. This in turn increases the potential for reproduction, allowing colony growth. Conversely, in a large colony, the high worker to queen ratio maximizes the foraging capacity of the nest, helping sustain the population size.|$|E
2500|$|His {{message of}} a {{reformed}} clergy was in great demand (though interestingly, {{he had to}} call for armed help from the Admiral's men to evict an Augustinian friar from the pulpit at Abbéville). Later that year he tried to bring a heretic to see the error of his ways. Jean Langlois was a priest who had travelled widely—in Spain, Provence, Italy and Bohemia where he had picked up some dangerous ideas. On 3 June 1496 he pushed the priest serving Mass at Notre Dame Cathedral and scattered the Hosts from the chalice before stamping <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>them</b> and declaring {{the idea of the}} real presence of Christ in them to be a superstition. He was also a brother of one of Standonck's students, so Jan visited him in prison to try to get him to repent, which [...] he did. However, when he learned he was to be handed over to the civil authorities—to be put to death—he retracted his repentance. He was ceremoniously stripped of his priesthood in front of Notre Dame, and the public executioner chopped off the hand that had offensively touched the sacred chalice. He was then put backwards on a donkey and led to the pig market to be burned. Standonck followed him all the way, preaching and imploring him to repent until he was so exhausted he could not speak. Langlois repented just as he was being burned. Standonck declared that from henceforth he would maintain a strict Lenten fast.|$|E
