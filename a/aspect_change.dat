40|$|Abstract�In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel method for {{tracking}} contour of a moving rigid object in natural video sequences from a mobile camera. While a mobile camera is keeping track of a moving target, any change in relative orientation or position of the target and camera may cause {{a change in the}} view of target captured by the camera. This is called the target <b>aspect</b> <b>change</b> and known as a challenge in tracking. Especially, a large <b>aspect</b> <b>change</b> may reveal some previously hidden parts of the target, and this is the case we have handled in our algorithm. In proposed contour tracking method the motion model of the target is estimated using corner matching and LMedS statistical method. This model is used together with an active contour (snake) to track the target efficiently. The snake we propose is capable of swelling locally, so that it can swell and include newly appeared parts of the target in case of a large <b>aspect</b> <b>change.</b> Detecting target newly appeared parts, is {{based on the fact that}} a part of target should move consistently with other parts and inconsistently with the background. When a new part is detected the nearby part of the snake is stimulated to swell. In this way the snake will include any new part of the target revealed by a large <b>aspect</b> <b>change.</b> Several experiments have been conducted to show the promise of proposed algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} new algorithms for automatic tracking of multiaspect targets in cluttered image sequences. We {{depart from the}} conventional correlation filter/Kalman filter association approach to target tracking and propose instead a nonlinear Bayesian methodology that enables direct tracking from the image sequence incorporating the statistical models for the background clutter, target motion, and target <b>aspect</b> <b>change.</b> Proposed algorithms include 1) a batch hidden Markov model (HMM) smoother and a sequential HMM filter for joint multiframe target detection and tracking and 2) two mixed-state sequential importance sampling trackers based on the sampling/importance resampling (SIR) and the auxiliary particle filtering (APF) techniques. Performance {{studies show that the}} proposed algorithms outperform the association of a bank of template correlators and a Kalman filter in adverse scenarios of low target-to-clutter ratio and uncertainty in the true target aspect.

30|$|Following {{the seminal}} work by Isard and Blake [20], {{particle}} filters have been extensively applied to the solution of visual tracking problems. In [21], a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to track an object in video subject to model uncertainty. The target's aspect, although unknown, is assumed, however, to be fixed in [21], with no dynamic <b>aspect</b> <b>change.</b> On the other hand, in [22], an adaptive appearance model is used to specify a time-varying likelihood function expressed as a Gaussian mixture whose parameters are updated using the EM [23] algorithm. As in our work, the algorithm in [22] also processes image intensities directly, but, unlike our problem setup, the observation model in [22] does not incorporate any information about spatial correlation of image pixels, treating instead each pixel as independent observations. A different Bayesian algorithm for tracking nonrigid (randomly deformable) objects in three-dimensional images using multiple conditionally independent cues is presented in [24]. Dynamic object appearance changes are captured by a mixed-state shape model [13] consisting of a discrete-valued cluster membership parameter and a continuous-valued weight parameter. A separate kinematic model is used in turn to describe the temporal evolution of the object's position and velocity. Unlike our work, the kinematic model in [24] is assumed statistically independent of the aspect to model.|$|E
40|$|Os grandes avanços na compreensão da fisiologia vocal e o desenvolvimento científico e tecnológico na área de voz permitiram transpor o limite terapêutico através dos meios para a detecção precoce de alterações vocais. OBJETIVO: Avaliar indivíduos sem queixa vocal e correlacionar possíveis achados telelaringo-estroboscópicos, perceptivo-auditivos e acústicos. FORMA DE ESTUDO: Observacional coorte com corte transversal. CASUÍSTICA E MÉTODO: Foram avaliados 21 indivíduos do sexo masculino, com idade variando de 20 a 50 e mediana de 33 anos, sem queixas vocais, que não faziam uso de tabaco nem de destilados. Os sujeitos foram submetidos às avaliações telelaringo-estroboscópica, perceptivo-auditiva e acústica da voz. RESULTADOS: Do total de sujeitos avaliados, 57, 15 % apresentaram alteração em uma ou mais das avaliações realizadas. À telelaringo-estroboscopia, observou-se fenda vocal {{triangular}} posterior em 4 sujeitos. Dez apresentaram alteração na análise perceptivo-auditiva, observando-se os seguintes parâmetros: instabilidade, rouquidão e soprosidade, todos em grau discreto. Na avaliação da ressonância, três apresentaram cada foco hipernasal, {{cul de sac}} e laringo-faríngea. A avaliação acústica apresentou as seguintes médias: f 0 - 125, 69 Hz; jitter - 0, 22 %; shimmer - 3, 06 %; NNE - 12, 29 dB; HNR - 20, 75 dB; freqüência do tremor - 2, 09 Hz; amplitude do tremor - 1, 16 Hz. Alguns sujeitos apresentaram valores de shimmer% e freqüência do tremor maiores do que a média. CONCLUSÃO: Foram detectadas alterações em 57, 15 % das avaliações realizadas em indivíduos sem queixas vocais. Esses achados podem ser indicativos de uma variação da normalidade ou representar uma predisposição a alterações glóticas e vocais que, com o passar do tempo, podem desenvolver-se. Em todas as avaliações alteradas houve alteração de parâmetro acústico. The {{great progress}} in understanding the vocal physiology and the scientific and technological development in the voice area allow transposing the therapeutic limit through the means for the precocious detection of vocal changes. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate subjects without vocal complaint, and to correlate possible videostroboscopic, perceptual and acoustic analysis finding. STUDY DESIGN: Observacional cohort with transversal cut. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 21 men without vocal complaints were studied. Their ages ranged from 20 to 50 with median of 33. They were neither alcohol nor smoke users. The subjects underwent the videostroboscopic, perceptual and acoustic evaluations. RESULTS: 57. 15 % of the subjects presented any alteration {{in one or more}} of the evaluated aspects. In the videostroboscopy it was observed posterior triangular gap in 4 subjects. Ten subjects presented a mild grade alteration in the perceptual analysis, in instability, hoarseness and breathiness parameters. Three subjects presented respectively hipernasal, cul de sac and pharyngolaryngeal resonance focus. The acoustic evaluation presented the following averages: f 0 125. 69 Hz; jitter 0. 22 %; shimmer 3. 06 %; NNE - 12. 29 dB; HNR 20. 75 dB; tremor frequency 2. 09 Hz; tremor amplitude 1. 16 Hz. Some subjects presented shimmer% values and tremor frequency largest than the average. CONCLUSION: Alterations were detected in 57. 15 % of the evaluations of subjects without vocal complaints. Those changes could be variations of the normality, or they could indicate a predisposition to future glottic and vocal alterations in the course of the time.
