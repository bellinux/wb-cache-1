5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b>|$|E

5|$|For {{his work}} on Itchy & Scratchy, Grampa is {{nominated}} for an award for Outstanding Writing in a Cartoon Series. When Grampa sees Itchy & Scratchy {{for the first time}} in a clip show introducing the award, he is appalled at the violent humor, and turns his acceptance speech into an assault on both the cartoon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> amused by it.

5|$|In The Girlie Show in 1993, {{the song}} was {{performed}} in an alternate version as the second to last song of the tour. It had a military theme to it. Halfway through the performance Madonna paused the song for a military drill with the dancers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> The performance met with strong reaction in Puerto Rico, when Madonna rubbed the Puerto Rican national flag between her legs in between the performance. For the Drowned World Tour in 2001 Madonna wore a fur coat, velvet fedora and a customised Dolce & Gabbana T-shirt which proclaimed 'Mother' {{in the front and}} 'F*cker' in the back painted in silver. This demonstrated her ghetto-girl appearance adopted for the song's performance.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the first}} episodes of Carnivàle, Ben's {{parentage}} {{is one of}} the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected to everything and everyone, it is Ben's job to piece together the mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than what both the characters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> would imagine at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up {{by the end of the}} second season. Other character links that were largely unanswered after Carnivàles cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde&Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the Carnivàle. Show creator Daniel Knauf, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not qualify them for canon status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.|$|E

I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> would be segregated.

5|$|The Simpsons go to {{the local}} movie theater to see a film. Bart and Lisa see Space Mutants VI, while Homer, Marge, and Maggie see The Stockholm Affair.

During the car ride home, Marge tries to apologize, but Homer will not accept it, by dropping Marge and the children off at home and goes off on a long drive into the night, finally stopping at a redneck bar called Beer 'N' Brawl, where he grabs a beer while listening to an attractive waitress named Lurleen Lumpkin performing on stage. She sings a song that follows Homer's current state with every detail, and once she finishes, Homer introduces himself to her.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{inspired}} by Glatzer and Westmoreland's experience as a white gay couple moving into the gentrifying neighborhood of Echo Park, a predominantly Latino working-class community.
