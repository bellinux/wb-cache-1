40|$|Simultaneous {{measurements}} of the <b>auroral</b> zone <b>particle</b> precipitation and the ion convection velocity by Atmosphere Explorer show a consistent difference between {{the location of the}} poleward boundary of the <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> precipitation and the ion convection reversal. The difference of about 1. 5 degrees of invariant latitude is such that some part of the antisunward convection lies wholly within the <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> precipitation region. The nature of the convection reversals within the precipitation region suggests that in this region the convection electric field is generated on closed field lines that connect in the magnetosphere to the low latitude boundary layer...|$|R

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{study of}} signatures of the high-latitude ionospheric convection pattern and the simultaneously observed energetic electron precipitation is presented. Most often found are convection cells {{in which the}} sunward flowing region contains <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> precipitation but the antisunward flowing region does not. However, observations also show the frequent occurrence of convection cells in which neither the antisunward nor the sunward flowing plasma region contains <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> precipitation.

No unique relation is found between the regions of the Birkeland current system and regions of <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> distribution, though repeatable systematics {{in the region of}} upward-directed current are observed, and little evidence exists in either local time sector for the direct detection of the downward current-associated current carriers...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} high {{latitude}} auroral processes {{has been developed}} {{for use in the}} NCAR TGCM. The ion drift pattern associated with magnetospheric convection is specified by the empirical model of Heelis et al. (1982) considering offset geographic and geomagnetic poles. An analytic prescription of particle precipitation in the auroral oval is developed that enables rapid numerical evaluation of auroral ionization rates and global aurora power input. An analytic expression has been derived for the total ionization rate and an ion chemical scheme is used to calculate the electron density enhancements and ion density distributions caused by <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> precipitation. The results of TGCM runs with and without <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> precipitation show the importance of auroral ionization in determining the dynamic structure of the winter hemisphere lower thermosphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{problems}} {{concerning the}} aurora posed {{prior to the}} war are now either solved in principle or were restated in a more fundamental form. The pre-war hypothesis concerning {{the nature of the}} <b>auroral</b> <b>particles</b> and their energies was fully confirmed, with the exception that helium and oxygen ions were identified as participating in the auroral particle precipitation in addition to the protons. The nature of the near-Earth energization processes affecting <b>auroral</b> <b>particles</b> was clarified. Charged particle trajectories in various electric field geometries were modeled. The physical problems have now moved from determining the nature and geometry of the electric fields, which accelerate charged particles near the Earth, to accounting for the existence of these electric fields as a natural consequence of the solar wind's interaction with Earth. Ultimately the reward in continuing the work in auroral and magnetospheric particle dynamics will be {{a deeper understanding of the}} subtleties of classical electricity and magnetism as applied to situations not blessed with well-defined and invariant geometries...|$|E
30|$|Observations in the auroral {{ionosphere}} {{indicated that}} the probe potential was shifted from the analytical solution of the floating potential due to the non-Maxwellian velocity distribution. Strong precipitation of energetic electrons in the auroral arc should have caused the lower probe potential.

Consideration is given to solar flux, atomic emissions, molecular emissions, hydrogen geocorona, and molecular oxygen and the green line nightglow...|$|R
30|$|An upward beam of hot ions which {{originates}} in the ionosphere is commonly observed in {{and above the}} region of <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> acceleration. Past simulations of the weak double layer (WDL) have only included magnetospheric hot electrons and ionospheric cold ions. We simulated {{the formation of the}} WDL numerically and more realistically using a one dimensional electrostatic code. We modeled magnetospheric hot electrons, ionospheric cold ions and hot ionospheric beam ions in the system. The existence of the hot ion beam modifies the characteristics of the WDL, its magnitude of the potential drop and lifetime. We investigated the variation in the character of the WDL for different fractions of the hot ion beam component. The magnitude of the potential jump of the WDL was found to decrease but the lifetime of the WDL increase as this proportion increased. The existence of a critical value of the ratio of the hot beam ions to the cold ions, above which electrons cannot be accelerated effectively and which places an upper limit on the altitude of <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> acceleration region has also been shown.|$|R

Note that the plasma frequencies were higher than the cyclotron frequencies except for the altitudes below 100 km, due to the ionization by <b>auroral</b> <b>particles</b> precipitation (Wakabayashi and Ono, 2006). This indicates that the difference between the observations and calculations was not derived from the condition fpe< fce as discussed in Section 5.1.|$|E
40|$|The ISEE- 1 {{satellite}} frequently {{passes through}} electrostatic shocks {{and the low}} altitude <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> acceleration region at geocentric radial distances less than approximately 7 earth radii and as low as {{greater than or equal}} to 2 earth radii. A sampling of data from the quasi-static electric field experiment during 22 such passes revealed events (defined as regions of low frequency turbulence) containing electrostatic shocks (defined as an electric field {{greater than or equal to}} 100 mV/m) during eight of the passes, which is an occurrence frequency comparable to that obtained near apogee on the S 3 - 3 satellite. Examination of three such electrostatic shocks shows that typical potentials of a few kV and latitudinal scale widths mapped to the ionosphere of a few km are encountered. From the latitudinal widths of the shocks and from the magnitudes of their observed electric fields, it is argued that the parallel electric field and <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> acceleration region may be confined to geocentric distances less than a few earth radii...|$|R

Vertical winds of a few meters per second are produced in the region subject to auroral heating; this vertical upwelling drives circulation cells that extend the effects of heating in the auroral region on a global scale. Our analysis focuses on the initial phase of a magnetic storm within the auroral region...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We discuss {{here the}} energy {{deposition}} of solar FUV, EUV and X-ray photons, en-ergetic <b>auroral</b> <b>particles,</b> and pickup ions. Photons and the photoelectrons that they produce may interact with thermospheric neutral species producing dissociation, ionization, excita-tion, and heating. The interaction of X-rays or keV electrons with atmospheric neutrals may produce core-ionized species, which may decay by {{the production of}} characteristic X-rays or Auger electrons. Energetic particles may precipitate into the atmosphere, and their colli-sions with atmospheric particles also produce ionization, excitation, and heating, and auro-ral emissions. Auroral energetic particles, like photoelectrons, interact with the atmospheric species through discrete collisions that produce ionization, excitation, and heating of the ambient electron population. <b>Auroral</b> <b>particles</b> are, however, not restricted to the sunlit re-gions. They originate outside the atmosphere and are more energetic than photoelectrons, especially at magnetized planets. The spectroscopic analysis of auroral emissions is dis-cussed here, along with its relevance to precipitating particle diagnostics. Atmospheres can also be modified by the energy deposited by the incident pickup ions with energies of eV’s to MeV’s; these particles may be of solar wind origin, or from a magnetospheric plasma.

40|$|OH {{rotational}} temperatures {{have been}} observed at the Syowa Station, Antarctica (69 &deg; S, 39 &deg; E), which {{is located in the}} middle of the auroral zone and has a high-sensitivity spectrometer for the spectral region of the OH 8 - 4 band. A dataset of 153 nights was acquired during the 2008 austral winter season. Of the 153 nights, the weather and aurora conditions were only suitable on 6 nights to study the relationship between auroral activity and OH airglow variation. Of these 6 nights, a significant increase in the rotational temperature and a decrease in the intensity related to an aurora activity were identified on the night of 27 / 28 March 2008, but no such variations were seen during the other nights. The horizontal magnetic field disturbance on the night of 27 / 28 March was the largest of that winter, while the cosmic radio noise absorption was also very strong. These facts indicate that, compared with the other nights, a large flux of high-energy <b>auroral</b> <b>particles</b> precipitated during the night. It is suggested that the observed variations in the OH rotational temperature and airglow intensity were caused by a lowering of the average airglow height as a result of OH depletion in the upper part of the layer where high-energy <b>auroral</b> <b>particles</b> can reach...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the in situ {{identification}} of a narrow electrostatic acceleration layer (electrostatic shock) containing intense plasma turbulence in the upward current region, {{and its effect on}} <b>auroral</b> <b>particles.</b> Wave turbulence recorded {{in the center of the}} layer differs in character from that recorded above and beneath. It is concluded that the shock is sustained by different nonlinear waves which, at each level, act on the particles in such a way to produce a net upward directed electric field. The main power is in the ion acoustic range. We point out that anomalous resistivities are incapable of locally generating the observed parallel potential drop...|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} design {{by which a}} cesium vapor cloud was suddenly released in order to stimulate <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> precipitation is described along with the general results obtained. A drastic increase of the field-aligned charged-particle flux was observed with subsequent particle bursts. It is suggested that low-energy acceleration was due to parallel electric fields created by an instability which was driven by field-aligned currents resulting from the plasma injection. Pitch angle scattering in the deep magnetosphere may account for particle precipitation continuing for 130 sec after release...|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} of the onset of magnetospheric substorms is made by using ATS 5 energetic particles, conjugate balloon X rays and electric fields, all-sky camera photographs, and auroral-zone magnetograms. It is shown that plasma injection to ATS distances, conjugate 1 - to 10 -keV <b>auroral</b> <b>particle</b> precipitation, energetic electron precipitation, and enhancements of westward magnetospheric electric-field component all occur with the star of slowly developing negative magnetic bays. No trapped or precipitating energetic-particle features are seen at ATS 5 when later sharp negative magnetic-bay onsets occur at Churchill or Great Whale River...|$|R

40|$|Magnetospheric and auroral energy {{dissipation}} {{can be described}} in terms of electric fields and currents. It is suggested that the energy is created by an MHD generator in front of the magnetopause that derives its energy from the slowing down of the solar wind plasma. It drives a westward current in front of the eastward magnetopause surface current. The action of this generator is to produce and maintain the charge polarization that creates the dawn-to-dusk magnetospheric electric field. Various auroral phenomena are direct consequences of this electrostatic field. The source of <b>auroral</b> <b>particles</b> is magnetosheath plasma that enters the magnetotail by diffusion (violating Liouville's theorem) across the sharp boundaries of the cleft...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{phenomena}} {{associated with}} the interaction between <b>auroral</b> <b>particles</b> and electromagnetic fields, auroral energy flow, and the propagation of auroral effects to low altitudes are discussed in detail. It is concluded that energy deposition of soft auroral X-rays would be negligible at stratospheric altitudes. New data from incoherent backscatter measurements of neutral winds in the auroral region indicate a lack of correlation between stratospheric winds and winds in the auroral ionosphere. Magnetograms are used to show that sector boundary crossings with a time scale of approximately one hour (as opposed to the sector structure itself with a time scale of several days) do not couple effectively with the magnetosphere and are not significant energy inputs to it...|$|E
