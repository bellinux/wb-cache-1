40|$|The lay <b>judge</b> system, <b>a</b> quasi-jury system, was {{introduced}} in Japan from May 2009. This paper attempts to analyze Japanese people’s attitude about the lay judge system by examining whether they show a willingness to serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lay <b>judge.</b> The major findings from regression analysis are: (1) In general, people with a spouse inclined to adopt a negative attitude about serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lay <b>judge.</b> This tendency is, however, not observed in large cities. (2) Long-time residents and homeowners {{are more likely to}} have a negative attitude about serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lay <b>judge.</b> These results show that a tightly knitted interpersonal social network discourages people from serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lay <b>judge.</b> Because of the life time secrecy obligation and the penalty provisions for those who break this obligation, people with closer interpersonal ties are under greater pressure and strains, leading to larger psychological cost. The obligation and its penalty should be eased to improve people’s attitudes about serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lay <b>judge.</b> ...|$|R
