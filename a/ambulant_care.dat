40|$|Background The {{increasing}} number of acute but not emergency visits to Emergency Departments (ED) contributes to ED crowding. A sustainable solution needs deeper knowledge of patients’ subjective rationales to ED usage under this condition. Methods A qualitative {{study was conducted in}} two urban and one rural ED site to explore patients’ motives with acute but not emergency conditions. Additionally, General Practitioners (GP) were interviewed in rural region to complement data collection. Results Main motives to visit ED were a) time autonomy in case of time-constraints and b) health anxiety. Both motives address ED’s advantages, which are around the clock available and medical treatment at hospital level. Furthermore, GPs referred patients to ED in case of time-shortage or for diagnostic reasons (e. g. x-ray). Conclusion Patients seek medical care, where they expect to get the best suitable treatment. Therefore, EDs play a pivotal role not only in emergency care, but also in <b>ambulant</b> <b>care.</b> Patient orientated interventions need to focus on cross sectoral integrated health care structures...|$|E
40|$|People {{affected}} by Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis experience {{a high level}} of suffering. A new generation of anti-tumour necrosis factor-α agents can alleviate the burden of symptoms considerably. In order to develop a need-centred care programme for this patient group, we conducted problem-centred interviews with nine patients about their experience of the disease, the therapy and the quality of nursing care. The evaluation was based on qualitative content analysis. Patients' statements revealed three general categories: (1) "the never ending story" of a life with IBD, (2) "the sudden change" due to successful therapy and (3) "the narrow path" of a new stage of life: the disease no longer dominated daily life. The results emphasise the necessity of specific care for this patient group in order to perceptibly enhance their self-management and quality of life. The study illuminates a developing field of <b>ambulant</b> nursing <b>care,</b> based on the knowledge of patients' needs {{in the context of a}} chronic disease characterised by an unpredictable and irregular course...|$|R
40|$|While {{they are}} usually the first point of contact for {{individuals}} {{with all kinds of}} health related questions, knowledge about Swiss general practitioners’ (GPs) practice of communicating with patients, patients’ families and other healthcare professionals in <b>ambulant</b> palliative <b>care</b> settings is still fragmentary. This thesis sheds light on GPs’ ways of counselling patients in an important topic in palliative care, namely advance directives (ADs), while also focusing on physician-patient-communication regarding other sensitive topics such as assisted suicide. Further, this thesis illuminates GPs’ communication processes with patients’ families and other healthcare professionals. The topic of ADs was chosen as a special focus since they were found to be a particularly important tool in <b>ambulant</b> palliative <b>care</b> settings. As a legal document signed by a competent person they offer GPs, other healthcare professionals and patients’ families guidance for medical decisions in case the patient becomes incompetent. The focus on GPs’ ways of communication with family members and other healthcare professional was set since the quality of this communication was shown to be directly linked to the quality of care that can be provided in this setting. Four main research questions are structuring this thesis: 1) When and how do GPs initiate conversations about ADs? 2) What difficulties have arisen in the context of conversations regarding sensitive topics such as assisted suicide? 3) How and where does communication with the patient’s family fit in? 4) How do GPs communicate with other healthcare professionals and what are their perceptions of possible improvement or barriers? Answers given to these questions are based on the analysis of the qualitative data collected via semi-structured face-to-face interviews with GPs from the German, Italian and French speaking parts of Switzerland. As for the first research question, guidelines such as the guideline on communication in clinical practice from the Swiss Academies of Medical Sciences, often only cover the content but not the appropriate timing and initiating of ADs. Thus, results from our data show that participants have very individual, often unstructured ways and timings of approaching this matter with their patients. It was presented that GPs often link the matter of ADs to the thought of approaching death. Therefore, GPs often chose to address ADs accordingly to this link. Stated moments could be split into two main categories: the first category “before illness” served the purpose to avoid additional burden by not having to talk about death and dying when the patient is already facing a severe illness. The second category “after an illness became predominant” was stated to be chosen {{in order to ensure that}} patients’ stated preferences are up to date and robust. For the second research question, aiming at possible difficulties that can occur, GPs criticized the usage of pre-formulated templates for ADs with patients, stating that these forms often fail to express individual values. Standardized sentences, so the participants, cannot sufficiently illustrate a patient’s health and/or biographical background. Often these templates were said to contain broad or vague statements such as wanting to “maintain dignity” which participants stated as too general to provide a basis for individual treatment decisions. As an example, participants named the forgoing of an intervention when the patient's condition is “irreversible” or “terminal”. However, physicians often have trouble determining whether patients are in these states. Further, the theme of emotional discomfort emerged as a possible barrier. The latter not only occurred on the side of the participating GPs but also on the side of families and patients, potentially hindering effective communication. The integration of families, as addressed under the third research question, was shown to be often achieved through individual communicative approaches with GPs falling back on and individually adapting tools they know from inpatient family meeting settings. Concerning the fourth research question, the missing transparency and timeliness of information caused tension and barriers between GPs and specialists working in hospitals complicating the communication and collaboration between all stakeholders involved. Also the lack of accountability and the missing assignment of responsibility led to GPs’ perceptions of a rather unstructured and ineffective communication with specialists. In conclusion, the decision of when to address the topic of ADs is surely a matter of sensitivity which should be left to the GP. However, for research question 2) we suggest that existing guidelines be fully completed, also covering possible effects of the timing on ADs. For 3) a more structured approach of how tools from inpatient family meetings could be adapted to and used in <b>ambulant</b> palliative <b>care</b> could help to optimize the informing of families in this setting. In regards to 4) we conclude that currently existing infrastructures concerning the mutual communication between GPs and other stakeholders are in need of more transparency and better structured information pathways. Nevertheless, this is difficult to accomplish, as it is not the official responsibility of any party yet. Therefore, responsibilities regarding this matter need clarification in order to optimize communication and subsequently patient care. ...|$|R
40|$|Aim: In view of {{increasing}} concern about a two-class {{system in the}} German health care sector, this study investigates the relevance of health insurance schemes and other socioeconomic characteristics {{to the level of}} specialist health care provision. Subjects and Methods: Referring to Ronald M. Andersen’s model of health care utilization and more content-based approaches, we implement a negative binomial hurdle regression to estimate the number of specialist visits within the last 12  months. Our data source is the German sample of the first wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in 2004. Results: The results show that men’s number of specialist visits is markedly sensitive to predisposing and enabling factors, whereas women’s health care utilization depends less on such socioeconomic characteristics. With reference to previous findings concerning general practitioner consultation, the assumption of a bipolar health care system providing general practitioner care primarily to the statutory insured and specialist care to the privately insured is supported empirically as to men. Education, which is considered to be highly correlated with health lifestyles, has a positive effect on medical health care. Every additional year of education increases by about 10 % the probability of men seeking specialist consultation. Furthermore, the results indicate an unfavorable situation for the self-employed concerning health care because of their specific employment situation and health insurance coverage. Discussion: The research results suggest the existence of relevant differences in the amount of specialist consultation according to health insurance and other socioeconomic features. Further research could concentrate {{on the question of whether}} these inequalities in utilization levels indicate overprovision or underprovision of <b>ambulant</b> health <b>care.</b> Moreover, we recommend longitudinal research that is particularly suited to detangle age and cohort effects...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 15 years the Fast Track Concept or Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) as a {{clinical}} pathway for improving perioperative care, maintaining physiological functions, reducing intraoperative stress and shortening {{the length of}} hospital stay, has become more common in colorectal surgery. After first promising results in prospective studies an expert group developed recommendations of a modified, multimodal Fast Track Concept in 2009. Main elements in this concept are laparoscopy, no nasogastric tubes, perioperative peridural anaesthesia and quick mobilisation of the patient after surgery. A metaanalysis in 2011 based on the Cochrane database showed, that in most studies regarding Fast Track Surgery, the authors have not strictly followed {{the recommendations of the}} expert group. Further studies with better quality and strict adaption on the multimodal principles of Fast Track Surgery are needed to gain more evidence. Furthermore the Fast Track Concept constitutes a challenge for the interdisciplinary collaboration of all involved treatment groups. Especially the postoperative outpatient treatment remains a problem due to unavailable rehabilitation capacities or <b>ambulant</b> <b>care.</b> Therefore a proper preoperative planning of the Fast Track Concept and the outpatient care should be performed interdisciplinary by the surgeons and the general practitioners...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the potential of}} deliberately light interpersonal touch (IPT) for reducing excessive head and trunk sway during self-paced walking {{in children and adolescents}} with cerebral palsy (CP). DESIGN: Quasi-experimental, proof-of-concept study with between-groups comparison. SETTING: <b>Ambulant</b> <b>care</b> facility, community center. PARTICIPANTS: 26 individuals with CP (spastic and ataxic; GMFCS I-III; mean= 9. 8 y; f= 11, m= 15) and in 39 typically developed (TD) children and adolescents (mean= 10. 0 y; f= 23, m= 16). INTERVENTIONS: ipt applied by a therapist to locations at the back and the head. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: As primary outcomes head and trunk sway during self-paced walking were assessed by inertial measurement units. Secondary outcomes were average step length and gait speed. RESULTS: CP group: apex and occiput IPT reduced head velocity sway compared to thoracic IPT (both p= 0. 04) irrespective of individuals' specific clinical symptoms. TD group: all testing conditions reduced head velocity sway compared to walking alone (all p≤ 0. 03) as well as in apex and occiput IPT compared to paired walking (both p≤ 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Deliberately light IPT at the apex of the head alters control of head sway in children and adolescents with CP. The effect of IPT varies as a function of contact location and acts differently in TD individuals...|$|E
40|$|The demographic, {{technological}} and economic changes in Germany require a profound {{reform of the}} health care system, especially concerning the ambulant medical care. For many years too strict legal regulations prohibited the development of adequate care structures; the major reform of 2004 has introduced new tools to be used by “entrepreneurial doctors”; however, these tools are still in their experimental phase. The changing demands include an increasing specialization of the ambulant medical care, lack of data and thus knowledge exchange between different doctors treating the same patient, and its insufficient cost effectiveness. In some regions of Germany there is also an alarming shortage of doctors and medical care. Another challenge lies in the increase and therefore growing impact of chronic diseases. This article focuses on the weaknesses and challenges that public health professionals are facing in Germany today. One way of matching the diverse needs is to establish ambulatory health care centres and thereby to locally concentrate interdisciplinary expertise. The main objective of these policlinics is to create patient-oriented structures and to ensure flexibility and economic efficiency of integrated care as well as substainability within the health sector. <b>Ambulant</b> <b>care,</b> hospital treatment, integrated care, health economics, health policies, health management, health care system analysis, policlinic...|$|E
40|$|HIV/AIDS is characterised {{by a high}} {{morbidity}} and mortality. Migrants {{are considered to be}} an important group in terms of the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in Germany, and are assumed to be underrepresented within German medical care institutions specialised in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. Culturally differing subjective concepts of illness and therewith differing interpretations of symptoms, language barriers, material and legal restrictions as well as direct effects of the migration process itself are considered as general entry barriers to the health care system for migrants. The study addressed the extent, the conditions and the quality of <b>ambulant</b> medical <b>care</b> for HIV-positive migrants in Berlin, taking into account psychological models of intercultural interaction in the scope of medical care for HIV. As basis, an epidemiological analysis of the statutory reports of newly diagnosed HIV-infections in Germany between 2001 and 2012 was conducted. Using standardised questionnaires practices of standard medical care in Berlin (N 1 = 841) as well as practices specialised in the treatment of HIV/AIDS in Berlin (N 2 = 28) were surveyed for data on the state of medical care of their HIV-positive migrant clients, on the kind and extent of intercultural competences given at the practices, on communication and interaction with HIV-positive patients, on the subjective concepts of illness of the treated migrants as well as on specific needs of medical care for HIV-positive migrants. An “intercultural index” (5 subscales) was newly designed to evaluate intercultural competences given at the practices. Complementing four interviews were conducted with experts working in medical care, legal as well as psychosocial counselling of HIV-positive migrants. HIV-positive migrants constituted a relevant proportion (30 %) of newly diagnosed HIV-infections in Germany. Most frequent region of origin of non-German persons was Subsaharan Africa, with differences by gender. 39 % of newly diagnosed HIV-infections of persons originating from outside Germany were acquired in Germany. Practices of standard medical care were not relevant as treating institutions for HIV-positive migrants. 17 / 25 of the practices specialised in treatment of HIV/AIDS cared for a total of 909 HIV-positive migrants, of those 80 % men. 12 % of HIV-positive migrants had no health insurance, 9 % had no regular residence permit. 67 % of HIV-positive migrants were treated by specialised practices having very high or high intercultural competences. Practices of standard medical care achieved worse scores generally. The analysis of communicational barriers in the scope of medical treatment of HIV-positive migrants showed the highest difficulties regarding differences in social classes of patient and doctor, lacking language competences as well as cultural differences. The course of treatment of HIV-positive migrants having German language skills was reported as nearly equal to those of nonmigrant HIV-patients. Those of migrants without German language skills were reported as slightly worse. On basis of the study data and the psychological model of adaptive oscillation of Demorgon and Molz, a model for successful intercultural interaction in the context of medical care for HIV-positive migrants under the conditions of the German health care system could be developed...|$|R

We aimed to determine items of importance for the antibiotic prescribing decision and to make them operational for an intervention trial. Methods A postal questionnaire based upon focus group findings was sent to 316 Flemish general practitioners (GPs). On a verbal rating scale the GPs scored to what extent they consider the questionnaire items in decision making in case of suspected RTI in a coughing patient and how strongly the items support or counter antibiotic treatment. Factor analysis was used to condense the data. The relative importance of the yielded operational factors was assessed using Wilcoxon Matched Pairs test. Results 59. 5 % completed the study. Response group characteristics (mean age: 42. 8 years; 65. 9 % men) approximated that of all Flemish GPs.

40|$|Family {{physicians}} (FPs) play a {{key role}} in the treatment and care for terminally ill men and women. However, little is known about the conditions and challenges of FPs services in this domain. Aim of this article is to identify, how FPs can be supported in palliative home care in Switzerland by the availability of guidelines and advance directives, community-based palliative care structures, education and training, as well as remuneration of palliative home care services. Case studies in three Swiss cantons, namely Lucerne (LU), Vaud (VD), and Ticino (TI) are the basis of the following investigation. They not only represent French, Italian and German language regions but differ considerably with respect to the history of palliative care. Within and between cantons documents, questionnaires and expert interviews are analyzed thematically with the help of content-analysis. The results illustrate considerable shortcomings with respect to the backing of FPs palliative home care services. The availability and use of guidelines as well as advance directives is rather small in general practice, and FPs care and treatment at the end of life is only marginally supported by <b>ambulant</b> <b>care</b> structures, especially in rural areas. Also the coordination of services and collaboration between specialists and generalists is poorly developed.

40|$|Original title: De jeugd een zorg. Youth care {{services}} {{are going through}} major changes. This has created {{a need for a}} better insight into the demand that is likely to be placed on these services in the future at both national and regional level. This report suggests that the use of <b>ambulant</b> <b>care</b> will rise sharply on a year by year basis. Nursing care is also forecast to increase slightly, but the use of daycare and residential {{care services}} is expected to show a slight fall. An analysis which takes into account the waiting lists for services produces comparable growth figures. The estimates in this report are based partly on determinants of use (age, sex, number of single-parent families and number of young members of ethnic minorities) and partly on trends. Recent trends are seen primarily {{as a result of a}} catching-up exercise due to the arrival of a new group of users; in time, the growth rate will return to its usual levels. The allocation model based on a study of children and parents calculates risk scores which give an indication of educational and upbringing problems. Five significant risk factors are identified for a problematic youth situation. At the level of the child, it is mainly boys and children in the lower echelons of the education system who are at greater risk of developing educational and upbringing problems, while at family level this applies for children from single-parent families, families of non-Western origin and families with a low income...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: In this paper, {{we aim to}} {{test the}} {{long-term}} benefit of an integrative reactivation and rehabilitation (IRR) program compared to usual care in terms of improved psychogeriatric patients on multiple psychiatric symptoms (MPS) and of caregivers on burden and competence. Improvement was defined as > 30 % improvement (≥ a half standard deviation) compared to baseline. Methods: We used the following outcome variables: difference {{in the number of}} improved patients on MPS (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI) and improved caregivers on burden (Caregiver Burden, CB) and competence (Caregiver Competence List, CCL). Assessments were taken after intake (T 1) and after six months of follow-up (T 3). Risk ratios (RR), number needed to treat (NNT), and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. Results: IRR had a significant positive effect on NPI-cluster hyperactivity (RR 2. 64; 95 % CI: 1. 26 - 5. 53; NNT 4. 07). In the complete cases analysis, IRR showed significant ORs of 2. 80 on the number of NPI symptoms and 3. 46 on the NPI-sum-severity; up to 76 % improved patients. For caregivers, competence was a significant beneficiary in IRR (RR 2. 23; 95 % CI: 1. 07 - 4. 62; NNT 5. 07). In the complete cases analysis, the ORs were significantly in favor of IRR on general burden and competence (ORs range: 2. 40 - 4. 18), with up to 71 % improved caregivers.

40|$|Healthcare is a {{key sector}} in society as it affects everyone’s life {{at some point in}} time. At the same time, the Western world is {{entering}} a profound ‘age wave’, leading to increased demand for healthcare service and alternative living arrangements for those in need of assistance in their daily lives. As a result of the challenges in this ageing society, healthcare – particularly service providers in elderly care – have to undertake transformational changes in their core concepts, structures, strategies, and policies in order to effectively serve this customer group. Recent market research suggests that innovation and technology will play a major role enabling healthcare organizations to successfully manage the care of ageing population. Health informatics, telemedicine technologies and remote monitoring systems may provide effective means to help the elderly manage illness. In unison, such technologies potentially ease the strain that the latter put on families in particular and the healthcare system in general. Thus, technology may provide a valuable addition to support the elderly in healthcare service. Healthcare is as a high emotion service, as it often involves intense feelings even before the service commences (Berry, Davis, Wilmet, 2015). Such feelings may emanate from a lack of familiarity with the delivered service or from a lack of control over the outcome of the service (Berry et al., 2015). Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} elderly patients’ needs and to move beyond token gestures (e. g., added amenities and updated room décor) to the patient experience. This study aims to extend our present knowledge on elderly patients’ healthcare experience and the role of technology and people in improving it. The healthcare sector is a fertile area for service research given its extensive growth (Berry & Bendapudi, 2007). However, to date service and experience focused research in this domain is rather limited. This study contributes to the present body of knowledge in the service literature with the aim to provide a better understanding of how technology can support and enhance the healthcare experience for the elderly. Three research questions guide our investigation: RQ 1 : How can technology enhance the healthcare service experience in the elderly home care context? RQ 2 : What is the role of other involved actors (i. e., formal service providers such as healthcare professionals, and informal service providers, such as patients’ family members) in enhancing the healthcare service experience in the elderly home care context? RQ 3 : What is the role of ‘technology’ versus ‘people’ in terms of the key contributors of the healthcare service experience? What are complementarities and conflicts? This study focuses on technology adoption by the elderly; it is possible that the elderly may exhibit less technology readiness, posing a barrier to a positive service experience. However, the use of technology may provide independence and personal autonomy to the elderly (Miskelly, 2001). The service experience of elderly who utilize healthcare assistance technology in the healthcare will be examined in an elderly <b>ambulant</b> <b>care</b> setting in Flanders, Belgium. Flemish <b>ambulant</b> <b>care</b> refers to home care and home nursing, which includes a range of services, such as personal care, housekeeping, and cleaning help. In recent years, the organizational context and complexity of care provided in home nursing has changed. Integrated services for home care are available and home nurses participate in shared care in collaboration with hospitals. This study focuses on the experience of elderly patients who receive integrated services from home care and the broader service context (e. g., from patient’s family members). Specifically, the use of technological applications in this setting will be explored. Our research is structured as follows. The study commences with a detailed review and synthesis of the current literature, providing a state-of-the-art overview on the healthcare service experience and related technologies. In a second step, the role of technology in elderly care is investigated by means of a multimethod investigation, comprising expert interviews and surveys, in the elderly homecare context in Belgium. Expected contribution This paper addresses a key research priority, improving well-being through transformative service. More specifically, the role of technology-enabled services in improving the well-being for vulnerable customers, such as the elderly, is explored (Ostrom, Parasuraman et al., 2015). In particular, this paper focuses on the call for a better understanding of how technology may support the service experience and the role of emotions of other actors involved in the experience (Jaakkola, Helkkula et al., 2015). We provide managers guidance in how to consider and use technology in an elderly care setting, while taking into account technology readiness levels of the elderly. References: Berry, L.

40|$|The Public health {{insurance}} {{system in the}} Czech Republic was established more than 20 years ago. During this period, the public {{health insurance}} system has gone through many transformations. A lot of reform proposals have been submitted {{with the aim of}} keeping the increase of healthcare expenses under control but simultaneously not limiting the quality and the accessibility of healthcare. The introduction of the regulatory fees {{was a part of the}} healthcare reformation and its purpose was to reduce the demand for healthcare and thus regulate the consumption of health services. Secondarily, the regulatory fees should bring private funds into healthcare system. In the theoretical part of the research, the author describes healthcare systems of several European countries mainly from the point of view of cost sharing by patients. The funding of healthcare in the Czech Republic is then evaluated in more detail. The research characterises all the types of regulatory fees including all the legal changes they have undergone prior to their implementation. The author summarizes the amounts of funds received from the different types of fees which patients have paid since the introduction of regulatory fees in 2012 on the basis of data received from health insurance companies. In the practical part of the research, the author analyses and statistically processes data which were taken from one specific bureau of employee health insurance company. On the basis of this data, the author maps the development of average visits of healthcare institutions per patient in the chosen fields of <b>ambulant</b> <b>care</b> specializations. The author compares the number of average visits in 2007, which is the year before the introduction of regulatory fees, with the number of average visits after the regulations implementation that means during the 2008 - 2013 period. The aim was to discover whether the fees had any effect on the amount of healthcare services and whether they led to decrease in the number of patients´ visits (at the doctor). The development of the number of patients´ visits was studied in 22 different fields of ambulatory specialization in total. The collected results have been statistically processed using one sample, one-tailed T test. Furthermore, the influence of fees on the healthcare expenses was surveyed in the respective ambulatory fields. In the similar manner as with the patients´ visits, the author compares the average expenses per one patient before the introduction of regulatory fees in 2007 with the average value after the implementation of regulatory fees to the healthcare system. The research offers a comprehensive overview of these issues and can be used as a basic material for further research about regulatory fees and patient cost sharing in healthcare...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} dealing with the impact of the Regulation fees cancelation on demand of Ambulant healthcare. The introductory part of theoretical thesis is describing the development of health care in regards to various financial models within the medical environment. At the beginning of this thesis, all known health care financial models are named and described in the worldwide scope. After the initial description, the bachelor thesis focuses on specific models and their development during the important stages from {{the second half of the}} 19 th century until current era of the Czech Republic. The current health care system in the Czech Republic is based on public services and financed mainly from public sources. The health care system has multiple sources that help sustain it financially. The prevalent form is indirect financing, specifically the mandatory health insurance. Health care financing has gone through important developments that should not be forgotten. Furthermore, the theoretical part of the thesis also contains a detailed description of regulatory fees. It shows different types and functionalities of regulatory fees since their implementation by the law number 261 / 2007 (stabilizing of public budgets), until their cancellation on January 1 st, 2015. The regulation fee was implemented by the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic in efforts to solve the increasing deficit of the state budget, and increase the efficiency of the health care system.) The income increase, caused by regulation fees, should serve as a starting point in an era of modernizing of medical facilities and maintaining the overall quality of health care for patients. In the scientific part of the thesis, the main scope and the two types of research are being set. The quantitative research is aimed on a group of patients. The hypotheses of the research are as follows. Hypothesis number 1 : The cancellation of regulatory fees leads to the increase in demand of a specialized <b>ambulant</b> <b>care.</b> Hypothesis number 2 : The cancellation of regulatory fees for a prescription leads to a higher demand of prescribed medication. A questionnaire was used to determine the results of the research, which will either confirm or deny the presented hypotheses. The method used to receive the results was a frequency analysis that was completed by a statistician. The secondary, qualitative, research is deliberately used to ensure the accuracy of the completed and compared data. This research, which was run simultaneously with the quantitative one, targeted a group of health care professionals, specifically medical doctors. The data collected in the form of a structuralized set of interviews were used to be analyzed as a key to answer the research questions: Research question number 1 : After cancellation of the regulatory fees, was there an increase in the amount of visits of patients with a specific health care provider? Research question number 2 : Does the health care demand need to be regulated? Based on the research displayed within the thesis, it is possible to predicate: The questionnaire method lead to a confirmation of hypothesis number 1 and also to the conclusion that the cancellation of 30 CZK fee lead to an increase in demand of health care services. The research question number 1 also confirms that after the 30 CZK fee cancellation there was an increase in patient visits of health care facilities. The results are contradicting the findings within the hypothesis number 2, as there was no higher demand in prescribed medication after the regulation fee for medication was cancelled. The comparison of the data that was collected through both types of the research does not prove a direct connection in the increased demand of patients for medicinal drug prescription after the 30 CZK regulation fee cancellation. We can safely state in regards of the research question number number 2 that regulation of health care is a necessity...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The acute abdomen is {{the main}} term for an at first unclear {{emergency}} situation of the abdominal cavity. The acute abdomen belongs to {{the three most important}} reasons for the admission of patients into the emergency room. Further, this illness ranks 40 % of all consultations in the <b>ambulant</b> <b>care</b> sector. The acute abdomen requires an early and direct diagnosis because of its potential of having a life threatening differential diagnosis. This HTA report aimed to assess the ultrasound diagnosis of the acute abdomen considering children and adults. This will be done from a medical and economic perspective. The differential diagnosis respectively the cause of the acute abdomen binds high direct treatment costs, especially in the stationary sector. Ultrasound diagnosis is a procedure that plays a big part in the differential diagnosis process and it is widely used in practise. Other research methods of diagnosing acute abdominal illness are: clinical examinations with inspection and palpation, surgical exploration and laparocopy as well as computer tomography and x-ray examination. Objectives: The main objective of this HTA report is to assess what significance sonography should have within the examination strategy of the acute abdomen from the medical and economical view. Second, this HTA report will evaluate under which circumstances the ultrasonographic diagnosis of the acute abdomen, considering medical and economical quality classifications, is the alternative of choice to comparable diagnostic measures. Methods: The target population this HTA report is aimed at are children and adults with acute abdomen or embedded differential diagnosis. A systematic literature search was conducted covering all relevant medical and HTA-databases. Furthermore, handsearch was conducted inside of the known data bases of HTA-institutions as well as from medical and economical journals. The following databases were searched in cooperation with DIMDI to identify relevant literature: Biosis-Previews (BA 93), Biotechnobase (ET 80), Cab-Health (AZ 72), Elsevier Biobase (EB 94), EMBASE (EM 74), Embase Alert (EA 08), Ethmed (ED 93), Euroethics (EU 93), Gerolit (GE 79), Heclinet (HN 69), IHTA (HT 83), IPA (IA 70), MEDLINE (ME 90, Medline Alert (MEOA) and SciSearch (IS 74). The search parameters were orientated by the embedded differential diagnosis’s as well as diagnostic measures considering the acute abdomen. The bibliographic search covered the period from 1990 to 2003. The relevant languages are English, German in connection to French. The evaluation of the information has been graduated. It must be clear that the abstract follows the topic of the acute abdomen. The as such identified literature will be structured by its methodological quality and relevance. This will be analysed and later valued after {{it is clear that the}} minimum requirements are met. Results: The identified and assessed primary studies, reviews and metaanalytic studies demonstrated the medical effectiveness as well as the economical efficiency of the sonographical diagnosis for individual questions or indications. The evaluated papers of the target population ‘children’ demonstrated that sonography resp. ultrasound as the basic examination is recommended for children with acute abdominal pain. Discussion: The identified studies have not used an extensive setting of the ultrasound diagnosis of the acute abdomen. Instead they focus only on small sections, orientated on certain indications. Blinded medical studies have not been identified. Also, there is no health-economics study that evaluated the diagnostic measures by comparing all available technologies. Altogether, the identified and assessed publications show that sonography is an alternative of choice considering particular questions in comparison to other diagnostic measures of analyzing the acute abdomen. A general deflected dominance from the sonography facing the computer tomography for instance can not be seen as the result of this structured review of the published literature. Conclusion: During a structured examination strategy, e. g. guidelines, sonography of children has become the diagnostic method of choice. Taking up sonography as a primary diagnostic evaluation into the guidelines of the analysis of the considered literature is recommended. The usage of already existing ultrasound systems is also recommended. Seeing that existing publications of this subject are scarce, it is not possible to prognose the economical effects of an obligatory primary sonographical diagnostic...|$|E
