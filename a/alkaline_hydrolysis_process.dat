40|$|AbstractAlkaline {{hydrolysis}} {{represents a}} relatively new animal carcass disposal technology. It uses alkali, high temperature and high pressure to catalyze the hydrolysis of biological materials into a sterile aqueous solution and bone residues. The purpose of this work {{is to provide a}} complete study of the influence of operational parameters on <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>process</b> and to find an optimal combination of factors that maximize the disposal efficiency. In order to determine the optimal combination of the four factors viz. treatment time, temperature, the concentration of alkali solution and the ratio of alkali and tissue, single-factor and orthogonal experiments were used. The orthogonal experimental design included four variables (three levels) in L 9 orthogonal array. Results showed that four factors all significantly (P < 0. 01) increased the efficiency of alkaline hydrolysis. The order of significance decreased from temperature, alkali concentration, the ratio of alkali and tissue to treatment time. Optimum process conditions were found to be as follows: treatment time, 180 min; temperature, 150 °C; the concentration of alkali solution, 5 % and the ratio of alkali and tissue, 3 mL/g. The optimum conditions was validated and proven to be reliable for achieving the complete hydrolysis of different animal tissues and the inactivation of Bacillus stearothermophilus. This study provides a biosafety disposal method of infected animal tissues and be useful to establish effective process conditions of alkaline hydrolysis...|$|E

5000|$|Sodium or {{potassium}} hydroxide {{can be used}} to digest tissues of animal carcasses or deceased humans. Often referred to as <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis,</b> the <b>process</b> involves placing the carcass or body into a sealed chamber, adding a mixture of lye and water and the application of heat to accelerate the process. After several hours the chamber will contain a liquid with coffee-like appearance, and the only solid that remains are very fragile bone hulls of mostly calcium phosphate, which can be mechanically crushed to a fine powder with very little force. Sodium hydroxide is frequently used in the process of decomposing roadkill dumped in landfills by animal disposal contractors. [...] Due to its low cost and availability, it has been used to dispose of corpses by criminals. Italian serial killer Leonarda Cianciulli used this chemical to turn dead bodies into soap. In Mexico, a man who worked for drug cartels admitted to having disposed of more than 300 bodies with it.|$|R
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease, and scrapie pose serious risks to human and animal health due {{to a host of}} disease-specific factors, including the resistance of infectious prions (PrPSc) to natural degradation and to most commercial inactivation procedures. In an attempt to address this concern, a mouse model was used to compare the efficacy of an <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>process</b> with a simulated continuous-flow rendering treatment for disposal of PrPSc-infected biological material. Female C 57 /BL 6 mice (N = 120) were randomly divided into 4 treatment groups (n = 30), and each mouse was injected intraperitoneally with their designated treatment inoculum. Treatment groups 1 and 2 served as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Group 3 was inoculated with rendered scrapie-positive mouse brain material to investigate the effectiveness of simulated continuous-flow rendering practices to reduce or eliminate PrPSc. Group 4 was inoculated with hydrolyzed scrapie-positive mouse brain material to determine the sterilizing effect of alkaline hydrolysis on PrPSc. Mice were monitored for overt signs of disease, and those showing clinical signs were killed to prevent undue suffering. Brains were obtained from all mice that died (or were killed) and analyzed with an ELISA for the presence of PrPSc. Results indicated that the simulated continuous-flow rendering treatment used for preparing the rendering treatment group inoculum failed to completely eliminate PrPSc. Rendering delayed, but did not stop, clinical mouse-adapted scrapie transmission. Compared with positive controls, the rendering treatment group experienced an approximate 45 -d average delay in days to death (250 vs. 205 d for positive controls; P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and a death loss of 73. 9...|$|E
40|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{energetic}} materials {{which have been}} accumulated {{over the years in}} various manufacturing and military installations must be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Historically, the method of choice for destruction of obsolete or aging energetic materials has been open burning or open detonation (OB/OD). This destruction approach has become undesirable due to air pollution problems. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} new technologies which will effectively and economically deal with the disposal of energetic materials. Along those lines, we have investigated a chemical/biological process for the safe destruction and disposal of a double base solid rocket propellant (AHH), which was used in several 8 inch projectile systems. The solid propellant is made of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin as energetic components, two lead salts which act as ballistic modifiers, triacetin as a plasticizer and 2 -Nitrodiphenylamine (2 -NDPA) as a stabilizer. A process train is being developed to convert the organic components of the propellant to biodegradable products and remove the lead from the process stream. The solid propellant is first hydrolyzed through an enhanced <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>process</b> step. Following lead removal and neutralization, the digested liquor rich in nitrates and nitrites is found to be easily biodegradable. The digestion rate of the intact ground propellant as well as the release of nitrite and nitrate groups were substantially increased when ultrasound were supplied to the alkaline reaction medium compared to the conventional alkaline hydrolysis. The effects of reaction time, temperature, sodium hydroxide concentration and other relevant parameters on the digestion efficiency and biodegradability have been studied. The present work indicates that the AHH propellant can be disposed of safely with a combination of physiochemical and biological processes...|$|E

40|$|In this work, we {{successfully}} extracted cellulose microfibrils from ficus leaves adopting the acidchlorite, <b>alkaline</b> and acid <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>process.</b> Chemical analysis, {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic studies, wide angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the extracted fibers and cellulose microfibrils from ficus leaves. The chemical analysis results revealed an increase in -cellulose content and decrease in lignin and hemicelluloses for the cellulose microfibrils over raw fibers. The FTIR and NMR spectroscopic studies indicated that the extractives, lignin and hemicellulose were removed extensively from the raw fibers during extraction of cellulose microfibrils. Crystallinity determined by Wide angle X-ray diffraction method and the studies reveal that extracted cellulose microfibrils were more crystalline than the raw fibers. The extracted cellulose microfibrils obtained from raw fibers had good thermal stability.

40|$|A {{study of}} both the steric and kinetic effects of the t-butyl {{substituent}} at phosphorus in phosphonium salts and thiophosphoiyl compounds has been made. In phosphonium salts one t-butyl substituent {{was found to have}} a relatively small effect on the rate of <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis,</b> whereas two t-butyl substituents completely inhibited attack at phosphorus and decomposition to olefin and phosphine became preferred over the normal decomposition to hydrocarbon and phosphine oxide. The reasons for the differing effects of one and two t-butyl substituents are discussed. With one t-butyl group nucleo- philic attack could occur with little difficulty opposite the t-butyl substituent to give an intermediate in which the t-butyl group occupied an apical position, whereas with two t-butyl groups attack must necessarily occur adjacent to one t-butyl group, a process which is greatly sterically hindered. The steric consequences of this explanation are profound. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of optically active benzyl- t-butylmethylphenylphosphonium iodide was found to proceed with predominant retention of configuration, instead of the usually observed inversion, and migration of a t-butyl group, presumably from an apical position in the intermediate, was observed in the <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of t-butyl- iodomethyldiphenylphosphonium iodide. Steric crowding at phosphorus was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the product distribution in the <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of a series of phosphonium salts. The kinetics of <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of the cyclic analogues of the t-butyl salts have been investigated, the rapid rates of <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> being due to relief of ring strain on formation of the intermediate. The <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of optically active O-methyl t-butylphenylphosphinothioate was found to proceed with complete retention of configuration at phosphorus. This stereochemical result was found by studies to be due to predominant C-O bond cleavage rather than to the effect of the t-butyl substituent. Other attempts to elucidate the stereochemistry of substitution at a thiophosphoryl centre bearing a t-butyl substituent were unsuccessful because of the resistance of these compounds to nucleophilic substitution...|$|R

Leaching of energetic compounds such as hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -trinitro- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (RDX) and octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocine (HMX) from these UXOs may cause adverse ecological effects so that the long-term fate of these chemicals in the sea should be known. The present study assesses the contribution of <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> into the natural attenuation of RDX and HMX in coastal waters. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> rates were shown to be unaffected by the presence of sodium chloride, the most common component in marine waters. Kinetic parameters (E(a), ln A, k(2)) quantified for the <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of RDX and HMX in deionized water (30 - 50 degrees C, pH 10 - 12) agreed relatively well with abiotic degradation rates determined in sterilized natural coastal waters (50 and 60 degrees C, variable salinity) even if the latter were generally slightly faster than the former. Furthermore, similar products (HCHO, NO(2) (-), O(2) NNHCH(2) NHCHO) were obtained on <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> in deionized water and abiotic degradation in coastal waters. These two findings suggested that degradation of nitramines in sterilized natural coastal waters, away from light, was mainly governed by <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> Kinetic calculations using the present parameters showed that <b>alkaline</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of RDX and HMX in marine waters at 10 degrees C would respectively take 112 +/- 10 and 2408 +/- 217 yr to be completed (99. 0 %).
