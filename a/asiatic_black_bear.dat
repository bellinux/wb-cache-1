25|$|The first living related renal {{transplant}} {{was performed}} in China in 1972; the first allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was successfully executed in an acute leukaemia patient. The first recorded clinical liver transplant from a living donor in China took place in 1995, seven years after the world's first {{was performed in}} Sao Paulo, Brazil. Between January 2001 and October 2003, 45 patients received living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) at five different hospitals. In 2002, doctors at Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University described three cases of living related liver transplantation. In 2003 a landmark brain-death case involving switched off ventilation {{came to the attention}} of the public and made a big impact on medical ethics and legislation. The first successful brain-death organ donation soon followed. From October 2003 to July 2006, 52 LDLT operations were conducted at the West China Hospital, West China Medical Center of Sichuan University. In October 2004, Peking University People's Hospital Liver Transplantation Center executed two cases of living related liver transplantation involving complex blood vessel anatomy. In 2002, the Chinese media reported surgeon Dr Zheng Wei successfully transplanted a whole ovary at the Zhejiang Medical Science University to a 34-year-old patient, Tang Fangfang, from her sister. In April 2006, the Xijing military hospital in Xian carried out a face transplant operation covering the cheek, upper lip, and nose of Li Guoxing, who was mauled by an <b>Asiatic</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> while protecting his sheep.|$|E

25|$|Tigers will {{occasionally}} prey {{on black}} bears. Russian hunters may occasionally find black bear carcasses showing evidence of tiger predation, and their remains may occur in tiger scats. If {{they manage to}} escape a tiger, black bears will attempt to rush up a tree {{and wait for the}} tiger to leave, though some tigers will pretend to leave, and wait for the bear to descend. One Manchurian tiger was reported to have lured an <b>Asiatic</b> <b>black</b> <b>bear</b> by imitating the species' mating call. Tigers regularly prey on young bears but adult bears are occasionally taken as well. Black bears are usually safe from tiger attacks once they reach five years of age. Although black bears prefer to avoid tigers, they can be extremely tenacious when attacked: Jim Corbett observed a fight between a tiger and the largest black bear he had ever seen, which resulted in the bear managing to chase off the tiger, despite having half its nose and scalp torn off. However, black bears may be less vulnerable than brown bears to tiger predation, due to their habit of living in hollows or in close set rocks, thus making them harder to pursue. At least one fatal attack on a juvenile bear has been recorded in Jigme Dorji National Park, as Bhutan's tiger populations have begun to colonise higher altitude areas. Black bears may steal tiger kills: Jim Corbett twice saw black bears carry off tiger kills when the latter was absent.|$|E
500|$|A decade later, a New York Times {{reporter}} {{visiting the}} zoo noted that [...] "...an <b>Asiatic</b> <b>Black</b> <b>Bear</b> {{lay on a}} rock {{a short distance from}} a guard rail. A shattered wine bottle, a cracked stick, and a number of empty beer cans were strewn about the ground a few feet in front of him. 'How many times have I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' said John Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'" [...] Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the [...] "10 worst" [...] zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. A fatal accident of an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility.|$|E

Asiatic black bears are mainly distributed in the conifer forests in the cold and temperate zones of northeast China, the main areas being Chang Bai, Zhang Guangcai, Lao Ye, and the Lesser Xingan Mountains. Within Liaoning province, there are about 100 black bears, which only inhabit the five counties of Xin Bin, Huan Ren, Ben Xi, Kuan Dian, and Fen Cheng. Within Jilin province, black bears occur mainly in the counties of Hunchun, Dun Hua, Wangqing, An Tu, Chang Bai, Fu Song, Jiao He, Hua Dian, Pan Shi, and Shu Lan. In Heilongjiang province, Asiatic black bears occur in the counties of Ning An, BaYan, Wu Chang, Tong He, Bao Qing, Fu Yuan, Yi Chun, Tao Shan, Lan Xi, Tie Li, Sun Wu, Ai Hui, De Du, Bei An, and Nen Jiang.

40|$|Enterocytozoon bieneusi is an obligate {{eukaryotic}} {{intracellular parasite}} that infects {{a wide variety}} of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Although considerable research has been conducted on this organism, relatively little information is available on the occurrence of E. bieneusi in captive <b>Asiatic</b> <b>black</b> <b>bears.</b> The present study was performed to determine the prevalence, genetic diversity, and zoonotic potential of E. bieneusi in captive <b>Asiatic</b> <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> in zoos in southwestern China. Fecal specimens from <b>Asiatic</b> <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> in four zoos, located in four different cities, were collected and analyzed for the prevalence of E. bieneusi. The average prevalence of E. bieneusi was 27. 4 % (29 / 106), with the highest prevalence in Guiyang Zoo (36. 4 %, 16 / 44). Altogether, five genotypes of E. bieneusi were identified among the 29 E. bieneusi-positive samples, including three known genotypes (CHB 1, SC 02, and horse 2) and two novel genotypes named ABB 1 and ABB 2. Multi-locus sequence typing using three microsatellites (MS 1, MS 3, and MS 7) and one minisatellite (MS 4) revealed V, III, V, and IV genotypes at these four loci, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genotypes SC 02 and ABB 2 were clustered into group 1 of zoonotic potential, the genotypes CHB 1 and ABB 1 were clustered into a new group, and the genotype horse 2 was clustered into group 6 of unclear zoonotic potential. In conclusion, this study identified two novel E. bieneusi genotypes in captive <b>Asiatic</b> <b>black</b> <b>bears,</b> and used microsatellite and minisatellite markers to reveal E. bieneusi genetic diversity. Moreover, our findings show that genotypes SC 02 (identified in humans) and ABB 2 belong to group 1 with zoonotic potential, suggesting the risk of transmission of E. bieneusi from <b>Asiatic</b> <b>black</b> <b>bears</b> to humans and other animals...|$|R
