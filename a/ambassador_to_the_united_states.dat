5|$|By 1949, the CIA {{claimed that}} Jevđević's {{intelligence}} material {{was being used}} by the Italian Ministry of Interior, the United States Counterintelligence Corps, British Forensic Science Service in Trieste, and French intelligence services in Rome and Paris. His intelligence correspondents included Đujić, who disseminated his intelligence reports to the CIA, Konstantin Fotić, the former Yugoslav <b>ambassador</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> and Miro Didek, Croat politician Vladko Maček's self-styled intelligence representative in Rome. The intelligence reports were mostly collected from refugees fleeing Yugoslavia and arriving in Italy via Trieste and from émigré groups in Italy and Greece. By 1949, Jevđević claimed to have formed a large network of anti-communist propagandists in Italy and intelligence collection centres in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece. The CIA believed that these claims were exaggerated, if not entirely fictitious. In 1951, Jevđević began printing an anti-communist, pro-Chetnik publication from an unidentified religious institution in Italy. Issues were regularly mailed to Yugoslav exiles and former Chetniks living in the United States, Canada, Australia and various European countries.|$|E

5|$|In February 1793 {{the newly}} formed French Republic {{declared}} war on Great Britain, extending the French Revolutionary Wars that had begun the year before on the continent. The French Navy {{was in a state}} of upheaval due to the social consequences of the French Revolution, and as a result found itself at a disadvantage to the Royal Navy, which had been preparing for war since June 1792. In response, the French sent several frigate squadrons to sea, including their newest ships and best sailors and officers in an attempt to disrupt British commerce in the early stages of the war. One such squadron was sent in April 1793 to the United States, carrying the French <b>ambassador</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Edmond-Charles Genêt. After the ambassador disembarked, the squadron, under the command of Captain Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart, dispersed to raid British shipping along the coast, capturing or destroying more than 60 merchant vessels before retiring to American ports for repairs.|$|E
5|$|In May 1920 Princess Matoika took {{on board}} the bodies of ten female nurses and over 400soldiers who died while on duty in France during the war. The ship then transited the Kiel Canal and picked up 1,600U.S. {{residents}} of Polish descent at Danzig, {{all of whom had}} enlisted in the Polish Army {{at the outset of the}} war. Also included among the passengers were 500U.S. soldiers who had been released from occupation duty at Koblenz. The ship arrived at New York on 23May with little fanfare and no ceremony; bodies returned but not claimed by families were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. On 21 July, Princess Matoika arrived in New York after a similar voyage with 25war brides, many repatriated Polish troops among its 2,094 steerage passengers, and the remains of 881soldiers. In between these two trips, the Belgian <b>Ambassador</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Baron Emile de Cartier de Marchienne, sailed from New York to Belgium {{on board the}} Matoika. It was, however, Princess Matoikas next trip to Belgium that was the most infamous.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{negotiations}} {{continued with}} the Americans. Oliver Franks, the British <b>Ambassador</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> lodged a formal request on 2 August 1951 {{for use of}} the Nevada Test Site. This was looked upon favourably by the United States Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, {{and the chairman of the}} United States Atomic Energy Commission, Gordon Dean, but opposed by the Robert A. Lovett, the Deputy Secretary of Defense and Robert LeBaron, the Deputy Secretary of Defence for Atomic Energy Affairs. The British government had announced on 7 June 1951 that Donald Maclean, who had served as a British member of the Combined Policy Committee from January 1947 to August 1948, had been a Soviet spy. In view of security concerns, Lovett and LeBaron wanted the tests to be conducted by Americans, with British participation limited to Penney and a few selected British scientists. Truman endorsed this counterproposal on 24 September 1951.|$|E
