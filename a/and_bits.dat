5|$|The larvae {{of other}} species of caddisfly make nets rather than cases. These are silken webs {{stretching}} between aquatic vegetation and over stones. These net-making larvae usually live in running water, different species occupying different habitats with varying water speeds. There is a constant drift of invertebrates washed downstream by the current, and these animals, <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> of debris, accumulate in the nets which serve both as food traps and as retreats.|$|E
5|$|Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain {{either a}} program {{instruction}} or data. In a program instruction, bits 0–12 represented the memory {{address of the}} operand to be used, <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> 13–15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16bits were unused. The SSEM's single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only {{the address of the}} data in memory.|$|E
5|$|Much more ancient {{than the}} {{upstream}} mountains are the exotic terranes of the Klamath Mountains to the west. Not until plate tectonics separated North America from Europe and North Africa {{and pushed it}} westward did the continent acquire, bit by bit, what became the Pacific Northwest, including Oregon. The Klamath Mountains consist of multiple terranes—former volcanic islands and coral reefs <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> of subduction zones, mantle, and seafloor—that merged offshore over vast stretches of time before colliding with North America as a single block about 150 to 130million years ago. Much of the Rogue River watershed, including the Rogue River canyon, the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, the Illinois River basin, and Mount Ashland, are composed of exotic terranes.|$|E

5|$|In January 1851, Allen {{purchased}} the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial {{building in the}} area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory {{had a long history}} of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers <b>and</b> <b>bits.</b> Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.|$|E
5|$|The Chetco River {{flows through}} the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane, which is between 400 and 100million years old, the oldest rocks in Oregon. The Klamath {{microcontinent}} was originally located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating {{hundreds of millions of}} years ago. Plate tectonics pushed the microcontinent north, <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> of granite, sea floor sediment, subduction zones, and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands. Between 212 and 170million years ago, a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath microcontinent, binding the islands together in a single block. The Klamath microcontinent went through a period of intense tectonic activity known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165million years ago. The process was strong enough to force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth's crust, melting them into large plutons of granite, which rose slowly to the surface. Shortly after, a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks. This region is known as the Josephine Ophiolite, and contains a rare type of rock called peridotite, originating from the Earth's mantle.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{probably}} breeds {{throughout its}} range. The breeding season is from June to January, {{with one or}} two broods raised during this time. The nest is an untidy deep bowl of sticks <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> of bark in the fork of a tree, Staghorn or bird's nest ferns, or grasstree. Pandanus palms are a popular nest site in Mackay. They often renovate and use the old nests of other species, most commonly the grey-crowned babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), but also the chestnut-crowned babbler (P. ruficeps), other honeyeaters including noisy (Philemon corniculatus), little and silver-crowned friarbirds (P. argenticeps), the noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), and artamids such as the Australian magpie and butcherbird species, and even the magpie-lark. In Coen, an old babbler nest in a paperbark (Melaleuca) which had been lined with messmate bark had been occupied by blue-faced honeyeaters and re-lined with strips of paperbark. Two or rarely three eggs are laid, 22 × 32mm (1 × 1⅓ in) and buff-pink splotched with red-brown or purplish colours. The female alone incubates the eggs, over a period of 16 or 17 days.|$|E

25|$|Necrophoric {{behaviour}} {{occurs in}} the red imported fire ant. Workers discard uneaten food and other such wastes away from the nest. The active component was not identified, but the fatty acids accumulating {{as a result of}} decomposition were implicated <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> of paper coated with synthetic oleic acid typically elicited a necrophoric response. The process behind this behaviour in imported red fire ants was confirmed by Blum (1970): unsaturated fats, such as oleic acid, elicit corpse-removal behaviour. Workers also show differentiated responses towards dead workers and pupae. Dead workers are usually taken away from the nest, whereas the pupae may take a day for a necrophoric response to occur. Pupae infected by Metarhizium anisopliae are usually discarded by workers at a higher rate; 47.5% of unaffected corpses are discarded within a day, but for affected corpses this figure is 73.8%.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Falsk and Mathisen {{wrote and}} created the film Showbiz, where Falsk played the movie's protagonist, a loser obsessed with {{becoming}} a pop star, while Mathisen played six different supporting roles. According to Falsk, he and Mathisen were determined to break every screenwriting rule and ignore every film cliché when writing the script. Falsk also directed the film, which was slaughtered by the critics after its premiere in September 1989, and bombed at the box office. Nonetheless, Showbiz {{has become something of}} a cult film in Norway. The duo's next project, the television show Tom Mathisen og Herodes Falsks latterlige verden (The ridiculous world of Tom Mathisen and Herodes Falsk), which aired on the cable channel TVNorge, was more successful. The TV show was basically an extension of Falsk/Mathisen's live act and featured sketches, songs, television parodies <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> of Falsk's stand-up material.|$|E

First, the mechanism of relay protection malfunction caused by communication delays <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> errors is introduced. In general, a channel’s consistent delay or bit error results in refuse-operations, while a channel’s inconsistent delay normally causes false trips. Based on the analysis of the probability distributions of communication delays <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> errors, probabilistic models of false trips and refuse-operations are proposed. Simulation results, using typical parameters, are implemented to investigate the effects of communications on the malfunction probability of differential protection...|$|R
25|$|Frank Geyer, a Philadelphia detective {{tracking}} Holmes, {{found the}} decomposed {{bodies of the}} two Pitezel girls in the Toronto cellar. After removing the bodies from their shallow graves, Geyer noticed that Nellie's feet had been removed. After discovering that Nellie had club foot, he theorized that Holmes had cut off her feet to prevent a distinctive identification of the body. He then followed Holmes to Indianapolis, where Holmes had rented a cottage. Holmes {{was reported to have}} visited a local pharmacy to purchase the drugs which he used to kill Howard Pitezel, and a repair shop to sharpen the knives he used to chop up the body before he burned it. The boy's teeth <b>and</b> <b>bits</b> of bone were discovered in the home's chimney. Holmes' murder spree finally ended when he was arrested in Boston on November 17, 1894, after being tracked there from Philadelphia by the Pinkertons. He was held on an outstanding warrant for horse theft in Texas, as the authorities had become more suspicious at this point and Holmes appeared poised to flee the country in the company of his unsuspecting third wife.|$|E
