5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Little</b> <b>More</b> Personal (Raw) {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, who praised Lohan's ambition, despite considering it a weak album. The album charted mildly compared to Speak, debuting (and also peaking) at number twenty on the US Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 82,000 copies, and also peaking {{at the same}} position on the Digital Albums chart.

5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain.

5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross {{in front of their}} star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E
5|$|Altair is a type-A main {{sequence}} star with approximately 1.8 times {{the mass of}} the Sun and 11 times its luminosity. Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours.

This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.|$|E

About 83 percent of women participated in housecleaning and food preparation compared to only 51 percent of men who were surveyed.|$|E
