5|$|Martin {{was fired}} from the band later that year due to musical differences, via <b>a</b> <b>fax</b> from {{keyboard}} player Roddy Bottum; and Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance {{was brought in to}} record their next album. However, Spruance left the band before the subsequent tour, and was replaced by the band's keyboard roadie, Dean Menta. Reasons given for the change differ—the band claim Spruance was unwilling to commit to a long touring schedule in support of the album, whilst Spruance claims he was never meant to be a permanent member in the first place. Roddy Bottum also claims to have been mostly absent during this period, owing to the deaths of his father and Kurt Cobain, whose wife Courtney Love was a close friend of his and one of the temporary lead singers of the band before Chuck Mosely joined. Bottum's absence led to the album being written largely without keyboards. Around the recording of the album in 1994, Mike Patton also got married to Italian woman Cristina Zuccatosta.|$|E

25|$|The {{general layout}} of the House was largely {{untouched}} from the previous non-celebrity series. The living room and bedroom had no noticeable changes. There were several single beds in the same room, with one double bed, meaning that two housemates (Leo and Donny) had to share. The bathroom is much smaller than previous versions and the toilet and shower were no longer fitted with cameras. The dining room table was moved inside, and the kitchen fully equipped with modern conveniences. Outside the garden was a three-jet hot tub with a farmyard seating area. The bridge to Nowhere was still present, leading to a sitting area with heated seats and the topiary man. A workout area was situated just off the kitchen area. Inside the House there was also <b>a</b> <b>fax</b> machine built into the wall. On day 24 this was used to post viewers' questions to the housemates. Meanwhile, the Diary Room was identical to the previous summer's Big Brother, with an oversized gold chair and padded walls, the only change being the addition of yellow lights facing the walls.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives made a {{detailed}} and revised plan on April 25, 2007, after leaks {{of a speech}} {{which was supposed to}} be made by John Baird on April 26 were discovered after some Liberal MPs received <b>a</b> <b>fax</b> of the speech. The new plan seeks to stop the increase of greenhouse gas emissions before 2012 and reduce the amount as much as 20% by 2020. Targets would be imposed to industries before 2015, while home appliances would need to be more energy efficient. There were also rewards for companies that reduced the amount of emissions since 2006. On the next day, Baird announced additional measures including one that would force industries to reduce greenhouse emissions by 18 percent by 2010 while auto industries would have a mandatory fuel-efficient standard by 2011. Later in 2007, Baird revealed other plans and deadlines that industries must meet. The plan mentioned that over 700 big-polluter companies, including oil and gas, pulp and paper, electricity and iron and steel companies, will have to reduce green-house emissions by six percent from 2008 to 2010 and will have to report data on their emissions on every May 31.|$|E
