5|$|As {{the size}} of train increased, so did the locomotives. The 4-6-0 wheel {{arrangement}} became popular for passenger and mixed traffic work with the D3 and A2 classes, and the 2-8-0 arrangement on goods with the K, J and C classes lasting into the 1960s. These were then followed by the 4-6-2 S class Pacifics for the Spirit of Progress express, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> 4-8-4 H class locomotive H220, the biggest Victorian Railways steam locomotive. The final steam locomotives built for the Victorian Railways were the 4-6-4 R class and 2-8-0 J classes. Although they were of more modern design, their advantages were overshadowed by the simultaneous arrival of the first diesels.|$|E

5|$|Like other abelisaurids, Majungasaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} {{with a short}} snout. Although the forelimbs are {{not completely}} known, they were very short, while the hind limbs were longer and very stocky. It can be distinguished from other abelisaurids by its wider skull, the very rough texture and thickened bone {{on the top of}} its snout, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> rounded horn on the roof of its skull, which was originally mistaken for the dome of a pachycephalosaur. It also had more teeth in both upper and lower jaws than most abelisaurids.|$|E

However, the specimens located in Maryland and Delaware {{were found on the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> North Carolina station is in the Piedmont. Its scattered distribution suggests that the species once spread more broadly across North America, but was almost eradicated by glacial advances, surviving only where it escaped the ice in protected refugia.|$|E

5|$|Reviews of {{the soundtrack}} album were positive, with critics praising both {{the variety of}} styles {{and quality of the}} pieces. Several critics noted Mizuta's work as {{possibly}} his finest to date. Reviewers of the game were more mixed, with some feeling that some of the styles of music did not match where they were played in the game. Critics were also mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling that several of the pieces were simply inferior versions of the original tracks. Both of the albums <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> sold well enough to place on the Japanese Oricon charts, with the original soundtrack album reaching a peak of #13 and remaining on the charts for eight weeks.|$|E
