5|$|Making <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>for</b> zero in the {{definition}} of evenness forces one to make such exceptions in the rules for even numbers. From another perspective, taking the rules obeyed by positive even numbers and requiring that they continue to hold for integers forces the usual definition and the evenness of zero.|$|E

Milne's form attracted attention elsewhere with Aberdeen among those interested, a move Milne favoured to be near his son and other family in Scotland. On being called into a meeting with manager, Joe Jordan, Milne was told by Jordan {{that he had no}} intention of letting him nor any of his other best players leave, but that he would make <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>for</b> Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was born}} {{five days after the}} September 15 cutoff date for {{eligibility}} in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft, there was a significant effort made to allow Tavares into the Draft. Following his 72-goal campaign in 2006–07, Tavares' agents asked the NHL and NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) to make <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>for</b> Tavares similar to the one the OHL had made in 2005. The attempt was unsuccessful, however, and Tavares was forced to wait until 2009 to participate in the League Entry Draft. In October 2007, however, it was reported that then-Toronto Maple Leafs General Manager John Ferguson, Jr., had offered the 17-year-old Tavares a spot with the team's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. Like the NHL, however, the AHL declined to amend its by-laws, and Tavares subsequently returned to the OHL.|$|E

5|$|Following {{their long}} delay, Babayane, Mshete, Maund and Colenbrander journeyed to England aboard the Moor. They disembarked at Southampton in early March 1889, and {{travelled}} by train to London, where they {{checked into the}} Berners Hotel on Oxford Street. They were invited to Windsor Castle after two days in the capital. The audience was originally meant only for the two izinDuna and their interpreter—Maund could not attend such a meeting as he was a British subject—but Knutsford arranged <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>for</b> Maund when Babayane and Mshete refused to go without him; the Colonial Secretary {{said that it would}} be regrettable for all concerned if the embassy were derailed by such a technicality. The emissaries duly met the Queen and delivered the letter from Lobengula, as well as an oral message they had been told to pass on.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{national}} accreditation groups {{attempted to}} disaccredit many of Kentucky's public colleges during Clements administration {{in order to}} end longstanding political interference in the higher education system. Clements worked to help these colleges maintain their accreditation and to secure re-accreditation for Morehead State Teachers College. In 1948, he weakened Kentucky's Day Law—which enforced segregation of the state's education system—by providing <b>an</b> <b>exception</b> <b>for</b> black medical personnel to take post-graduate courses in white public hospitals. He also supported a 1948 bill that allowed blacks to pursue medical training at the University of Louisville. His efforts to secure a similar arrangement at the University of Kentucky were not successful, despite the governor's status as ex-officio chairman of the Board of Trustees. In 1949, the federal district court in Lexington granted blacks admission to programs at the University of Kentucky if an equivalent program was not available at Kentucky State College, the state's historically black college.|$|E
