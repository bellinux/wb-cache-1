50|$|The {{novel is}} set in Melbourne. The first-person narrator, Eddie Harnovey, is a Chemical Engineer, married to Tanya, an {{aspiring}} but ultimately uncontracted Political Science academic. Eddie is from middle class origins, his father being a clerk for a local council. His childhood friend Amanda, however, was a class above them. As a Chemical Engineer, her father wore starched cotton shirts while Eddie's father wore drip-dry poly-cotton shirts. Amanda's family banned Eddie from meeting her. Nevertheless, Eddie meets Amanda every nine and half years. The next time is as undergraduates, where Eddie notices her in a queue for more fashionable food than {{he is in the}} queue for. The next time is as fellow shoppers in a department store, as Eddie looks for formal wear for his marriage to Tanya. The next time he meets her is in much straitened circumstances. Downsized, jobless, and with only three dollars in his bank account, Eddie skips an appointment with Amanda - now an employment consultant - and ends up beaten unconscious protecting a friend of a now indigent man Eddie befriended while still solvent. Eddie's report on Amanda's father's smelter expansion was the reason Eddie was downsized. Amanda identifies Eddie from the <b>appointment</b> <b>card</b> he had in his shirt pocket.|$|E

He goes to the market and is told to go to check the morgue. There he finds her body, badly beaten and tortured. King returns to the car wash and assaults three men. He drags {{one of the men}} into a storeroom and pours bleach all over his face. The man admits that Bianca was part of a network of drug dealers and prostitutes, and that their boss Duke was hired to kill her. King leaves the man alive to deliver the message to Duke that King would be coming for him. He then goes to Trish's party to get answers and when he arrives he discovers Trish doing drugs. She admits her and Bianca hosted frequent parties for their dealer Frankie so he could sell drugs. King confronts Frankie outside. Frankie claims {{he had nothing to do}} with Bianca's death so King robs him of his cash and drugs. Later that evening while eating at diner King is approached by Kelly, a single mom from New Mexico who is living in the same motel that King is staying in. She thanks him for not being judgemental about her situation like some of the other guests are.|$|E

In a {{disguise}} Amy visits the doctor and gets a dose of the vaccine. Afterwards, she breaks into the storage room and finds it full of vaccine; enough to treat the whole population for years. Amy realizes that the government has been lying all along. However, she is arrested and put into prison where she is supposed to stay until she will be executed. Tiberius visits her and reveals that he had put a listening device on her and telling her she failed the loyalty test. He also wants to eliminate Danton {{and the rest of the}} rebels. However, Amy manages to escape with the help of a red-eyed raven. When she arrives at the rebel’s hideout, everyone is dead. She finds a hidden message and learns that Danton has survived and fled to the reactor base. Before Amy goes there, she gives her lottery ticket to a friend, because she already had a dose of the vaccine and therefore does not need it anymore. Through a public announcement she hears that her ticket won and Amy believes it’s a coincident. However, when she gets to Danton she is told that the lottery is just a farce and that they can track the person with each number; they are using her friend as a bait to get Amy.|$|E

Homer looks through Marge's memory box {{and sees a}} poster of Moe's Tavern's opening. But there is Marge's writing on it. It says Homer made it {{the worst day of}} her life because Homer, when he was a teenager, during the opening becomes drunk and ditches Marge so he can play Asteroids on an arcade machine with his friends. He is soon sent to the hospital with alcohol poisoning. This leaves Homer concerned why Marge stayed with him; he then finds a hospital <b>appointment</b> <b>card</b> dated two days later, confirming she was pregnant with Bart. When Homer confronts Marge about the letter, she says she was just upset that night, but is forced to admit that Homer did, and still does, things which annoy her. Homer then realizes Marge has been resenting him behind his back. The next day, they argue again and Homer leaves the house. He spends some time at Kirk Van Houten's apartment, but the generally depressive mood of the apartment complex where he lives drives him out. Homer then reads a newspaper saying that there is a place available. Finding out that the place is in Springfield's gay district, Homer moves in with a gay male couple, Grady and Julio. Homer has a visit home after taking Bart and Lisa out, but Marge and Homer still argue. At the gay bar, Homer tells Grady and Julio that his relationship with Marge is low.|$|E

When Val finds out, she is stunned {{and decides to}} tell the shocked villagers that she is HIV positive. After being rude to Brenda when she offers her support, Val gets drunk and Jacob reveals {{that he was the}} culprit who posted her status online. She forgives Jacob and apologises for being irritating. Ian later arrives at the B&B so Eric punches him. This stuns Val and her new employee and friend, Finn Barton (Joe Gill). She takes Ian to the café, where they realise how well suited they are for one another. As they are leaving the café, Val and Ian share a passionate kiss, unaware that Eric has seen them. Val and Ian later begin dating but it doesn't last long and Val is devastated to find Eric selling her belongings outside The Woolpack. Val is later delighted when local delivery driver, Tiny Alcock (Tony Pritchard), takes a shine to her. They have numerous drinks and are attracted to one another, despite Eric warning Tiny to stay away from Val. The next day, Tiny makes it clear he wants to sleep with her but she panics and tells him she is just popping out for some condoms, but she actually confides in Victoria. She returns, and the pair sleep together. Unfortunately Tiny finds an <b>appointment</b> <b>card</b> for the sexual health clinic in Val's bag when looking for cigarettes and asks Val about it, so she tells him that she is HIV positive. Tiny is furious and tries to leave but Val tries to stop him. He pushes her away and she hits her head as Tiny storms out, leaving Val on the floor, devastated. The next morning, Val has a black eye and Eric thinks that Tiny hit her and confront him in the café, where Tiny is nasty about Val and her HIV status, infuriating Eric. The pair go outside, where a fight ensues and Val and Diane get involved as the police arrive and make things worst. Val is arrested for criminal damage after she vandalises Tiny's van with a key, Diane for assaulting a police officer after she accidentally elbows one in the face while trying to restrain her sister from throwing bread at Tiny, and Eric for assault after he kicks and punches Tiny. At the police station, they begin bickering, so they all spend the night in a cell, Diane and Eric are released without charge, while Val is released and charged with criminal damage, threatening behaviour and assault, which infuriates her. After being released, Val finally forgives Diane after months of feuding. The following day, Val gives a heart-felt talk to The Woolpack regulars about living with HIV, which is praised throughout the pub.|$|E

40|$|Following HIV- 1 acquisition, many {{individuals}} develop an acute retroviral syndrome {{and a majority}} seek care. Available antibody testing cannot detect an acute HIV infection, but repeat testing after 2 - 4 weeks may detect seroconversion. We assessed the effect of appointment reminders on attendance for repeat HIV testing. We enrolled, in a randomized controlled trial, 18 - 29 year old patients evaluated for acute HIV infection at five sites in Coastal Kenya (ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01876199). Participants were allocated 1 : 1 to either standard appointment (a dated <b>appointment</b> <b>card)</b> or enhanced appointment (a dated <b>appointment</b> <b>card</b> plus SMS and phone call reminders, or in-person reminders for participants without a phone). The primary outcome was visit attendance, i. e., the proportion of participants attending the repeat test visit. Factors associated with attendance were examined by bivariable and multivariable logistic regression. Between April and July 2013, 410 participants were randomized. Attendance was 41 % (85 / 207) for the standard group and 59 % (117 / 199) for the enhanced group, for a relative risk of 1. 4 [95 % Confidence Interval, CI, 1. 2 - 1. 7]. Higher attendance was independently associated with older age, study site, and report of transactional sex in past month. Lower attendance was associated with reporting multiple partners {{in the past two}} months.

40|$|Background: It is {{important}} to seek cost-effective methods of improving the care and outcome of those with serious mental illnesses. User-held records, where {{the person with the}} illness holds all or some personal information relating to the course and care of their illness, are now the norm in some clinical settings. Their value for those with severe mental illnesses is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of personalised, accessible, user-held clinical information for people with a severe mental illness (defined as psychotic illnesses). Search methods: We updated previous searches by searching the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register in August 2011. This register is compiled by systematic searches of major databases, and handsearches of journals and conference proceedings. Selection criteria: We included all relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that: i. have recruited adult participants with a diagnosis of a severe mental illness (specifically psychotic illnesses and severe mood disorders such as bipolar and depression with psychotic features); and ii. compared any personalised and accessible clinical information held by the user beyond standard care to standard information routinely held such as <b>appointment</b> <b>cards</b> and generic information on diagnosis, treatment or services available.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the factors influencing non-attendance with clinic appointments in diabetic patients at a Gauteng Hospital in 2007 / 2008. SETTING: Two diabetes clinics situated at a secondary-level hospital, that offer more specialised outpatient care to adult patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes. DESIGN: Between 21 November 2007 and 12 March 2008, {{a convenience sample}} of consecutive non-attending diabetic patients (n = 76) was prospectively recruited for the study. A survey of the non-attending patients was conducted, using two data collection methods, namely face-to-face interviews and telephone interviews. Patient demographics, reasons for non-attendance, perceived severity of diabetes, and perceived encouragement from others to attend were investigated. The characteristics of the non-attending patients and the reasons for non-attendance were explored. RESULTS: Of the 520 patients who were booked during the study period, 35 % were not compliant with their clinic visit. The mean age of the patients was 51 years (range 18 – 85). All patients perceived diabetes to be a serious disease. Of the interviewed patients, 83 % perceived their health to be either good or excellent, and 95 % claimed that a clinic visit assisted them in managing their diabetes. Only 20 % of the patients diarised their appointment dates, while the rest simply used the <b>appointment</b> <b>card</b> given by the clinic. Patients had various reasons for not complying with their clinic appointments, with forgetting being the most frequently dominant response (22 %). CONCLUSION: Forgetfulness, which was found to be the major cause of non-attendance, can easily be addressed in ensuring the attendance of scheduled clinic visits...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: In 2000, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) updated {{its core}} {{standards}} {{for measuring the}} quality of the interaction between a patient and physiotherapist. Some organisational barriers exist however, in implementing these standards within an outpatient clinical setting. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to design and evaluate a patient-information leaflet for new patients referred to the department, advising them about the physiotherapy process and addressing some of the core standards. RELEVANCE: This work reflects the Government’s agenda for clinical governance, ‘creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish’ (Secretary of State for Health 1998). It also addresses local needs, informing patients about their physiotherapy service and the process of delivery of care. DECSRIPTION: The leaflet development was completed in 3 stages: 1) 50 patients were asked to identify what information they would like to know about physiotherapy, the department, their first visit, and their rights, for the purpose of developing a leaflet; 2) 100 consecutive patients discharged from the outpatient physiotherapy service were asked to participate in an anonymized postal audit evaluating their experience of the department, using the CSP’s standardized ‘Patient Feedback’ questionnaire; 3) a patient-information leaflet was developed using the responses from stage 1, the core standards and input from clinicians. This leaflet was piloted with 100 patients. OBSERVATIONS: The response rate for stage 1 = 74 %. Patients most wanted directions to the department, information about their personal physiotherapist (such as their name and level of experience), duration of the appointment and likelihood of a successful outcome of treatment. In stage 2, the feedback from patients was generally positive, with 89 % enjoying ‘coming for physiotherapy’ and 87 % being ‘very satisfied’ with their care. However, 43 % of patients did not recover as well as they had hoped and nearly 8 % considered their physiotherapy to be ‘a waste of time’. In stage 3, the mean score for the leaflet on a scale of 0 - 10, where 0 =‘of no benefit’ and 10 =‘extremely helpful’ was 8. 4. Work is currently underway to repeat the audit from stage 2 with 100 consecutive patients discharged from the department, who had received the leaflet prior to their first appointment. These findings will be compared to the findings from stage 2. CONCLUSIONS: A simple, patient-information leaflet, sent out with the <b>appointment</b> <b>card</b> before patients first attend an outpatient physiotherapy department, is proving popular with patients and can be used as part of a range of strategies to implement the core standards into clinical practice and improve patient care...|$|E

50|$|In March 1913, at {{the start}} of Woodrow Wilson's administration, the staff of the Records Office began to compile a card index to the presidential appointments.

40|$|HIV and AIDS {{pandemic}} {{have been}} declining in South Africa. HIV and AIDS affect individuals, families, {{organizations and the}} communities at large. While the roll out of the antiretroviral treatment (ART) has brought much excitement and hope to both patients and the health practitioners, it has also brought challenges (Maskew, Macphail, Menez & Rubel, 2007 : 853). In order for ART to be effective patients need to adhere to antiretroviral treatment, thus adherence is {{a critical component of}} ART. Patients who discontinue treatment are at high risk of illness and death because of AIDS related diseases or developing drug resistant virus. With {{a better understanding of the}} reasons for defaulting antiretroviral treatment interventions can be designed to improve adherence to antiretroviral treatment. Thus the purpose of this study was to explore the reasons why HIV and AIDS infected patients default antiretroviral treatment because adherence to ART is of utmost important. Within the context of qualitative and applied research the researcher utilized the collective case study design. Semi structured interviewing was used as data collection method to elicit qualitative information on the reasons why patients default ART. The main research question that was put forward to all participants was: What are your reasons for defaulting ART? The participants in this study were patients who have default their ART during 2012. By using systematic sampling fourteen participants from Thekganang ARV Clinic in Seshego District Hospital, Limpopo province, were selected to form a sample for this study. Some conclusions based on the findings were that: The participants were knowledgeable about the basic facts of HIV and AIDS and they had a good understanding about the importance of adherence even though they defaulted their antiretroviral treatment. The use of ART may also be challenging to individuals. The findings of this study were that not all participants in the study experienced challenges with taking ART. Those who experienced challenges included fear of disclosing HIV status, fear of stigmatization and physical challenges due to ill health. Regarding the reasons for defaulting ART, participants’ reasons for defaulting antiretroviral treatment were similar although some of the reasons applied to only one participant. Participants’ reasons for treatment default were classified into socio-economic factors, patient related, psychological related and medication related factors. Socio- economic factors included shortage of food in the household and lack of money for transport to attend clinic appointments. Patient related factors included substance abuse, lost <b>appointment</b> <b>cards,</b> participants were too busy with personal issues and relocation to another area of residence. Psychological factors that contributed to non-adherence to treatment were depression and denial. Medical related factor voiced was that participant was too confused about the drug regimen. Most participants were satisfied with the services in Thekganang ARV clinic although some participants raised concerns about staff attitudes and long queue. The findings will assist the hospital management and the clinic staff to make informed decisions about the management of defaulters in the clinic. The study was concluded with the relevant recommendations to the ART facilities. The recommendations included implementation of the multi-disciplinary centred approach, establishing patient education programmes and on-going support services to patients who fail to adhere to treatment. Future research studies should determine the prevalence of drug resistant HIV patients in the ART facilities and the development of a systematic method of capturing ‘‘lost to follow up’’ patients who pass away within hospitals.

40|$|Introduction: There is a {{relationship}} between children’s survival, development and health and theirfeeding. Malnutrition is a common complication {{in most of the}} developing countries. Complementaryfeeding begins in infants when they can not obtain enough energy and nutrients from mother’s milk. Both early and late beginning of complementary nutrition lead to severe complications, and suitableage for feeding in infants is after month 6. The present study was performed to estimate the age ofbeginning of complementary feeding and related factors in infants of Semnan. Materials&Methods: In this cross sectional study, 400 infants aged 6 - 12 months were analized viaquestionnaire. In each of 8 health centers in Semnan, 50 mothers who referred to health care centers,filled up questionnaires. Results: 76. 3 % of mothers begin the complementary feeding from 6 months after delivery. Themost common complementary food, which was used, was cereal (69. 5 %). Mean (±SD) beginning ageof complementary feeding was 5. 86 ± 0. 60 month. Most of mothers (97. 5 %) had been receivedinformation about infant’s feeding through <b>appointments,</b> books, vaccination <b>card</b> and pamphlet priorto their infants reach to age 6 month. There was a significant relationship between occupation ofmother (P= 0. 049), age of mother (P= 0. 040), father's educational level (P= 0. 002), type of delivery(P= 0. 015) and the beginning age of complementary feeding. However, no significant relationship wasobserved between gender, type of milk, birth order, type of health care center, mother's educationallevel, first complementary feeding, type of mother's education and the beginning age ofcomplementary feeding. Conclusion: The findings of current study showed that 97. 5 % of mothers were educated forbeginning of complementary feeding in a suitable time; however, about 23 % of them didn’t begincomplementary feeding in an appropriate time.
