This study focused on germination as a versatile and low cost practice. Different lengths of germination time were assessed and compared to each another. Soybeans were soaked for 24 hours and allowed to germinate from one day up to six days. Changes within seeds were noted for nutritional and <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factors</b> during germination. Condensed tannins and trypsin inhibitors decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) while total polyphenols increased from 5 to 6 days. Protein and fat content increased significantly (P< 0. 05), but starch content decreased with germination. There were no significant changes for IVPD during germination of soybeans. Germination was also compared to other traditional methods such as roasting, soaking and dehulling. Results showed that dehulled soybeans had the highest proximate composition which was significantly different from other treatments (P< 0. 05), but the total polyphenols increased.

40|$|Abstract: Animal {{production}} in Botswana suffers from inadequate feed quantities and qualities, due mainly to semi-arid low rainfall which can barely support arable farming in most years. This problem {{is compounded by}} the competition between the livestock and human feed industries for the little available pulses and cereals. Consequently, tree fodders are available forage resources which grazing herbivores can utilize without competition from monogastric animals and man. Tree fodders can be utilized as supplements to low quality grasses and straws. Most tree leaves and twigs contain tannins, an <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factor</b> for which proper precautions need to be taken in selecting the species of trees and their level of feeding to grazing animals. Many plant components have the potential to precipitate adverse effects on the productivity of farm livestock. Plant anti-nutritive factors may be divided into a heat-labile group, comprising lectins, proteinase inhibitors and cyanogens, which are sensitive to standard processing temperatures and a heat-stable group including, among many others, antigenic proteins, condensed tannins, saponins, the non-protein amino acids and mimosine. These compounds are present in the foliage and/or seeds of virtually every plant that is used in practical feeding. Processing can be used to destroy some anti nutrient factors, also rumen digestion reduces the impart of anti-nutritive factors in some tree fodders for cattle, sheep and goats.

Several low PA soybean lines have been discovered, but many of these lines have either minor reductions in PA or inadequate germination and emergence. The reduced PA phenotype of soybean line Gm-lpa-ZC- 2 was previously shown {{to be the result of}} a mutation in a gene encoding an inositol pentakisphosphate 2 -kinase on chromosome 14 (14 IPK 1). While the 14 IPK 1 mutation was shown to have no impact on germination and emergence, the reduction in PA was modest (up to 50 %). Our objective was to determine the effect on seed P partitioning for a novel mutation of an independent gene on chromosome six (06 IPK 1) on its own and in combination with mutant alleles of the 14 IPK 1. We developed soybean populations and conducted genotype and phenotype association analyses based on the genotype of the 06 IPK 1 and 14 IPK 1 genes and the seed P partitioning profile. The lines with both mutant genes had very low PA levels, moderate accumulation of inorganic phosphate (Pi), and accumulation of high amounts of P in lower inositols. The developed lines did not have significant reductions in germination or field emergence. In addition, characterization of the lower inositols produced in the mutant lines suggests that IPK 1 is a polyphosphate kinase and provides some insight into the PA biosynthesis pathway in soybean seeds...|$|E

40|$|Optimization {{of process}} for {{reduction}} of <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factors</b> in edible cereal brans Satinder Kaur 1, Savita Sharma 1, BN Dar 1, 2 and Baljit Singh 1 Reduction of various <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factors</b> in cereal brans by different treatments (microwave heating, dry heating and wet heating) were studied. There was significant difference (p 0. 05) in reduction of <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factors</b> of treated cereal brans except for dry heating at low temperature. Microwave heating at 2450 MHz for 2. 5 min resulted in 53. 85 %, 57. 21 %, 65. 00 % and 100 % reduction in phytic acid, polyphenols, oxalates and saponins, respectively. Wet heating resulted in maximum reduction in trypsin inhibitor activity (83. 07 %) at 110 C for 25 min. Processing treatment resulted in increase in bulk density and slight darkening of the brans. The most effective method of detoxifying {{most of the}} toxicants was microwave heating for 2. 5 min, and therefore it could be exploited for making treated brans an ideal source for potential food application...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{elimination}} of <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factors</b> of the Jatropha curcas L. seed cake {{is important for}} decreasing environmental damage and adding economic value to this residue of the biodiesel industry. In this study, we analyzed the ability of Pleurotus ostreatus to degrade <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factors</b> and produce edible mushrooms using different proportions of the J.  curcas seed cake as substrate. After 60  d of incubation at 25  °C, we observed 95 % phytic acid and 85 % tannins reductions, and high mushrooms productivity. There {{was no evidence of}} tannins or phytic acid in these mushrooms. Furthermore, the phorbol ester concentration observed in these mushrooms was around 1000 -fold lower than that found in the non-toxic variety of J. curcas. Thus, P.  ostreatus can degrade the <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factors</b> found in J.  curcas seed cake. The jatropha seed cake can potentially be used for mushroom production, with high nutritional value, and animal ration, after treated by P.  ostreatus, adding economic value to the biodiesel residue and avoiding inadequate disposal in the environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} some {{processing}} technique on the proximate and <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factors</b> in Leucaena leucociphala seed were evaluated. The crude protein, ether extract, crude fibre, ash content and nitrogen free extract were estimated on raw, roasted and cooked samples of Leucaena leucociphala milled seed. The <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factors</b> such as phytate and tannin were also determined {{in the raw}} and processed samples of the seed. The nitrogen free extract of the raw sample was observed to be significantly lower (p< 0. 05) compared to those of roasted and cooked samples. A significant increase (p< 0. 05) was observed in the ether extract and crude fibre of raw sample {{compared with that of}} roasted and cooked samples. A significant reduction (p< 0. 05) was observed in the level of phytate of roasted and cooked samples compared to the raw sample. A significant reduction (p< 0. 05) was also observed in the level of tannin of cooked sample compared to raw and roasted. The study revealed that there was improvement in the nutritional quality of the processed seed with reduction in the <b>antinutritional</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R
