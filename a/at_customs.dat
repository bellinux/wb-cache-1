5|$|Susan hires Finn Kelly (Rob Mills), {{following}} Brad's departure. Susan {{learns that}} Elly and Finn used to date. Susan collapses and {{is taken to}} hospital, where it is discovered {{that she has a}} high level of opiates in her system. It emerges that her vitamins have been swapped and Elly suspects that Finn was responsible. Finn is appointed acting principal while Susan recovers. When Finn's crimes are exposed, including the vitamin swap, Susan ignores her MS symptoms to return to the school to undo everything Finn implemented. Susan suffers an MS relapse and falls in the school yard. Karl persuades her to take sick leave and go to a retreat in Thailand. When they return, Susan is angry with Karl and later reveals that he tried to bring seeds and a Durian into the country, but was stopped <b>at</b> <b>customs</b> because of the smell, which he blamed on her soiling herself.|$|E
25|$|Turkish voters {{living abroad}} {{will have to}} wait for another {{election}} to be able to cast their votes in the countries in which they are residing due to the inability to institute electronic voting.

25|$|The Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey (YSK) {{repeated}} {{its highly}} controversial decision which it initially {{took in the}} local elections to print {{a substantial amount of}} ballot papers more than necessary, totalling 75,708,180. It was reported that the YSK had printed 18 million more ballot papers more than the total number of registered voters. The YSK responded to questions regarding its decision by stating that it was required by law to print extra ballot papers. The YSK president Sadi Güven also stated that the uncertainty of how many people would vote <b>at</b> <b>customs</b> gates was also a factor behind the decision to send a disproportionately large number of ballot papers to national borders. However, the OSCE stated that there was no legal basis for printing such a large amount of ballot papers.|$|E

25|$|Most {{international}} flights {{operated by}} Star Alliance carriers, including all United international flights and select United domestic flights, {{are assigned to}} Boarding Area G's 15 gates (G91, G92–G92A, G93–G98, G99–G99A, G100, G101–G101A, G102) and three remote parking stands. Most international flights operated by SkyTeam, Oneworld and non-aligned international carriers board and deplane at Boarding Area A's 13 gates (gates A1–A10, A11–A11A, A12). However, Star Alliance carriers Asiana Airlines and Avianca El Salvador operate out of Boarding Area A, and non-aligned carriers Aer Lingus, Fiji Airways, WestJet (select flights), and WOW air have designated gates located at Boarding Area G. Boarding Area A is also used by domestic carriers Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Sun Country Airlines, and Hawaiian Airlines. When all gates in an airline's designated international boarding area are full, the passengers will board or deplane from the opposite international boarding area. Air Canada, Aer Lingus, Etihad Airways, and WestJet operate from airports with United States border preclearance, allowing arriving passengers to skip the wait <b>at</b> <b>customs</b> and immigration when they arrive at SFO, and exit the airport from the departure level.|$|E
500|$|In the afterlife, Keamy is a {{business}} associate of Mr. Paik, Sun’s (Yunjin Kim) father. [...] Mr. Paik sends Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) to LA to give Keamy a watch and $25,000, intended to be Keamy's reward for killing Jin. However, the money is confiscated <b>at</b> <b>customs</b> in LAX, and Keamy is disappointed to discover it missing. [...] He takes Jin to a restaurant and has him tied up in a freezer. [...] Shortly after, Omar, one of Keamy's henchmen, captures Sayid and brings him to the same restaurant. Keamy explains to Sayid that his brother has been shot because he borrowed money and failed to pay it back. After Keamy threatens Sayid's family, Sayid retaliates and shoots Keamy in the chest, presumably killing him.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{an episode}} abroad had been {{suggested}} in 2004, but the episode {{was the first}} such occasion. Planning began in April 2007, before Moran had written the script, and continued until the production team travelled to Italy. Several weeks before filming started, a fire disrupted the production. Moving to Rome caused problems for the production team: the equipment truck was delayed for several hours at the Swiss border; the special effects team were delayed for twenty-four hours <b>at</b> <b>Customs</b> in Calais. The production team only had 48 hours to film on location. The aftermath of the eruption was filmed {{on the same night}} as the location shots. To create the falling ash, the special effects team used a large mass of cork, with a [...] "constant supply of debris raining down". Scenes set at the Temple of Sibyl were filmed at the Temple of Peace, Cardiff on 18 and 19 September 2007.|$|E

500|$|Before Davenport left Constantinople {{to travel}} to Aleppo {{and then into the}} desert, he visited the royal stables, and also took {{advantage}} of an opportunity to view the Sultan during a public appearance. [...] He displayed his artistic ability and talent for detail by sketching several portraits of Abdul Hamid II from memory about a half-hour after observing him, as Davenport believed the ruler unwilling to have his image drawn. Davenport's personal impression of the Sultan was sympathetic, viewing him as a frail, elderly man burdened by the weight of his office but kind and fatherly to his children. Davenport compared his appearance as a melding of the late congressman from Maine, Nelson Dingley, with merchant and philanthropist Nathan Straus, commenting of the Sultan, [...] "I thought... that no matter what crimes had been charged to him, his expressionless soldiers, his army and its leaders were possibly more to blame than he." [...] Believing that he needed to keep his sketches a secret, he carried the sketch book in a hidden pocket throughout his journey, and <b>at</b> <b>customs</b> smuggled it onto the steamer home hidden inside a bale of hay.|$|E
500|$|On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were {{travelling}} by limousine to a New York {{airport for}} their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then {{reminded him that}} they would be going through customs and that they had better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: [...] "Jimi, I know you have something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs." [...] Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: [...] "Trust me, Bob, {{no one is going to}} recognize me", to which he replied: [...] "Recognize you? They will be waiting <b>at</b> <b>customs</b> for you." [...] Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication.|$|E

[...] Bowden later praised the [...] "banter" [...] between the group, adding that she found one of Dom's scenes [...] "absolutely hilarious".

2500|$|A Border Services Officer (BSO) is {{a federal}} law {{enforcement}} officer employed by the Canada Border Services Agency. While Border Services Officer is the overarching term for the CBSA's front-line personnel, it is actually not a title derived from legislation. Rather BSOs receive multiple legislative designations such as Customs Officers under the [...] "Customs Act", Immigration Officers under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and Screening Officers under the [...] "Quarantine Act". Border Services Officers are, when enforcing customs- or immigration-related legislation, Peace Officers under the Criminal Code of Canada; however, they can only make arrests for offences under the Code if they are appointed [...] "designated officers" [...] by the Minister of Public Safety under Section 163.4 of the [...] "Customs Act" [...] and are <b>at</b> <b>customs</b> office performing the normal duties of an officer. Border Services Officers are equipped with handcuffs, oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray, batons, and are currently armed with Beretta PX4 Storm pistols.
