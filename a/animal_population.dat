5|$|The {{preservation}} of various pure breeds and strains, including {{some that are}} rare today, was once undertaken in North America {{in large part by}} large agriculture-focused colleges and universities. However, many of these institutions have changed their focus to commercial or crossbred strains, with many herds being sent to slaughter. The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened in some of these cases, leading to the survival and {{preservation of}} some gene stocks. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology-based approaches such as gene mapping and germplasm (genetic material) storage. However, although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds, it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed, and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as live animal populations can. The US federal government rarely supports rare breed live <b>animal</b> <b>population</b> conservation, and while agricultural subsidies were once seen more than they are in present times, they were never focused on individual breeds. The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} records of domesticated red foxes and others, but rarely of {{sustained}} domestication. A recent and notable {{case is the}} Russian silver fox, which resulted in visible and behavioral changes, and is {{a case study of}} an <b>animal</b> <b>population</b> modeling according to human domestication needs. The current group of domesticated silver foxes are the result of nearly fifty years of experiments in the Soviet Union and Russia to domesticate the silver morph of the red fox. This selective breeding resulted in physical and behavioral traits appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cats, dogs, and other animals, such as pigmentation changes, floppy ears, and curly tails. Notably, the new foxes became more tame, allowing themselves to be petted, whimpering to get attention and sniffing and licking their caretakers.|$|E

500|$|Somari is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game, originally {{released in}} 1994 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). An unlicensed port of Sega's 1991 Sega Genesis game Sonic the Hedgehog, {{the game was}} sold primarily around Asia, Russia, and other regions where pirate NES cartridges were distributed. Like the original, players venture to defeat the mad scientist Doctor Robotnik, who plots to turn the <b>animal</b> <b>population</b> of the fictional South Island into evil robots. Unlike the original, the game features Nintendo's mascot Mario as the main character rather than Sonic. The title is a portmanteau of [...] "Sonic" [...] and [...] "Mario".|$|E
500|$|Sonic Advance is a side-scrolling, action-platform game {{reminiscent}} of the original Sonic the Hedgehog games released for the Sega Genesis. Players journey through the fictional South Island to defeat Doctor Eggman, who is attempting to capture the island's <b>animal</b> <b>population</b> {{to turn them into}} evil robots. At the game's start, players select one of four characters, each with their own unique set of moves. Sonic the Hedgehog is the fastest and can perform an [...] "insta-shield" [...] that protects him for a brief moment; Tails can fly or swim for a short amount of time; Knuckles the Echidna can glide through the air and climb walls; and Amy Rose can destroy enemies using her hammer. With the exception of Amy, each character can defeat enemy robots by jumping and curling into a ball, or by performing a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. By entering a cheat code, players can also control Sonic while Tails runs alongside him, similar to Sonic the Hedgehog 2.|$|E
500|$|In June 1964 the Natural Resources Council asked Stephen H. Spurr, {{dean of the}} Graduate School of the University of Michigan and an {{authority}} on forestry and forest ecology, to form a group to evaluate the proposed Rampart Dam. The Spurr report determined that the scenarios offered as justification for the project were overly optimistic with respect to Alaskaâ€™s projected long-term population growth, its per capita use of electricity, and the predicted rate of entry of electroprocess industries like the aluminum industry (which had substantial power requirements) into Alaska. Moreover, the proposed dam would have greatly reduced the catch of five species of Pacific salmon, especially the chinook (king), chum (dog) and coho (silver) salmon. It would also eliminate vast numbers of migratory waterfowl, including an estimated 1.5 million ducks and 12,500 geese that migrated annually from the Yukon flats. [...] There would also have been {{a sharp decline in}} both large mammals - the moose, black and grizzly bear, and caribou - and smaller mammals: [...] muskrats, mink, beavers, and river otters in aquatic habitats, and marten, wolverines, weasels, lynx, snowshoe hares, red fox and red squirrels in terrestrial or upland habitats. Spurrâ€™s report noted: [...] "is a truism of wildlife ecology that displacement of a population from the area where it normally lives is tantamount to eliminating it completely. Adjoining habitats ordinarily are carrying all the wildlife that the local resources will support. In short, loss of habitat is synonymous with loss of the <b>animal</b> <b>population</b> supported by the inundated habitat." ...|$|E
