40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feasibility {{study of a}} method for turbocharging single cylinder, four-stroke internal combustion engines. Turbocharging is not conventionally used with single cylinder engines because of the timing mismatch between when the turbo is powered, during the exhaust stroke, and when it can deliver air to the cylinder, during the intake stroke. The proposed solution involves an <b>air</b> <b>capacitor</b> on the intake side of the engine between the turbocharger and intake valves. The capacitor acts as a buffer and would be implemented as a new style of intake manifold with a larger volume than traditional systems. In order for the <b>air</b> <b>capacitor</b> to be practical, {{it needs to be}} sized large enough to maintain the turbocharger pressure during the intake stroke, cause minimal turbo lag, and significantly increase the density of the intake air. By creating multiple flow models of air through the turbocharged engine system, we found that the optimal size <b>air</b> <b>capacitor</b> is between four and five times the engine capacity. For a capacitor sized for a one-liter engine, the lag time was found to be approximately two seconds, which would be acceptable for slowly accelerating applications such as tractors, or steady state applications such as generators. The density increase that can be achieved in the capacitor, compared to air at standard ambient temperature and pressure, was found to vary between fifty percent for adiabatic compression and no heat transfer from the capacitor, to eighty percent for perfect heat transfer. These increases in density are proportional to, to first order, the anticipated power increases that could be realized with a turbocharger and <b>air</b> <b>capacitor</b> system applied to a single cylinder, four-stroke engine.

40|$|Agriculture is {{the main}} source of {{livelihood}} for a majority of India's population. However, despite the number of workers, the yield and the yield of principal crops in India is much lower than that in developed nations. One of the reasons for this is the lack of farming mechanization in India. One of the common ways to run farming equipment is by using a single-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine. Diesel engines can be turbocharged in order to make them more efficient for less cost. A method has been found to turbocharge a single-cylinder diesel engine by adding an <b>air</b> <b>capacitor</b> to form a buffer between the intake and exhaust strokes. This thesis analyzes how the size and heat transfer of the <b>air</b> <b>capacitor</b> for this turbocharged diesel engine are correlated to engine performance and fuel economy. According to the modeled engine, a 3. 0 liter capacitor had better peak power and fuel economy at high loads and speeds than a 2. 4 or 1. 25 liter capacitor. Additionally, forced convection cooling on the capacitor using a fan allowed the intake air density to increase, and the engine to have better fuel economy than the. However the peak power and fuel economy of the modeled naturally aspirated engine was better than the turbocharged engine for speeds below 2500 rpm. The general trends from the model were reflected in the experimental data. The forced convection increased cooling, and improved the intake air density. However, it was difficult to make any confident recommendations about the fuel economy based on the experimental data. by Colleen McCoy. Thesis: S.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a method for}} turbocharging single cylinder four stroke internal combustion engines, a model used to evaluate it, an experimental setup used to test it, and {{the findings of this}} experiment. A turbocharged engine has better fuel economy, cost efficiency, and power density than an equivalently sized, naturally aspirated engine. Most multi-cylinder diesel engines are turbocharged for this reason. However, due to the timing mismatch between the exhaust stroke, when the turbocharger is powered, and the intake stroke, when the engine intakes air, turbocharging is not used in commercial single cylinder engines. Single cylinder engines are ubiquitous in developing world off grid power applications such as tractors, generators, and water pumps due to their low cost. Turbocharging these engines could give users a lower cost and more fuel efficient engine. The proposed solution is to add an <b>air</b> <b>capacitor,</b> {{in the form of a}} large volume intake manifold, in between the turbocharger compressor and the engine intake to smooth out the flow. by Michael Rafael Buchman.

The resulting inductor has a temperature coefficient of 6 to 8 parts per million per degree Celsius. [...] Vackář points out that common <b>air</b> variable <b>capacitors</b> have a stability of 2 parts per thousand; to build a VFO with a stability of 50 parts per million requires that the variable capacitor is only 1/40 of the tuning capacity (.002/40 = 50ppm). The stability requirement also implies the variable capacitor may only tune a limited range of 1:1.025. Larger tuning ranges require switching stable fixed capacitors or inductors.|$|R

25|$|For <b>air</b> {{dielectric}} <b>capacitors</b> {{the breakdown}} field strength is of the order 2 to 5 MV/m; for mica the breakdown is 100 to 300 MV/m; for oil, 15 to 25 MV/m; it can be much less when other materials are used for the dielectric. The dielectric is used in very thin layers and so absolute breakdown voltage of capacitors is limited. Typical ratings for capacitors used for general electronics applications range from a few volts to 1 kV. As the voltage increases, the dielectric must be thicker, making high-voltage capacitors larger per capacitance than those rated for lower voltages. The breakdown voltage is critically affected by {{factors such as the}} geometry of the capacitor conductive parts; sharp edges or points increase the electric field strength at that point and can lead to a local breakdown. Once this starts to happen, the breakdown quickly tracks through the dielectric until it reaches the opposite plate, leaving carbon behind and causing a short (or relatively low resistance) circuit. The results can be explosive as the short in the capacitor draws current from the surrounding circuitry and dissipates the energy. However, in capacitors with particular dielectrics and thin metal electrodes shorts are not formed after breakdown. It happens because a metal melts or evaporates in a breakdown vicinity, isolating it {{from the rest of the}} capacitor.|$|R

Its effects at micro-scale level sharply {{depend on the}} structure layouts and size of MEMS devices. The damping phenomenon of comb microaccelerometers is investigated. The air between fixed plate electrodes and movable plate electrodes cannot flow freely and is compressed. The air damping, therefore, exhibits both viscous effects and stiffness effects. The former generates a drag force like that in macromechanical systems, and the damping force {{is proportional to the}} velocity of movable electrodes. The latter stiffens the rigidity of structure, and the stiffening level is related to the gap value of capacitors, internal pressure, and temperature. This paper focuses on the dependence of the squeeze film <b>air</b> damping on <b>capacitor</b> gaps. The simulation and experiments indicate that the squeeze film effect is sharply affected by the gap value when the structural dimensions decrease.

40|$|Heavily boron-doped silicon microstructures {{fabricated}} using deep-boron diffusions and boron etch-stops {{have been}} widely used in a variety of integrated sensors and actuators. For many applications, having knowledge of the mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, intrinsic stress, and fracture stress of these films is very important in predicting the response parameters of the sensors and actuators that utilize them. These parameters include mechanical resonant frequency, sensitivity, bandwidth, linearity, and operating range. This paper describes the measurement of fracture stress, Young's modulus, and intrinsic stress of boron-doped silicon microstructures at doping concentrations above 5 x 1019 cm- 3. The measurement of fracture stress is performed using 15 microm thick cantilever beams of widths ranging from 20 to 150 microm. The beams were bent to fracture and the maximum fracture stress was measured to be [approximate] 1. 8 x 1010 dyne cm- 2 which is a factor of about six higher than silicon structures with larger dimensions (bulk silicon). Young's modulus and intrinsic stress were measured using a novel custom-designed doubly supported beam (bridge) structure. The measurement technique uses the characteristic pull-in voltage of the beam as electrostatic voltage is applied across an <b>air</b> gap <b>capacitor</b> {{in the middle of the}} beam, which causes the bridge to collapse. The Young's modulus for (110) -oriented silicon was measured to be [approximate] (2 - 2. 2) x 1012 dyne cm- 2 which is 20 %- 30 % higher than undoped silicon.

The tuning and matching network employs stepper motors which turn high power <b>air</b> gap <b>capacitors</b> in a “moving grid” optimization strategy to minimize the reflected power from a directional coupler. In the duplexer circuit, digitally controlled relays are used to switch different lengths of coax cable appropriate for the different radio frequencies. A home-built pulse programmer card controls the timing of radio frequency pulses sent to the probe, while data acquisition and control software is written in Microsoft Quick Basic.

The NQR spectrometer described in Part I of this thesis is used as one of the receivers. S/N measurements are comparable to those observed using single coils. No evidence of cross talk is evident in the spectra even after considerable signal averaging.

40|$|Microaccelerometers have {{established}} {{themselves as a}} vital piece of the global microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) market with applications spanning automotive, industrial, military, biomedical, and consumer electronics sectors. They remain one of the top-selling silicon sensors, with $ 1. 6 billion in revenue reported in 2011 equating to 15 % of the total MEMS market. Continued, expected growth {{in the next few}} years demands innovation to meet new industry requirements. Current commercial accelerometer designs are based on a differential capacitor structure which measures the change in capacitance between a set of interdigitated fingers. These fingers are separated by air gaps in high aspect ratio, suspended polysilicon microstructures. Despite its widespread use, the <b>air</b> gap <b>capacitor</b> has some significant drawbacks. It involves a release step during fabrication which introduces complexity and variation in the devices. In addition, these transducers are subject to pull in and stiction which can render a device inoperable. Air gap devices are vulnerable to particulates requiring complicated packaging steps which increase cost and yield of production. Moreover, these devices are also subject to electrical drift. All of these issues can be addressed by replacing this air gap with a dielectric. Not only does it mitigate these concerns, it also offers potential for smaller device footprint, more robust design, and increased shock survival. This project developed a new accelerometer design sandwiching a thin film dielectric between two electrodes. This capacitor was patterned on top of a bending flexure which supported a large hanging mass. In the presence of an external acceleration, the deflection of the suspension beams caused a deformation of the dielectric film resulting in a change in capacitance. Fabrication using an SOI substrate allowed for increased deflection and process control. by Bethany Ruth Kroese. Thesis: M.

From C-V measurements of the MOS capacitors, the extracted TaN work function, effective charge densities, and flatband voltage values were found to be between 4. 23 and 4. 42 eV, - 10 (11) and - 10 (12) cm(- 2), and - 0. 12 and 0. 25 V, respectively. From I-V measurements of the Schottky diodes, work function and ideality factor values between 4. 40 and 4. 53 eV, and 1. 0 and 1. 9, respectively, were extracted. The variation of the TaN work function (extracted from C-V and I-V curves), flatband voltage, and ideality factor values were related to dipole variations (at the TaN/SiO 2 interface), Ta and N vacancies in the TaN film, and oxygen incorporation on the TaN film surface.
