5|$|As {{with most}} of the northeastern United States, the number of tornadoes peaks in the summer months, {{normally}} in July or August. Hartford County has had the most tornadoes in the state, although since 1950 Litchfield County has reported the most tornadoes. Several <b>areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> struck more than once, and Waterbury has been struck by no less than four tornadoes since 1955.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have coexisted {{with humans}} for {{thousands}} of years and in some <b>areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, the <b>area</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{converted}} to a deer park {{with the introduction of}} six spotted deer. Subsequently, the whole <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> declared a wildlife sanctuary.|$|R
50|$|The <b>area</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{inhabited}} {{since the}} ancient times. In the Iron Age the <b>area</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> conquered by the Scythians, by the Celts, {{then by the}} Huns. After the Hungarian Conquest, there were many small villages in the area.|$|R

5|$|Taman Sari {{consisted}} of four distinct areas: a large artificial lake with islands and pavilions {{located in the}} west, a bathing complex in the centre, a complex of pavilions and pools in the south, and a smaller lake in the east. Today only the central bathing complex is well preserved, while the other <b>areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> largely occupied by the Kampung Taman settlement.|$|E
5|$|As {{a primary}} route to southwestern England, the A303 is {{frequently}} congested on its single carriageway sections. As {{it passes through}} the Stonehenge World Heritage Site and the Blackdown Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, attempts to upgrade the road in those <b>areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> controversial. In particular, the Stonehenge tunnel, which would see the A303 rerouted underground, has been proposed and delayed several times. Nevertheless, the road remains a popular alternative to motorway driving, and was commemorated in a book and BBC Four television documentary by Tom Fort in the early 2010s.|$|E

5|$|Fiji's native birdlife {{has been}} badly {{affected}} by agriculture, deforestation and introduced pests like rats and mongooses. Although Important Bird <b>Areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> established on Taveuni {{and the forest}} east of Vanua Levu, conservation problems persist. The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man-made landscapes; it is neither a ground nor hole nester, so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle mynas. Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity. The potential introduction of other species, such as snakes, or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in the Ellendale and Georgetown <b>areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{environmentally}} cleared, {{which means}} design and engineering can proceed as funding becomes available. The Federal Highway Administration approved the Ellendale Area Environmental Assessment with a Finding of No Significant Impact in 2010. DelDOT plans to upgrade US 113 on its present alignment through the study area, which runs from south of Redden Road to north of DE 16. Along {{much of the}} route, service roads would be constructed parallel to the present highway {{to provide access to}} properties along US 113 and to connect with the local road system and reduce the number of contact points with US 113. Interchanges are planned at Redden Road and DE 16.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the site}} of the {{recently}} closed Homestake gold mine near Lead was chosen as the location of a new underground research facility, the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory. Despite a growing state population and recent economic development, many rural <b>areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> struggling over the past 50 years with locally declining populations and the emigration of educated young adults to larger South Dakota cities, such as Rapid City or Sioux Falls, or to other states. Mechanization and consolidation of agriculture has contributed greatly to the declining number of smaller family farms and the resulting economic and demographic challenges facing rural towns.|$|E

5|$|Most of Sikkim, {{including}} Gangtok, is underlain by Precambrian rocks {{which contains}} foliated phyllites and schists; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides. Surface runoff of water by natural streams (jhora) and man-made drains {{has contributed to}} the risk of landslides. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount Kanchenjunga (8,598m or 28,208ft)—the world's third-highest peak—is visible {{to the west of the}} city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most <b>areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other <b>areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|When {{speakers}} of different languages interact closely, it is typical for their languages to influence each other. Through sustained language contact over long periods, linguistic traits diffuse between languages, and languages belonging to different families may converge {{to become more}} similar. In areas where many languages are in close contact, this {{may lead to the}} formation of language areas in which unrelated languages share a number of linguistic features. A number of such language <b>areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> documented, among them, the Balkan language area, the Mesoamerican language area, and the Ethiopian language area. Also, larger areas such as South Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia have sometimes been considered language areas, because of widespread diffusion of specific areal features.|$|E

5|$|The overall {{infrastructure}} of Malaysia {{is one of}} the most developed in Asia and ranked 8th in Asia and 25th in the world. Malaysia is ranked 19th in the world for its quality roads, quality of port infrastructure and quality of air transport infrastructure but ranked 39th in quality of electricity supply. Its telecommunications network is second only to Singapore's in Southeast Asia, with 4.7million fixed-line subscribers and more than 30million cellular subscribers. The country has seven international ports, the major one being the Port Klang. There are 200 industrial parks along with specialised parks such as Technology Park Malaysia and Kulim Hi-Tech Park. Fresh water is available to over 95 per cent of the population. During the colonial period, development was mainly concentrated in economically powerful cities and in areas forming security concerns. Although rural <b>areas</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the focus of great development, they still lag behind areas such as the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The telecommunication network, although strong in urban areas, is less available to the rural population.|$|E
