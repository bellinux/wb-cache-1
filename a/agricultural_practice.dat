5|$|Madagascar's varied fauna and flora are {{endangered}} by human activity. Since {{the arrival of}} humans around 2,350years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90percent of its original forest. This forest loss is largely fueled by tavy ("fat"), a traditional slash-and-burn <b>agricultural</b> <b>practice</b> imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers. Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice {{not only for its}} practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (fomba malagasy). As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1400 years ago. By the 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests. More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century. According to a conservative estimate, about 40percent of the island's original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80percent. In addition to traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>practice,</b> wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.|$|E

Ibn Bassāl had travelled widely across the Islamic world, returning with a detailed knowledge of agronomy. His practical and systematic book describes over 180 plants and how to propagate and care for them, including leaf and root vegetables, herbs, spices and trees. Abū l-Khayr described in minute detail how olive trees should be grown, grafted, treated for disease, and harvested, and gave similar detail for crops such as cotton.|$|E

In the United Kingdom, some grasslands have gained a measure of legal protection as Sites of Special Scientific Interest because of their waxcap interest.|$|E
25|$|The early Middle Ages, {{from the}} fifth century to the tenth century, were a period of climate deterioration, with a drop in {{temperature}} {{and an increase in}} rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive. With a lack of significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that farming was based around a single homestead or a small cluster of three or four homes, each probably containing a nuclear family, with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance. The climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than wheat. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare. Christian missionaries from Ireland may have changed <b>agricultural</b> <b>practice,</b> bringing innovations such as the horizontal water mill and mould board ploughs, which were more effective in turning the soil.|$|E

25|$|Historians have {{suggested}} multiple {{reasons for the}} sparking of the Bar Kokhba revolt, long-term and proximate. Several elements {{are believed to have}} contributed to the rebellion; changes in administrative law, the diffuse presence of Romans, alterations in <b>agricultural</b> <b>practice</b> with a shift from landowning to sharecropping, the impact of a possible period of economic decline, and an upsurge of nationalism, the latter influenced by similar revolts among the Jewish communities in Egypt, Cyrenaica and Mesopotamia during the reign of Trajan. The proximate reasons seem to centre around {{the construction of a new}} city, Aelia Capitolina over the ruins of Jerusalem and the erection of a temple to Jupiter on the Temple mount. One interpretation involves the visit in 130 CE of the Roman Emperor Hadrian to the ruins of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. At first sympathetic towards the Jews, Hadrian promised to rebuild the Temple, but the Jews felt betrayed when they found out that he intended to build a temple dedicated to Jupiter upon the ruins of the Second Temple. A rabbinic version of this story claims that Hadrian planned on rebuilding the Temple, but that a malevolent Samaritan convinced him not to. The reference to a malevolent Samaritan is, however, a familiar device of Jewish literature.|$|E
500|$|From the 8th century, {{the medieval}} Islamic world {{underwent}} a transformation in <b>agricultural</b> <b>practice,</b> {{described by the}} historian Andrew Watson as the Arab Agricultural Revolution. This transformation was driven {{by a number of}} factors including the diffusion of many crops and plants along Muslim trade routes, the spread of more advanced farming techniques, and an agricultural-economic system which promoted increased yields and efficiency. The shift in <b>agricultural</b> <b>practice</b> changed the economy, population distribution, vegetation cover, agricultural production, population levels, urban growth, the distribution of the labour force, cooking, diet, and clothing across the Islamic world. Muslim traders covered much of the Old World, and trade enabled the diffusion of many crops, plants and farming techniques across the region, as well as the adaptation of crops, plants and techniques from beyond the Islamic world. This diffusion introduced major crops to Europe by way of Al-Andalus, along with the techniques for their cultivation and cuisine. Sugar cane, rice, and cotton were among the major crops transferred, along with citrus and other fruit trees, nut trees, vegetables such as aubergine, spinach and chard, and the use of [...] spices such as cumin, coriander, nutmeg and cinnamon. Intensive irrigation, crop rotation, and agricultural manuals were widely adopted. Irrigation, partly based on Roman technology, made use of noria water wheels, water mills, dams and reservoirs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{intensification}} of agriculture {{has led to}} a loss of biodiversity and subsequently to a decrease in ecosystem services, including regulation of pests by natural enemies. Biological regulation of pests is a complex process affected by both landscape configuration and <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices.</b> Although modeling tools are needed to design innovative integrated pest management strategies that consider tritrophic interactions at the landscape scale, landscape models that consider <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> as levers to enhance biological regulation are lacking. To begin filling this gap, we developed a grid-based lattice model called Mosaic-Pest that simulates the spatio-temporal dynamics of Meligethes aeneus, a major pest of oilseed rape, and its parasitoid, Tersilochus heterocerus through a landscape that changes through time according to <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices.</b> The following <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> were assumed to influence the tritrophic system and were included in the model: crop allocation in time and space, ploughing, and trap crop planting. To test the effect of <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> on biological regulation across landscape configurations, we used a complete factorial design with the variables described below and ran long-term simulations using Mosaic-Pest. The model showed that crop rotation and the use of trap crop greatly affected pollen beetle densities and parasitism rates while ploughing had only a small effect. The use of Mosaic-Pest as a tool to select the combination of <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> that best limit the pest population is discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Beekeepers in Western {{countries}} have been reporting slow declines of stocks for many years, apparently due to impaired protein production, changes in <b>agricultural</b> <b>practice,</b> or unpredictable weather. In early 2007, abnormally high die-offs (30–70% of hives) of European honey bee colonies occurred in North America; such a decline seems unprecedented in recent history. This has been dubbed [...] "colony collapse disorder" [...] (CCD); {{it is unclear whether}} this is simply an accelerated phase of the general decline due to stochastically more adverse conditions in 2006, or a novel phenomenon.

We focused on twelve livestock farms distributed along two gradients: i) intensity of <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices,</b> and ii) density of AES on farm territory. In each farm, four types of permanent grasslands were selected in which variables of <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> (date of mowing, livestock rate, fertilization), landscape (AES categories, AES density, AES connectivity) and floristic composition are sampled. Variance partitioning analysis showed that taxonomic diversity is mainly due to landscape variables, like density of hedges and diversity of AES included in a 300 m buffer zone around the floristic survey. The variance of functional indices depended both <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> (livestock and mineral fertilization) and landscape variables such as density of hedges...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{different}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> on the mycorrhizal symbiosis is important for agricultural production and the sustainable use of soil. We investigated the composition and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soils from fields under different <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> (conventional and organic cereal fields, leys and permanent pastures) in southern Sweden. The diversity of AMF {{was found to be}} greatest in permanent pastures, corroborating evidence that <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> such as tillage impair AMF diversity. Neither geographical location nor soil type nor any of the major soil characteristics we measured impacted AMF diversity or community composition. AMF community composition was significantly affected by the different <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices,</b> particularly conventional management, which reduced AMF diversity. Of the cereal fields sampled, those under organic management held the greatest AMF diversity, and in a glasshouse experiment this greater diversity was positively related to barley phosphorus uptake and grain biomass production. Our results demonstrate the impact of different <b>agricultural</b> <b>practices</b> on AMF communities. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of organic farming to sustain greater AMF diversity relative to conventional farming, and the potential importance of this increased diversity for sustainable cereal production...|$|R
