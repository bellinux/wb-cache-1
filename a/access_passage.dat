5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 7 February 1827 at the Saint Hyacinthe pit, fire broke out in an <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> for the workers to descend into the pit. Thick smoke spread inside the mine and asphyxiated 46 workers {{employed}} in the coal extraction tunnels. Seven young men and two fathers were found dead.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there have}} been several {{building}} campaigns, the architectural ensemble is very homogeneous. It is also innovative: a central double staircase is substituted for the traditional screw tower included {{in a corner of the}} courtyard. The whole organization of the house, now thought around a median axis, is modified. This modern and probably pioneering distribution in Toulouse was somewhat disturbed by the opening of the <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> to the garden (18th or 19th century).|$|E
5000|$|The Western Shoshone did not {{consent to}} the {{inclusion}} of their property into the boundaries or jurisdiction of any US state or territory. The Western Shoshone possess all the interests which the United States sought to purchase by the treaty for $5,000 per year for 20 years. The United States failed to make any but the first payment to the Shoshone, but exercised its rights of <b>access,</b> <b>passage</b> and taking of territory {{for the construction of}} railroads, and later of federal agency management, by such agencies as the Bureau of Land Management, of what it called federal public lands.|$|E
50|$|The side wings {{included}} {{provision for}} arrivals and departures. The southerly departure side consisted of an ornamented portal with steps and three large arches supported by columns, that were crowned with statues. <b>Access</b> <b>passages</b> {{to the left}} and right of these led to the two two-storey office buildings. Through this portal, one entered the ticket hall and the departure platform. On slightly elevated terrain, the departure side offered the most impressive view of the station from the southeast. This motif was repeated in the northerly arrival side; however because of the grade, the building's foundation was lower and the portal not built up as high, as arcades offered passengers who were waiting for carriages or carts protection from the elements.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the terms}} of a Deeds of Dedication signed with the Government, 3010 m2 of the ground floor was set aside for public <b>access,</b> {{pedestrian}} <b>passage</b> and passive recreation. However, the company has the right to organise exhibitions there, and charge fees. The exact details of the concessions to the developers were not made public.|$|R
50|$|The comedian Hyacinthe {{made his}} {{debut in the}} place in 1821. In 1826, Louis Comte {{had to leave the}} passage des Panoramas for {{security}} reasons. He then commissioned the architects Allard and Brunneton {{the construction of a new}} hall in the Choiseul area being redeveloped at that time. With double <b>access</b> to <b>passage</b> Choiseul and rue Neuve-Ventadour (current rue Monsigny), it was inaugurated on 23 January 1827.|$|R
50|$|The {{driver and}} the {{commander}} seats are {{located at the}} front of the vehicle, the turret in the middle and the troop's compartment at the rear. There is three large day periscopes at the front position of driver and commander and one on each side that provide excellent visibility. Eleven infantrymen can be seated at the rear of the hull on individual seats down each side of the hull facing inwards. All shock-absorbing seats are fitted with five-point seatbelts as standard. Back of the driver and commander position, there is an <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> to the troop compartment at the right side of the hull. The troops leave and enter the vehicle via a large hydraulic ramp mounted at the rear of the hull.|$|E
50|$|The second chamber {{is similar}} to the first and lies {{directly}} beneath the apex of the pyramid. High in the southern wall of the chamber is an entrance, now reached by a large wooden staircase built for the convenience of tourists. This gives onto a short horizontal passage that leads to the third and final chamber with a corbelled roof 50 ft high. The first two chambers have their long axis aligned north-south, but this chamber's long axis is aligned east-west. Unlike the first two chambers, which have fine smooth floors on the same level as the passages, the floor of the third chamber is very rough and sunk below the level of the <b>access</b> <b>passage.</b> It is believed that this is the work of robbers searching for treasure in what is thought to have been the burial chamber of the pyramid.|$|E
50|$|In this version, the Batcave is {{not located}} {{directly}} underneath Wayne Manor, but was originally {{in the woods}} on the manor's outskirts, with Bruce discovering the cave when he fell into them after running away during his parents' funeral. After Wayne Manor was destroyed in some unspecified fire, Bruce and Alfred relocated to a glass house built above the Batcave, which consists primarily of a long <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> {{that leads to a}} nearby lake and can be used for the Batmobile or (presumably) the Batplane to gain access. The elevator leading to the house also includes a chamber with an old Robin costume, apparently a memorial, while an upper level includes the Batcomputer and a workshop where Bruce and Alfred can work on Batman's various weapons, including the synthesiser used to distort his voice in the regular suit and the armour he uses to fight Superman.|$|E

50|$|Back {{outside at}} the ship, Meg {{is trying to}} get Steppenwolf to answer the damned call on the PDA, but the PDA ran out of batteries. Octavio then told {{something}} he forgot to mention, he set explosive charges around the <b>access</b> <b>passage.</b> Not only Steppenwolf has {{to get away from the}}m, he'll have to get away from the compound as possible. Back at the lab, we see Steppenwolf is pushed by someone. It was the mutated Reggie who is now a monster and tries to kill Alan. After Steppenwolf finds the chemical bombs with the telescope, he uses them on the doors to shoot the rockets and the main radar that controls the cannons that are automatic. After the radar was destroyed, Steppenwolf can use the rocket blasters to kill Reggie. However, if Steppenwolf uses two traps and blasts him, Reggie will survive and destroy the cannons. The last trap and cannon will finally kill Reggie, leaving his decapitated head.|$|E
5000|$|Unusually for a [...] "deep level" [...] tube station, Arsenal {{possesses}} neither escalators nor lifts. Instead, {{a sloping}} passageway leads {{down to the}} platforms. This {{is due to the}} combination of the tunnels being both relatively shallow at this point and being some distance from the station entrance (being underneath the East Coast Main Line). Due to short flights of stairs {{at both ends of the}} passageway the station is not wheelchair accessible. When the station was rebuilt in the early 1930s an extra tunnel was dug to platform level from the main <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> in anticipation of increased traffic, which is now used to handle the large crowds on match days. The station has a [...] "tidal" [...] system unique on the Underground network, with a narrow section on one side divided from the main passageway by a full-height fence. The narrow section is used on match days for the lighter flow, according to time of day—for passengers catching trains before matches, or leaving the station afterwards.|$|E
50|$|Djedefre's pyramid was architecturally {{different}} from those of his immediate predecessors in that the chambers were beneath the pyramid instead of inside. The pyramid was built over a natural mound and the chambers were created using the 'pit and ramp' method, previously used on some mastaba tombs. Djedefre dug a pit 21m x 9m and 20m deep in the natural mound. A ramp was created at an angle of 22º35' and the chambers and <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> were built within the pit and on the ramp. Once the 'inner chambers' were finished, the pit and ramp were filled in and the pyramid built over the top. This allowed the chambers to be made without tunneling, and avoided the structural complications of making chambers within the body of the pyramid itself.He also reverted to an earlier style of construction by creating a rectangular enclosure wall oriented north-south, similar to those of Djoser and Sekhemkhet.Several Pyramids and Sun Temples were built over natural mounds; utilising these may have been a way of shortening the actual work required, although the mound may have been symbolic of the Primaeval Mound of the Egyptian Creation mythology.|$|E

5000|$|In 1814-1815 Smith was {{commissioned}} to design modifications to Brucklay Castle including remodelling {{the main entrance}} hall and frontage; {{this was in the}} neoclassical style. Work was also undertaken on the second and third storeys of the north elevation. Returning in 1820, Smith extended the old stable block in a mainly one and a half-storey Gothic style with a central pyramid roofed two-storey tower. That year he also began work on an extensive enlargement of Cluny Castle for Colonel John Gordon. Originally a Z-plan castle built c. 1604, the later extensions were described by architectural historian H. Gordon Slade as [...] "the most shocking mis-use of architectural effort and granite in the north east of Scotland." [...] Smith also worked on nearby Castle Fraser constructing an access stairway between the great hall on the first floor and the rear courtyard entrance. The two-storey building it was housed within had a glazed cupola at its centre under a lead roof. Two crow stepped gatehouses were constructed between an arched gateway entrance and various <b>access</b> <b>passages</b> joined the first floor wings. He was also responsible for the library design.|$|R
50|$|The NiD 590's two pilots sat {{side-by-side}} at {{the front}} of the cabin. Their cockpit was semi-enclosed with glazing ahead and above but with open sides fitted with wind deflectors. They had dual controls and seat-type parachutes. This part of the cabin, under the wing, was conventional, with box-frame sides and bulkheads; just behind the seats there was an <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> with a side door from which both the controls and the rear cabin could be reached. Aft of this the final conventional bulkhead leaned backwards towards the tail, forming the start of the NiD 590's most unusual feature: the rest of the cabin was under an arched roof, extending from the forward cabin structure but the sides were only about 1 m high, with no glazing. Careful fuselage design deflected the slipstream beyond the rear of the cabin and provided its various occupants with a calm working environment and an excellent all-round and downwards view of the French colonies below. Their rear view was greatly enhanced by the very unusual rear fuselage: beyond the trailing edge the aft end of the cabin tapered rapidly in plan onto the vertical part of a T-shaped bulkhead supporting the arched upper structure. Behind it, the fuselage maintained this upper structure on two longerons, with very narrow, concave sides down to a third, lower, longeron. This narrow rear fuselage provided a wide rearward and downward view even from the back of the cabin where the rear gunner sat with a twin Lewis gun on a flexible mount.|$|E
40|$|Taking {{time-varying}} parking {{demands and}} supplies into account, this paper develops a dynamic parking choice model to simulate drivers’ searching for parking spaces between parking lots. In this study, each parking lot has one <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> and vehicles can move or wait for entering {{the park in}} the <b>access</b> <b>passage.</b> The flow propagation formula in the <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> of parking lots is established to obtain the number of vehicles entering the parking lot from the <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> within each time interval. This paper brings forward the instantaneous dynamic user-optimal condition of dynamic parking choice, constructs an equivalent variational inequality (VI) model and develops a diagonalization algorithm to solve the model. A numerical example demonstrates the rate of in-flow, the rate of out-flow, link flow, instantaneous travel time on each link or <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> of the parking lot, and the amount and routes of cruising traffic at each time point...|$|E
40|$|Diesel engine {{in-cylinder}} pressure {{analysis is}} important for engine research and diagnosis. It has been a subject of interest right from the inception of internal combustion engines. Engine cylinder pressure measurements {{provide insight into the}} combustion process and the accuracy of these measurements governs the quality of analyses of different combustion modes of the engine. Since the in-cylinder pressure increases abruptly after the start of combustion, non-flush mounting of the pressure transducer creates standing/resonant waves in the <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> which severely affect the recorded pressure fidelity by introducing undesired noise. The challenge is to get rid of these pressure pulsations and characterize the unaccounted noise which can lead to erroneous determination of different combustion parameters and characteristics. This work focuses on online filtering of the noisy pressure data so as to obviate the need of any post-processing for combustion and noise analysis. An online filtering algorithm is defined which is a combination of a five-point moving average filter and a forward and reverse Butterworth digital filter. The filter is tested for its robustness over different engine operating conditions such as engine load, speed, boost etc. The cut-off frequency of the filter is determined on a cycle-by-cycle basis using an algorithm based on the power spectral density of the pressure signal. The noise component is segregated from the pressure trace by means of pressure decomposition technique and the peak noise power is attributed to the <b>access</b> <b>passage</b> resonance frequency. Further development of this approach can be used to achieve optimal combustion control by means of the development of optimal injection strategies in order to fulfill emission reduction and performance requirements in Diesel engines...|$|E

30|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) {{ceramics}} have a {{wide variety}} of potential applications due to their excellent performances, such as extremely high hardness, high thermal resistance, high chemical stability, good mechanical properties, and good electronic properties [1 – 4]. Several studies have reported the preparation of SiC ceramic derived from naturally occurring plant biomass, such as wood, bamboo, and agricultural waste [5 – 10]. Naturally, occurring plants have complex hierarchical pore structure due to long-term genetic evolution and optimization [11]. The specific pore structure can provide the <b>access</b> <b>passage,</b> storage space, and reaction space for external silicon (Si) sources. These structures can be preserved in the final SiC ceramic samples. In this way, plant-based SiC ceramics both possess unique biomorphic porous construction and traditional ceramic properties, having attracted much attention and led to extensive research.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{draws upon}} {{empirical}} insights {{provided by a}} two-year research project relating to security governance at the European Football Championships 2008 in Switzerland and Austria (Euro 2008). The objective is to study the role and modalities of border and access control {{in the context of}} sport mega-event security on various national and urban scales. This investigation seeks to demonstrate that security and surveillance at sport mega-events are shaped, fundamentally, by efforts towards the increased flexibility, variability and mobility (in both space and time) of carefully orchestrated <b>access,</b> <b>passage</b> and border controls. At stake in this “mobile border assemblage” are a large variety of phenomena, places and scales: from classic border controls at the national boundaries {{to a wide range of}} inter- and intra-urban enclosures and passage points (Graham, 2010) aimed at monitoring, restricting, filtering and also managing and facilitating different forms and modalities of circulation (of people and objects). This paper explores the reasons, logics and characteristics of this phenomenon. Following Michel Foucaultʼs conceptual distinction between (apparatuses of) “discipline” and “security” (Foucault, 2009), the paper also aims to bring to the fore a number of more fundamental insights into the spatialities of contemporary security and surveillance. Two key issues stand out: firstly, the complex challenges associated with the necessary balancing and reconciliation of the core requirements of mobility and surveillance in contemporary security governance, and secondly, the multi-scalar, public-private interests and forms of expertise associated with this phenomenon...|$|E
