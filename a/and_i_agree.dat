Colfer said, [...] "I would like to do something besides say 'I love you,' and I think Darren [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> on that. We're ready for the next step. They've been together for a while. Let's throw some spice and drama into that." [...] In September 2012, Criss echoed Colfer's sentiment, [...] "We're like an old married couple now. Let's shake it up!" ...|$|E

[...] In September 2012, Criss seconded Colfer, [...] "We're like an old married couple now. Let's shake it up!" ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{observed}} that Burton {{was more interested}} in the Joker and the art and set production design than Batman or anything else in terms of characterization and screentime. Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering Thomas and Martha Wayne; in the comic book, Joe Chill is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm said it was Burton's idea to have the Joker murder Wayne's parents. [...] "The Writer's Strike was going on, and Tim had the other writers do that. I also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave. Fans were ticked off with that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree.</b> That would have been Alfred's last day of employment at Wayne Manor," [...] Hamm said.|$|E

500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like {{you can do all}} that stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She also noted that the album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree,</b> It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} several vocal {{tracks for}} a possible new Simon & Garfunkel album, Simon decided to adopt it as his own solo album. Garfunkel refused to learn the songs {{in the studio and}} would not give up his longstanding cannabis and cigarette habits despite Simon's requests. An official spokesperson remarked, [...] "Paul simply felt the material he wrote is so close to his own life {{that it had to be}} his own record. Art was hoping to be on the album, but I'm sure there will be other projects that they will work on together. They are still friends." [...] The material was later released on Simon's 1983 effort Hearts and Bones. Another rift opened between the duo when the lengthy recording of Simon's 1986 album Graceland prevented Garfunkel from working with Roy Halee on a Christmas album. In 1990, the duo was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Garfunkel thanked his partner, calling him [...] "the person who most enriched my life by putting those songs through me," [...] to which Simon responded, [...] "Arthur <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> about almost nothing. But it's true, I have enriched his life quite a bit." [...] After three songs, the duo left without speaking. In August 1991 Simon staged his own concert in Central Park, which was released a few months later. Art Garfunkel had offered to lend his friend a hand in creating another park reunion in which Simon declined, leading the concert as a solo act.|$|E

"For {{the reasons}} set forth below, I am {{of the opinion}} that federal courts do have the power to award damages for {{violation}} of 'constitutionally protected interests' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with the Court that a traditional judicial remedy such as damages is appropriate to the vindication of the personal interests protected by the Fourth Amendment." ...|$|E

[...] And Mackintosh adding, [...] "The talent we have unearthed has been terrific." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on the now-discontinued TheftTrack, Carol Cafiero (school {{district}} Information Systems Coordinator, and {{supervisor of}} 16 technicians and administrative assistants) {{wrote to her}} boss Virginia DiMedio (district Director of Technology {{for a number of}} years, until June 2009, {{and a member of the}} district Superintendent's five-person Cabinet) that district Network Technician Mike Perbix [...] "loves it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> it is a great product." [...] Perbix also raved about the spying capabilities of TheftTrack in a May 2008 LANrev promotional webcast, saying he [...] "really, really" [...] liked it.|$|E
2500|$|British prime {{minister}} Theresa May {{said that the}} foreign minister's comments did not represent the government's view. Other Conservatives however defended Johnson. Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson said: [...] "I think Boris Johnson was absolutely right about {{what he said about}} proxy wars and about Iran. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with his analysis. Now, that might not be the position of the UK Government but guess what - I am not in the UK Government and I think he was right." [...] Later that month, Johnson visited Bahrain, met Saudi leaders and praised Saudi Arabia, saying it was [...] "securing itself from bombardment by the Hootis" [...] in Yemen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your own fault," [...] said Uncle John. [...] "You {{wanted me}} {{to play a game}} with you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed,</b> providin' you behaved yourself. And you didn't. Now, look here. Do you blame me any?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sadie {{thought it}} was time I did {{something}} useful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed.</b> It's obvious that if anything useful can be done, I'm the proper person to undertake the job. Now you understand me, shall I go on?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{thought the}} world of Ross Perot. I put him up there with our {{founding}} fathers. I liked the way he talked. He’d say 'We’ve got {{to clean out the}} barn!' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> with everything he said." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{album was}} a {{farewell}} to Petra's first era of popularity {{and the sound}} it had cultivated with Volz's distinctive vocals. As constant touring took its toll on the band, Hartman and Volz began to disagree about Petra's future, both on stage and off. The tour, while it drew more fans than ever, was expensive, and it left Petra hurting financially. Increased competition from other Christian rock bands, for whom Petra had paved the way, led to lower-than-expected showings as the tour went on. As Hartman told CCM Magazine in 1986, [...] "If I had {{to put it in}} a nutshell without getting too deep, I would have to say it's business. Greg <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> on just about everything except business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} perfectly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with you," [...] Holder replied. [...] "I have come, quite recently, to {{the same}} conclusion myself." ...|$|E
60|$|Will Clerk {{says he has}} {{a theory}} on the {{vitrified}} forts. I wonder if he <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree.</b> I think accidental conflagration is the cause.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{was talking}} about it," [...] {{corrected}} Mr. Wilks, in a hoarse voice. [...] "You brought up the subject <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> with you--not that it matters to me 'ow people get married. That's their affair. Banns or license, it's all one to me." ...|$|R
60|$|JUNO. No: {{that was}} what was so tame about it. I wanted to suffer. You get so sick of being happily married. It's always the happy marriages that break up. At last my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> that we ought to take a holiday.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{glass of}} sugar-and-water. You know, I am not easily tired. <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with you, {{it is better}} to come to {{business}} at once: so prepare them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your security, {{my small}} friend," [...] replied the wolf, [...] "depends not upon those points {{in which you}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree,</b> but upon those in which I and the dog differ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good, we are ready," [...] said Harold, rising, [...] "but tell me {{one thing}} before my comrade <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> to go with you,--tell us {{honestly}} if you are engaged in the slave-trade." ...|$|E
6000|$|Romayne {{thought it}} {{needless to say}} that Mrs. Eyrecourt had not been trusted with the secret until the wedding day was close at hand. [...] "My wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> in wishing to be married as quietly as possible," [...] he answered, after making the {{customary}} acknowledgments.|$|R
6000|$|... "I own I bade him do it, but I was not obeyed. He swore {{we should}} give the babe a chance of life. It should never know whose son it was, he said, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed.</b> We took the boy away. He has lived and thrived." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{assure you}} I read it most reverently down in Wiltshire, where Nelly kept a select library of fiction {{concealed}} underneath her mattress; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> believed {{every word of}} it. Nelly <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> that you were exactly like Zanoni; but she was hardly to blame; for {{she had never seen}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My son," [...] said Nazinred, [...] "I {{have one}} or two {{questions}} to put to you. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> about many things. Tell me, what would you think of the fawn that would forsake its dam?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Harold said, [...] "the plan is {{a hopeful}} one, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with {{you that it is}} a {{thousand}} times better to try it than it is to stop here with the certainty of being shot down before morning." ...|$|E
60|$|Besides {{love and}} sympathy, animals exhibit other qualities {{connected}} with the social instincts, which in us would be called moral; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> with Agassiz (16. 'De l'Espece et de la Classe,' 1869, p. 97.) that dogs possess something very like a conscience.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have had}} {{experience}} of this [...] "overhauling." [...] There {{was a man}} at Folkestone; I used to meet him on the Lees. He proposed one evening we should go for a long bicycle ride together on the following day, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed.</b> <b>I</b> got up early, for me; I made an effort, and was pleased with myself. He came half an hour late: I {{was waiting for him}} in the garden. It was a lovely day. He said:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{used to know}} Sid Merrick years ago," [...] he said. [...] "He used me for a tool, he did. When we met at Nassau he told me what {{he wanted}} done <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> to do it, for some money he gave me and for more that he promised me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{sooner the}} better, Harry," [...] Polly said, eagerly; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> with her, for I really dreaded being by our two selves in that {{rambling}} old house, where every room, {{every piece of}} furniture, every act of our daily life would bring back some association of him who was gone.|$|R
