40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} generic {{methodology}} for segmentation and reconstruction of volumetric datasets {{based on a}} deformable model, the Topological <b>Active</b> <b>Volumes</b> (TAV). This model, based on a polyhedral mesh, integrates features of region based and boundary based segmentation methods in order to fit {{the contours of the}} objects and model its inner topology. Moreover, it implements automatic procedures, the so called topological changes, that alter the mesh structure and allow the segmen-tation of complex features such as pronounced curvatures or holes, as well as the detection of several objects in the scene. This work presents the TAV model and the segmentation methodology and explains how the changes in the TAV structure can improve the adjustment process. In particular, it is focused on the increase of the mesh density in complex image areas in order to improve the adjustment to object surfaces. The suitability of the mesh structure and the segmentation methodology is analyzed and the accuracy of the proposed model is proved with both synthetic and real images.

The variation of F(detector)  with field size has been computed for detector voxels of various materials and densities. For ion chambers and solid-state detectors, the well-known variation of F(detector)  at small field sizes is shown {{to be due to}} differences between the densities of detector <b>active</b> <b>volumes</b> and water, rather than differences in atomic number. However, associated changes in the measured shapes of small-field profiles offset these variations in F(detector), so that integral doses measured using the different detectors are quite similar, at least for slit fields. Since changes in F(detector)  with field size arise primarily from differences between the densities of the detector materials and water, ideal small-field relative dosimeters should have small <b>active</b> <b>volumes</b> and water-like density...|$|R

50|$|The Erniettomorphs are {{a form of}} Ediacaran fossil {{consisting}} of rows of airbed-like tubes arranged along a midline with a glide symmetry. Representative genera include Ernietta, Phyllozoon, Pteridinium, Swartpuntia and possibly Dickinsonia.There is no record of Erniettomorphs {{after the end of}} the Ediacaran period. Their affinity is uncertain; they probably form a clade and are most likely a sister group to the rangeomorphs, which bear a similar (though fractal) construction. Placements within the metazoan crown-group have been rebutted, and it is most likely that these peculiar organisms lie in the stem group to the animals. There is no evidence that they possessed a mouth or gut. Because they are often found in water which was too deep to permit photosynthesis - and in some cases, lived half-buried in sediment, it is speculated that they fed by osmosis from the sea water. Such a lifestyle requires a very high surface area to volume ratio - higher than is observed in fossils. However, this paradox can be resolved if much of the volume of the organisms was not metabolically active. Many Pteridinium fossils are found completely filled with sand; if this sand were present within the organism while it was alive, this would reduce its metabolically <b>active</b> <b>volume</b> enough to make osmotic feeding viable.|$|E

Gain was measured over a 9 cm length of strontium vapor present in a 3 torr buffer gas of helium or neon and maintained at the correct temperature by an externally heated furnace. Three years later, twelve further infra-red laser transitions in neutral strontium were reported by Cahuzac. Again the heat needed to provide sufficient vapor pressure was produced by external means. The tubes used here were 5-10 mm in diameter and 75 cm in length. A 1.25 m cavity was used with mirrors of approximately 98% reflectivity.In 1973, Latush and Sém from Rostov-on-Don State University, Russia, observed visible laser action from the strontium vapor laser for the first time, at wavelengths of 430.5 nm and 416.2 nm. The <b>active</b> <b>volume</b> was contained in a ceramic tube 8 mm in diameter and 60 cm long. Small pieces of strontium were placed inside the tube at equally spaced intervals and the necessary vapor pressure was produced by externally heating the assembly.

With an increasing population density, the necessity to treat digester feeds with increased sludge concentration becomes apparent. With increasing sludge concentration, however, comes increasingly complex fluid rheology. This study aims to investigate the mixing characteristics of digested sludge in the reduction of inactive volume in anaerobic digesters.

A transparent simulant fluid (xanthan gum Keltrol T solution) at varying concentrations was used to mimic digested sludge.

During that period tracer tests have been run at intervals using inert and reactive compounds. Initially, the results of the inert tracer investigations showed that the <b>active</b> <b>volume</b> (indicated by modal and median volumes) of the circulating system was dormant. Then, after a period of sustained oscillation, notable increases in <b>active</b> <b>volume</b> were observed which depended on both the subsequent flow rate changes and circulation time. these dynamic changes had almost reached optimum values when a downhole pump was introduced in the production well. The drawdown in the production well caused a reduction of the modal volume, whilst the median volume remained almost the same.
