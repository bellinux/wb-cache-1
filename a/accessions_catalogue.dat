It gives {{a description of the}} Printed Catalogue (holdings up to 1872) and the <b>Accessions</b> <b>Catalogue</b> (1873 - 1963) and provides an insight into the work of the project over its four year lifetime (2005 - 2009). The methodology used to co-ordinate the project is outlined as is the sourcing of electronic records for titles contained in both catalogues. It also shows how advances in a dynamic library environment can affect a project during the various stages of its lifecycle. It suggests options for future conversion projects as well as offering advice to institutions undertaking a comparable task...|$|E

40|$|The University of Wollongong library Acquisitions Team has {{established}} an ideal model for best practice {{in relation to}} the acquisition and provision of prescribed texts and recommended readings for library clients through benchmarking with three other Australian academic libraries. The approaches integral to our focus on texts and recommended readings were examined in detail, with opportunities for our own continuous improvement defined. Our major aim was improvement of collection relevance and development concerning acquisition of University of Wollongong curriculum texts and recommended readings through benchmarking. In practical terms this meant redesigning the texts and recommended readings process from selection to shelf ready access for our clients. Specifically, we examined components such as: approach taken; selection; ordering; <b>accessioning,</b> copy <b>cataloguing</b> and end processing; access provided for clients; and funds used...|$|R
25|$|The Processing Laboratory {{incorporates}} {{equipment for}} the processing of archaeological materials for <b>cataloguing,</b> <b>accessioning</b> and analytical purposes. Analytical methods employed include sectioning and polishing of hard biological tissues, including animal bones, teeth and shell, and of non-organic materials, such as ceramics and lithics, as well as micro-drilling and milling to facilitate light stable isotope and trace elemental analysis. Equipment in the processing laboratory includes a manual grinder polisher (Buehler Metaserv 250), vacuum mounting (Buehler Cast N' Vac 1000), Buehler IsoMet 1000 Precision Saw and a Minimo high precision rotary tool for cutting samples such as bone, ceramic, antler, or shell.|$|R
40|$|This article compares YouTube and the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) as {{resources}} for television historians interested in viewing old Australian television programs. The author searched for seventeen important television programs, identified {{in a previous}} research project, to compare what was available in the two archives and {{how easy it was}} to find. The analysis focused on differences in curatorial practices of <b>accessioning</b> and <b>cataloguing.</b> NFSA is stronger in current affairs and older programs, while YouTube is stronger in game shows and lifestyle programs. YouTube is stronger than the NFSA on “human interest” material—births, marriages, and deaths. YouTube accessioning more strongly accords with popular histories of Australian television. Both NFSA and YouTube offer complete episodes of programs, while YouTube also offers many short clips of “moments. ” YouTube has more surprising pieces of rare ephemera. YouTube cataloguing is more reliable than that of the NFSA, with fewer broken links. The YouTube metadata can be searched more intuitively. The NFSA generally provides more useful reference information about production and broadcast dates...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{possible}} the tree's distribution {{was associated with}} Capability Brown (1716-1783), known to have favoured U. laevis (which he listed among his preferred [...] "native" [...] (sic) trees). This could explain {{the existence of the}} seven old specimens discovered by Elwes in 1908 on Mount Pleasant within Ugbrooke Park, Devon, designed by Brown in 1761. Ugbrooke is four miles from Mamhead Park, which had earlier been planted with numerous exotic trees, notably holm oak, collected by its owner, merchant Thomas Ball ( [...] d. 1749) during his commercial travels in Europe. Ball's introductions were known to have been marketed by his head gardener William Lucombe, who in 1720 founded the first commercial nursery in the south-west at Exeter. None of Lucombe's early catalogues are known to survive, and thus the introduction of U. laevis through south Devon cannot be confirmed. However, the tree does not feature in any of the surviving arboreta <b>accessions</b> lists, or <b>catalogues</b> of the larger, nationally famous, nurseries of the day, and its earliest-known mention in commerce remains in the south-west, in the catalogue of the Ford & Please nursery (as U. pedunculata) at Exeter circa 1836.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliography. This {{dissertation}} {{sets up a}} standardised {{system for}} analysing mid-seventeenth to mid- nineteenth century Cape colonial ceramic assemblages and then applies it {{to a number of}} Dutch and British historical sites in the south-western Cape region of South Africa in order to trace patterns of change in the availability and use of domestic ceramics in the colony. The system accommodates the wide range of African, Asian and European ceramics used during the period of Dutch East India rule from 1652 to 1795, the following Transitional years when the Cape was governed for short periods by both the British and Dutch governments and the period from 1815 onwards when the Cape became a British Crown Colony. A systematic ceramic classificatory system was required to form a framework for the first stage of a proposed study of the role of Asian porcelain in the Cape during the 17 th and 18 th centuries. The resulting Cape Classificatory System has five sections. (i) Ware Table, a ware based classification, records ceramics by sherd count and minimum number of vessels, and acts as a check list for Cape colonial sites. (ii) Date Table provides the accepted dates of production and references for all ceramics excavated in the Cape. (iii) Form and Function Table lists excavated ceramics by vessel form within functional categories. (iv) The Site <b>Catalogue</b> <b>accessions</b> and references (where possible) all the ceramics in an assemblage. (v) A catalogue of previously unreferenced Asian market ware (coarse porcelain) excavated from 17 th to 19 th century colonial sites in the south-western Cape. Thirty ceramic assemblages from Cape colonial sites and four assemblages from shipwrecks in Cape waters were analysed or examined. The Cape Classificatory System was applied in full to the ceramics from four sites: the Granary, a late seventeenth century Dutch East India site; Elsenburg, an elite mid-eighteenth century farmstead; Sea Street, Cape Town, a town midden in use from {{the last quarter of the}} eighteenth century to ca. 1830; and a well in Barrack Street, Cape Town, that was open from ca. 1775 till the late nineteenth century. The results clearly demonstrated changes in ceramic availability, usage and discard in the Cape over a two hundred year period, differences in refuse disposal practices and the dependence of the colony on Asian porcelain, including Asian market coarse porcelain, during the late seventeenth century and eighteenth century...|$|R

The scope of this study is limited to finding about the availability of total number of periodicals on Science and Management in TUCL only, portrays the collection strength of journals, and describes the organization and management of scientific journals only and does not include the daily newspaper, magazine. The significance of this study lies in the management of journals, finding out the collection strength of journals and finally it helps to know about users’ satisfaction about availability and adequacy of journals in TUCL. VI. The study includes the terminology in order to explain the words and phrases that deals with library and information science, which are also included in this research. The Review of Literature section includes 10 literatures that are consulted for preparation of this study. These literatures are reviewed because these are relevant to this study as they document about various methods of periodical management system in different academic libraries of different countries. The section “Focus of Study” is focused on explaining about the description of periodical section of TUCL with information about its activities regarding responsibilities, reader services, additional activities, creation of database, and detail record of periodicals on Science and Management Faculty. The study applies descriptive method and it is questionnaire-based data gathering survey containing 19 questions.
