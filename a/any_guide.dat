A reviewer for the New Times in Los Angeles referred to the album as [...] "stupid, exploitive, derivative rap-metal {{by the man who}} once did nearly irreparable damage to hip-hop." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "If history is <b>any</b> <b>guide,</b> Vanilla Ice's adoption of rap-metal means that hard rock is about to move on." [...] Richard Torres of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, writing that while [...] "nothing, however, can redeem Ice's wack boasting," [...] the album [...] "isn't half-bad." [...] The New Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album three out of five stars. The Iowa State Daily called the album [...] "the greatest pop culture comeback of all time". The album did not chart.

At its conclusion, the performer, a boy of nineteen or twenty, gave place to a girl; and to her accompaniment they all sang a hymn, and afterwards a sort of chorus. It was very sad to look upon and hear them, happy though their condition unquestionably was; and I saw that one blind girl, who (being for the time deprived {{of the use of}} her limbs, by illness) sat close beside me with her face towards them, wept silently the while she listened.|$|E

[...] But--and here immediately he turns east again--he is careful not to say [...] "individual happiness." [...] And he says [...] "Pleasure is, as Epicureans insisted, only a part of a large ideal of happiness." [...] So he lets the happiness of devotion and sacrifice creep in. So he opens indefinite possibilities of getting away from any merely materialistic rule of life. And he writes: ...|$|E

60|$|I {{send you}} this apology for Freethinking,[3] without the least hopes of doing good, but purely {{to comply with}} your request; for those truths which nobody can deny, will do no good to those who deny them.

Now the Bible, which contains the precepts of the priests' religion, {{is the most difficult}} book in the world to be understood; it requires a thorough knowledge in natural, civil, ecclesiastical history, law, husbandry, sailing, physic, pharmacy, mathematics, metaphysics, ethics, and everything else that can be named: And everybody who believes it ought to understand it, and must do so by force of his own freethinking, without <b>any</b> <b>guide</b> or instructor.|$|E
60|$|Certainly {{the great}} {{grievance}} of Penang is the Chinese question.

But I sat in that little newspaper office and listened to stories of municipal intrigue that might have suited Serampore or Calcutta, only the names were a little different, and in place of Ghose and Chuckerbutty one heard titles such as Yih Tat, Lo Eng, and the like. The Englishman's aggressive altruism always leads him to build towns for others, and incite aliens to serve on municipal boards. Then he gets tired of his weakness and starts papers to condemn himself. They had a Chinaman on the Municipality last year. They have now got rid of him, and the present body is constituted of two officials and four non-officials. Therefore they complain of the influence of officialdom.|$|E
60|$|We {{went first}} to the cathedral, which has a Gothic front, and a modernized interior, stuccoed and whitewashed, looking as neat as a New England meeting-house, and very mean, after our {{familiarity}} with the gorgeous churches in other cities.

Next we went, without <b>any</b> <b>guide,</b> to a church attached to a convent of Dominican monks, with a Gothic exterior, and two hideous pictures of Death,--the skeleton leaning on his scythe, one {{on each side of the}} door. This church, likewise, was whitewashed, but we understood that it had been originally frescoed all over, and by famous hands; but these pictures, having become much injured, they were all obliterated, as we saw,--all, that is to say, except a few specimens of the best preserved, which were spared to show the world what the whole had been. I thanked my stars that the obliteration of the rest had taken place before our visit; for if anything is dreary and calculated to make the beholder utterly miserable, it is a faded fresco, with spots of the white plaster dotted over it.|$|E

60|$|As {{the males}} of several quadrumanous animals have their vocal organs much more {{developed}} {{than in the}} females, and as a gibbon, one of the anthropomorphous apes, pours forth a whole octave of musical notes and {{may be said to}} sing, it appears probable that the progenitors of man, either the males or females or both sexes, before acquiring the power of expressing their mutual love in articulate language, endeavoured to charm each other with musical notes and rhythm. So {{little is known about the}} use of the voice by the Quadrumana during the season of love, that we have no means of judging whether the habit of singing was first acquired by our male or female ancestors. Women are generally thought to possess sweeter voices than men, and as far as this serves as <b>any</b> <b>guide,</b> we may infer that they first acquired musical powers in order to attract the other sex. (41. See an interesting discussion on this subject by Haeckel, 'Generelle Morphologie,' B. ii. 1866, s. 246.) But if so, this must have occurred long ago, before our ancestors had become sufficiently human to treat and value their women merely as useful slaves. The impassioned orator, bard, or musician, when with his varied tones and cadences he excites the strongest emotions in his hearers, little suspects that he uses the same means by which his half-human ancestors long ago aroused each other's ardent passions, during their courtship and rivalry.|$|E
60|$|A first {{introduction}} to the Calcutta durwân or door-keeper is not nice. If he is chewing pân, he does not take the trouble {{to get rid of}} his quid. If he is sitting on his cot chewing sugar-cane, he does not think it worth his while to rise. He has to be taught those things, and he cannot understand why he should be reproved. Clearly he is a survival of a played-out system. Providence never intended that any native should be made a concierge more insolent than any of the French variety. The people of Calcutta put a man in a little lodge close to the gate of their house, in order that loafers may be turned away, and the houses protected from theft. The natural result is that the durwân treats everybody whom he does not know as a loafer, has an intimate and vendible knowledge of all the outgoings and incomings in that house, and controls, to a large extent, the nomination of the servants. They say that one of the estimable class is now suing a bank for about three lakhs of rupees.[15] Up-country, a Lieutenant-Governor's servant has to work for thirty years before he can retire on seventy thousand rupees of savings. The Calcutta durwân is a great institution. The head and front of his offence is that he will insist upon trying to talk English. How he protects the houses Calcutta only knows. He can be frightened out of his wits by severe speech, and is generally asleep in calling hours. If a rough round of visits be <b>any</b> <b>guide,</b> three times out of seven he is fragrant of drink. So much for the durwân. Now for the houses he guards.|$|E
60|$|Fortunately {{the guns}} were at hand, and, as usual, they {{were quick to}} {{come to the aid of}} the distressed. The sun was hardly up before the howitzers were {{throwing}} lyddite at 4000 yards, the three field batteries (18th, 62nd, 75th) were working with shrapnel at a mile, and the troop of Horse Artillery was up at the right front trying to enfilade the trenches. The guns kept down the rifle-fire, and gave the wearied Highlanders some respite from their troubles. The whole situation had resolved itself now into another Battle of Modder River. The infantry, under a fire at from six hundred to eight hundred paces, could not advance and would not retire. The artillery only kept the battle going, and the huge naval gun from behind was joining with its deep bark in the deafening uproar. But the Boers had already learned--and it is one of their most valuable military qualities that they assimilate their experience so quickly--that shell fire is less dangerous in a trench than among rocks. These trenches, very elaborate in character, had been dug some hundreds of yards from the foot of the hills, so that there was hardly <b>any</b> <b>guide</b> to our artillery fire. Yet it is to the artillery fire that all the losses of the Boers that day were due. The cleverness of Cronje's disposition of his trenches some hundred yards ahead of the kopjes is accentuated by the fascination which any rising object has for a gunner. Prince Kraft tells the story of how at Sadowa he unlimbered his guns two hundred yards in front of the church of Chlum, and how the Austrian reply fire almost invariably pitched upon the steeple. So our own gunners, even at a two thousand-yard mark, found it difficult to avoid overshooting the invisible line, and hitting the obvious mark behind.|$|E
