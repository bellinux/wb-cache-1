5|$|Of {{the moons}} {{discovered}} by the Voyager2 imaging team, only Puck was discovered early enough that the probe could be programmed to image it in some detail. Images showed that Puck has <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> a slightly prolate spheroid (ratio between axes is 0.97±0.04). Its surface is heavily cratered and is grey in color. There are three named craters {{on the surface of}} Puck, the largest being about 45km in diameter. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and large terrestrial telescopes found water-ice absorption features in the spectrum of Puck.|$|E
5|$|The {{current crest}} of the club {{is based on the}} {{official}} emblem of the city of Maribor, which is in turn based on a 14th-century seal with minor differences. The badge is formed in <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> a shield, and shows the former Piramida Castle that used to stand on top of the Pyramid Hill before it was demolished {{at the end of the}} 18th century. A violet blossom forms the backdrop. Unlike the coat of arms of the city of Maribor, the current badge of the club does not represent a white dove facing downwards to the castle, but an athlete. At the top of the shield the name of the club and the year of its foundation is inscribed. The entire badge uses only two colours, purple and yellow. Previous versions of the crest included the colour white, one of the traditional colours of the club, in the form of a white castle in the centre and a white ball that was on top of the shield. Since May 2012 the official badge includes a yellow star above the crest, which indicates the first ten domestic titles won by the club.|$|E

25|$|Selecting a {{model for}} <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the Earth {{involves}} choosing between {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of a sphere versus an ellipsoid. Spherical models are useful for small-scale maps such as world atlases and globes, since the error at that scale is not usually noticeable or important enough to justify using the more complicated ellipsoid. The ellipsoidal model is commonly used to construct topographic maps and for other large- and medium-scale maps that need to accurately depict the land surface. Auxiliary latitudes are often employed in projecting the ellipsoid.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{was one of}} {{the first}} tall brick-and-sandstone {{buildings}} in the city. The original 13th-century Gothic structure was consecrated before 1269, and expanded in 1260–70. Not much remains from that particular period other than the ribbed 13th-century vault. Presbytery was elongated beginning in 1401 with the three-sided apsis (pictured). The cross-shaped central part with nave arcades was added around 1420–36 (the original chancel was straight). The annexes gave the temple <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> a Greek cross for the first time. The expansion was re-consecrated by Cardinal Zbigniew Oleśnicki in 1436. In spite of various calamities (1462, 1476, 1655), the Church of St. Francis of Assisi and the adjacent Monastery experienced the most destructive fire only in 1850. The written records of its consecration along with priceless artifacts were lost.|$|E
25|$|In August 2005 the Royal Mint {{launched}} a competition {{to find new}} reverse designs for all circulating coins apart from the £2 coin. The winner, announced in April 2008, was Matthew Dent, whose designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage from mid-2008. The designs for the 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p and 50p coins depict sections of the Royal Shield that form the whole shield when placed together. The shield in its entirety is featured on the £1 coin. The 50p coin depicts the lowest point of the Royal Shield, with the words FIFTY PENCE below {{the point of the}} shield. The coin's obverse remains unchanged. It should be noted that this coin is an example of <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> constant width. Shapes of constant width are shapes that have constant width but are not circular.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first record}} of the Cobb, the town's harbour wall, is in a 1328 {{document}} describing it as having been damaged by storms. It was made of oak piles driven into the seabed with boulders stacked between. The boulders had been floated into place, tied between empty barrels. A 1685 account describes it as, [...] "an immense mass of stone, of <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> a demi-lune, with a bar {{in the middle of}} the concave: no one stone that lies there was ever touched with a tool or bedded in any sort of cement, but all the pebbles of the see are piled up, and held by their bearings only, and the surge plays in and out through the interstices of the stone in a wonderful manner." [...] The Cobb wall provides a breakwater to protect the town from storms and separates Monmouth and Cobb Gate beaches.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transept}} has altars of two brotherhoods {{that were}} active in the church: Merciful Mother of God and Five Wounds of Christ. These brotherhoods existed before the current church was built and, therefore, the imagery is inherited from the previous church. The western (left) transept displays the painting of Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy and two large Turkish war drums (timpano, [...] in circumference) that were seized from the Ottomans in the Battle of Khotyn of 11 November 1673 and granted to the church by its founder Michał Kazimierz Pac. The transept ceiling has stucco reliefs {{from the life of}} Mary (with Visitation at the center) and crucifixion of Jesus. The Rococo pulpit was installed in 1801–1804.

The south-east side (along the river and towards the Caspian Sea) and from the northwest (from the front to the villages of Gamushevani were 100 meters long each. Besides that, on each corner were bastions located. The most imposing of them were the ones from the northeastern side. The ditch in front of the citadel was 4 meters deep and 10 meters in width.|$|E
2500|$|When {{thanks to}} Besht, the Hasidism started taking <b>a</b> <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> {{large-scale}} social phenomenon, in 1772 the same Brody Community issued a famous harsh ban against its own [...] "son and offspring" [...] Besht and [...] "illness infected" [...] Hasidim with the strange exception {{of allowing the}} prayer in Lurianic rite. Gershon Kutover (Brody native, secretary to Baal Shem Tov and his brother-in-law, who settled in Palestine later) was here to defend his employer when Brody sages were preparing to anathematise him, and so they did. Brody ban of 1772 encompassed {{a great number of}} Hasidic practices, including Hasidic shehitah (slaughter by Talmud forbidden honed shehitah knives / geschleefeene) that irritated the Misnagdim. Brody ban justly predicted the impact the movement might have in Galicia. The proclamation is included in the pamphlet Zamir arisim ve-harevot surim. Brodyites expressed their concern that the new heresy can bring a catastrophe on whole Polish Jewry discrediting God's name {{in the same way as}} Frankists and Sabbateans did. Brody sages feared that the sect was particularly dangerous as there was no high authority to interfere after dissolution of the Great Council of Fours Lands. Brody declaration caused great furore on the tsaddiks when learning of it, who in their turn became even more active in a fight for a believer, as a cause of it.|$|E
