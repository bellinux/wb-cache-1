40|$|Exciton {{coupling}} {{between two}} or more chlorophyll (Chl) pigments is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>associated</b> with the color tuning of photosynthetic proteins {{but it is difficult}} to disentangle this effect from shifts that are due to the protein microenvironment. Herein, we report the formation of the simplest coupled system, the Chl a dimer, tagged with a quaternary ammonium ion by electrospray ionization. Based on action spectroscopic studies in vacuo, the dimer complexes were found to absorb 50 – 70 meV to the red of the monomers under the same conditions. First-principles calculations predict shifts that somewhat depend on the relative orientation of the two Chl units, namely 50 and 30 meV for structures where the Chl rings are stacked and unstacked, respectively. Our work demonstrates that Chl association alone can produce a large portion of the color shift observed in photosynthetic macromolecular assemblies...|$|E

The definitive published version is available via the record DOI, published June 2015 Background Postnatal depression {{is associated with}} poorer parenting quality, but there are few studies examining maternal-specific cognitive processes that may impact on parenting quality. In this study, we examined the impact of rumination on parental problem-solving effectiveness in dysphoric and non-dysphoric postnatal mothers. Methods Fifty-nine mothers with a infant aged 12 months and under, 20 of whom had a Beck Depression Score II (BDI-II) score ≥ 14, and 39 who scored less than 14 on the BDI-II {{were randomly assigned to}} either a rumination or distraction condition. Problem-solving effectiveness was assessed post-induction with the “Postnatal Parental Problem-Solving Task” (PPST), which was adapted from the Means Ends Problem-solving task. Parental problem-solving confidence was also assessed. Results Dysphoric ruminating mothers exhibited poorer problem-solving effectiveness and poorer confidence regarding their problem-solving compared to dysphoric distracting, non-dysphoric distracting, and non-dysphoric ruminating mothers. Limitations A self-report measure of depressed mood was used. Conclusions Rumination may be <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>associated</b> with both depressive mood and maternal parenting quality during the postnatal period...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>associated</b> {{with the}} spread of exotic plants and previous {{studies have found that}} invasive species are generally more plastic than co-occurring species. Comparatively, the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in plant invasion has received less attention, and in particular, the genetic basis of plasticity is largely unexamined. Native from North America, Acer negundo L. is aggressively impacting the riparian forests of southern and eastern Europe thanks to higher plasticity relative to co-occurring native species. We therefore tested here whether invasive populations have evolved increased plasticity since introduction. The performance of 1152 seedlings from 8 native and 8 invasive populations was compared in response to nutrient availability. Irrespective of nutrients, invasive populations had higher growth and greater allocation to above-ground biomass relative to their native conspecifics. More importantly, invasive genotypes did not show increased plasticity in any of the 20 traits examined. This result suggests that the high magnitude of plasticity to nutrient variation of invasive seedlings might be pre-adapted in the native range. Invasiveness of A. negundo could be explained by higher mean values of traits due to genetic differentiation rather than by evolution of increased plasticity.

40|$|Cellular {{response}} to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or unfolded protein response (UPR) is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> defense <b>mechanism</b> <b>associated</b> with many human diseases. Despite its basic and clinical importance, {{the extent of}} ER stress inflicted by physiological and pathophysiological conditions remains difficult to quantitate, posing a huge obstacle that has hindered our further understanding of physiological UPR and its future therapeutic potential. Here we have optimized a Phos-tagbased system to detect the activation status of two proximal UPR sensors at the ER membrane. This method allowed for a quantitative assessment {{of the level of}} stress in the ER. Our data revealed quantitatively the extent of tissue-specific basal ER stress as well as ER stress caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and the fasting-refeeding cycle.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is <b>a</b> <b>key</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>associated</b> with white matter disruption in cerebral vascular disease and dementia. In a mouse model relevant to studying cerebral vascular disease, we have previously shown that cerebral hypoperfusion disrupts axon-glial integrity {{and the distribution of}} key paranodal and internodal proteins in subcortical myelinated axons. This disruption of myelinated axons is accompanied by increased microglia and cognitive decline. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether hypoperfusion impairs the functional integrity of white matter, its relation with axon-glial integrity and microglial number, and whether by targeting microglia these effects can be improved. We show that in response to increasing durations of hypoperfusion, the conduction velocity of myelinated fibres in the corpus callosum is progressively reduced and that paranodal and internodal axon-glial integrity is disrupted. The number of microglial cells increases in response to hypoperfusion and correlates with disrupted paranodal and internodal integrity and reduced conduction velocities. Further minocycline, a proposed anti-inflammatory and microglia inhibitor, restores white matter function related to a reduction in the number of microglia. The study suggests that microglial activation contributes to the structural and functional alterations of myelinated axons induced by cerebral hypoperfusion and that dampening microglia numbers/proliferation should be further investigated as potential therapeutic benefit in cerebral vascular disease.

40|$|Despite {{moderate}} heritability estimates, {{the molecular}} architecture of aggressive behavior remains poorly characterized. This study compared gene expression profiles from a genetic mouse model of aggression with Zebrafish, an animal model traditionally {{used to study}} aggression. A meta-analytic, cross-species approach was used to identify genomic variants associated with aggressive behavior. The Rankprod algorithm {{was used to evaluate}}d mRNA differences from prefrontal cortex tissues of three sets of mouse lines (N[*]=[*] 18) selectively bred for low and high aggressive behavior (SAL/LAL, TA/TNA, and NC 900 /NC 100). The same approach was used to evaluate mRNA differences in Zebrafish (N[*]=[*] 12) exposed to aggressive or non-aggressive social encounters. Results were compared to uncover genes consistently implicated in aggression across both studies. Seventy-six genes were differentially expressed (PFP[*]<[*] 0. 05) in aggressive compared to non-aggressive mice. Seventy genes were differentially expressed in zebrafish exposed to a fight encounter compared to isolated zebrafish. Seven genes (Fos, Dusp 1, Hdac 4, Ier 2, Bdnf, Btg 2, and Nr 4 a 1) were differentially expressed across both species 5 of which belonging to a gene-network centred on the c-Fos gene hub.
