5|$|Hardman {{returned}} to Britain on the SS Himalaya, {{and joined the}} British Air Council as Air Member for Supply and Organisation on 1May 1954, succeeding <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Sir John Whitworth-Jones. In December, he represented the Air Council at No.78 Wing's farewell parade in Malta, reminding the personnel gathered {{that he had been}} present at the wing's march through Sydney in July 1952, prior to its departure for the Mediterranean. He was promoted to <b>air</b> <b>chief</b> <b>marshal</b> on 1April 1955. In July 1956, he presented a Squadron Standard to his old unit, No.19 Squadron. That October, he presided over the inquiry into the fatal crash of Vulcan XA897 at Heathrow Airport after its maiden round-the-world flight, the only survivors of the six crew members being the pilot and Air Marshal Sir Harry Broadhurst. Hardman was succeeded as Air Member for Supply and Organisation by <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Sir Walter Dawson on 1January 1958, and was raised to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire the same day. He retired from the RAF on 29January.|$|E

5|$|The Second World War brought renewed prosperity, despite {{extensive}} {{bombing of}} cities by the Luftwaffe. It saw {{the invention of}} radar by Robert Watson-Watt, which was invaluable in the Battle of Britain, as was the leadership at RAF Fighter Command of <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Hugh Dowding.|$|E
5|$|Hardman {{joined the}} board of New Electronic Products Ltd in May 1959. In February 1963, he succeeded <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Sir Douglas Evill as the RAF Benevolent Fund's honorary county {{representative}} for Hampshire. Sir Donald Hardman died on 2March 1982, while holidaying in Estoril, Portugal, and was {{survived by his wife}} and children.|$|E
5|$|The CDF is {{the most}} senior {{appointment}} in the ADF. The CDF commands the ADF, and is notionally the equal of the Secretary of Defence, the most senior public servant in the Department of Defence. The CDF is the only four-star officer in the ADF and is a general, admiral or <b>air</b> <b>chief</b> <b>marshal.</b> As well as having command responsibilities, the CDF is the Minister for Defence's principal military adviser. <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Mark Binskin is the current CDF, and assumed this position on 30 June 2014. Hugh White, a prominent academic and former Deputy Secretary in the Department of Defence, has criticised the ADF's current command structure. White argues that the Minister plays too large a role in military decision-making and does not provide the CDF and Secretary of Defence with necessary and sufficient authority to manage the ADO effectively.|$|E

5|$|On 28 March 1939, {{the head}} of RAF Bomber Command <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt hosted a conference {{on the state of}} Bomber Command. Among the many {{problems}} with operational readiness, he noted that that RAF bombs were much too small and that bombsight technology was obsolete. Given the problems of obtaining a modern bombsight, he pressed {{for the creation of a}} high-speed bomber design that could safely attack at low levels.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss of experienced pilots. In mid-September, Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1,662 â€“ a deficiency of 10%. Many of the pilots were ineffective unless led into battle by experienced men. <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became exhausted. By early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 Olivier {{appeared}} in two war films, portraying military leaders. He played Field Marshal French in the First World War film Oh! What a Lovely War, {{for which he}} won another BAFTA award, followed by <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Hugh Dowding in Battle of Britain. In June 1970 {{he became the first}} actor to be created a peer for services to the theatre. Although he initially declined the honour, Harold Wilson, the incumbent prime minister, wrote to him, then invited him and Plowright to dinner, and persuaded him to accept.|$|E
50|$|For {{those in}} the {{military}} it is given after distinguished service and is also the highest award that can be awarded to those at the rank of Generals (Army), <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshals</b> (<b>Air</b> Force), and Admirals of the Navy, Coast Guard, and Marines.|$|R
50|$|Originally, a Pakistani <b>air</b> <b>chief</b> <b>marshal's</b> rank {{insignia}} {{was essentially}} the same as the RAF insignia. In 2006 the Pakistan Air Force changed the rank insignia for its officers, abandoning the ring insignia in favour of a Turkish Army-style featuring four stars and a crossed swords and laurel device.|$|R
50|$|Around 200 pilots {{served with}} 41 Squadron between 1 April 1923 and 2 September 1939. During this period, no Battle Honours were granted, nor any decorations awarded, but the era {{produced}} ten Air Commodores, nine Air Vice-Marshals, two Air <b>Marshals</b> and two <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshals.</b> During these same years, eleven men {{were killed and}} three injured in flying accidents, and three injured in airscrew accidents on the ground.|$|R
5|$|King died {{unexpectedly}} of cerebral oedema on 28November, aged 47. Survived by {{his wife}} and children, he was cremated at Fawkner Crematorium, Melbourne. His funeral service at South Yarra was attended by hundreds of mourners from the military and civil aviation world, including the Chief of the Air Staff, <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Sir Charles Burnett, and {{a representative of the}} Minister for Air; the pallbearers included Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley, Air Commodore Raymond Brownell, Group Captain Allan Walters, and Wing Commander Henry Winneke.|$|E
5|$|Philosophically, Newall {{remained}} a close follower of Trenchard during the interwar period; {{his time in}} the Independent Bombing Force had left him convinced that strategic bombing was an exceptionally powerful weapon, and one that could not effectively be defended against. In this, he was a supporter of the standard doctrine of the day, which suggested that the destructive power of a bomber force was sufficiently great that it could cripple an industrial economy in short order, and that so merely its presence could potentially serve as an effective deterrent. He was promoted to <b>air</b> <b>chief</b> <b>marshal</b> on 1 April 1937.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{order of}} battle {{involved}} all the major commands in the area at the time. The Supreme Allied Air Force Command was the Mediterranean Air Command (MAD) under <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Arthur Tedder. Below the supreme command were the sector organisations, the Northwest African Air Forces (NAAF) commanded by Carl Spaatz. Directly subordinated to Spaatz was the Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF) under James H. Doolittle. The second command was the operational/tactical force, the Northwest African Tactical Air Force (NATAF) under Air Marshal Arthur Coningham.|$|E
50|$|On 5 November, on {{insistence of}} <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshals</b> Sir Cyril Newall and Charles Medhurst {{he was set}} free and in 1941 he was {{admitted}} to RAF Ferry Command units, transporting planes between allied airfields in Asia and North Africa. He led a variety of transport missions, including a remarkable flight of a formation of Bristol Blenheim bombers from Habaniya in Iraq to Singapore. After two weeks of flight, his bomber was destroyed by Japanese fighters immediately upon arrival to the attacked port.|$|R
50|$|Although no serving RAF officer {{has been}} {{promoted}} to marshal of the Royal Air Force since the British defence cuts of the 1990s, British <b>air</b> <b>chief</b> <b>marshals</b> are not the most senior officers in the RAF as several officers continue to retain the RAF's highest rank. Additionally, Lord Stirrup was granted an honorary promotion to marshal of the Royal Air Force in 2014. The marshals are still to {{be found on the}} RAF's active list even though they have for all practical purposes retired.|$|R
50|$|On 17 August, 10 former Chiefs of the Armed Forces of India in an {{unprecedented}} joint open letter addressed to Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister, condemned the police action, and urged the PM to order an inquiry into the action by the Delhi Police. The Signatories to the letter included retired Generals Vishwa Nath Sharma, Shankar Roy Choudhary, Sundararajan Padmanabhan, Joginder Jaswant Singh, Deepak Kapoor and Bikram Singh; retired <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshals</b> Nirmal Chandra Suri and Shashindra Pal Tyagi, and retired Admiral Madhvendera Singh.|$|R
5|$|The Zimbabwe Defence Forces {{were set}} up by unifying three insurrectionist forces â€“ the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA), the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), and the Rhodesian Security Forces (RSF) â€“ after the Second Chimurenga and Zimbabwean {{independence}} in 1980. The integration period saw the formation of The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) and Air Force of Zimbabwe (AFZ) as separate entities {{under the command of}} Rtd General Solomon Mujuru and Air Marshal Norman Walsh who retired in 1982, and was replaced by Air Marshal Azim Daudpota who handed over command to the late Rtd <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Josiah Tungamirai in 1985.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Burnett {{completed}} his term in 1942, Williams was once more {{considered for the}} role of CAS. This was vetoed by Prime Minister John Curtin and the appointment unexpectedly went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. A mooted Inspector Generalship of the Air Force, which would have seen Williams reporting directly to the Minister for Air, also failed to materialise. Instead Williams was posted to Washington, D.C. as the RAAF's representative to the Combined Chiefs of Staff in the United States, and remained there {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|<b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Burnett had {{recommended}} his deputy, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, for CAS but in May 1942 the position went to acting Air Commodore George Jones. Bostock in turn became Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, Australia's main operational organisation under SWPA. An ongoing conflict between Jones (now promoted air vice marshal) and Bostock led to moves in April 1943 {{to bring in}} an officer senior to both men to head the RAAF in a unified command structure, and Drummond was once more approached by the Australian Government. Drummond had indicated that {{he was happy to}} serve in Australia but the Air Ministry again refused to release him, having selected him for a posting to the Air Council as Air Member for Training.|$|E

5|$|Completing {{his term}} as Chief of the Air Staff on 31 December 1952, Slessor was succeeded by <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Sir William Dickson and {{retired from the}} RAF on 29 January 1953. He {{attended}} the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953. In retirement he published two books: his autobiography, The Central Blue (1956), and The Great Deterrent (1957). He served as Honorary Air Commodore of No. 3 (County of Devon) Maritime Headquarters Unit, Royal Auxiliary Air Force, from 23 May 1963 to 5 May 1969. His wife, Lady Hermione, was appointed a Serving Sister of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem on 2 July 1963.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt {{was raised}} from Knight Commander to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 2008â€“2009 New Year Honours List. His tenure as CGS expired in August 2008 {{and he was}} succeeded {{for the last time}} by Sir David Richards. The {{government}} took the unusual decision to extend the tenure of <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Sir Jock Stirrup as CDS, rather than promote one of the outgoing service chiefs. Thus all three, including Dannatt, retired, amid claims that Dannatt's potential promotion to CDS had been personally vetoed by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. His last act as CGS was to nominate Nick Houghton to become the next Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942 the Australian Government sought Drummond for the {{position}} of Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) of the RAAF, to succeed <b>Air</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Sir Charles Burnett {{at the completion of}} the latter's two-year term. Although initially supportive of the plan, the British Air Ministry eventually declined to release Drummond from his role in the Middle East, partly to avoid disruption to the region's command and also because it did not believe that Drummond's operational abilities would be put to sufficient use in the largely administrative role of CAS. Drummond himself was reportedly dubious about the appointment because of the division of authority between RAAF Headquarters and Allied Air Force Headquarters, South West Pacific Area (SWPA).|$|E

5000|$|On 9 September 1985, the Young Turks again unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to topple the}} government of General Prem, although Prem was abroad at the time.

[...] The pre-dawn coup consisted of several hundred men and twenty-two tanks. Within 10 hours, government troops led by General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh quelled the bloody rebellion. There are 59 injuries, 5 casualties, 2 of them foreign journalists. Over 40 active and former military officers were arrested. Exiled pyramid scheme operator Ekkayuth Anchanbutr was widely cited as a financier of the coup, leading some to call the coup the [...] "Share Rebellion".|$|R
25|$|According to a {{statement}} by Pakistan <b>Air</b> Force <b>Chief</b> <b>Marshal</b> Rao Qamar Suleman, {{there had been an}} air-surveillance failure. Qamar covered the inquiry by saying that the air space was unable to detect the American helicopters because the radar installed on the western borders were inactive {{on the day of the}} incident. The U.S. helicopters also reportedly used radar-evading measures, such as stealth technology, to avoid detection.|$|R
