40|$|This paper {{introduces}} new systematic {{procedures to}} estimate aggregate unpaid claims {{as of the}} current <b>accounting</b> <b>date.</b> Through the use of examples that introduce concepts in a natural progression, {{emphasis is placed on}} the reasonability and practicality of an <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> reserving framework and its appeal to loss reserving practitioners. The <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> framework provides a fresh perspective which differs from traditional actuarial reserving methods that typically derive unpaid claim estimates using individual accident year experience. Current <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> aggregate unpaid claims are directly estimated from the emergence of aggregate claim experience which had been unpaid as of prior accounting dates. Exploration of this <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> framework leads to techniques that may be understood as <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> analogues of commonly used accident year reserving methods including the incurred development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. In addition to revealing visibly apparent aggregate unpaid claim estimates, the structure of appropriate <b>accounting</b> <b>date</b> reserving applications suggests improved accuracy over corresponding accident year development methods...|$|E
