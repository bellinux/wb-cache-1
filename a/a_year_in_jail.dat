25|$|On 7 April 2009, a Manhattan {{district}} attorney charged a financier with the suspected misuse of Manhattan banks employed to transfer money between China and Iran {{by way of}} Europe and the United States.

The charges would carry a maximum of up to <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> for fifth-degree conspiracy and a maximum of four years for falsifying business records. David Albright, a nuclear weapons expert who assisted in the prosecution, said {{that it is impossible to}} say how Iran used or could use the raw materials it acquired.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the 1970s Mormon sex {{in chains}} case brought {{increased}} awareness {{of the possibility of}} female-on-male rape. A young Mormon missionary named Kirk Anderson went missing in 1977, in Ewell, Surrey, after being abducted from the steps of a church meetinghouse. A few days later, Anderson made a report to the police that he had been abducted and imprisoned against his will. He said that while chained to a bed, Joyce Bernann McKinney attempted to seduce him, and then raped him. News coverage was extensive, in part because the case was considered so anomalous, having involved the rape of a man by a woman. McKinney fled to the US, extradition was not pursued by Britain, and the English court sentenced McKinney in absentia to <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> Under the then-Sexual Offences Act 1956, due to the victim's gender, technically no crime of rape was committed, though indecent assault of a man applied.|$|E

25|$|Mosby's Colorado methods failed, however, {{since the}} Omaha grand jury refused to authorize an {{indictment}} against Richards or anyone but nonresident agent Lesser. Mosby was recalled to Washington to appease Nebraska's Senators, {{and then sent}} to halt timber trespassers in Alabama forests. However, other attorneys were sent out, who secured indictments. Richards and his English brother in law William G. Comstock were convicted in 1905 despite their argument that the government land hadn't been surveyed. The local judge sentenced them to $300 fine apiece and six hours in custody, which they spent celebrating at the Omaha Cattlemen's Club, and which led President Roosevelt to fire both the U.S. attorney and U.S. Marshall. The next year Richards and Comstock were indicted on a new charge of conspiracy to deprive the government of public land, convicted and fined $1,500 fines as well as sentenced to <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> After three years of appeals, the convictions and sentences were upheld, so they were sent to prison in Hastings, Nebraska for a year beginning in 1901, and Richards died in a hospital {{a month before the}} sentence would end.|$|E
500|$|Yancey, {{like most}} members of the planter class, was a strong believer in a {{personal}} code of honor. [...] In September 1838, Yancey returned for a brief return visit to Greenville. [...] A political slur by Yancey in a private conversation was overheard by a teenage relative of the aggrieved party. [...] Yancey was confronted by another relative (and his wife’s uncle), Dr. Robinson Earle. [...] Conversation turned to violence, and the always-armed Yancey ended up killing the doctor in a street brawl. [...] Yancey was tried and sentenced to <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> for manslaughter. [...] An unrepentant Yancey was pardoned after only a few months, but while incarcerated he wrote for his newspaper, [...] "Reared with the spirit of a man in my bosom — and taught to preserve inviolate my honor — my character, and my person, I have acted as such a spirit dictated." ...|$|E
500|$|By mid-October 2013, McConnell's {{campaign}} {{indicated it}} would look beyond Bevin and focus its advertising against Allison Lundergan Grimes, the frontrunner {{in the race for}} the Democratic senatorial nomination, calling her [...] "my real opponent". In the aftermath of McConnell negotiating a deal to end the 16-day government shutdown in 2013, the Senate Conservatives Fund endorsed Bevin. McConnell's campaign then launched another ad, based on a story published by BuzzFeed, claiming Bevin had failed to disclose a federal tax lien when applying for the state grant to rebuild his family business, which could be a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> and a $2,000 fine under Connecticut law. Bevin said that he had been paying the lien in $5,000 installments prior to the fire that destroyed the business, a condition he said was allowed by the grant application, but after the fire, the Internal Revenue Service suspended the payments. Bevin was never charged. Lexington Herald-Leader columnist Sam Youngman speculated that McConnell's pivot back to Bevin was a proxy war against Tea Party fundraising groups, hoping that a decisive win over their chosen candidate in the primary would hamper the groups' fundraising in future elections.|$|E
50|$|On 26 April 2012, Petricevic was {{sentence}}d to six and <b>a</b> half <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> by Justice Venning.

Justice Venning dismissed the request stating {{that he was not}} convinced the remorse shown by Petricevic was genuine.|$|R

500|$|The 1890s were a {{turbulent}} decade for Weldy's older brother Fleetwood. [...] In 1891, Fleetwood stabbed {{a man to}} death outside a saloon, but was acquitted on grounds of self-defense. [...] In 1898, while employed as a railroad postal clerk, Fleetwood was charged with embezzling the contents of registered letters addressed to a dozen different persons and served <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail.</b> [...] In 1899, while Fleetwood was still in jail, Weldy began operating the Union Hotel at 105 Market Street in downtown Steubenville. [...] Following Fleetwood's release from jail, the hotel/boarding house was jointly operated by Fleetwood and Weldy. [...] In June 1900, {{at the time of}} the 1900 United States Census, Walker was living at the Union Hotel with Fleetwood, Fleetwood's second wife Ednah, and their three children. [...] The family also had a live-in servant, Sarah Richmond (age 45). [...] Fleetwood was identified in the 1900 Census as the operator of a boarding house, and Weldy as a [...] "porter." [...] A 1902 city directory listed Fleetwood as the hotel's proprietor and Weldy as the clerk, but a 1904–05 directory listed Weldy as the proprietor and Fleetwood and Ednah as residents. [...] By 1906, Weldy had temporarily relocated several miles downriver to Wheeling, West Virginia, and rumors circulated that the Union Hotel would be sold and turned into [...] "a first class house for the accommodation of Afro-American visitors." ...|$|E

2500|$|Their debut {{full-length}} album, Nobody Said it Was Easy, {{produced by}} Rubin, {{was released in}} 1991, following a two-year delay when Starr was arrested on drug charges and spent six months in jail. The album generated the title track as a single, followed by the hit [...] "Rockin' Is Ma' Business". However, Starr was arrested again and this time spent <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> on a drugs charge. This, combined with poor album sales as the grunge scene started to take over from traditional rock, caused the record label to drop them in 1992.|$|E
