5000|$|The game {{begins in}} Sunny Meadows, the asylum Ash is {{committed}} to. Ash is briefly visited by his lawyer, Sally who mentions how she found Professor Knowby's diary and believes Ash's {{story about the}} Necronomicon and the cabin. Ash thanks Sally for her efforts and awkwardly flirts with her. Just after Sally leaves, Reinhard accidentally unleashes the dead through the Necronomicon. The evil also breaks <b>Ash</b> <b>free</b> in the process. Ash travels through the asylum killing deadites with a pistol he retrieved from a dead security guard. He eventually finds his clothing, his boomstick and his chainsaw in the process. As he goes through the asylum, Ash finds an electric deadite named Sparky. Ash kills Sparky and decapitates him. Ash briefly breaks the fourth wall, telling us that [...] "Ash is back in business", and throws Sparky's head away. Ash proceeds through the nearby cellar. However, just as {{he is about to}} leave the asylum, Professor Knowby's spirit appears to Ash, telling him that Reinhard's plan requires the closing of several portals and how Sally is in danger for having the diary. Ash teams up with a diminutive victim of Reinhard, a half-dead man named Sam (voiced by Ted Raimi) who can return from any death (as he is half-Deadite, but isn't affected by the evil). His condition grants him many mystical skills.|$|E

40|$|Top predators are {{relevant}} {{indicators of the}} ecological status of a system and can have a high impact on food webs. But top predators are difficult to include in network analyses because their biomass in <b>ash</b> <b>free</b> dry weight or carbon content ismissing. Regression equations were determined for the relationships between fresh weight and dry weight, <b>ash</b> <b>free</b> dryweight, carbon and nitrogen contents respectively for six of the most abundant bird species in theWadden Sea (Calidris canutus, Limosa lapponica, Haematopus ostralegus, Chroicocephalus ridibundus, Larus canus, Anas penelope) and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). The relationships for all specieswere interpreted as linear through the origin. Carbon content vs. freshweight ratios for birds ranged from 0. 16 ± 0. 01 to 0. 22 ± 0. 02. Carbon content vs. fresh weight ratio was 0. 17 ± 0. 02 on average for harbor seals. This work highlights that the biomass of top predatorswas often over- or underestimated in previous studies. The determined conversion factors will be useful for future studies to generate more realistic food web models...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the adsorption thermodynamics of textile reactive dyes from aqueous solution on the waste ashes formed by burning brown coal at a city heating station. The values of thermodynamic parameters are the actual indicators for practical application in the adsorption process. Based on characteristic diagrams the thermodynamic parameters, enthalpy and entropy of adsorption are determined, {{and based on}} those data the Gibbs's free energy changes were determined. In all cases, there is a negative sign of the thermodynamic parameters. Entropy change (– 2 to – 3 J/K⋅mol) increases with increasing initial concentration of the adsorbate and decreases with increasing amount of adsorbent, suggesting a decrease in disordered system at the interface of solid- solution during the adsorption of dye on the <b>ashes.</b> <b>Free</b> energy (– 1. 7 to 5 kJ/mol) decreases with the concentration of adsorbate discontinuously but continuously with increasing temperature, which is associated with spontaneous nature of the process. Small negative values of enthalpy change (– 2 to – 6 kJ/mol), point to the physical nature and the energy stability of the reactive dyes adsorption by ashes...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} fly ash {{effects on the}} compressive strength of concrete is presented, where an experimental program {{has been designed to}} examine the role of fly ash in influencing the compressive strength of concrete. Various percentages of fly ash are added to concrete mixtures as partial replacements of both cement and fine aggregate or sand. The compressive strengths of concrete aged 7 and 28 days are measured on the specimens with replacement ratios of 15 %, 30 % and 45 % fly ash as well as on fly <b>ash</b> <b>free</b> concrete specimens. These observed compressive strengths are compared in terms of replacement method, i. e. cement or sand replacement, and replacement ratio. It is found that while for both replacement methods, an optimum fly ash ratio exists where the maximum compressive strengths of fly ash containing concrete can be achieved, the sand replacement method produces superior concrete in terms of compressive strength. The experimental results also demonstrate that in comparison with their fly <b>ash</b> <b>free</b> counterparts, the compressive strength of fly ash containing concrete improves more slowly but more strongly with aging. Furthermore, the observed phenomena are discussed in terms of hydration reaction and interface behaviour...|$|E

All {{the data were}} statistically tested using variance analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) {{with the aim of}} classifying the honeys and identifying the most significant parameters in the classification. Measurements with FTIR-ATR spectroscopy were performed on order to correlate the previously chemical parameter and the obtained spectra. The one-way analysis of variance, considering the factor botanical origin shows that, in general, this factor is highly significant. In particular it can be stated (p< 0. 001) that is occurs in almost all variables, that explained between 81 % and 98 % of the total variance. From the statistical study by PCA the variables analyzed, two factors explain 86. 3 % of the total variance between honey types.

At yolk absorption the larvae consumed 0. 090 - 0. 120 ul O 2 /larva/hour {{depending on the}} larval group examined. The larval energy consumption either measured as oxygen uptake or calculated from larval weight decrement, was of the same magnitude. The oxygen uptake was 20 - 30 % higher under 100 lux illumination than in darkness, a difference which was of the same magnitude (20 %) as the difference in weight decrement between larvae held at a constant 500 lux and larvae held in constant darkness. Light-adapted larvae showed a 6 - 10 times higher swimming frequency (bursts of swmming per min) than dark-adapted ones. The overall utilization of yolk for somatic growth varied between 65 and 70 % depending on the larval group examined. The utilization seemed independant of temperature and light intensity when these parameters were kept within the natural range observed during hatching in the Lofoten area.

Some strips were placed in cages to protect them from fish grazing and some where placed in the open pond, accessible to the fish. Periphyton development was evaluated by the contents of chlorophyll, dry matter (DM), and <b>ash</b> <b>free</b> dry matter (organic matter) and by an autotrophic index. The first experiment tested growth on substrates of different textures including natural (palm leaves) and artificial (agricultural nets, plastic surfaces) materials. The second experiment tested the effect of different colored nets. The differences between periphyton grown in cages and in the open pond indicate that tilapia grazed on the periphyton. Palm leaves decomposed too quickly to be of practical use in large- scale aquaculture. Periphytic material seemed to be more easily dislodged from smooth plastic substrates than from rough nets, changing the structure of the residual attached periphyton. Growth was greater on nets with a fine mesh (5. 3 - 9. 6 mg/cm 2 DM) than with a coarse mesh (3. 7 - 4. 0 mg/cm 2 DM) or on smooth plastic surfaces (1. 4 - 2. 6 mg/cm 2 DM).

The effect of media and temperature on 2 autochthonous multiple strain cultures (AMSI: 18 A, 2 B, 20 F and 22 C, 32 C and 16 E and AMSII: 18 A, 2 B, 20 F and 22 C) was studied. Genomic analysis showed a constant cell numbers for AMSII during 16 days of propagation in whey milk. Mozzarella cheese was made by using AMSII, commercial starter (CS) or citric acid (DA). Compared to other cheeses, the DA had {{a lower level of}} protein, <b>ash,</b> Ca, <b>free</b> amino acids and a higher level of moisture. Based on confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis, AMSII cheese showed the lowest microstructural variations during the period of storage compared to other cheeses. All the sensory attributes were scored highest for AMSII cheese. ASMII extend the shelf-life to ca. 12 − 15 days instead of the 5 − 7 days of traditional high-moisture Mozzarella cheese...|$|R
40|$|Different {{physical}} properties of volcanic ash soils were investigated along a transect of 120 km {{from the western}} slope of the Central Cordilleras (40 ° 20 ’S, 72 ° 06 ’W) to the eastern slope of the Costal Cordillera (39 ° 39 ’S, 73 ° 11 ’W) in southern Chile {{with respect to the}} degree of soil development (Arenosol versus Andosol stage; Arenosol: young volcanic <b>ash</b> soil, <b>free</b> of clay, tephric properties, Andosol: older volcanic soil, clayey). The Andosols show a higher total pore volume and a higher field capacity, especially due to an increase in fine pores, than the Arenosols. Furthermore, the precompression stress (Pc) as a parameter for the mechanical soil strength is higher for Andosols despite of a lower bulk density. A land use (cropland, meadow, forest) dependent variation of the investigated parameters was less distinct for Andosols. A reduction of macropores and saturated hydraulic conductivity (ks) due to agriculture could be determined in the field, but in general the values are still on a high level with ks-values > 100 cm d- 1. However, at higher stresses using an oedometer test the ks-values of the Andosols are highly negatively affected with values < 10 cm d- 1. Aggregation is of major importance for soil stability of Andosols, whereas a homogenization of soil structure will lead to a distinct decrease of Pc of approx. 50 %...|$|R
