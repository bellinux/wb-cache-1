50|$|In the {{experiments}} with oxygen and hyphal development {{there was no}} requirement for calcium and no inhibition by EGTA. At the time of these studies many mycologists thought that calcium {{played a role in}} fungal morphology and were disinclined to believe that the labelling of agents such as the chelator EGTA and the ionophore A23187 could have been incorrectly said to be specific for calcium in many studies. Indeed it is still not clear how the error occurred because stability constants for EGTA chelated with Fe, Zn and Mn had been published before any claim of specificity for Ca. Calculations of the availability of free ions of essential divalent cations like Fe and Zn showed that experiments with EGTA were better explained as having caused deficiencies in these essential ions. Classical demonstration of the requirements for trace metals requires careful cleaning of all glassware or plastic dishes and the use of very pure distilled water, and <b>AR</b> <b>grade</b> chemicals. By this method A.macrogynus and Achlya species were shown to require Fe, and Zn but not Ca. The traditional supply of calcium salts to fungal cultures may have met the need for trace elements as even A.R. calcium salts always contain other divalent cations.|$|E

BackgroundQuantitative American Society of Echocardiography (QASE) thresholds are recommended for AR assessment, but impact on clinical outcome is unknown. MethodsWe prospectively enrolled (1991 to 2003) 251 asymptomatic patients (age 60 ± 17 years) with isolated AR and ejection fraction ≥ 50 % with quantified AR and left ventricular (LV) volumes using Doppler-echocardiography. ResultsSurvival under medical management was independently determined by baseline regurgitant volume (RVol) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1. 22 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 08 to 1. 35] per 10 ml/beat, p = 0. 002) and effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) (adjusted HR 1. 52 [95 % CI 1. 19 to 1. 91] per 10 mm 2, p = 0. 002), which superseded traditional <b>AR</b> <b>grading.</b> Patients with QASE-severe AR (RVol ≥ 60 ml/beat or ERO ≥ 30 mm 2) versus QASE-mild AR (RVol < 30 ml and ERO < 10 mm 2) had lower survival (10 years: 69 ± 9 % vs. 92 ± 4 %, p = 0. 05) independently of all clinical characteristics (adjusted HR 4. 1 [95 % CI 1. 4 to 14. 1], p = 0. 01) and lower survival free of surgery for AR (10 years: 20 ± 5 % vs. 92 ± 4 %, p < 0. 001, adjusted HR 12. 9 [95 % CI 5. 4 to 38. 5]). Cardiac events were considerably more frequent with QASE-severe versus -moderate or -mild AR (10 years: 63 ± 8 % vs. 34 ± 6 % and 21 ± 8 %, p < 0. 0001). Independent determinants of cardiac events were quantitative <b>AR</b> <b>grading</b> (QASE-severe adjusted HR 5. 2 [95 % CI 2. 2 to 14. 8], p < 0. 001; QASE-moderate adjusted HR 2. 4 [95 % CI 1. 06 to 6. 6], p = 0. 035), which superseded traditional AR assessment (p < 0. 001) and LV end-systolic volume index (ESVI) (adjusted HR 1. 09 [95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 14 per 10 ml/m 2], p = 0. 002), which superseded LV M-mode diameters. In QASE-severe AR, patients with ESVI ≥ 45 versus < 45 ml/m 2 had higher cardiac event rates (10 years: 87 ± 8 % vs. 40 ± 10 %, p < 0. 001). Cardiac surgery for AR reduced cardiac events in patients with QASE-severe AR (adjusted HR 0. 23 [95 % CI 0. 09 to 0. 57], p = 0. 002). ConclusionsEchocardiographic quantitation of AR severity and ESVI provides independent and superior predictors of clinical outcome in asymptomatic patients with AR and ejection fraction ≥ 50 % and should be widely clinically applied. Patients with QASE-severe AR and ESVI ≥ 45 ml/m 2 should be carefully considered for cardiac surgery, which reduces cardiac events risk...|$|R

We report results of a Marfan cohort treated exclusively with the non-modified David I procedure. METHODS: Forty-eight Marfan patients (25 males, mean age 33 ± 12 years, range 15 – 62 years) underwent the original variant of the David V-SARR (David I) between 1997 and 2013. Forty-two operations (88 %) were performed as elective procedures for aortic root aneurysms and six for acute dissections (12 %). Seventeen had aortic regurgitation (<b>AR)</b> <b>grades</b> ≥ 2 + preoperatively, and 3 had AR> 2 +. No patients with severe AR (4 +) were selected for V-SARR. Three full or hemi-arch replacements were performed. Patients who were operated on using {{a variation of the}} David I or David II procedure were excluded. RESULTS: Mean prosthesis size was 28 ± 3 mm (18 – 30 mm). Mean clinical and echocardiographic follow-up (98 % complete) was 3. 8 ± 3. 7 years with a cumulative follow-up of 178 patient-years. The early mortality rate was 2 % (one hospital death). The survival rate was 98 % (95 % confidence 84 – 99 %) at 4 years and 90 % (57 – 98 %) at 8 years with 5 patients at risk at 10 years. The rate of freedom from root or valve reoperation was 97 % (79 – 99 %) and 97 % (79 – 99 %) at 4 and 8 years, respectively. Only one patient required mechanical aortic valve replace-ment for progression of AR.

A 12 -lead electrocardigram showed atrial fibrillation (heart rate= 68 /min) but no evidence of ischemic change. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly but no pulmonary congestion. Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed a basal interventricular septum (IVS) markedly protruding into the left ventricular outflow tract (sigmoid septum). The angle formed by the aorta and the IVS (aorto-septal angle) was about 70 degrees. Furthermore, prolapse of the right coronary cusp toward the left ventricle accompanied by paradoxical motion of the basal IVS during diastole was also observed.

While transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) {{is the most}} widely used method, velocity-encoded phase-contrast magnetic resonance (PCMR) imaging in the ascending aorta for flow quantification is considered the gold standard method to calculate the regurgitant volume (Reg Vol). The aim of our study was to compare the AR severity by TTE and PCMR in a large serie of consecutive patients with aortic valvular heart disease (VHD). Methods and resultsbetween 2007 and 2014, 283 patients underwent clinically indicated TTE and PCMR (Philips ACHIEVA 1. 5 Tesla) within 30 days. Multiparametric approach was used by TTE (vena contracta, pisa method and semi-quantitative method) to <b>grade</b> <b>AR</b> severity. Mean age was 81 ± 9 years, 53 % were male. LVEF was not significantly different between TTE and CMR (55 ± 13 % and 53 ± 15 %); mean trans aortic gradient was> 40 mmHg in 53 % patients. <b>AR</b> was respectively <b>graded</b> 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 in 51 %, 19 %, 13 %; 8 % and 8 % by TTE which corresponded to a Reg Vol of 5. 3 ± 3. 9 mL, 16 ± 3, 26 ± 4, 37 ± 5, and 57 ± 9 mL respectively as obtained by PCMR. There was no significant overlap between different Reg vol by PCMR and the 5 grade obtained by TTE; The relation between AR- Reg vol and grade by TTE was not significantly affected by the mean trans-aortic gradient (i. e>or< 40 mmHg). ConclusionTTE as used in routine practice, allows a good discrimination and quantification of chronic AR when compared to that performed by CMR.

A QPCR-based logistic regression model was built on 5 of these 10 genes (AR threshold composite score > 37 %  = AR) and tested for AR prediction in an independent set of 109 samples, where it correctly diagnosed AR with 89 % accuracy, with no misclassifications for <b>AR</b> ISHLT <b>grade</b> 1 b.

The present evaluation examined whether AVC severity and its location could influence paravalvular aortic regurgitation (AR) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. A total of 79 patients (age 80 ± 7 years, 49 % men) with preprocedural multidetector row computed tomography were included. Volumetric AVC quantification and its location were assessed. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed to assess the presence and site of AR after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to evaluate the usefulness of AVC in determining paravalvular AR at a specific site. Postprocedural <b>AR</b> of <b>grade</b> 1 or more was observed in 63 patients. In most patients (n = 56, 71 %), AR was of paravalvular origin. Calcium at the aortic wall of each valve cusp had the largest area under the curve (0. 93, p < 0. 001) in predicting paravalvular AR at the aortic wall site compared to calcium at the valvular edge or body (area under the curve 0. 58 and 0. 67, respectively). Calcium at the valvular commissure was better than calcium at the valvular edge (area under the curve 0. 94 vs 0. 71) in predicting paravavular AR originating from the corresponding commissure. In conclusion, contrast-enhanced multidetector row computed tomography can be performed to quantify AVC.
