40|$|A {{new method}} to {{simulate}} flows <b>past</b> <b>a</b> two-dimensional porous plate is proposed. The method {{is a simple}} application of a discrete vortex method which has been well established for flows <b>past</b> <b>an</b> inclined flat plate. In this method, <b>a</b> flow <b>past</b> <b>a</b> porous plate is described as superposition of the velocity potential of a uniform flow on that of <b>a</b> flow <b>past</b> <b>a</b> flat plate. The effect of porosity is replaced by that of a mass flow rate of the approaching freestream passing through the plate. Calculated flow features are compared with experiments. It is shown that the present method is effective in the simulation of the flow <b>past</b> <b>a</b> porous plate...|$|R
5|$|All major moons {{comprise}} {{approximately equal}} amounts rock and ice, except Miranda, {{which is made}} primarily of ice. The ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. Their surfaces are heavily cratered, though all of them (except Umbriel) show signs of endogenic resurfacing {{in the form of}} lineaments (canyons) and, in the case of Miranda, ovoid race-track like structures called coronae. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae. Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel's appears oldest. <b>A</b> <b>past</b> 3:1 orbital resonance between Miranda and Umbriel and <b>a</b> <b>past</b> 4:1 resonance between Ariel and Titania are thought to be responsible for the heating that caused substantial endogenic activity on Miranda and Ariel.|$|E

5|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} for such <b>a</b> <b>past</b> resonance is Miranda's unusually high orbital inclination (4.34°) for a body {{so close to the}} planet. The largest Uranian moons may be internally differentiated, with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles. Titania and Oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the core/mantle boundary. The major moons of Uranus are airless bodies. For instance, Titania was shown to possess no atmosphere at a pressure larger than 10–20nanobar.|$|E
