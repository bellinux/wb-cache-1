5|$|Nasser made Egypt fully {{independent}} of British influence, {{and the country}} became a major power {{in the developing world}} under his leadership. One of Nasser's main domestic efforts was to establish social justice, which he deemed a prerequisite to liberal democracy. During his presidency, ordinary citizens enjoyed unprecedented access to housing, education, jobs, health services and nourishment, as well as other forms of social welfare, while feudalistic influence waned. By the end of his presidency, employment and working conditions improved considerably, although poverty was still high in the country <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> resources allocated for social welfare had been diverted to the war effort.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of his conquests, Alexander founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most of them east of the Tigris. The first, and greatest, was Alexandria in Egypt, which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities. The cities' {{locations}} reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first, the cities must have been inhospitable, little more than defensive garrisons. Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece. However, a century or so after Alexander's death, many of the Alexandrias were thriving, with elaborate public buildings <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> populations that included both Greek and local peoples.|$|E
5|$|The Ionian Revolt was {{primarily}} of significance as the opening chapter in, and causative {{agent of the}} Greco-Persian Wars, which included the two invasions of Greece and the famous battles of Marathon, Thermopylae and Salamis. For the Ionian cities themselves, the revolt ended in failure, <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> losses, both material and economic. However, Miletus aside, they recovered relatively quickly and prospered under Persian rule for the next forty years. For the Persians, the revolt was significant in drawing them into an extended conflict with the states of Greece which would last for fifty years, over which time they would sustain considerable losses.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{continued}} in {{use as a}} fort through the 18th and 19th centuries. In the early 1850s, fears of a fresh conflict with France, combined with changes in military technology, led to the redevelopment of the fortification. The out-dated Henrician castle {{was turned into a}} barracks <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> gun batteries were constructed beneath it, equipped with the latest naval artillery. In the 1880s and 1890s an electronically-operated minefield was laid across the River Fal, operated from St Mawes and Pendennis, and new, quick-firing guns were installed at St Mawes to support these defences. After 1905, however, St Mawes' guns were removed, and between 1920 and 1939 it was run by the state as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|The species {{occurs in}} coastal regions of Southwest Australia, from Gingin and Muchea north of Perth south to Augusta and east {{along the south}} coast to Green Range, east of Albany. It also occurs in the Stirling Range, a {{possible}} disjunction; and at Narrogin, a certain <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> disjunction. Nelson tentatively explains these disjunct populations in terms of natural climate fluctuations: during times of higher rainfall, the distribution of A.obovatus {{would have been much}} more extensive. Reductions in rainfall would cause the distribution to contract, but isolated populations could survive in favourable refugia.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the east}} coast of the United States, Hurricane Bob {{produced}} moderate rainfall <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> damage. Damage totaled about $1.5billion (1991USD). That included about $700million through cleanup costs, uninsured losses, and food claims. That made it, at the time, one of the costliest United States hurricanes, although the total was due to the storm passing through a densely populated region. As of 2010, Hurricane Bob ranked as the 22nd costliest tropical cyclone in the United States mainland. Across its track, the hurricane left 2.1million people without power. There were six confirmed tornadoes, along with thirteen unconfirmed tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|With the British 6th Airborne Division still {{refitting}} after Operation Tonga, and {{the subsequent}} fighting in Normandy, the task of securing the Rhine Bridgehead fell to the 1st Airborne Division {{under the command of}} Major-General Roy Urquhart. The division was made up of three brigades of infantry (two parachute, one glider borne), supporting artillery and anti-tank batteries <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> Royal Engineer units, as well as supporting elements such as Royal Army Service Corps and Royal Army Medical Corps units. Most of the division had seen action in North Africa and Sicily, particularly the 1st Parachute Brigade and 1st Airlanding Brigade.

5|$|British losses {{during the}} siege of 88 killed and 131 wounded were {{relatively}} heavy; French casualties were not recorded but {{were thought to be}} negligible as few defenders were exposed to British fire during the only day of bombardment. Captured in the city were 645 French soldiers and 1,014 sepoys with 167 guns of varying sizes and materials <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> quantities of ammunition. Elsewhere the other French Indian colonies of Karaikal, Yanam, Mahé and Chandernagore all surrendered when summoned without conflict, assuring British dominance among the European powers on the Indian Subcontinent. It has been noted that British naval forces in the Bay of Bengal were unusually weak during this period, Minerva the only warship on active operations, and had the French managed to concentrate their forces in the region they might have considerably extended the siege of Pondicherry and caused considerable damage to British merchant shipping in the region. The French made no efforts to recapture their lost Indian territories during the war, but regained them {{under the terms of the}} Peace of Amiens in 1802.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, German counterattacks on PPCLI {{positions}} in the town had begun, involving tanks from the 7th Company of the 26th Panzer Regiment (26. Panzer-Regiment), field guns <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> infantry forces. Throughout the afternoon two infantry companies of the PPCLI fought off several attacks by German forces, eventually managing to push {{them back to the}} vineyards on the northern edge of the town. While the PPCLI had taken 68 casualties, German casualties were estimated at 120. However, three strong German formation surrounded the Canadian positions at Villa Rogatti, rendering further exploitation of the bridgehead unlikely. Col. Ware was advised to be ready to withdraw across the Moro River, should German forces counterattack. In order to allow the Canadian Division a greater concentration of force, on the night of 7/8 December, the Indian 21st Infantry Brigade from the Indian 8th Infantry Division amalgamated the western flank of the 1st Canadian Division into their own lines. As a result of the withdrawal, Canadian efforts would focus on achieving a bridgehead at San Leonardo.|$|E

5|$|King John enjoyed regular {{hunting in}} the Forest each November, and used St Briavels Castle as his base for such trips. The king entertained the Welsh lord Gruffyd ap Cadwallon at the castle in 1207. This royal {{interest}} resulted in further building works <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> expenditure, with £291 being spent {{in the next four}} years. A stone curtain wall replaced an earlier wooden one between 1209–11, complete with a tower and gateway. Inside the bailey a number of buildings suitable for use by the king as a lodge were constructed. A wooden chapel was built within the castle in 1236–7. The castle expansion may have been funded by the increased taxes from iron-working across the areas, {{and by the end of}} John's reign, the castle was almost in its mature form.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November Allenby made {{preparations}} for battle the following day. He ordered {{an attack by}} the 52nd (Lowland) Division to extend their position across the Nahr Sukereir on the Turkish Army's right flank. Reinforced with two additional brigades, he ordered the Australian Mounted Division to advance towards Tel es Safi where they encountered a determined <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> Turkish counterattack. This counterattack forced the mounted division to concede the territory gained during the day, before fighting the Turkish Army to a standstill in front of Summeil. On {{the morning after the}} battle at Mughar Ridge, Junction Station was occupied and during the following days other villages in the area were found to have been abandoned. Later in the morning of 14 November New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade ran into a determined and well entrenched Turkish rearguard near Ayun Kara, which they attacked. Fierce close quarter fighting against the Turkish 3rd Infantry Division continued during the afternoon. Although severely threatened, the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade eventually prevailed and went on to occupy Jaffa two days later.|$|E
5|$|The Oklahoma City {{bombing was}} a {{domestic}} terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing killed 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed {{one-third of the}} building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies {{in the wake of}} the bombing, <b>and</b> <b>substantial</b> donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. The Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil until the September 11 attacks six years later, and it still remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in United States history.|$|E
