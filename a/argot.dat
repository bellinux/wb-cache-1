5|$|With ultra-violent {{films such}} as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Thirst (2009), Park Chan-wook of South Korea {{has been the most}} {{prominent}} director outside of the United States to work regularly in a noir mode in the new millennium. The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements is The Spirit (2008). This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for Road to Perdition (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and A History of Violence (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film {{of the year in the}} annual Village Voice poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's Brick (2005), featuring present-day high schoolers speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled <b>argot,</b> won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival. The television series Veronica Mars (2004–07) also brought a youth-oriented twist to film noir. Examples of this sort of generic crossover have been dubbed teen noir.|$|E

25|$|The four-act tragicomedy Le Fou? {{is seen by}} Vianu as {{comparable}} in subject matter and depth to Enrico IV, a celebrated 1922 play by Luigi Pirandello. The plot reflects Macedonski's confrontation with his critics, and his acceptance {{of the fact that}} people saw in him an eccentric. The central figure is a banker, Dorval, who identifies himself with Napoleon Bonaparte {{to the point where he}} sees episodes in his biography as mirrors of early 19th-century battles. Unlike patients with dissociative identity disorder, Dorval does not actually imagine his life has become Napoleon's, but rather joins with him on an intellectual level. Witnesses of this disorder are divided into family, who seek to have Dorval committed, and close friends, who come to see his take on life as a manifestation of genius. The spectator is led to believe that the latter interpretation is the correct one. At a larger level, Vianu indicates, the play is also Macedonski's critique of capitalism, and, using Parisian <b>argot,</b> makes allusive references to famous people of the day.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of leet is its unique approach to orthography, using substitutions of other characters, letters or otherwise, to represent a letter or letters in a word. For more casual use of leet, the primary strategy is to use homoglyphs, symbols that closely resemble (to varying degrees) the letters for which they stand. The choice of symbol is not fixed—anything that the reader can make sense of is valid. However, this practice is not extensively used in regular leet; more often it is seen in situations where the <b>argot</b> (i.e., secret language) characteristics of the system are required, either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general, i.e., anything that the average reader cannot make sense of is valid; a valid reader should himself try to make sense, if deserving of the underlying message. Another use for Leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords. Limitations imposed by websites on password length (usually no more than 36) and the characters permitted (usually alphanumeric and underscore) require less extensive forms of Leet when used in this application.|$|E

Furthermore, a well-defined triazole mid-chain functionalized block homopolymer, i. e. polystyrene-b-polystyrene (PS-b-PS, Mn,SEC = 4. 4 kDa,= 1. 08), was synthesized via a combination of <b>ARGET</b> ATRP and copper(i) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) as a reference material. Reference polymers without bromine and with ester/triazole functionalities were additionally investigated. Thermomechanical stress was applied to the polymers via small scale extrusion as well as a rheological assessment (G′(t), G′′(t)) under processing conditions. The thermally challenged polymers were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to arrive at a detailed image of the degradation susceptibility of individual functional groups, especially esters, bromines and triazole functions. The findings indicate an enhanced degradation of ATRP polymers via an accelerated ester cleavage due to HBr release at high temperatures accompanied by a concomitant molecular weight increase due to the formation of triazolium salts via the reaction of triazole units with bromine terminal chain ends.

40|$|The {{importance}} of finding new applications for cellulose‐based products has increased, especially {{to meet the}} demand for new environmentally friendly materials, but also since the digitalization of our society will eventually decrease the need for paper. To expand the application area of cellulose, modification to improve and/or introduce new properties can be a requisite. Thus, the focus of this study has been to achieve fundamental knowledge about polymer grafting of cellulose via well‐controlled radical polymerization. Cellulose, in the form of filter paper, has successfully been grafted via activators regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (<b>ARGET</b> ATRP) of the monomers: methyl methacrylate, styrene, and glycidyl methacrylate. The advantages of <b>ARGET</b> ATRP are that only a small amount of a copper catalyst is required and the reaction can be performed in limited amount of air; yet, providing for relatively well‐controlled reactions. These benefits can render <b>ARGET</b> ATRP an attractive method for industrial utilization. The contact‐angle measurements of the grafted filter papers confirmed that the hydrophobicity of cellulose was significantly increased, even for shorter graft lengths. FT‐IR spectroscopy established that the amount of polymer successively increased with monomer conversion. High‐resolution FT‐IR microscopy (FT‐IRM) was proven to be a very useful technique for the analysis of cellulose substrates, displaying the spatial distribution of polymer content on cellulose fibers. The polymer was shown to be fairly homogenously distributed on the fiber. An initiator with a reducible disulfide bond rendered cleavage of the polymer grafts possible, employing mild reaction conditions. The cleaved grafts and the free polymers – formed from a sacrificial initiator in parallel to the grafting – were shown to have similar molar masses and dispersities, confirming that the grafts can be tailored by utilizing a sacrificial initiator. Moreover, the initiator content on filter paper and microcrystalline cellulose was assessed. A comparison between the two grafting techniques, grafting‐from cellulose via <b>ARGET</b> ATRP and grafting‐to cellulose via copper(I) ‐catalyzed alkyne‐azide cycloaddition, was performed. To achieve a trustworthy comparison, the free polymer formed in parallel to the grafting‐from reaction was employed as the prepolymer in the grafting‐to approach, resulting in nearly identical graft length on the substrates for the two grafting methods. FT‐IRM analyses verified that under the selected conditions, the grafting‐from technique is superior to the grafting‐to approach with respect to controlling the distribution of the polymer content on the surface. The results were corroborated with X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy. QC 20121126 </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a fundamental {{problem in the}} area of viral marketing, called T <b>ARGET</b> S ET S ELECTION problem. In a a viral marketing setting, social networks are modeled by graphs with potential customers of a new product as vertices and friend relationships as edges, where each vertex v is assigned a threshold value θ(v). The thresholds represent the different latent tendencies of customers (vertices) to buy the new product when their friend (neighbors) do. Consider a repetitive process on social network (G,θ) where each vertex v is associated with two states, active and inactive, which indicate whether v is persuaded into buying the new product. Suppose we are given a target set S⊆ V(G). Initially, all vertices in G are inactive. At time step 0, we choose all vertices in S to become active. Then, at every time step t> 0, all vertices that were active in time step t- 1 remain active, and we activate any vertex v if at least θ(v) of its neighbors were active at time step t- 1. The activation process terminates when no more vertices can get activated. We are interested in the following optimization problem, called T <b>ARGET</b> S ET S ELECTION: Finding a target set S of smallest possible size that activates all vertices of G. There is an important and well-studied threshold called strict majority threshold, where for every vertex v in G we have θ(v) =(d(v) + 1) / 2 and d(v) is the degree of v in G. In this paper, we consider the T <b>ARGET</b> S ET S ELECTION problem under strict majority thresholds and focus on three popular regular network structures: cycle permutation graphs, generalized Petersen graphs and torus cordalis...|$|R

The self-assembled empty and DOX-loaded micelles were spherical in morphologies with average sizes of 63 and 110  nm depending on the architecture of the copolymers. The pH responsiveness and in vitro release properties from the micelles exhibited desired pH dependence owing to the protonation of tertiary amine groups of DEA.
