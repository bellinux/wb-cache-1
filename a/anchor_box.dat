5000|$|The Mk 6 {{mine was}} a 34 in {{diameter}} steel sphere containing a buoyancy chamber and 300 lb of TNT. [...] Each mine was constructed of two steel hemispheres welded together. A Toxyl bursting charge was cast {{into the lower}} hemisphere. Toxyl {{was a mixture of}} 60% trinitroxylene (TNX) with 40% TNT used because the United States Army controlled United States TNT production and would not release sufficient quantities for the naval mine barrage. [...] For transport, the mine rested atop a box-shaped steel anchor approximately 30 in square. The <b>anchor</b> <b>box</b> had wheels allowing the mine assembly to be moved along a system of rails aboard the minelayer. The mine was connected to its 800 lb <b>anchor</b> <b>box</b> by a wire rope mooring cable stored on a reel. [...] The depth of the mine below the water surface was controlled by allowing the steel mooring cable to unwind from its reel as the mine was dropped from the minelayer until a sensor suspended beneath the anchor reached the bottom. The sensor locked the cable reel so the falling anchor would pull the buoyant mine below the surface; and the float extended the antenna above the mine. [...] Each mine had two hydrostatic safety features intended to render the mine safe if it detached from its mooring cable and floated to the surface. The first was an open switch in the detonation circuit closed by hydrostatic pressure. The second was a spring pushing the detonator away from the explosive charge into the buoyancy chamber unless compressed by hydrostatic pressure. The mines were intended to be safe at depths less than 25 ft.|$|E

In this paper, we give upper bounds for the star-discrepancy and its inverse for subsets of the d-dimensional unit cube. They improve known results. In particular, we determine the usually only implicitly given constants. The bounds are based on the construction of nearly optimal δ-covers of <b>anchored</b> <b>boxes</b> in the d-dimensional unit cube.

30|$|WSN {{localization}} algorithms are {{shorter than}} the MCB and MCL time higher positioning accuracy. MCB has higher sampling and filtering efficiency than MCL because the sampling region adopted by MCB has a smaller area than that adopted by MCL. In addition, the reason why MCB filter sampling point is because when there is less anchor node sampling area out of {{a portion of the}} anchor node of the signal will overlap the coverage area. In MCB, the mobile node can receive signals from anchor nodes outside the area covered by each to form a rectangle. Then, the area-circumscribed rectangle is covered by a section of all other anchor boxes, usually in addition to the <b>anchor</b> <b>box</b> anchor signal node mutual coverage area outside the region, as well as some regional or no signal coverage area with only a few anchor nodes. Therefore, the MCB position still requires filter methods. This paper considers that targeting efficiency will be greatly improved if the sampling area lies inside the overlapping coverage areas of anchor node signals, such that filtration and repeated sampling can be completely eliminated. The proposed algorithm is presented as follows.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{fast and}} high-accuracy amodal 3 D object detections in RGB-D images, which {{requires}} a compact 3 D bounding box around the whole object even under partial observations. To avoid the time-consuming proposals preextraction, we propose a single end-to-end framework based on the deep neural networks which hierarchically incorporates appearance and geometric features from 2. 5 D representation to 3 D objects. The depth information has helped on reducing the output space of 3 D bounding boxes into a manageable set of 3 D anchor boxes with different sizes on multiple feature layers. At prediction time, in a convolutional fashion, the network predicts scores for categories and adjustments for locations, sizes and orientations of each 3 D <b>anchor</b> <b>box,</b> which has considered multi-scale 2 D features. Experiments on the challenging SUN RGB-D datasets show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art by 10. 2 in mAP and is 88 x faster than the Deep Sliding Shape.

40|$|The Stonecutters Bridge (SCB) in Hong Kong is the third-longest {{cable-stayed}} {{bridge in the}} world with a main span stretching 1, 018 m between two 298 m high single-leg tapering composite towers. A Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System (WASHMS) is being implemented on SCB by the Highways Department of The Hong Kong SAR Government, and the SCB-WASHMS is composed of more than 1, 300 sensors in 15 types. In order to establish a linkage between structural health monitoring and maintenance management, a Structural Health Rating System (SHRS) with relevant rating tools and indices is devised. On the basis of a 3 D space frame finite element model (FEM) of SCB and model updating, this paper presents the development of an SHR-oriented 3 D multi-scale FEM for the purpose of load-resistance analysis and damage evaluation in structural element level, including modeling, refinement and validation of the multi-scale FEM. The refined 3 D structural segments at deck and towers are established in critical segment positions corresponding to maximum cable forces. The components in the critical segment region are modeled as a full 3 D FEM and fitted into the 3 D space frame FEM. The boundary conditions between beam and shell elements are performed conforming to equivalent stiffness, effective mass and compatibility of deformation. The 3 D multi-scale FEM is verified by the in-situ measured dynamic characteristics and static response. A good agreement between the FEM and measurement results indicates that the 3 D multi-scale FEM is precise and efficient for WASHMS and SHRS of SCB. In addition, stress distribution and concentration of the critical segments in the 3 D multi-scale FEM under temperature loads, static wind loads and equivalent seismic loads are investigated.

40|$|A more {{efficient}} and effective approach for detecting animal species in digital images is required. Every winter, the Climate-ecological Observatory for Arctic Tundra (COAT) project deploys several dozen camera traps in eastern Finnmark, Norway. These cameras capture large volumes of images {{that are used to}} study and document the impact of climate changes on animal populations. Currently, the images are examined and annotated manually by ecologists, hired technicians, or crowdsourced teams of volunteers. This process is expensive, time-consuming and error-prone, acting as a bottleneck that hinders development in the COAT project. This thesis describes and implements a unified detection system that can automatically localize and identify animal species in digital images from camera traps in the Arctic tundra. The system unifies three state-of-the-art object detection methods that use deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), called Faster Region-based CNN, Single Shot Multibox Detector and You Only Look Once v 2. With each object detection method, the system can train CNN models, evaluate their detection accuracy, and subsequently use them to detect objects in images. Using data provided by COAT, we create an object detection dataset with 8000 images containing over 12000 animals of nine different species. We evaluate the performance of the system experimentally, by comparing the detection accuracy and computational complexity of each object detection method. By experimenting in an iterative fashion, we derive and apply several training methods to improve animal detection in camera trap images. These training methods include custom <b>anchor</b> <b>boxes,</b> image preprocessing and Online Hard Example Mining.

40|$|The rise of deep {{learning}} has facilitated remarkable progress in video understanding. This thesis addresses three important tasks of video understanding: video object detection, joint object and action detection, and spatio-temporal action localization. Object class detection {{is one of}} the most important challenges in computer vision. Object detectors are usually trained on bounding-boxes from still images. Recently, video has been used as an alternative source of data. Yet, training an object detector on one domain (either still images or videos) and testing on the other one results in a significant performance gap compared to training and testing on the same domain. In the first part of this thesis, we examine the reasons behind this performance gap. We define and evaluate several domain shift factors: spatial location accuracy, appearance diversity, image quality, aspect distribution, and object size and camera framing. We examine the impact of these factors by comparing the detection performance before and after cancelling them out. The results show that all five factors affect the performance of the detectors and their combined effect explains the performance gap. While most existing approaches for detection in videos focus on objects or human actions separately, in the second part of this thesis we aim at detecting non-human centric actions, i. e., objects performing actions, such as cat eating or dog jumping. We introduce an end-to-end multitask objective that jointly learns object-action relationships. We compare it with different training objectives, validate its effectiveness for detecting object-action pairs in videos, and show that both tasks of object and action detection benefit from this joint learning. In experiments on the A 2 D dataset, we obtain state-of-the-art results on segmentation of object-action pairs. In the third part, we are the first to propose an action tubelet detector that leverages the temporal continuity of videos instead of operating at the frame level, as state-of- the-art approaches do. The same way modern detectors rely on <b>anchor</b> <b>boxes,</b> our tubelet detector is based on anchor cuboids by taking as input a sequence of frames and outputing tubelets, i. e., sequences of bounding boxes with associated scores.

Plant proteins having antilithiatic activity is a hitherto unexplored area and therefore, we conducted a detailed identification and characterization of antilithiatic proteins from Terminalia arjuna (T. arjuna). Proteins were isolated from the dried bark of T. arjuna and those having molecular weights > 3 kDa were subjected to anion exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. Four proteins were identified exhibiting inhibitory activity against CaOx crystallization and crystal growth kinetics The cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic efficacy of these purified proteins was further investigated on oxalate injured renal epithelial cells (MDCK and NRK- 52 E) wherein, injury due to oxalate was significantly attenuated and led to a dose dependent increase in viability of these cells. These proteins also prevented the interaction of the CaOx crystals to the cell surface and reduced the number of apoptotic cells.
