5|$|Parisians tend {{to share}} the same movie-going trends {{as many of the}} world's global cities, with cinemas {{primarily}} dominated by Hollywood-generated film entertainment. French cinema comes a close second, with major directors (réalisateurs) such as Claude Lelouch, Jean-Luc Godard, and Luc Besson, and the more slapstick/popular genre with director Claude Zidi as an example. European and Asian films are also widely shown <b>and</b> <b>appreciated.</b> On 2 February 2000, Philippe Binant realised the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} the original ZX Spectrum Underwurlde release. They noted its expansive game world <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> the parts where Sabreman travelled by bubble. Later critics {{commented on the}} game's frustrating difficulty. While the Commodore 64 version {{was similar to the}} original, reviews were mixed—one critic thought the title had aged poorly in the year between releases. Your Sinclair placed Underwurlde within its top 20 for the ZX Spectrum, though their readers put it near the bottom of their top 100. The game was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Almost all of Josquin's motets {{use some}} kind of {{compositional}} constraint on the process; they are not freely composed. Some of them use a cantus firmus as a unifying device; some are canonic; some use a motto which repeats throughout; some use several of these methods. The motets that use canon can be roughly divided into two groups: those in which the canon is plainly designed to be heard <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> as such, and another group in which a canon is present, but almost impossible to hear, and seemingly written to be appreciated by the eye, and by connoisseurs.|$|E

5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting these works {{was one of}} familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman's second role of {{the year}} came {{opposite}} Meryl Streep and Amy Adams in John Patrick Shanley's Doubt, where he played Father Brendan Flynn– a priest accused of sexually abusing a 12-year-old African American student in the 1960s. Hoffman was already familiar with the play <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> the opportunity {{to bring it to}} the screen; in preparing for the role, he talked extensively to a priest who lived through the era. The film had a mixed reception, with some critics such as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian suspicious of it as Oscar bait, but Hoffman gained second consecutive Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, and was also nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.|$|E
5|$|In the finale, {{the main}} {{characters}} spend the longest {{amount of time in}} the parallel universe to date. The writers sought to emphasize {{the differences between the two}} worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's doppelgänger, Fauxlivia; DC Comics designed special covers based upon some of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other popular culture differences were noted <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> by critics, persuading the writers to add more in the third season. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), as well as the return of actors Leonard Nimoy and Kirk Acevedo as William Bell and Agent Charlie Francis, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Liman {{approached}} {{a wide range}} of actors for the role of Bourne, including Brad Pitt, who turned it down to star in Spy Game, as well as Russell Crowe, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise and Sylvester Stallone, before he eventually cast Damon. Liman found that Damon understood <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> that, though The Bourne Identity would have its share of action, the focus was primarily on character and plot. Damon, who had never played such a physically demanding role, insisted on performing many of the stunts himself. With stunt choreographer Nick Powell, he underwent three months of extensive training in stunt work, the use of weapons, boxing, and eskrima. He eventually performed a significant number of the film's stunts himself, including hand-to-hand combat and climbing the safe house walls near the film's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|Nenjil Or Aalayam was {{released}} on 26 January 1962, coinciding with the Republic Day of India. The film received critical acclaim and was also commercially successful upon release; it ran for 175 days in theatres. The film is hailed as a landmark for portraying a triangular love story in an innovative manner. To celebrate the film's successful outing at the box office, the film's crew members created an advertisement thanking {{the people who came}} to watch the film <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> it; the advertisement was issued in Nadigar Sangam's official magazine, Nadigan Kural, on 9 February 1962.|$|E
5|$|Norcross was afforded {{a privileged}} {{education}} {{that was not}} available to many young ladies of her generation. At 16 years of age, she graduated from Fitchburg High School, and, beginning in 1870, she attended Wheaton Female Seminary, now Wheaton College. When she was 16 and 17 years old she wrote essays for Rushlight, the school's literary journal. The nature of her essays {{provide insight into the}} woman she would become: one who would successfully operate in a male-oriented society, had an interest in bettering the plight of others, <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> historical things. She graduated in 1872. Frances Vose Emerson was a classmate at Wheaton, good friend from childhood, and ultimately a trustee for the Fitchburg Art Museum.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{preferred}} the Nintendo64 port over the arcade release, <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> its audiovisual enhancements, but felt that its graphical upgrades and memorization-based combo gameplay were insufficient {{when compared to}} fighting games like Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2. Critics recommended Gold primarily for fans of the series and genre, but IGN reported that even fans were upset by changes in the combo system {{and the absence of}} several well-liked characters. Gold ultimately did not replicate the success of its Super NES predecessor, and the series remained dormant through its 2002 acquisition by Microsoft until its 2013 reboot.|$|E
5|$|The game world's {{design and}} the game's {{attention}} to detail were well received by critics. Game Informers Andrew Reiner said the game's setting had a taut and mesmerizing atmosphere, and {{was a place of}} wonder and inexplicable horror. Miller called it the right mix of creepy and cool, <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> the gradual damage reflected on Batman's suit as the story progressed, but said that pixelated CGI and lip synching issues diminished the presentation. Whitehead said that the impressive animation makes Batman feel alive, but wrote that the world itself was lifeless and lacking in interactive objects. He criticized segments in which character logic was sacrificed for video game tropes, citing repeated use of poison gas and electric floors as obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{influenced}} {{by a variety of}} cultures fashions, including Guatemalan, Japanese, Indian and Jamaican styles. Stefani came from a family of seamstresses. This further inspired her to launch her own fashion line. The line achieved popularity among celebrities and was worn by stars such as Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, Paris Hilton and Stefani herself. The fashion line made a runway debut in the spring collection of 2004 and achieved mainstream success at New York Fashion Week in 2005. At one point its annual gross income was $90 million. The line, as well as the shows at which it was displayed, were well received by critics <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> the indulgence of a celebrity into the fashion world. An additional fashion line, called Harajuku Lovers, was subsequently launched by Stefani.|$|E

5|$|Mani again {{teamed up}} with Ram Gopal Varma to provide the {{screenplay}} for the latter's Telugu film Gaayam, a socio-politico film loosely based on The Godfather. In 1995, Mani returned to Tamil language drama through Bombay starring Arvind Swamy and Manisha Koirala, which {{told the story of}} a Hindu-Muslim couple {{in the midst of the}} 1993 religious Bombay riots and bombings. It was also the first Indian film to focus on marriage between Hindu and Muslim people. The film met with controversy and censorship upon release, was subsequently dubbed into Hindi and was commercially successful <b>and</b> <b>appreciated</b> by critics. It won a number of awards, such as Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration, Special Award from the Political Film Society, In the Spirit of Freedom Award at the Jerusalem International Film Festival and the Gala Award at the Edinburgh International Film Festival.|$|E
