5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography <b>and</b> <b>measurement</b> of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{is the critical}} study of economics including its methodology, epistemology, history and empirical research, attempting to overcome androcentric (male and patriarchal) biases. It focuses on topics of particular relevance to women, such as care work or occupational segregation (exclusion of women and minorities from certain fields); deficiencies of economic models, such as disregarding intra-household bargaining; new forms of data collection <b>and</b> <b>measurement</b> such as the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and more gender-aware theories such as the capabilities approach. Feminist economics ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive economics.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Albert Michelson and Francis Pease {{mounted a}} 6-meter {{interferometer}} {{on the front}} of the 2.5-meter telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory. Helped by John Anderson, the trio measured the angular diameter of Betelgeuse at 0.047", a figure which resulted in a diameter of 3.84×108km (2.58 AU) based on the parallax value of 0.018". However, limb darkening <b>and</b> <b>measurement</b> errors resulted in uncertainty about the accuracy of these measurements.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} forms of {{research}} studies, {{it is important to}} have a critical approach to statistics <b>and</b> <b>measurements.</b> There are problems associated with many forms of measurement, like the UCR and NCVS surveys, but looking at these statistics <b>and</b> <b>measurements</b> through a critical lens will help us to realize what statistics <b>and</b> <b>measurements</b> are valid <b>and</b> reliable.|$|R

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Rutgers, Friedman was offered two {{scholarships}} to do graduate work—one in mathematics at Brown University {{and the other}} in economics at the University of Chicago. Friedman chose the latter, thus earning a Master of Arts degree in 1933. He was strongly influenced by Jacob Viner, Frank Knight, and Henry Simons. It was at Chicago that Friedman met his future wife, economist Rose Director. During the 1933–1934 academic year he had a fellowship at Columbia University, where he studied statistics with renowned statistician and economist Harold Hotelling. He was back in Chicago for the 1934–1935 academic year, working as a research assistant for Henry Schultz, who was then working on Theory <b>and</b> <b>Measurement</b> of Demand. That year, Friedman formed what would prove to be lifelong friendships with George Stigler and W. Allen Wallis.|$|E
5|$|The friends, {{followers}} of the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler, were self-taught mathematical astronomers who had worked methodically to correct and improve Kepler's Rudolphine tables by observation <b>and</b> <b>measurement.</b> In 1639, Horrocks was the only astronomer to realise that a transit of Venus was imminent; others became aware of it only after the event when Horrocks's report of it was circulated. Although the friends both died within five years of making their observations, their ground-breaking work was influential in establishing {{the size of the}} Solar System; for this and their other achievements Horrocks and Crabtree, along with their correspondent William Gascoigne, are considered to be the founding fathers of British research astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other animal}} stories that uses words humans use, the feline {{characters}} of the Warriors series use different words for certain concepts and objects in the natural world. The most common terms found within the books are 'Twolegs' (humans), 'kittypets' (house cats), 'monsters' (cars), 'the Thunderpath' (a road) or 'the horseplace' (a stable). The cats also have their own terms for time <b>and</b> <b>measurement,</b> such as sundown or moonhigh representing different times of day according to {{the positions of the}} moon, sun, and stars overhead. The seasons are given names according to the trees and foliage in the forest, with 'newleaf' meaning spring, 'greenleaf' meaning summer, 'leaf-fall' meaning autumn, and 'leaf-bare' meaning winter.|$|E
