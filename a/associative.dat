5|$|A {{commutative}} semigroup {{is a set}} {{endowed with}} a total, <b>associative</b> and commutative operation.|$|E
5|$|Brower {{stated in}} an {{interview}} in 2013 that he intended to continue the process of <b>associative</b> musical themes in Legacy of the Void.|$|E
5|$|If the {{operation}} also has two-sided inverses and is <b>associative,</b> then the magma is a group. The inverse of x can be denoted by x−1 and follows {{all the usual}} rules for exponents.|$|E
5|$|In amphibians, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of habituation, <b>associative</b> learning through both classical and instrumental learning, and discrimination abilities.|$|E
5|$|This {{recursive}} {{formulation of}} addition {{was developed by}} Dedekind as early as 1854, and he would expand upon it in the following decades. He proved the <b>associative</b> and commutative properties, among others, through mathematical induction.|$|E
5|$|Commutative algebra makes great use of {{rings of}} polynomials {{in one or}} several variables, {{introduced}} above. Their multiplication is both commutative and <b>associative.</b> These rings and their quotients {{form the basis of}} algebraic geometry, because they are rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|MU5 was {{designed}} to be about 20 times faster than Atlas, and was optimised for running compiled programs rather than hand-written machine code, something that contemporary computers were unable to do efficiently. A major factor in the MU5's much-improved performance over its predecessors was its incorporation of <b>associative</b> memory, which greatly speeded up access to its main store.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of an}} <b>associative</b> array {{that allows}} data to be {{accessed}} by its value rather than by its address {{dates back to the}} mid-1940s in the work of Konrad Zuse and Vannevar Bush, but hash tables were not described until 1953, in an IBM memorandum by Hans Peter Luhn. Luhn used a different collision resolution method, chaining, rather than linear probing.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now {{is renowned}} for its {{innovative}} editing style and its use of recurring motifs and themes and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit for its time. The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards {{in keeping with the}} depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using <b>associative</b> editing techniques.|$|E
5|$|Much work on hypercomplex {{numbers and}} group {{representations}} {{was carried out}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras. Briefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of <b>associative</b> algebras and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} major {{pathways}} {{in the brain}} connecting other brain areas with the basal ganglia. These are known as the motor, oculo-motor, <b>associative,</b> limbic and orbitofrontal circuits, with names indicating the main projection area of each circuit. All of them are affected in PD, and their disruption explains many of the symptoms of the disease, since these circuits {{are involved in a}} wide variety of functions, including movement, attention and learning. Scientifically, the motor circuit has been examined the most intensively.|$|E
5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be <b>associative,</b> there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.|$|E
5|$|A ring likewise, has {{a set of}} elements, but now has two {{operation}}s. The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is <b>associative</b> and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E
5|$|For {{implementing}} <b>associative</b> arrays, hash tables, a {{data structure}} that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records; most implementations require only amortized constant time on average. However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, {{as the only}} information given on a failed search is that the target is not present in any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. In addition, all operations possible on a sorted array can be performed—such as finding the smallest and largest key and performing range searches.|$|E
5|$|In {{political}} and sociocultural studies, monarchies are normally associated with hereditary rule; most monarchs, in both {{historical and contemporary}} contexts, have been born and raised within a royal family. Succession has been defined {{using a variety of}} distinct formulae, such as proximity of blood, primogeniture, and agnatic seniority. Some monarchies, however, are not hereditary, and the ruler is instead determined through an elective process; a modern example is the throne of Malaysia. These systems defy the model concept of a monarchy, but are commonly considered as such because they retain certain <b>associative</b> characteristics. Many systems use a combination of hereditary and elective elements, where the election or nomination of a successor is restricted to members of a royal bloodline.|$|E
5|$|Late LTP is {{induced by}} changes in gene {{expression}} and protein synthesis {{brought about by the}} persistent activation of protein kinases activated during E-LTP, such as MAPK. In fact, MAPK—specifically the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of MAPKs—may be the molecular link between E-LTP and L-LTP, since many signaling cascades involved in E-LTP, including CaMKII and PKC, can converge on ERK. Recent research has shown that the induction of L-LTP can depend on coincident molecular events, namely PKA activation and calcium influx, that converge on CRTC1 (TORC1), a potent transcriptional coactivator for cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). This requirement for a molecular coincidence accounts perfectly for the <b>associative</b> nature of LTP, and, presumably, for that of learning.|$|E
25|$|<b>Associative</b> {{learning}} in animal behaviour is any learning {{process in which}} a new response becomes associated with a particular stimulus. The first studies of <b>associative</b> learning were made by Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. Examples of <b>associative</b> {{learning in}}clude when a goldfish swims to the water surface when a human is going to feed it, or the excitement of a dog whenever it sees a leash as a prelude for a walk.|$|E
25|$|Function {{composition}} is always <b>associative.</b>|$|E
25|$|Multiplication is <b>associative</b> (α·β)·γ = α·(β·γ).|$|E
25|$|Multiplication is <b>associative</b> (κ·μ)·ν = κ·(μ·ν).|$|E
25|$|Multiplication of {{symmetry}} transformations is <b>associative.</b>|$|E
25|$|Endomorphism {{rings are}} <b>associative,</b> but {{typically}} non-commutative.|$|E
25|$|When {{considering}} {{representations of}} an <b>associative</b> algebra, one can forget the underlying field, and simply regard the <b>associative</b> algebra as a ring, and its representations as modules. This approach is surprisingly fruitful: many results in representation theory {{can be interpreted}} as special cases of results about modules over a ring.|$|E
25|$|This {{multiplication}} is commutative, <b>associative</b> and distributes over addition.|$|E
25|$|Addition is <b>associative</b> (α + β) + γ = α + (β + γ).|$|E
25|$|Addition is <b>associative</b> (κ + μ) + ν = κ + (μ + ν).|$|E
25|$|A paired word <b>associative</b> task {{consists}} of two phases. During the first phase (acquisition), {{the responses of the}} paired-associate task are learned and become recallable. In the second phase (<b>associative</b> phase), the subject learns to pair each response to a separate stimulus. For example, a visual cue would provide information as to what words must be recalled after the stimulus and words are removed.|$|E
25|$|In one sense, <b>associative</b> algebra {{representations}} generalize both {{representations of}} groups and Lie algebras. A {{representation of a}} group induces a representation of a corresponding group ring or group algebra, while representations of a Lie algebra correspond bijectively to representations of its universal enveloping algebra. However, the representation theory of general <b>associative</b> algebras does not {{have all of the}} nice properties of the representation theory of groups and Lie algebras.|$|E
25|$|Like whole numbers, {{fractions}} {{obey the}} commutative, <b>associative,</b> and distributive laws, {{and the rule}} against division by zero.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} Shang oracle bone script, the graphs had already {{evolved into a}} variety of mostly non-pictographic functions, {{including}} all the major types of Chinese characters now in use. Phonetic loan graphs, semantic-phonetic compounds, and <b>associative</b> compounds were already common. One structural and functional analysis of the oracle bone characters found that they were 23% pictographs, 2% simple indicatives, 32% <b>associative</b> compounds, 11% phonetic loans, 27% phonetic-semantic compounds, and 6% uncertain.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a {{universal}} enveloping algebra {{is the most}} general (unital, <b>associative)</b> algebra that contains all representations of a Lie algebra.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main sorts of {{algebraic}} objects for which {{this can be}} done: groups, <b>associative</b> algebras and Lie algebras.|$|E
25|$|Also {{important}} is that the universal enveloping algebra of a free Lie algebra is isomorphic to the free <b>associative</b> algebra.|$|E
25|$|With an article, {{it means}} an {{instance}} of some abstract structure, like a Lie algebra, an <b>associative</b> algebra, or a vertex operator algebra.|$|E
25|$|Axioms: Addition {{makes the}} ring into an abelian group, {{multiplication}} is <b>associative</b> {{and has an}} identity 1, and multiplication is left and right distributive.|$|E
25|$|Some number {{systems that}} are not {{included}} in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called hypercomplex numbers. They include the quaternions H, introduced by Sir William Rowan Hamilton, in which multiplication is not commutative, the octonions, in which multiplication is not <b>associative</b> in addition to not being commutative, and the sedenions, in which multiplication is not alternative, neither <b>associative</b> nor commutative.|$|E
