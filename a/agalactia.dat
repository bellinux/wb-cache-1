40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate and {{estimate}} the prevalence of Mycoplasma <b>agalactiae</b> from sheep presenting with contagious <b>agalactiae</b> in Kurdistan situated in the West of Iran. A total of 69 samples including Milk (n= 19), Conjunctival swabs (n= 24), Synovial fluid (n= 14), and Ear canal swabs (n= 12) were examined by culture and PCR assay during 2011 - 2012. DNA was extracted from enriched samples. Two primers (Forward and Reverse) amplify a 163 bp region of 16 S rRNA gene of Mycoplasma genus and two primers amplify 375 bp region of 16 S rRNA gene of M. <b>agalactiae</b> species were used. This proved that 46 samples (66. 7 %) were infected with Mycoplasma in PCR test. On the PCR test, 15 isolates (32. 6 %) examined were positive for M. <b>agalactiae</b> that showed specific amplicon at 375 bp.

However, the pathogenesis mechanism of S. <b>agalactiae</b> associate with CVD has not been well studied. Here, we have demonstrated the pathogenicity of S. <b>agalactiae</b> in rat cardiomyocytes (H 9 C 2). Interestingly, both live and dead cells of S. <b>agalactiae</b> were uptaken by H 9 C 2 cells. To further dissect the process of S. <b>agalactiae</b> internalization, we chemically inhibited dis-crete parts of cellular uptake system in H 9 C 2 cells using genistein, chlorpromazine, noco-dazole and cytochalasin B. Chemical inhibition of microtubule and actin formation by nocodazole and cytochalasin B impaired S. <b>agalactiae</b> internalization into H 9 C 2 cells. Consistently, reverse ‒ transcription PCR (RT‒PCR) and quantitative real time‒PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses also detected higher levels of transcripts for cytoskeleton forming genes, Acta 1 and Tubb 5 in S. agalactiae‒infected H 9 C 2 cells, suggesting the requirement of func-tional cytoskeleton in pathogenesis. Host survival assay demonstrated that S. <b>agalactiae</b> internalization induced cytotoxicity in H 9 C 2 cells. S. <b>agalactiae</b> cells grown with benzyl peni-cillin reduced its ability to internalize and induce cytotoxicity in H 9 C 2 cells, which could be attributed with the removal of surface lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from S. <b>agalactiae.</b> Further, the LTA extracted from S. <b>agalactiae</b> also exhibited dose‒dependent cytotoxicity in H 9 C 2 cells.

40|$|Streptococcus <b>agalactiae</b> is a {{major cause}} of {{invasive}} infections in human newborns. To satisfy its growth requirements, S. <b>agalactiae</b> takes up 9 of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids from the environment. Defined S. <b>agalactiae</b> mutants in one or several of four putative peptide permease systems were constructed and tested for peptide uptake, growth in various media, and expression of virulence traits. Oligopeptide uptake by S. <b>agalactiae</b> was shown to be mediated by the ABC transporter OppA 1 -F, which possesses two substrate-binding proteins (OppA 1 and OppA 2) with overlapping substrate specificities. Dipeptides were found to be taken up in parallel by the oligopeptide permease OppA 1 -F, by the dipeptide ABC transporter DppA-E, and by the dipeptide symporter DpsA. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed a polycistronic organization of the genes oppA 1 -F and dppA-E and a monocistronic organization of dpsA in S. <b>agalactiae.</b> The results of quantitative real-time PCR revealed a medium-dependent expression of the operons dppA-E and oppA 1 -F in S. <b>agalactiae.</b> Growth of S. <b>agalactiae</b> in human amniotic fluid was shown to require an intact dpsA gene, indicating an important role of DpsA during the infection of the amniotic cavity by S. <b>agalactiae.</b> Deletion of the oppB gene reduced the adherence of S. <b>agalactiae</b> to epithelial cells by 26 %, impaired its adherence to fibrinogen and fibronectin by 42 and 33 %, respectively, and caused a 35 % reduction in expression of the fbsA gene, which encodes a fibrinogen-binding protein in S. <b>agalactiae.</b> These data indicate that the oligopeptide permease i...|$|R

The GC 3 % against the effective number of codon (ENC) value suggested that translational selection was the important factor for codon bias in the microorganism. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that (i) mutational pressure was {{the most important factor in}} shaping codon usage of all open reading frames (ORFs) in the S. <b>agalactiae</b> genome; (ii) strand specific mutational bias was not capable of influencing the codon usage bias in the leading and lagging strands; and (iii) gene length was not the important factor in synonymous codon usage pattern in this organism.

40|$|Heme is {{essential}} for several cellular key functions but is also toxic. Whereas most bacterial pathogens utilize heme as a metabolic cofactor and iron source, the impact of host heme during bacterial infection remains elusive. The opportunist pathogen Streptococcus <b>agalactiae</b> does not synthesize heme but still uses it to activate a respiration metabolism. Concomitantly, heme toxicity is mainly controlled by the HrtBA efflux transporter. Here we investigate how S. <b>agalactiae</b> manages heme toxicity versus benefits in the living host. Using bioluminescent bacteria and heme-responsive reporters for in vivo imaging, we show that the capacity of S. <b>agalactiae</b> to overcome heme toxicity is required for successful infection, particularly in blood-rich organs. Host heme is simultaneously required, as visualized by a generalized infection defect of a respiration-negative mutant. In S. <b>agalactiae,</b> HrtBA expression responds to an intracellular heme signal via activation of the two-component system HssRS.

Here, we summarize current knowledge about S. <b>agalactiae</b> surface proteins, with emphasis on proteins that have been characterized immunochemically and/or elicit protective immunity in animal models. These surface proteins have been implicated in interactions with human epithelial cells, binding to extracellular matrix components, and/or evasion of host immunity. Of note, several S. <b>agalactiae</b> surface proteins are related to surface proteins identified in other bacterial pathogens, emphasizing the general interest of the S. <b>agalactiae</b> proteins. Because some S. <b>agalactiae</b> surface proteins elicit protective immunity, they hold promise as components in a vaccine based only on proteins or as carriers in polysaccharide conjugate vaccines...|$|R
