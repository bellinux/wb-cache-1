2500|$|March 24, 2004: [...] "I {{would love}} to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> who did it, who brought this {{proposal}} to me, but I don't know. The two – since you press me, the two possibilities that are most likely are either the Department of State or the White House Chief of Staff's Office. But I don't know." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 12th-century heresiographer al-Shahrastani {{describes}} the Majusiya into three sects, the Kayumarthiya, the Zurwaniya and the Zaradushtiya, among which Al-Shahrastani asserts {{that only the}} last of the three were properly followers of Zoroaster. As regards the recognition of a prophet, Zoroaster has said: [...] "They ask you as to how should they recognize a prophet and believe him to be true in what he says; tell them what he knows the others do not, and he shall tell you even what lies hidden in your nature; he shall be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> whatever you ask him and he shall perform such things which others cannot perform." [...] (Namah Shat Vakhshur Zartust, [...]5–7. 50–54) When the companions of Muhammad, on invading Persia, came in contact with the Zoroastrian people and learned these teachings, they at once {{came to the conclusion that}} Zoroaster was really a Divinely inspired prophet. Thus they accorded the same treatment to the Zoroastrian people which they did to other [...] "People of the Book".|$|E

6000|$|... "We came {{as fast as}} we might, O Hes," [...] said Leo; [...] "and if thy spies {{could visit}} those mountains, where no man was, and find a path down that hideous precipice, they must have been <b>able</b> also <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> the reason of our delay. Therefore I pray, ask it not of us." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} she was," [...] says Mrs. Gresham, with that sort of acrimony which one pretty young woman so {{frequently}} expresses with reference to another. [...] "But if one could always tell of a woman, as you say you can of a man, I should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of <b>you.</b> Now, I wonder whether you are a marrying woman? I have never been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{make up my mind}} yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think she}} was very much {{impressed}} by him," [...] Mrs. Clifford said with confidence. [...] "I've watched her to see, and I don't think she's in love with him. But by to-morrow, Reginald, I shall be <b>able,</b> I'm sure, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> for certain." ...|$|R

Well, {{the world is}} full of queer surprises, but this is the queerest I ever ran up against. Believe me, Mr. Ware, if this man Romilly who {{disappeared}} had been a millionaire, you could have walked into his family circle and been made welcome at the present moment. Why, I don't believe his own wife or sister, if he had such appendages, would have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>you</b> weren't the man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It means," [...] said Clarence {{with a white}} face, but {{a steady}} voice, [...] "that I care for her now as much as I ever cared for her, no matter to what folly it once might have led me.

5000|$|... "It's very {{interesting}} to see how kids from different countries have different skills and different approaches. But that still doesn't make me think they're really that different. I think if you went into any kid's room in any country in the world, <b>you</b> wouldn't be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what country <b>you</b> were in. They're all wearing Reeboks and Levi's. I think kids are essentially the same the world over and that's why this concept is so powerful." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "After all, I {{suppose we}} imagine more evil than really exists, and {{sometimes}} accuse our neighbors wrongfully. But the mother birds know how often their nests have been robbed in their absence, {{and if they}} suspect some neighbor of the crime instead of a prowling animal it is but natural, since many birds cannot be trusted. There are laws in the forest, of course; but the guilty ones are often <b>able</b> <b>to</b> escape. I'll <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of a little tragedy that happened only last week, which will prove how apt {{we are to be}} mistaken." ...|$|R
5000|$|Business {{columnist}} James Surowiecki {{has noted}} that [...] "transparent pricing", which usually leads to lower costs, has not had the intended effect not only in executive pay but also in prices of medical procedures performed by hospitals—both situations [...] "where the stakes are very high." [...] He suggests the reasons are psychological—"Do you want the guy doing your neurosurgery, or running your company, to be offering discounts? Better, {{in the event that}} something goes wrong, <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> yourself that <b>you</b> spent all you could. And overspending is always easier when you’re spending someone else’s money." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Annie, {{we cannot}} {{guarantee}} you safe return of John. This would be lying. Nobody can guarantee you this - {{there is too}} much machinery involved. The one thing I can guarantee you is that when the spacecraft leaves it is in the best possible condition for a launch. If anything should happen to the spacecraft, I would like <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> come and <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about the accident and look you straight in the eye and say, 'We did the best we could.' My conscience then is clear and there is where my guideline is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{know how}} much I love you," [...] he said. [...] "I'd give {{anything}} in the world to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> what I've got in my heart." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wish {{to speak}} of him no more than I must. After this, I trust never {{to speak of}} him again. Before the lines of our lives crossed, I knew {{him for what he}} was, I knew the report of him that ran the countryside. Even then I found him detestable. You heard him allude last night to the unfortunate La Binet. You heard him plead, in {{extenuation}} of his fault, his mode of life, his rearing. To that there is no answer, I suppose. He conforms to type. Enough! But to me, he was the embodiment of evil, just as you have always been the embodiment of good; he was the embodiment of sin, just as you are the embodiment of purity. I had enthroned you so high, Aline, so high, and yet no higher than your place. Could I, then, suffer that you should be dragged down by ambition, could I suffer the evil I detested to mate with the good I loved? What could have come of it but your own damnation, as I told you that day at Gavrillac? Because of that my detestation of him became a personal, active thing. I resolved to save you at all costs from a fate so horrible. Had <b>you</b> been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me that <b>you</b> loved him it would have been different. I should have hoped that in a union sanctified by love you would have raised him to your own pure heights. But that out of considerations of worldly advancement you should lovelessly consent to mate with him... Oh, it was vile and hopeless. And so I fought him--a rat fighting a lion--fought him relentlessly until I saw that love had come to take in your heart the place of ambition. Then I desisted." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{how easily}} and comfortably the pilot's memory does its work; how placidly {{effortless}} is its way; how UNCONSCIOUSLY it lays up its vast stores, hour by hour, day by day, and never loses or mislays a single valuable package of them all! Take an instance. Let a leadsman cry, 'Half twain! half twain! half twain! half twain! half twain!' until it become as monotonous as the ticking of a clock; let conversation {{be going on}} all the time, and the pilot be doing {{his share of the}} talking, and no longer consciously listening to the leadsman; {{and in the midst of}} this endless string of half twains let a single 'quarter twain!' be interjected, without emphasis, and then the half twain cry go on again, just as before: two or three weeks later that pilot can describe with precision the boat's position in the river when that quarter twain was uttered, and give you such a lot of head-marks, stern-marks, and side-marks to guide you, that you ought <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take the boat there and put her in that same spot again yourself! The cry of 'quarter twain' did not really take his mind from his talk, but his trained faculties instantly photographed the bearings, noted the change of depth, and laid up the important details for future reference without requiring any assistance from him in the matter. If you were walking and talking with a friend, and another friend at your side kept up a monotonous repetition of the vowel sound A, for a couple of blocks, and then in the midst interjected an R, thus, A, A, A, A, A, R, A, A, A, etc., and gave the R no emphasis, you would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> state, two or three weeks afterward, that the R had been put in, nor be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what objects <b>you</b> were passing at the moment it was done. But you could if your memory had been patiently and laboriously trained to do that sort of thing mechanically.|$|R
