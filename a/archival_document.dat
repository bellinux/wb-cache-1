5|$|Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance}} units plotted Soviet troop concentration, supply dumps and airfields, {{and marked}} them down for destruction. Additional Luftwaffe attacks {{were carried out}} against Soviet command and control centers in order to disrupt the mobilization and organization of Soviet forces. In contrast, Soviet artillery observers based at the border area had been under the strictest instructions not to open fire on German aircraft prior to the invasion. One plausible reason given for the Soviet hesitation to return fire was Stalin's initial belief that the assault was launched without Hitler's authorization. Significant amounts of Soviet territory were lost along with Red Army forces as a result; it took several days before Stalin comprehended {{the magnitude of the}} calamity. The Luftwaffe reportedly destroyed 1,489 aircraft {{on the first day of}} the invasion and over 3,100 during the first three days. Hermann Göring, Minister of Aviation and Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, distrusted the reports and ordered the figure checked. Luftwaffe staffs surveyed the wreckage on Soviet airfields, and their original figure proved conservative, as over 2,000 Soviet aircraft were estimated to have been destroyed on the first day of the invasion. In reality, Soviet losses were likely higher; a Soviet <b>archival</b> <b>document</b> recorded the loss of 3,922 Soviet aircraft in the first three days against an estimated loss of 78 German aircraft. The Luftwaffe reported the loss of only 35 aircraft on the first day of combat. A document from the German Federal Archives puts the Luftwaffe's loss at 63 aircraft for the first day.|$|E

From the very beginning Abraham Favre concentrated on improving the technology of his watches, their properties at different temperatures as well as the materials used in watch making, thus making more reliable and accurate movements.|$|E

However, an <b>archival</b> <b>document</b> rediscovered in 1996 and recounting events from 1621 calls him [...] "Hong Taiji" [...] in a discussion concerning the possible naming of Nurhacis heir apparent, a title that the document refers to as taise. Tatiana Pang and Giovanni Stary, two specialists of early Manchu history, consider this document as [...] "further evidence" [...] that Hong Taiji was his real name, [...] "not being at all connected with the Chinese title huang taizi". Historian Mark Elliott views this as persuasive evidence that Hong Taiji was not a title, but a personal name.|$|E
50|$|Provenance is a {{fundamental}} principle of archival science, referring to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in a collection, and to the items' subsequent chain of custody. According to archival theory and the principle of provenance, records which originate from a common source (or fonds) should be kept together - either physically; or, where that is not practicable, intellectually, {{in the way in}} which they are catalogued and arranged in finding aids - in accordance with what is sometimes termed the principle of archival integrity or respect des fonds. Conversely, records of different provenance should be separated. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an <b>archival</b> <b>document</b> or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain (because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody) will be considered to be severely compromised.|$|E

The basic part volume contains different craftsmen constitutions including different versions about painters, spinners, stonemasons, smiths, goldsmiths, bakers, sadlers, butchers, teamsters, furriers and cobblers constitutions from the 15-16th centuries.In addition to these, there were detected some Town Council regulations from which the most interesting ones are ff.79r-89r provisions from the Reformation time made reorganizations that concern Church life from the years 1524-1525. Important part of what is known about the Town Hall actions, are connected to the reformation, for example - the new church management, demands to return the church property that was robbed during iconoclasm and in this context also the announcement about the occurrence of iconoclasm of itself generally originates from this <b>archival</b> <b>document.</b>|$|E

40|$|In recent years, “the archive” as both {{a concept}} and an object has been {{undergoing}} a transformation.

This situation calls for a reformulation of the very notion of the <b>archival</b> <b>document.</b> This article reframes the <b>archival</b> <b>document</b> not as an object but as a spectatorial experience or a relationship between viewer and text.
