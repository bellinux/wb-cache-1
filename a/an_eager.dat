5|$|A {{significant}} {{transition in}} her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and {{sold as a}} set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> audience.|$|E
5|$|The {{revival of}} {{learning}} during the European Renaissance {{renewed interest in}} plants. The church, feudal aristocracy and an increasingly influential merchant class that supported science and the arts, now jostled {{in a world of}} increasing trade. Sea voyages of exploration returned botanical treasures to the large public, private, and newly established botanic gardens, and introduced <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> population to novel crops, drugs and spices from Asia, the East Indies and the New World.|$|E
5|$|As Sicily now {{becomes a}} more {{politically}} stable, secure and less corrupt environment, the Baroque palazzi are slowly beginning {{to open their}} doors to <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> paying public, American and Northern European as much as Italian. In 1963, when the movie The Leopard was released the Gangi Palace ballroom was almost unique in its status of having been a film set, but today long unused salons and ballrooms are hosting corporate and public events. Some palazzi are offering a bed and breakfast service to paying guests, once again providing impressive hospitality to visitors to Sicily, the purpose {{for which they were}} originally intended.|$|E

[...] resounds aloud; [...] So Maggie runs, the witches follow, [...] Wi' mony an eldritch skreech and hollow.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of {{the winning}} record, by season's end several future Hall of Famers {{departed}} or retired (among those who retired or departed that year were the likes of Willie Davis and Herb Adderley), leaving the team scrambling to rebuild its depleted roster. <b>As</b> <b>eager</b> as Packer fans were to recapture the winning ways of Lombardi, it was obvious Titletown {{would have to wait}} to regain its luster.|$|R
5|$|Charles Atangana (c. 1880 – 1 September 1943), {{also known}} by his birth name, Ntsama, and his German name, Karl, was the {{paramount}} {{chief of the}} Ewondo and Bane ethnic groups {{during much of the}} colonial period in Cameroon. Although from an unremarkable background, Atangana's loyalty and friendship with colonial priests and administrators secured him successively more prominent posts in the colonial government. He proved himself an intelligent and diplomatic administrator and <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> collaborator, and he was eventually named paramount chief of two Beti-Pahuin subgroups, the Ewondo and Bane peoples. His loyalty and acquiescence to the German Empire was unquestioning, and he even accompanied the Germans on their escape from Africa in World War I.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{rose from}} sea to sky the wild farewell-- [...] Then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave, [...] Then some leap'd {{overboard}} with dreadful yell, [...] <b>As</b> <b>eager</b> to anticipate their grave; [...] And the sea yawn'd around her like a hell, [...] And down she suck'd with her the whirling wave, [...] Like one who grapples with his enemy, [...] And strives to strangle him before he die.|$|R

25|$|Compared with later operations, {{the battle}} {{involved}} only small numbers, with the Union fielding 274 infantry, and the Confederates about 750 of infantry, cavalry and artillery. But {{it was widely}} reported by <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> press, and it worried the government, whose 90-day regiments were due to be disbanded. It was the first case of troop movement by train in the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|With {{the demise}} of the textile industry, many of the city's mills were {{occupied}} by smaller companies, some in the garment industry, traditionally based in the New York City area but attracted to New England by the lure of cheap factory space and <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> workforce in need of jobs. The garment industry survived in the city well into the 1990s but has also largely become a victim of globalization and foreign competition.|$|E
25|$|From {{the moment}} he takes the dog, Coco's luck begins to change. People ask him to guard {{buildings}} with the dog; a chance meeting with the bank manager leads him to Walter, a trainer. Walter assures him that the dog is pure gold. After the dog wins third prize at a dog show <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> Walter begins to make arrangements to have him put out to stud, this promises to be lucrative for them both, but the dog is unable to perform.|$|E

25|$|One {{important}} {{forerunner of}} the organized Left Wing Section of 1919 was the magazine The Class Struggle, founded by Ludwig Lore of the New Yorker Volkszeitung. Lore's magazine, which first saw print in May 1917, related current events in Europe and discussed matters of import written by various adherents of the Zimmerwald Left with <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> English-speaking audience. Co-editing the magazine with Lore were Louis C. Fraina, {{a former member}} of the Socialist Labor Party and voluminous writer on themes relating to the European revolutionary movement, and Louis Boudin, a well known Marxist theoretician.|$|E
25|$|Turnbull was <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> sportsman as a youth, {{and played}} rugby for Downside School. He matriculated to Cambridge, and at {{university}} joined {{not only the}} cricket team, but also Cambridge University Rugby Club. One of the earliest rugby clubs he represented was St. Peters in Cardiff. His elder brother, Bernard Turnbull had already represented Wales by this time, and had also played club rugby for St. Peters. During the 1931–32 season, Turnbull played his first senior game for Cardiff, mainly playing at scrum-half, and by 1932 he was representing rugby at county level, playing for Glamorgan.|$|E
25|$|De la Gardie {{is known}} as being <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> {{constructor}} {{and the amount of}} different building projects he was running was huge. In 1674, the Italian diplomat Lorenzo Magalotti estimated that De la Gardie had at least 50 on-going projects in Sweden and its provinces, excluding the 37 churches he was constructing or repairing at the time. One of the churches De la Gardie restored was the abbey church of Varnhem, in which he established a family mausoleum where Magnus Gabriel himself, his wife Maria Eufrosyne, their son Gustav Adolf and daughter-in-law Elisabet Oxenstierna are buried.|$|E

25|$|Augustine {{was from}} the {{beginning}} a brilliant student, with <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> intellectual curiosity, but he never mastered Greek—he tells us that his first Greek teacher was a brutal man who constantly beat his students, and Augustine rebelled and refused to study. By the time {{he realized that he}} needed to know Greek, it was too late; and although he acquired a smattering of the language, he was never eloquent with it. However, his mastery of Latin was another matter. He became an expert both in the eloquent use of the language and in the use of clever arguments to make his points.|$|E
25|$|In 1625, Duke Friedrich Kettler of Courland {{granted the}} town city rights, which were affirmed by King Sigismund III of Poland in 1626, {{although}} under what legal authority Sigismund had is debatable. Under Duke Jacob Kettler (1642–1681), Libau {{became one of}} the main ports of Courland as it reached the height of its prosperity. In 1637 Couronian colonization was started from the ports of Libau and Ventspils (Windau). Kettler was <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> proponent of mercantilist ideas. Metalworking and ship building became much more developed, and trading relations developed not only with nearby countries, but also with Britain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal.|$|E
25|$|During the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1858, Ralston brought {{another group}} of prospectors back {{to the site of}} his first discovery. The placer gold in the area soon played out, but hard rock {{deposits}} of gold were found in the mountains to the west. Some of the miners abandoned their search for gold and returned to farm the rich bottom land along Ralston Creek and Clear Creek. They found <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> market for their crops among other gold seekers. The Territory of Colorado was formed on February 28, 1861, and the farms in the valley expanded to feed the growing population of the region.|$|E
60|$|Beer, {{whiskey and}} cigars were brought. Maraton asked <b>a</b> few <b>eager</b> {{questions}} {{about the condition of}} one of the industries, and followed Henneford to the door, talking rapidly.|$|R

25|$|While Mary {{manages the}} children, other {{problems}} lie with their parents. Winifred {{is aware that}} she is somehow disappointing both her children and her husband ("Being Mrs Banks"). George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult ("Cherry Tree Lane (reprise)"). In an effort to please her husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party. Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts {{it out with a}} lesson ("A Spoonful of Sugar"). However, it is then revealed that none of the invitees are coming.|$|E
25|$|Expansion caused {{controversy}} about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During {{an age of}} tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted {{the rise of the}} new research university, claiming that <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.|$|E
25|$|Sima Yi's {{subordinates}} {{urged him}} to attack on numerous occasions, but Sima Yi was hesitant to do so upon seeing Zhuge Liang's arrangement. Nevertheless, faced with intensive criticism and ridicule from both the enemy and subordinates, Sima Yi eventually relented. In May 231, Sima Yi sent <b>an</b> <b>eager</b> Zhang He to attack the Shu southern camp guarded by Wang Ping, while he personally led a frontal assault against Lucheng from the central avenue. Zhuge Liang ordered Wei Yan, Wu Ban and Gao Xiang to resist the enemy outside Lucheng, where the Wei forces suffered an unexpected and tremendous defeat: 3,000 soldiers were killed, and 5,000 suits of armour and 3,100 sets of hornbeam crossbows were seized by Shu forces. Even though the losses were heavy, Sima Yi still retained a sizable army, which he led back to his camp.|$|E
