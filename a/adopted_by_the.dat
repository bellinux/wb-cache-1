5|$|Jharokha Darshan was a daily {{practice}} {{of addressing the}} public audience (darshan) at the balcony (jharokha) at the forts and palaces of medieval kings in India. It was an essential and direct way of communicating face-to-face with the public, and was a practice which was <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mughal emperors. The balcony appearance {{in the name of}} Jharokha Darshan also spelled jharokha-i darshan was <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 16th-century Mughal Emperor Akbar, even though it was contrary to Islamic injunctions. Earlier, Akbar's father Emperor Humayun had also adopted this Hindu {{practice of}} appearing before his subjects at the jharokha to hear their public grievances.|$|E

5|$|A Han kingdom {{was much}} like a commandery in size and administration, except it was officially, and after 145 BC, nominally, the fief of a {{relative}} to the emperor, including brothers, uncles, nephews, and sons—excluding the heir apparent. The policy of awarding kingdoms only to imperial relatives was gradually <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> founder Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202–195 BC), {{as many of the}} early kings were non-relatives who were leading officers during the Chu-Han contention (206–202 BC). Kingdoms were usually inherited by the king's eldest son born to his queen.|$|E
5|$|A plutoid or ice dwarf is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet, i.e. a body {{orbiting}} beyond Neptune that is massive {{enough to}} be rounded in shape. The term plutoid was <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> International Astronomical Union (IAU) working group Committee on Small Bodies Nomenclature, but {{was rejected by the}} IAU working group Planetary System Nomenclature. The term plutoid is not widely used by astronomers, though ice dwarf is not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in the UN Charter and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E

5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> board.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{for many}} Italians the name of Kesselring, whose {{signature}} appeared on posters and printed orders announcing draconian measures <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> German occupation, had become synonymous with the oppression and terror that had characterised the German occupation.

5|$|By the mid-1st {{millennium}} BC, hieroglyphs and hieratic {{were still}} used for royal, monumental, religious, and funerary writings, while a new, even more cursive script {{was used for}} informal, day-to-day writing: Demotic. The final script <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ancient Egyptians was the Coptic alphabet, a revised version of the Greek alphabet. Coptic became the standard in the 4th century AD when Christianity became the state religion throughout the Roman Empire; hieroglyphs were discarded as idolatrous images of a pagan tradition, unfit for writing the Biblical canon.|$|E

5|$|Dazzle was <b>adopted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Admiralty in the UK, {{and then}} by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. The result was that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
