2500|$|Viewers saw Natalie and Barry’s {{marriage}} sour {{towards the}} end of 2002 when she was momentarily tempted by the charms of his scheming half-brother Nathan (Doug Allen), and then, in the New Year’s Eve episode, she was shown to rekindle a secret “steamy affair” with old flame, Ricky, which continued into 2003. [...] Speed commented “Natalie's always had strong feelings for Ricky. And now she's grown tired of being a mother to baby Jack and Barry!…family is everything to her, so she would have to feel very strongly indeed about someone to put her marriage at risk. As for Ricky, I suppose Natalie's always held a torch for him. He was her first love who finished with her, so she's been left with a kind of 'what if?' feeling.

2500|$|Another type of {{stripped}} down and raw {{music with a}} variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma. It became known as honky tonk and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states, particularly Texas, together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as [...] "a little bit of this, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> a little bit of black {{and a little bit of}} white... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey."

Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll, such as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, as well as Chuck Berry and Ike Turner, while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like George Jones.
