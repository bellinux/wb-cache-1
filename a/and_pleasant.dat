5|$|Flagstaff has {{a rather}} dry semi-continental climate (Köppen Dsb/Csb). Flagstaff has five {{distinct}} seasons: {{a cold and}} snowy winter, with extended dry periods punctuated by deep snows about once every 3–4 weeks; a dry and windy spring with occasional snows; a very dry and hot early summer from May to early July; a wet and humid monsoon season from July to early September; and a dry <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> fall which lasts until the first snows in November.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 2008, track {{inspector}} James Strickland {{was struck}} {{and killed by}} a train as he was walking along a section of track between the Concord <b>and</b> <b>Pleasant</b> Hill stations. Strickland's death started an investigation into BART's safety alert procedures. At {{the time of the}} accident, BART had assigned trains headed in opposite directions to a shared track for routine maintenance. BART came under further fire in February 2009 for allegedly delaying payment of death benefits to Strickland's family.|$|E
5|$|Previous Ramones records {{featured}} celebrity record {{producers in}} an attempt to gain some sort of popularity. Since this method did not yield the results which they were expecting, Sire Records contacted the producers of 1978's Road to Ruin: Ed Stasium and ex-band member Tommy Ramone. Too Tough to Die has less production value than previous recordings by the Ramones. Because critics often disapproved of the sound quality on End of the Century <b>and</b> <b>Pleasant</b> Dreams, the band leaned towards a harsher sound.|$|E

5|$|The first {{railroad}} track laid through Thistle was a narrow-gauge {{spur line}} servicing coal mines near today's Scofield Reservoir, built in 1878 by the Utah <b>and</b> <b>Pleasant</b> Valley Railway. By 1890, the Denver and Rio Grande Western, which acquired {{the line in}} a foreclosure sale in 1882, had rebuilt the line to standard gauge. The D connected this line with one they had built west from Colorado, completing a link from Salt Lake City to Denver.|$|E

5|$|Concerned {{about his}} growing blindness, and not enjoying the social life in London, Bute retired to his estates on the Isle of Bute {{for the next}} six years. While recovering, Bute married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818. Maria was one of the three daughters of the 3rd Earl of Guilford, and a wealthy heiress. £40,000 was settled on her {{at the time of her}} {{marriage}} and she was due to inherit a third of her father's extensive estates. Contemporaries considered Maria a kind <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> woman, but she was often unwell and the marriage proved childless. In 1820 his portrait was painted by Henry Raeburn, and published two years later as an engraving by William Ward. In 1827 his father-in-law died and Maria inherited lands worth over £110,000.|$|E
50|$|When the 40 equal-population map {{was created}} in 1973, the 10th District ran along the beach towns of Monmouth County from Monmouth Beach to Brielle; it also {{included}} the large suburb of Wall Township and two Ocean County boroughs, Point <b>Pleasant</b> <b>and</b> Point <b>Pleasant</b> Beach. In the 1981 redistricting, the 10th was shifted south, only keeping Point <b>Pleasant</b> <b>and</b> Point <b>Pleasant</b> Beach. The 10th included the large suburbs of Lakewood Township, Brick Township, and Dover Township (now Toms River Township). As a result of shifting population towards the suburban Ocean County townships, the 1991 redistricting eliminated Lakewood <b>and</b> Point <b>Pleasant</b> from the 10th District. The 2001 redistricting brought little change to the 10th, only adding South Toms River, Seaside Park, Point <b>Pleasant,</b> <b>and</b> Monmouth County's Manasquan.|$|R

5|$|During {{the evening}} of 19 November, a {{thunderstorm}} followed by a drenching downpour broke over the opposing armies. In a few hours every wadi in the foothills and on the plain was in flood. The black soil plain, hard and firm during summer, became in these winter conditions sticky and heavy for marching and almost impassable for wheeled vehicles. The temperature, which had been hot during the day <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> at night, dropped rapidly to become piercingly cold. The infantrymen had been marching light in their summer uniform of twill shorts and tunics. With only one blanket (and/or a Greatcoat), this gear gave little protection from the driving rain and bitter chill.|$|E
5|$|On February 22, 1972, the {{governors}} of the Passamaquoddy tribes at Indian Township <b>and</b> <b>Pleasant</b> Point {{wrote a letter to}} Louis R. Bruce, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, asking him to initiate such a lawsuit before the July 18th deadline. In early March, Bruce {{sent a letter to the}} Department of the Interior recommending that the tribes' request be granted. No reply was forthcoming before April 1. Tureen met with William Gershuny, the Associate Solicitor for Indian Affairs, who said more time was needed. On mid-May, Tureen persuaded Governor Kenneth Curtis to issue a public statement saying that the Passamaquoddy deserved their date in court. Senators Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) and Edmund S. Muskie (D-ME) and Representatives William Hathaway (D-ME) and Peter Kyros (D-ME) also issued similar statements of support.|$|E
5|$|The delay {{caused by}} these rearguards may have seriously {{compromised}} the British Empire advance {{as there was}} not much time to conclude military engagements in southern Palestine. The winter rains were expected to start {{in the middle of the}} month and the black soil plain which was currently firm, facilitating the movements of large military units would with the rains become a giant boggy quagmire, impassable for wheeled vehicles and very heavy marching for infantry. With the rains the temperatures which were currently hot during the day <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> at night would drop rapidly to become piercingly cold. In 1917 the rains began on 19 November just as the infantry began their advance into the Judean Hills.|$|E

5|$|Avatar—one of {{the main}} {{developers}} of Poinciana—had long planned to connect Kinney Harmon Road with the Cypress Parkway in order to relieve congestion along Poinciana <b>and</b> <b>Pleasant</b> Hill Boulevards. However, the highway would not be built until the company was able to develop the community according to plan. Despite being included in the comprehensive land use plans of both Polk and Osceola Counties, the Polk County Commission voted in 1997 to vacate right-of-way along Kinney Harmon Road to a developer to build a 495-lot mobile home park, {{a move that would}} effectively block construction of the Poinciana Parkway. The commissioners noted that the road had been discussed for years, but there were still no plans to build it at the time. Avatar sued the county and the 10th Judicial Circuit ruled that the commissioners did not explain why vacating the right-of-way would be in the public interest when making their decision. Osceola County had objected the commissioners' decision and helped Avatar in the case, but did not join the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19thcentury, the European American {{newcomers}} had begun to remove vegetation, build sawmills, fell trees, fill wetlands, and farm in the fertile soil along Johnson Creek. The creek is named for one of these newcomers, William Johnson, who in 1846 settled in what later became the Lents neighborhood of Portland and operated a water-powered sawmill. In early 1848 Lot Whitcomb, who would later found Milwaukie, filed a donation land claim and built a sawmill near the confluence of Johnson Creek and the Willamette River. In 1886, plans were made for train tracks along the creek. In 1903, the Springwater Division Line, also known as the Portland Traction Company Line, the Cazadero Line, and the Bellrose Line, was built along Johnson Creek to provide rail transport for passengers and freight. Sellwood, Eastmoreland, Lents, <b>and</b> <b>Pleasant</b> Valley were among the new communities that grew up along the line. By the 1920s, housing began to replace creekside farms.|$|E
5|$|Eidos's German {{branch and}} the KMF agency handled {{marketing}} for Lara Croft. Eidos marketing manager David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted {{to portray the}} character as attractive <b>and</b> <b>pleasant.</b> However, interaction with the press, especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images. Concerned with diluting Croft's personality, Eidos avoided products it felt did not fit the character. Ian Livingstone, Eidos's product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals. He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as exposure for the character. Following Square Enix's acquisition, Eidos's marketing duties were transferred to the Square Enix Europe subsidiary. As part of the second reboot, Crystal Dynamics planned to align all products, promotions, and media ventures with its {{new version of the}} character.|$|E

5|$|Passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 {{formed the}} Interstate Highway System, however only the western segment of now I-84 was {{approved}} at this time, and a designation of I-82S {{was assigned to}} a then unconstructed controlled-access highway across Box Elder County in 1957. The eastern segment of the highway was added later in 1957, and the route was numbered I-80N by 1958. By 1968, portions of the western half of the freeway had been completed, along with the segment between Tremonton and Brigham City. A portion of the freeway was completed around Morgan as well. By 1971, most of the western portions of the freeway had been constructed with two sections remaining that had at-grade intersections. Along the concurrency, there were gaps between Brigham City <b>and</b> <b>Pleasant</b> View, and one small gap near the Devil's Slide.|$|E
5|$|The Ragamuffin menace {{was halted}} when the {{government}} dispatched field marshal (present-day divisional general) Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then Baron, later Duke of Caxias) in 1842. The Baron of Caxias had been the second {{in command of the}} Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion when it put down the mutiny of navy artillerymen in 1831. He and Joaquim Inácio established a close, lifelong friendship. Joaquim Inácio was promoted to frigate captain on 15 March 1844. Soon afterward, Joaquim Inácio was relieved of command, at his own request, after becoming ever more at odds with his superior. On 2 April 1845, he was assigned command of the frigate Constituição and in October returned to Rio Grande do Sul, which by that time had been pacified. He escorted the Emperor during his tour of the Brazilian southern provinces. PedroII was favorably impressed with the character of the ship's captain. Dark-haired and of average height, Joaquim Inácio was joyful <b>and</b> <b>pleasant.</b> He was also hard-working, intelligent and well-learned. In addition to his native Portuguese, he could also speak and write in Latin, English and French.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E

5|$|The {{referendum}} {{that was}} held to adopt the state symbols took place on May 14, 1995. With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new flag was approved by {{a majority in the}} ratio of three to one (75.1% to 24.9%). The other three questions were also passed by the voters. The way of carrying out the referendum as well as the legality of questioning the national symbols on a referendum was heavily criticized by the opposition. Opposition parties claimed that only 48.7% of the entire voting population (75.1% of the 64.7% who showed at the polling stations) supported the adoption of the new flag, but Belarusian law (as in many other countries) states that only a majority of voters is needed to decide on a referendum issue. Upon the results going in favor of President Lukashenko, he proclaimed that the return of the Soviet-style flag brought a sense of youth <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> memories to the nation.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma pardinum is one {{of several}} {{poisonous}} members of the genus Tricholoma; its large size, fleshy appearance, <b>and</b> <b>pleasant</b> smell and taste add to the risk of it being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for over 20 percent of cases of mushroom poisoning in Switzerland {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains. Eating it causes highly unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea. These arise 15minutes to 2hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; complete recovery usually takes 4 to 6 days. Sweating and anxiety may be evident, and disturbance in liver function has been recorded. Cramping may occur in the calves. In one case, seven people and a cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown, appears to cause a sudden inflammation of the mucous membranes lining the stomach and intestines.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, PA 997 was {{extended}} south from Waynesboro to MD 60 at the Maryland border, following Potomac Street and Wayne Highway, and {{was extended}} northwest from Fayetteville to US 11 in Green Village, following Mont Alto Road, Main Street and Mount Pleasant Road before picking up its current alignment. PA 997 replaced the PA 996 designation between Scotland and Green Village. In addition, {{the north end}} of PA 333 was cut back to PA 433 near Lurgan, with PA 641 replacing the route between Roxbury and Newburg and PA 696 replacing the route between Newburg and Shippensburg, and an extended PA 944 was designated onto the road between Roxbury and McCrea. In the 1930s, the entire length of both PA 333 and PA 997 were paved along with PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, PA 944 between Roxbury and McCrea, and the unnumbered road between Mont Alto and north of Fayetteville via Black Gap. In 1941, PA 997 switched alignments with PA 316 south of Waynesboro, with PA 997 rerouted to head south along Clayton Avenue, State Hill road, and Anthony Highway to MD 64 at the Maryland border. In the 1940s, PA 333 was rerouted to head southeast from Pleasant Hall to PA 433 in Culbertson along a new paved road, with a section of the former route between Beautiful <b>and</b> <b>Pleasant</b> Hall removed for the Letterkenny Army Depot. In 1964, PA 997 was extended north from Green Village to PA 233 in McCrea, replacing the entire length of PA 333 between Culbertson and Lurgan, the section of PA 433 between Lurgan and Roxbury, and the section of PA 944 between Roxbury and McCrea. In the 1960s, PA 997 was rerouted to bypass Scotland to the northeast, with the former alignment now unnumbered Main Street. In 1977, PA 997 was moved off its alignment on Mont Alto Road, Main Street and Mount Pleasant Road and shifted east onto its current route via Black Gap.|$|E
