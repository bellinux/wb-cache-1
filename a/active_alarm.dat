To tackle this problem, {{in this paper}} we present a novel interactive troubleshooting tool to be used in industrial environment. The application, called MyAID, relies on a hypermedia information system and aims at assisting shopoor workers in a factory to perform preventive and corrective machine maintenance. The main advantages of MyAID are the following. First, it overcomes limitations of conventional printed documentation. Second, it can be easily updated and adapted to other machines or uses, other than troubleshooting, since it enjoys a modular structure. Third, it can be connected directly to the control unit of the machine to read <b>active</b> <b>alarms</b> or verify whether the user is following correctly the troubleshooting procedure. Finally, the plan for usability assessment of the proposed application, which is organized in a preliminary heuristic evaluation according to Nielsen's heuristics and field tests with users, is introduced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Detection {{of other}} {{vehicles}} {{in the vicinity of}} a moving vehicle is of primary importance to help the driver safely negotiate acceleration, deceleration and parking. In these situations the vehicle must acquire its positional knowledge with respect to others and be able to identify a possible collision. This paper introduces an <b>active</b> <b>alarming</b> system for predicting a collision between two or more vehicles using GPS and IEEE 802. 15. 4 MAC/PHY specification compatible system on chip (SOC). We develop a generic estimation mechanism for the safety coordinates of a vehicle based on its orientation, size, current speed, acceleration and its braking potential. Such safety coordinates are communicated among all vehicles in proximity and is used to determine overlaps thus detecting a possible collision. The IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard is designed for low rate wireless personal area networks and we investigate its applicability in a VANET through two series of tests. Firstly, we simulate a scenario of upto 10 vehicles in proximity and test the practically achievable throughput using commercially available SOCs. This gives an estimate of the best average latency the standard can support. We also simulate our system in NS 2 and study the packet loss as a function of periodicity of packet transmission, the number of nodes and the mode of data transmission.

Each year, these blind spot accidents are responsible for numerous fatalities and heavily injured. Existing commercial systems seem {{not to be able}} to cope with this problem completely. Therefore, we propose a vision-based safety system relying solely on the blind spot camera images. Our system is able to detect all vulnerable road users (VRUs) in the blind spot zone, and automatically generates an alarm towards the truck driver. This inherently is a challenging task. Indeed, such active safety system implicitly requires extremely high accuracy demands at very low latency. These two demands are contradictory, and thus very difficult to unite.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 34 - 37). Mobile network operators run Operations Support Systems (OSS) that produce {{vast amounts of}} alarm events. These events can have different significance levels, domains, and also can trigger other ones. Network Operators face the challenge to identify the significance and root causes of these system problems in real-time {{and to keep the}} number of remedial actions at an optimal level, so that customer satisfaction rates can be guaranteed at a reasonable cost. A solution containing alarm correlation, rule mining and root cause analysis is described to help scalable streaming alarm management systems. This solution is applied to Alarm Collector and Analyzer (ALACA), which is operated in the network operation center of a major mobile telecom provider. It is used for alarm event analyses, where the alarms are correlated and processed to find root-causes in a streaming fashion. The developed system includes a dynamic index for matching <b>active</b> <b>alarms,</b> an algorithm for generating candidate alarm rules, a sliding-window based approach to save system resources, and a graph based solution to identify root causes. ALACA helps operators to enhance the design of their alarm management systems by allowing continuous analysis of data and event streams and predict network behavior with respect to potential failures by using the results of root cause analysis. The experimental results that provide insights on performance of real-time alarm data analytics systems are presented. by Selçuk Emre Solmaz. M. S...|$|R
40|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} (Tursiops truncatus) reduce {{catches of}} Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) when {{they interact with}} coastal gillnets off Hatteras, North Carolina. Acoustic alarms, or pingers, are one means of potentially reducing these adverse interactions. We measured the effect of Save Wave alarms on the incidence of dolphin depredation and target fish catches. The study had two goals: (1) to quantify the effect of alarms on target species catch and (2) to quantify the effect of alarms on dolphin depredation. Fieldwork was conducted off Hatteras during June and August 2004. During this period, we attached alarms to 118 Spanish mackerel gillnet sets (63 active and 55 control). All catches were standardized for effort by incorporating measures of net length and soak duration. We collected data on total catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), Spanish mackerel CPUE, counts of fish discards, and evidence of depredation. There {{was no difference in}} total CPUE (p = 0. 25) or Spanish mackerel CPUE (p = 0. 94) between active and control sets. Net position (inshore, middle, offshore) also had no effect on total CPUE (p = 0. 48) or Spanish mackerel CPUE (p = 0. 35). We observed several dolphins interacting with nets with <b>active</b> <b>alarms,</b> but did not observe a sufficient amount of dolphin depredation to quantify their response to the Save Wave alarms. These results suggest that Save Wave alarms do not affect fish catches.

The OBP structures have been obtained from Diptera (mosquitos and fruitflies), Hymenoptra (honey bee), Lepidoptra (moths), Orthoptera (locust) and Dictyoptera (cockroach), but to date {{there are no such}} structures for aphid OBPs. Indeed there are no reports of an OBP 3 D structure for any Hemipteran, which comprise around 50, 000 - 80, 000 species of aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, shield bugs, and other crop pests despite there being more than 300 hemipteran OBPs reported in NCBI GenBank. Here, we report the first aphid OBP crystal structures and examine their molecular interactions with the biological <b>active</b> <b>alarm</b> pheromone components using biochemical and structural approaches. Our study reveals some unique structural features and ligand binding mechanisms: 1) the ligand binding site is not internal; 2) a striking groove is present in the surface of the proteins as a putative binding site; 3) the N-terminus occupies the site more commonly filled by the C-terminus closing off the conventional OBP pocket. The results from fluorescent binding assays, molecular docking and molecular dynamics demonstrate that OBP 3 from Megoura viciae Buckton can bind to all four alarm pheromone components. We will demostrate that the differential ligand binding between these very similar OBP 3 s from the two aphid species is determined mainly by the direct π-π interactions between ligands and the aromatic residues of OBP 3 s in the binding pocket...|$|E
40|$|Small {{cetacean}} bycatch in gillnet fisheries may {{be reduced}} by deterring odontocetes from nets acoustically. However, different odontocete species may respond differently to acoustic signals from alarms. Therefore, in this study a striped dolphin and a harbour porpoise were subjected simultaneously to sounds produced by the XP- 10 experimental acoustic alarm. The alarm produced 0. 3 s tonal signals randomly selected from a set of 16 with fundamental frequencies between 9 and 15 kHz, with a constant pulse interval of 4. 0 s (duty cycle 8 %) and a Source Level range of 133 - 163 dB re 1 μPa (rms). The effect of the alarm was judged by comparing the animals' respiration rate and position relative to the alarm during test periods with those during baseline periods. As in a previous study on two porpoises with the same alarm, the porpoise {{in the present study}} reacted strongly to the alarm by swimming away from it and increasing his respiration rate. The striped dolphin, however, showed no reaction to the <b>active</b> <b>alarm.</b> Based on harbour porpoise audiograms and the specific audiogram of the striped dolphin in the present study, and the low background noise levels during the experiment, both animals must have heard the alarm signals clearly. This study indicates that cetacean species are not equally sensitive to human-made noise disturbance. Therefore, source levels of acoustic alarms should be adapted to the species they are supposed to deter. In addition, alarms should be tested on each odontocete species for which they are intended to reduce bycatch. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A Fire Protection 2 ̆ 6 Life Safety Analysis was {{conducted}} {{in order to fulfill}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Fire Protection Engineering. The Fire Protection 2 ̆ 6 Life Safety Analysis consisted of a prescriptive and performance-based analysis of the Eric Rood Administration Center (Rood Center). The prescriptive based analysis {{was conducted}} to determine if the Rood Center adhered to the applicable codes and standards. It utilized the 2013 California Building and Fire Codes and the 2012 Life Safety Code (NFPA 101). Other NFPA codes that were referenced included the 2013 edition of NFPA 13, Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems, the 2013 edition of NFPA 72, National Fire Alarm Signaling Code, and the 2015 edition of NFPA 2001, Standard on Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing systems. The prescriptive based analysis examined four portions of the building’s fire protection system: Egress Analysis 2 ̆ 6 Design, Fire Detection 2 ̆ 6 Alarm Notification, Water-based Fire Suppression, and Structural Fire Protection Deficiencies were found in the building’s fire detection and notification systems, as well as the inspection, testing, and maintenance of said systems. The building’s primary fire alarm system has photoelectric smoke detectors installed in only portions of the building. The bulk of the detectors are installed in the exit corridors with typically only one detector per department. While the number of smoke detectors in most departments is lacking, some departments don’t have any at all. The first floor has only 23 smoke detectors, while the second floor has only 16. Based on coverage-area-per-detector calculations alone, the first floor should have a minimum of 56 detectors and the second floor should have a minimum of 58. One of the departments in the building that does have smoke detectors, has only local detectors (they are not connected to the building’s fire alarm control panel (FACP)). Two of the fire scenarios in the performance based analysis indicated the fires were detected within 10 seconds of ignition. In the other two fire scenarios, the fires were not detected until 73 seconds and 107 seconds into the simulations respectively. Examining the building’s notification systems revealed several issues as well. Three of the notification devices types currently in use in the building are listed in the FACP’s manual as not compatible. Similar to the detection system, there are not enough notification appliances (audio or visual) throughout the building to ensure proper coverage. Inspections and tests are not done to confirm proper audible and/or visual levels in the building during an <b>active</b> <b>alarm.</b> The performance based analysis examined how the building’s fire protection system would react to a fire, and whether occupants would have enough time to escape to safety. A computational fluid dynamics modeling program, Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), was used to estimate the available safe egress times (ASET) for four different fire scenarios throughout the building. Those values were then compared with the required safe egress times (RSET) calculated in the prescriptive based analysis for each fire scenario. The original RSET values were calculated for the departments affected by the fire scenarios. The fire models were analyzed and the ASET values were determined when conditions either first became untenable, or when all the occupants had exited the building; whichever came first. The conditions in the building became untenable before people could evacuate the building in all four fire scenarios (RSET 3 ̆e ASET). In some situations, conditions became untenable seconds after the fire alarm was activated, and several minutes before evacuations were complete. The performance based analysis determine that the arrangement of the dead end hallway off the second floor lobby was especially problematic as it could cause the occupants to be trapped {{in the event of a}} fire. Two fire scenarios were examined, one with the fire in the dead end hallway, and another with the fire in the main lobby. In both cases, the conditions in the building became untenable long before the occupants would have been able to escape the hallway, let alone the building...|$|E

Spatial alarms extend the very same idea to {{location}} based triggers, which are fired whenever a mobile user enters the spatial region of the location alarms. Spatial alarms provide critical capabilities for many mobile location based applications ranging from personal assistants, inventory tracking to industrial safety warning systems. In this paper we present a middleware architecture for energy efficient processing of spatial alarms on mobile clients, while maintaining low computation and storage costs. Our approach to spatial alarms provides two systematic methods for minimizing energy consumption on mobile clients. First, we introduce the concept of safe distance {{to reduce the number}} of unnecessary mobile client wakeups for spatial alarm evaluation, enabling mobile clients to sleep for longer intervals of time in the presence of <b>active</b> spatial <b>alarms.</b> We show that our safe distance techniques can significantly minimize the energy consumption on mobile clients compared to periodic wakeups while preserving the accuracy and timeliness of spatial alarms. Second, we develop a suite of techniques for minimizing the number of location triggers to be checked for spatial alarm evaluation upon each wakeup. This further reduces the computation cost and energy expenditure on mobile clients. We evaluate the scalability and energyefficiency of our approach using a road network simulator.

40|$|Many passerines adjust song {{attributes}} to avoid potential masking by anthropogenic noise. The costs of masking should be particularly high for vocalizations important for survival (e. g. alarm calls), but {{few studies have}} investigated how such calls are affected. We compared urban and rural silvereye, Zosterops lateralis, alarm calls across southeastern Australia, and found that urban calls had lower average, peak and maximum frequencies than rural calls. The average, peak and maximum frequency of alarm calls also decreased linearly with increasing background noise. The direction of this frequency shift runs contrary to expectations and previous findings of higher-pitched avian vocal signals in urban habitats, including higher-pitched song and contact calls in urban silvereyes. However, assuming no change in call amplitude, acoustic modelling indicates that the observed frequency shift {{would lead to a}} 20 % increase in the predicted <b>active</b> space of <b>alarm</b> calls (i. e. the distance over which the calls can be detected by a conspecific bird) in urban noise, and therefore may be potentially adaptive.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to compare the Attention to Memory (AtoM) and the Episodic Buffer (EB) Models. The AtoM model proposes that the ventral parietal cortex (VPC) and dorsal parietal cortex (DPC) are {{responsive}} to bottom-up and top- down attention to memory, respectively, (Cabeza, 2008; Cabeza et al., 2008; Ciaramelli et al., 2008). The EB model, on the other hand, proposes that the VPC {{is involved in the}} episodic buffer component of Baddeley 2 ̆ 7 s working memory model (Vilberg 2 ̆ 6 Rugg, 2008). Using objective (source) and subjective (Remember/Know) retrieval tasks, specific patterns of PPC activity were posited based on the propositions of the AtoM model. These expectations included greater VPC activity for Remember and False Alarms compared to Correct Rejections and Subjective Know, greater DPC activity for Know and Objective Remember compared to Subjective Remember and correct rejections, and no difference in VPC activity for remembering both font and color compared to remembering only one contextual detail. During encoding participants saw words in one of two colors, red or yellow, and in one of two fonts, curvy or straight, and were required to indicate the color the word was presented in. Following each encoding scan participants performed either an Objective or Subjective retrieval task. During Objective retrieval task, participants performed a forced-choice source memory test choosing the word with the correct fontand color or the 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 option. During Subjective retrieval participants were presented with the word in a neutral font and white color and performed a Remember/Know test. On the Subjective retrieval task both VPC and DPC were active for recollection compared to familiar items and Correct Rejections. On the Objective retrieval task the DPC was active for all correct old responses. Neither the VPC nor the DPC were significantly <b>active</b> for False <b>Alarms</b> on both the Subjective and Objective tasks. Both VPC and DPC were more active for Subjective Remember compared to Objective Remember response. Neither PPC region was more active for remembering font and color compared to remembering only font or color. Memory load effects for retrieval of information from long-term memory were only seen in the hippocampus on the Subjective retrieval task. These patterns of activity support the role of the VPC in recollection, as seen on the Subjective task, {{and the role of the}} DPC in familiarity, as shown in both the Subjective and Objective tasks. The role of the VPC and DPC during recollection and familiarity processing supports both the AtoM and the EB model. The key predictor of the Episodic Buffer model, memory load effects, was not supported and provides the only evidence against one of the two proposed models. Future work should examine the role of the posterior parietal cortex in spontaneous episodic retrieval to assess the validity of the AtoM model.
