Dogs must be examined by an <b>approved</b> <b>veterinarian</b> who checks for the presence of heritable eye diseases. Testing is less inexpensive (about 20-40 USD) than OFA examinations but, like OFA testing, must be done annually to remain valid.|$|E

All procedures {{were in accordance with}} NIH guidelines and were approved by the National Institute of Mental Health Animal Care and Use Committee. The monkey received an operation to place a titanium head restraint post by using standard sterile techniques. The operation was preceded by sedation with ketamine hydrochloride (10 – 20 mg/kg; intramuscular, i. m.), atropine injection (0. 04 mg/kg, i. m.) to reduce oral secretions, and intravenous (i. v.) injection of antibiotics (30 mg/kg cefazolin). After hair removal and cleaning, a saline i. v. drip was established. Then, a surgical level of anesthesia was maintained with a gas inhalant (isoflurane, 1 – 4 %). Heart rate (EKG), pCO 2, SPO 2 and body temperature were constantly monitored to judge the animal’s anesthetic state. After the animal’s head was fixed in a standard stereotaxic frame, the skin was incised. The skin, fascia and muscles were retracted to expose the skull. The titanium head restraint post (pre-sterilized) was attached to the skull by using 14 stainless steel screws. Then the fascia and skin were re-approximated around the restraint post. Antibiotic therapy was continued for 5 days after the operation. After this operation, the animal was given one week for recovery. Then, with the physical condition <b>approved</b> by a <b>veterinarian,</b> the animal was trained to stay in a primate restraining chair wit...|$|R
