It is interesting that some of the Nishika [...] "dealers" [...] claimed that the Nimslo had only 3 lenses. The confusion on the part of Michael Starks may stem from the introduction about a year later of the 3 lens Trilogy, which sported a built in electronic flash and motorized film advance, and was originally marketed through a system very similar to the multilevel scheme used by Nishika. The same camera was later renamed to Image Tech 3D 1000 and marketed through more traditional channels. Several other three-lens cameras were released, such as the 3D wizard, 3D magic, 3DFX, and Kalimar, some of which sported more modern features such as built-in electronic flash and motorized film advance, but lacked the auto-exposure features of the Nimslo. The 3D trio featured 3 element coated glass lenses, built in flash, motorized film advance, automatic exposure control, compatibility with DX coded ASA 100, 200 and 400 film, and a built in protective lens cover, making it the closest three-lens equivalent to the Nimslo. These 3 lens cameras gave more pictures per roll of film, 16 [...] for 24 exposure roll rather than the 12 yielded by Nimslo/Nishika and had less ghosting, but also less depth. There were other 4 lens Nimslo clones as well, such as the 3DNext and the Rittai. Like the Nishika, several of these were marketed through multilevel schemes, often in Asian countries, occasionally being the basis of a scam. In 2005 the Canadian firm Snap 3D began selling several 2 lens and 5 lens lenticular cameras made by US technology Ltd in Hong Kong. The 5 lens cameras were particularly odd producing five images that were 29.94 mm high and from 24.75 to 26.33 mm wide, all five images having a different width. These were deluxe cameras, featuring glass lenses, <b>adjustable</b> <b>focus</b> with rangefinder, adjustable shutter speeds 1/125, 1/60, 1/30 sec. and [...] "B", continuously adjustable aperture from f/5.6 to f22 and a spirit level. They also had automatic film loading and motorized film advance. Indeed, these cameras were so far removed from the Nimslo, that it might be stretching things to call them Nimslo clones. Snap 3D no longer sells these cameras and as of May 2012 no longer does lenticular printing due to failure of their machine.|$|E
40|$|Presbyopia is an age-related loss of {{accommodation}} {{of the human}} eye that manifests itself as inability to shift focus from distant to near objects. Assuming no refractive error, presbyopes have clear vision of distant objects; they require reading glasses for viewing near objects. Area-divided bifocal lenses are {{one example of a}} treatment for this problem. However, the field of view is limited in such eyeglasses, requiring the user to gaze down to accomplish near-vision tasks and in some cases causing dizziness and discomfort. Here, we report on previously undescribed switchable, flat, liquid-crystal diffractive lenses that can adaptively change their focusing power. The operation of these spectacle lenses is based on electrical control of the refractive index of a 5 -μm-thick layer of nematic liquid crystal using a circular array of photolithographically defined transparent electrodes. It operates with high transmission, low voltage (90 %, small aberrations, and a power-failure-safe configuration.

40|$|When {{we watch}} a moving object, our lens {{accommodate}} on the focused images, our eyes converge to maintain stereo vision, and our pupil controls {{the amount of}} light into our eyes. This is called the triple response of eyes. Although virtual reality (VR) binocular displays can present moving stereoscopic images to a viewer, the triple response cannot be performed in a normal fashion because the lens focuses of these displays are fixed. Biological reviews have hypothesized that this may cause eye fatigue in users of VR displays. However, this remains a hypothesis {{as there is no}} empirical data to verify it. In this study, a wearable binocular display with dynamically <b>adjustable</b> lens <b>focus</b> has been developed. Two experiments have been conducted to verify the effects of appropriately adjusted lens focus on task performance and eye fatigue. Results of the first (preliminary) experiment show that the time required to form a single stereoscopic image is significantly shorter when the lens focus is adjusted to match with the depth cue of the presented stereoscopic images (p< 0. 05, paired t-test). In the second (main) experiment, when lens focus is set at 200 cm, results show that eye tiredness rating is significantly reduced when stereoscopic images are presented with depth cues appropriate to 200 cm rather than 40 cm (p< 0. 01, ANOVA) even though the apparent size of the images presented at a depth of 40 cm are larger. This is an important finding because most commercially available VR binocular displays have fixed lens focus of 200 cm. This finding can help to explain the commonly reported eye fatigue problems among users of VR displays.

40|$|Human eyes see {{the same}} object from {{slightly}} different viewpoints. Unless the object is placed at infinity, our eyes have to verge towards each other in order to fixate on the same object. Such vergence eye movements are also coupled to appropriate accommodation changes of our eyes in order {{to focus on the}} object. Unfortunately, this coupling is disturbed when viewing current binocular displays. On binocular displays, images with correct stereoscopic depth cues can be presented to induce appropriate vergence eye movements. However, the lens focus of such displays is typically fixed regardless of changing depth cues. This posts an un-natural demand on the viewer’s eyes since the viewing condition demands vergence movement in the absence of appropriate accommodation changes. This thesis studies, for the first time, the effects of matching lens focus with stereoscopic depth cues on the time taken to form a single stereoscopic image when viewing a binocular micro-display. A micro-display system with dynamically <b>adjustable</b> lens <b>focus</b> was designed and prototyped for this study. The design and prototyping work forms part of the contribution of the thesis. An experiment was then conducted to study the time taken to merge a pair of left and right binocular images into a single stereoscopic image under four viewing conditions that exhaust the combinations of two lens focus (40 cm and 200 cm) and two object depths (40 cm and 200 cm). Results indicate that viewers took significantly shorter time to form a single overlaid stereoscopic image when the lens focus matched with the object depth (p< 0. 05, paired t test). Further examinations of the data suggest that unnatural demand for the eyes to diverge (e. g., lens focus was smaller than the object depth) are associated with significantly longer periods of double images. Among the ten viewers, seven consistently and significantly benefited from the effect of matching lens focus with stereoscopic depth cues but three viewers did not. The relationships between individuals’ performance in the study and their visual parameters have been studied. Significant correlations are found between the time taken to form a single stereoscopic image and the negative fusional reserve of the participants.

The AFOCL {{is an active}} optical component composed of solid state lead lanthanum-modified zirconate titanate (PLZT) ferroelectric ceramic with patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent surface electrodes that modulate the refractive index of the PLZT to function as an electro-optic lens. The AFOCL was developed to perform optical re-alignment and wavefront correction to enhance the performance of Ultra-Lightweight Structures and Space Observatories (ULSSO). The AFOCL has potential application as an active optical component within a larger optical system. As such, information from a wavefront sensor would be processed to provide input to the AFOCL to drive the sensed wavefront to the desired shape and location. While offering variable and rapid focussing capability (controlled wavefront manipulation) similar to liquid crystal based spatial light modulators (SLM), the AFOCL offers some potential advantages because it is a solid-state, stationary, low-mass, rugged, and thin optical element that can produce wavefront quality comparable to the solid refractive lens it replaces. The AFOCL acts as a positive or negative lens by producing a parabolic phase-shift in the PLZT material through the application of a controlled voltage potential across the ITO electrodes.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the electron-phonon interaction in an n-doped weakly coupled semiconductor superlattice (SL). Two experiments were performed which studied different aspects of this interaction. Firstly, a coherent phonon optics chip was designed. This was used in an experiment where a phonon beam was passed through the SL while an electrical bias was applied to it. The experiment provided a sensitive measurement of the effects caused by bias in the SL on the phonon beam. Secondly, a train of strain pulses was passed through the SL and the charge transferred in the device due to the strain was investigated. A coherent phonon optics chip was formed using a semiconductor superlattice as a transducer structure and a p-i-n photodiode as a coherent phonon detector {{on the opposite side of}} the substrate. The doped weakly coupled superlattice structure, which is the main subject of investigation in this thesis was grown between the transducer and detector structures. Optical access mesas were processed on both sides of the substrate to allow the application of bias to both the doped superlattice and the p-i-n structures. A photocurrent pump-probe experiment was then performed using a femtosecond laser to excite the transducer structure and activate the detection mechanism. The application of bias to the weakly coupled SL was found to cause a small attenuation to the 378 GHz phonon beam passing through it. An investigation of the possible causes of this attenuation ruled out several trivial explanations, suggesting that it was caused by the interaction between electrons and phonons in the structure. The active control of phonon amplitude by electrical means has not previously been demonstrated and may offer exciting new prospectives for phonon devices and experiments. The coherent phonon optics technique was shown to be very sensitive and it will be a useful technique to increase our understanding of future acousto-electric devices. The electrical signal that acoustic excitation caused in the SL device was investigated using a pulse shaping technique in combination with an amplified femtosecond laser. A Fabry-Perot cavity was used in the laser path to create a train of equally spaced laser pulses with an <b>adjustable</b> pulse spacing. <b>Focusing</b> these pulses on an aluminium film transducer creates a train of equally spaced acoustic pulses simulating a monochromatic acoustic wave packet. The SL was processed and electrically contacted so that the charge transferred through it due to the acoustic pulse train could be monitored using a 12. 5 GHz-bandwidth digital oscilloscope. The variation in charge transfer seen as a function of the DC bias applied to the device and as a function of the total energy of the acoustic pulse train was investigated. The behavior was compared to a theoretical model developed in the style of previous theories of electrical conversion in SLs excited by electromagnetic waves. The dependencies of the charge transfer on the bias and energy of the pulse train were well reproduced in the theory. The theory predicted that magnitude of the signal in the superlattice was independent of the frequency of the acoustic pulse train. This was verified by measuring the frequency dependence of the signal seen for a variety of transducer films. The frequency dependencies seen were well explained through simulations presuming the device response was independent of train frequency. This confirms the predictions of the theory. Both the experiments detailed in this thesis have helped increase our understanding of the nature of electron-phonon interactions in superlattices. It is hoped that a fuller understanding of these interactions may be instrumental in the creation of exciting new acousto-electrical devices...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the activities and}} accomplishments along with {{the status of the}} characterization of a PLZT-based <b>Adjustable</b> <b>Focus</b> Optical Correction Lens (AFOCL) test device. The activities described in this report were undertaken by members of the Center for Applied Optics (CAO) at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) under NASA Contract NAS 8 - 00188. The effort was led by Dr. Bruce Peters as the Principal Investigator and supported by Dr. Patrick Reardon, Ms. Deborah Bailey, and graduate student Mr. Jeremy Wong. The activities outlined for {{the first year of the}} contract were to identify vendors and procure a test device along with performing the initial optical characterization of the test device. This activity has been successfully executed and test results are available and preliminary information was published at the SPIE Photonics West Conference in San Jose, January 2001. The paper, "Preliminary investigation of an active PLZT lens," was well received and generated response with several questions from the audience. A PLZT test device has been commercially procured from an outside vendor: The University of California in San Diego (UCSD) in partnership with New Interconnect Packaging Technologies (NIPT) Inc. The device has been subjected to several tests to characterize the optical performance of the device at wavelengths of interest. The goal was to evaluate the AFOCL similar to a conventional lens and measure any optical aberrations present due to the PLZT material as a deviation in the size of the diffraction limited spot (blur), the presence of diffracted energy into higher orders surrounding the focused spot (a variation in Strehl), and/or a variation or spread in the location of the focused energy away from the optical axis (a bias towards optical wedge, spherical, comma, or other higher order aberrations). While data has been collected indicative of the imaging quality of the AFOCL test device, it was not possible to fully characterize the optical performance of the AFOCL alone because there were significant optical distortions due to fabrication related issues...|$|E
