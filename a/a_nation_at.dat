After declaring independence from Russia in 1918, Estonia first competed as <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>at</b> the 1920 Summer Olympics, although the National Olympic Committee was established in 1923. Estonian athletes took part of the Olympic Games until the country was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. The 1980 Summer Olympics Sailing regatta was held in the capital city Tallinn. After regaining independence in 1991, Estonia has participated in all Olympics. Estonia has won most of its medals in athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and cross-country skiing. Estonia has had very good success at the Olympic games given the country's small population. Estonia's best results were being ranked 13th in the medal table at the 1936 Summer Olympics, and 12th at the 2006 Winter Olympics.|$|E

500|$|Edwards {{authored}} {{two of the}} volumes. Crises & Commitments (1992)—written with Gregory Pemberton—analysed {{the political}} and diplomatic history of Australia's involvement in the three conflicts up to 1965, while <b>A</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>at</b> War (1997) covered the political, diplomatic and social history of Australia's Vietnam War from 1965 to 1975. Crises & Commitments received a somewhat contentious reception. John Murphy criticised the volume for {{what he saw as}} an overemphasis on the diplomatic and for skirting the social controversies of the Vietnam era. Murphy also questioned the need for an official history. Pemberton, a senior researcher on the history who drafted several of the earlier chapters before leaving the project acrimoniously in 1990, took issue with the book as well, arguing that his input [...] "had been censored and sanitised in the final product". Edwards acknowledged substantial rewrites to Pemberton's drafts in the foreword to Crises & Commitments, but the extent of and reasoning for the changes were not made clear. <b>A</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>at</b> War experienced a warmer reception, winning the Foundation of Australian Literary Studies Award and H. T. Priestley Medal. In spite of Murphy's doubts, the official history series was also [...] "praised [...] its detached and scholarly analysis of complex events", according to the Oxford Companion to Australian Military History.|$|E
500|$|Hashimoto spoke {{first with}} judge {{advocate}} Captain Thomas J. Ryan {{for four hours}} on 11 December. He spoke {{the next day with}} Captain John P. Cady, McVay's chief defense counsel, for several hours, as both officers sought to determine his credibility and competence to take the stand in the trial. He told them the visibility was good {{on the night of the}} attack and he had been able to easily spot the Indianapolis. Hashimoto testified in the court on 13 December in a crowded courtroom. It was the first time that an officer of <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>at</b> war with the United States had testified against an officer of the U.S. Navy in a court martial. At the behest of Cady, Hashimoto took both a Japanese civil oath and an U.S. Navy oath so he could be charged for perjury in both nations if he lied. Hashimoto's 50 minutes of testimony focused on whether or not Indianapolis was [...] "zigzagging" [...] and he noted the ship did not deviate from its course. However, he also noted that, due to his position, such evasive maneuvers would not have diminished his ability to attack the ship. Still, his testimony is considered integral in McVay's eventual conviction that he had been negligent. Charles Butler McVay III was exonerated in 2001. Following his appearance at the trial, Hashimoto remained in U.S. custody under guard until early 1946, when he was returned to Japan aboard [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the {{character}} of [...] "Mr. Lovewell" [...] and the album came up while the band was attempting to figure out concepts for the record. According to lead singer Bart Millard [...] "we [...] were {{trying to come up}} with the concept for our next record. For some reason, the words 'love well' got stuck in my head". Millard elaborated that [...] "we're very good, as <b>a</b> <b>nation,</b> <b>at</b> loving well when a massive tragedy takes place... We all of a sudden become very unified, which is a great, great thing. But on a day-to-day basis, we pass up opportunities. We look the other way, or we try to ignore. So the idea of loving well is almost a kind of 'pay it forward' that revolves around the cross". With that general idea, MercyMe was going to name the album Love Well. However, the band decided to make a character that personifies the idea of 'loving well', and came up with the character of 'Mr. Lovewell', partly inspired by The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Because of the character and the more diverse sound the album was going to have, the band felt the original name didn't fit and changed the album name to reflect the character of 'Mr. Lovewell'. Millard has described the character of 'Mr. Lovewell' as [...] "like Buddy the Elf meets Forrest Gump. He sees the good in everyone and knows his neighbors enough to know their needs. Mr. Lovewell may not be the next Billy Graham, but he’s changing the world each day in every little word and deed.” ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the advent}} of the American Civil War, minstrels {{remained}} mostly neutral and satirized both sides. However, as the war reached Northern soil, troupes turned their loyalties to the Union. Sad songs and sketches came to dominate in reflection of the mood of a bereaved nation. Troupes performed skits about dying soldiers and their weeping widows, and about mourning white mothers. [...] "When this cruel war is over" [...] became the hit of the period, selling over a million copies of sheet music. To balance the somber mood, minstrels put on patriotic numbers like [...] "The Star Spangled Banner", accompanied by depictions of scenes from American history that lionized figures like George Washington and Andrew Jackson. Social commentary grew increasingly important to the show. Performers criticized Northern society and those they felt responsible for the breakup of the country, who opposed reunification, or who profited from <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> <b>at</b> war. Emancipation was either opposed through happy plantation material or mildy supported with pieces that depicted slavery in a negative light. Eventually, direct criticism of the South became more biting.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Dixon, Jr., {{author of}} The Birth of a Nations source play and novel The Clansman, {{was a former}} classmate of then-president Woodrow Wilson at Johns Hopkins University. Dixon {{arranged}} a screening of The Birth of <b>a</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>at</b> the White House for Wilson, members of his cabinet, and their families, {{in one of the}} first ever screenings at the White House. Wilson was falsely reported to have said of the film, [...] "It is like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true". Wilson's aide, Joseph Tumulty, denied the claims and said that [...] "the President was entirely unaware {{of the nature of the}} play before it was presented and at no time has expressed his approbation of it." [...] Historians believe the quote attributed to Wilson originated with Dixon, who was relentless in publicizing the film. After controversy over the film had grown, Wilson wrote that he disapproved of the [...] "unfortunate production". Besides having the film screened at the White House, Dixon persuaded all nine justices of the Supreme Count to attend a screening of The Birth of a Nation as well as many members of Congress. With the help of the Navy Secretary, Josephus Daniels, Dixon was able to meet the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Edward Douglass White. Initially Justice White was not interested in seeing the film, but when Dixon told him it was the [...] "true story" [...] of Reconstruction and the Klan's role in [...] "saving the South", White, recalling his youth in Louisiana, jumped to attention and said: [...] "I was a member of the Klan, sir". With White agreeing to see the film, the rest of the Supreme Court followed. Dixon was clearly rattled and upset by criticism by African-Americans that the film version of his books was projecting hatred against them, and wanted the endorsement of many powerful men as possible to offset such criticism.|$|E
