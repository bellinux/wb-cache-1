5|$|In {{the book}} , the author Charles Mann, cites sources that {{speculate}} that the reason <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> {{were brought to the}} British Americas was because of their immunity to malaria. Britain did not have large number of <b>African</b> <b>slaves,</b> there were plenty of unemployed workers who could come as indentured servants. In the area above the Mason–Dixon line, the malaria protozoa did not fare well, the English-speaking indentured servant proved more profitable as he would work toward his freedom and hence worked with less supervision and coercion. As malaria spread, places such as the tidewater of Virginia and South Carolina which had previously been habitable by white people became endemic with malaria. Small white landholders were at a disadvantage to plantation owners, as they risk complete economic ruin when they were sick, while plantation owners relied on more malaria resistant West <b>African</b> <b>slaves.</b> Malaria caused huge losses to British forces in the South during the revolutionary war as well as to Union forces during the Civil War. Malaria also helped weaken the Native American population and make them more susceptible to other diseases.|$|E
5|$|The French, {{like the}} Spanish, {{imported}} slaves from Africa. In 1681 there were 2,000 <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> {{in the future}} Saint Domingue; by 1789 there were almost half a million.|$|E
5|$|<b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> were {{originally}} excluded from United States citizenship. In 1857, the United States Supreme Court held in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slaves, former slaves, {{and their descendants}} were not eligible under the Constitution to be citizens. Additionally, American Indians were not originally recognized as citizens, since Indian tribes {{were considered to be}} outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.|$|E

5|$|Among <b>African</b> <b>slaves,</b> Catholicism was the {{religion}} of the majority. Most slaves came originally from the midwestern and southwestern portions of the African coast. For over four centuries this region had been the subject of Christian mission activities. Some Africans and their descendants, however, held onto elements of polytheistic religious traditions by merging them with Catholicism. This resulted in the creation of syncretic creeds such as Candomblé. Islam was also practiced among a small minority of <b>African</b> <b>slaves,</b> although it was harshly repressed {{and by the end of}} the 19th century had been completely extinguished. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Indians in most of eastern Brazil had been either assimilated or decimated. Some tribes resisted assimilation and either fled farther west, where they were able to maintain their diverse polytheistic beliefs, or were restricted to aldeamentos (reservations), where they eventually converted to Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Lacks {{was buried}} in an unmarked grave in the family {{cemetery}} {{in a place called}} Lackstown in Halifax County, Virginia. Lackstown is the name that was given to the land in Clover, Virginia that was originally owned by white, land- and slave-owning members of the Lacks family before the Civil War. Later generations gave the land to the many black members of the Lacks family who were descendants of <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> and their white owners.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{were the}} {{earliest}} {{inhabitants of the}} land that is today known as the United States and played its first music. Beginning in the 17th century, immigrants from the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Germany, and France began arriving in large numbers, bringing with them new styles and instruments. <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> brought musical traditions, and each subsequent wave of immigrants contributed to a melting pot.|$|E

5|$|The amendment's {{first section}} {{includes}} several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), which had held that Americans descended from <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> {{could not be}} citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted {{in such a way}} that it does very little.|$|E
5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The {{life expectancy of}} slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase {{in the numbers of}} slaves. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice. But {{by the turn of the}} 18th century, <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} parts of Latin America, slavery played a much lesser role in the {{development}} of the Argentine economy, mostly because of the absence of gold mines and sugar plantations, which would have demanded huge numbers of slave workers. Colonial Brazil, for example, imported as many as 2.5 million Africans in the 18th century. By contrast, an estimated 100,000 <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> arrived at the port of Buenos Aires in the 17th and 18th centuries, and many were destined for Paraguay, Chile and Bolivia.|$|E

6000|$|I have {{recently}} seen {{a letter of}} Judge Douglas's in which, without stating {{that to be the}} object, he doubtless endeavors to make a distinction between the two. He says he is unalterably opposed to the repeal of the laws against the <b>African</b> <b>slave</b> trade. And why? He then seeks to give a reason that would not apply to his popular sovereignty in the Territories. What is that reason? [...] "The abolition of the <b>African</b> <b>slave</b> trade is a compromise of the Constitution!" [...] I deny it. There is no truth in the proposition that the abolition of the <b>African</b> <b>slave</b> trade is a compromise of the Constitution. No man can put his finger on anything in the Constitution, or on the line of history, which shows it. It is a mere barren assertion, made simply for the purpose of getting up a distinction between the revival of the <b>African</b> <b>slave</b> trade and his [...] "great principle." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to her passengers and cargo, De Soto also acted as a conduit for news between Cuba and the United States. Most of the news conveyed by De Soto was of a mundane characterfor example, reports of activity on the Havana sugar marketbut sometimes it was of more interest. In October 1860 for instance, De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 <b>African</b> <b>slaves.</b> The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore {{and could not be}} retrieved.|$|E
5|$|One month later, the House of Lords {{passed the}} Slavery Abolition Act, which {{abolished}} slavery {{in most of}} the British Empire from August 1834. They voted plantation owners £20million in compensation, giving full emancipation to children younger than six, and instituting a system of apprenticeship requiring other enslaved peoples to work for their former masters for four to six years in the British West Indies, South Africa, Mauritius, British Honduras and Canada. Nearly 800,000 <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> were freed, the vast majority in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{to explain}} the mythical blue men include {{that they may be}} a {{personification}} of the sea, or originate with the Picts, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled kayaks. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|E

5|$|The Natchez killed {{almost all}} of the 150 Frenchmen at Fort Rosalie, and only about 20 managed to escape. Most of the dead were unarmed. Women, children, and <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> were mostly spared; many were locked inside a house on the bluff, guarded by several warriors, from where they could see the events. According to Dumont de Montigny's account of the attack, women seen {{defending}} their husbands from the violence, or trying to avenge them, were taken captive or killed. One woman's unborn baby was reportedly torn from her before she herself was killed. A year after the event, the tally of dead was put at 138 men, 35 women and 56 children, or approximately 230 overall. Some scholars argue that the Natchez spared the <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> due to a general sense of affinity between the Natchez and the Africans; some slaves even joined the Natchez against their masters, while others took the chance to escape to freedom. A group of Yazoo people who were accompanying Commandant du Codère remained neutral during the conflict but were inspired by the Natchez revolt. When they returned to Fort St. Pierre, they destroyed the fort, killing the Jesuit priest and 17 French soldiers.|$|E
5|$|When <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> {{were freed}} in America, they {{struggled}} {{to reach the}} social status of whites. Many former slaves tried to conform their hairstyles {{as part of this}} struggle. Women, especially, felt pressure to make their hair straight, rather than keeping the tightly coiled style they had known. However, during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, African-Americans such as Malcolm X advocated hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks, in order to embrace their race, and to return to West African roots.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado was {{attracted}} by reports of gold, and also wished {{to prevent the}} complete abandonment of the territory by the Spanish. He invaded Higueras in 1536, with 80 well-armed soldiers of mixed infantry and cavalry, accompanied by about 3000 indigenous Guatemalan auxiliaries; Many of the auxiliaries were Achi Maya warriors with a particularly fearsome reputation. He also brought Indian and <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> to work the mines, as well as livestock to assist the colonisation effort. His route took him past a strong native fortress called the Peñol of Cerquín, where native warriors had amassed to resist the Spanish. Alvarado, seeing {{the strength of the}} fortress and aware of the pressing need to relieve Buena Esperanza, decided not to storm the fortress and pushed onwards to assist his countrymen.|$|E

5|$|Castelli was {{appointed}} a Committee {{member of the}} Primera Junta and was sent to Córdoba to end Santiago de Liniers's counter-revolution. He succeeded, and ordered the execution of Liniers and his supporters. He then commanded {{the establishment of a}} revolutionary government in Upper Peru (today's Bolivia) with the aim of freeing the indigenous peoples and <b>African</b> <b>slaves.</b> In 1811 Castelli signed a truce with the Spanish in Upper Peru, but they betrayed him and caught the Northern Army unprepared. As a result, the Argentines suffered a major loss in the Battle of Huaqui on June 20, 1811. When Castelli returned to Buenos Aires, the First Triumvirate imprisoned him for losing the battle, and Castelli died shortly afterwards from tongue cancer.|$|E
5|$|In mid-spring 946, al-Ikhshid sent emissaries to the Byzantines for {{yet another}} {{prisoner}} exchange (which eventually would take place under Sayf al-Dawla's auspices in October). Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959) sent an embassy under John Mystikos in response, which arrived at Damascus on 11 July. On 24 July 946, al-Ikhshid died in Damascus. The succession of his son Unujur was peaceful and undisputed, due {{to the influence of}} the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the many Black <b>African</b> <b>slaves</b> recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by his death, in 969 the Fatimids invaded and conquered Egypt, beginning a new era in the country's history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Creeks, escaped <b>African</b> <b>slaves,</b> and other Indians from {{northern}} Florida {{displaced by the}} Creek War formed the area's Seminole nation. After {{the end of the}} Seminole Wars in 1842, the Seminoles faced relocation to Indian territory near Oklahoma. A few hundred Seminole hunters and scouts settled within what is today Big Cypress National Preserve, to escape the forced emigration to the west. From 1859 to about 1930, the Seminoles and Miccosukee, a similar but linguistically unique tribe, lived in relative isolation, making their living by trading. In 1928, surveying and construction began on the Tamiami Trail, along the northern border of Everglades National Park. The road not only bisected the Everglades but also introduced a steady, if small, traffic of white settlers into the Everglades.|$|E
