The theoretical part compares different authors of intercultural dimensions and the significance of intercultural communication.

5|$|Her {{essays on}} Pushkin and Poem Without a Hero, her longest work, were only {{published}} after her death. This long poem, composed between 1940 and 1965, is often critically regarded as her best work and {{also one of}} the finest poems of the twentieth century. It gives a deep and detailed analysis of her epoch and her approach to it, including her important encounter with Isaiah Berlin (1909–97) in 1945. Her talent in composition and translation is evidenced in her fine translations of the works of poets writing in French, English, Italian, Armenian, <b>and</b> <b>Korean.</b>|$|E

5|$|Asian Americans are {{a sizable}} {{minority}} group in Texas.

Non-Hispanic Asians number over 795,000. Just over 200,000 Indian Americans make Texas their home. Texas {{is also home to}} over 187,000 Vietnamese and 136,000 Chinese. In addition to 92,000 Filipinos and 62,000 Koreans, there are 18,000 Japanese Americans living in the state. Lastly, over 111,000 people are of other Asian ancestry groups, such as Cambodian, Thai, and Hmong. Sugar Land, a city within the Houston metropolitan area, and Plano, located within the Dallas metropolitan area, both have high concentrations of ethnic Chinese <b>and</b> <b>Korean</b> residents. The Houston and Dallas areas, and to a lesser extent, the Austin metropolitan area, all contain substantial Vietnamese communities.|$|E

His accomplishments were praised in a manner much differently from commanders who returned from the Vietnam <b>and</b> <b>Korean</b> Wars. He became an instant national celebrity {{and the source of}} great curiosity by the general public.

He later found Judy bleeding from the shoulder {{where she had been}} grazed by the bullet. He covered the wound with some palm fronds, but could do nothing else to treat or reward her. After moving camps once more, Judy was sentenced to death by the Japanese as part of a plan to control a lice breakout. She disappeared for three days, with guards conducting sweeps in an attempt to find her. She only reappeared when the Japanese forces abandoned the camp.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{immigration}} {{in the late}} 20th century and early 21st century has fueled new communities of Hispanics and Asians. , 9.0% of Virginians are Hispanic or Latino (of any race), and 6.5% are Asian. The state's Hispanic population rose by 92% from 2000 to 2010, with two-thirds of Hispanics living in Northern Virginia. Hispanic citizens in Virginia have higher median household incomes and educational attainment than the general Virginia population. As far as Hispanic groups, {{there is a large}} Salvadoran population in the DC suburbs of Northern Virginia, and a large Puerto Rican population in the Hampton Roads region of Southeast Virginia. Northern Virginia also has a significant population of Vietnamese Americans, whose major wave of immigration followed the Vietnam War, <b>and</b> <b>Korean</b> Americans, whose migration has been more recent and was induced in part by the quality school system. The Filipino American community has about 45,000 in the Hampton Roads area, many of whom have ties to the U.S. Navy and armed forces.|$|E
