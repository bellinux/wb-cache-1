5|$|Titanium {{tetrachloride}} (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl4) is a colorless volatile liquid (commercial {{samples are}} yellowish) that, in air, hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds. Via the Kroll process, TiCl4 {{is produced in}} the conversion of titanium ores to titanium dioxide, e.g., for use in white paint. It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama <b>aldol</b> <b>condensation.</b> In the van Arkel process, titanium tetraiodide (TiI4) is generated {{in the production of}} high purity titanium metal.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Aldol</b> <b>condensations</b> are {{important}} in organic synthesis, because they provide {{a good way to}} form carbon-carbon bonds. For example, the Robinson annulation reaction sequence features an aldol condensation; the Wieland-Miescher ketone product is an important starting material for many organic syntheses. <b>Aldol</b> <b>condensations</b> are also commonly discussed in university level organic chemistry classes as a good bond-forming reaction that demonstrates important reaction mechanisms.In its usual form, it involves the nucleophilic addition of a ketone enolate to an aldehyde to form a β-hydroxy ketone, or [...] "aldol" [...] (aldehyde + alcohol), a structural unit found in many naturally occurring molecules and pharmaceuticals.|$|R
25|$|In the aldol reaction, {{the metal}} enolates of ketones, esters, amides, and {{carboxylic}} acids {{will add to}} aldehydes to form β-hydroxycarbonyl compounds (aldols). Acid or base-catalyzed dehydration will then lead to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The combination of these two steps {{is known as the}} <b>aldol</b> <b>condensation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Zinc enolates, {{prepared}} from {{alkali metal}} enolates and ZnCl2, provide control of stereochemistry in <b>aldol</b> <b>condensation</b> reactions due to chelation {{on to the}} zinc. In the example shown below, the threo product was favored over the erythro {{by a factor of}} 5:1 when ZnCl2 in DME/ether was used. The chelate is more stable when the bulky phenyl group is pseudo-equatorial rather than pseudo-axial, i.e., threo rather than erythro.|$|E
25|$|The total {{synthesis}} of napelline (Scheme a) begins with aldehyde 100. In a 7 step process, the A-ring of napelline is formed (104). It takes another 10 steps {{to form the}} lactone ring in the pentacyclic structure of napelline (106). An additional 9 steps creates the enone-aldehyde 107. Heating in methanol with potassium hydroxide causes an <b>aldol</b> <b>condensation</b> to close the sixth and final ring in napelline (14). Oxidation then gives rise to diketone 108 which was converted to (±)-napelline (14) in 10 steps.|$|E

25|$|A typical modern aldol {{addition}} reaction, shown above, {{might involve}} the nucleophilic {{addition of a}} ketone enolate to an aldehyde. Once formed, the aldol product can sometimes lose a molecule of water to form an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. This is called <b>aldol</b> <b>condensation.</b> A variety of nucleophiles may be employed in the aldol reaction, including the enols, enolates, and enol ethers of ketones, aldehydes, and many other carbonyl compounds. The electrophilic partner is usually an aldehyde or ketone (many variations, such as the Mannich reaction, exist). When the nucleophile and electrophile are different, the reaction is called a crossed aldol reaction; on the converse, when the nucleophile and electrophile are the same, the reaction is called an aldol dimerization.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{protective}} {{group in}} 26 (acetal, acid hydrolysis) was reconverted to the ketone in 27. The monooxime 28 (at the more hindered ketone group) was synthesised from the dioxime by selective hydrolysis (nitrous acid / acetic acid [...] ). The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the cyclopentene ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an ozonolysis (ozone) forming triketone 29, an <b>aldol</b> <b>condensation</b> of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (pyrrolidine acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A Beckmann rearrangement (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - <b>aldol</b> <b>condensation</b> cascade. This compound resisted [...] ring-opening of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its epimer 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This epimer was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and thiophenol. This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] Ozonolysis gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the thioester into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (sodium borohydride) followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E
2500|$|Given its {{economic}} importance, indigo has been prepared by many methods. The Baeyer-Drewson indigo synthesis {{dates back to}} 1882. It involves an <b>aldol</b> <b>condensation</b> of o-nitrobenzaldehyde with acetone, followed by cyclization and oxidative dimerization to indigo. This route is highly useful for obtaining indigo {{and many of its}} derivatives on the laboratory scale, but was impractical for industrial-scale synthesis. Johannes Pfleger and Karl Heumann (...) eventually came up with industrial mass production synthesis. The first commercially practical route is credited to Pfleger in 1901. In this process, N-phenylglycine is treated with a molten mixture of [...] sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodamide. This highly sensitive melt produces indoxyl, which is subsequently oxidized in air to form indigo. [...] Variations of this method are still in use today. [...] An alternative and also viable route to indigo is credited to Heumann in 1897. [...] It involves heating N-(2-carboxyphenyl)glycine to [...] in an inert atmosphere with sodium hydroxide. The process is easier than the Pfleger method, but the precursors are more expensive. [...] Indoxyl-2-carboxylic acid is generated. [...] This material readily decarboxylates to give indoxyl, which oxidizes in air to form indigo. [...] The preparation of indigo dye is practiced in college laboratory classes according to the original Baeyer-Drewsen route.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is unknown}} whether the same KS/CLF/ACP ternary complex chaperones {{the growth of}} a full length polyketide chain through the entire {{catalytic}} cycle, or whether the ACP dissociates after each condensation reaction. [...] A 2.0-Å [...] resolution structure of the actinorhodin KS/CLF, which is very similar to the dps KS/CLF, shows polyketides being elongated inside an amphipathic tunnel formed at the interface of the KS and CLF subunits. [...] The tunnel is about 17-Å long and one side has many charged amino acid residues which appear to be stabilizing the carbonyl groups of the chain, while the other side is hydrophobic. [...] This structure explains why both subunits are necessary for chain elongation and how the reactive growing chain is protected from random spontaneous reactions until it is positioned properly for orderly cyclization. The structure also suggests a mechanism for chain length regulation. [...] Amino acid side groups extend into the tunnel and act as [...] "gates". [...] A couple of particularly bulky residues may be impassable by the chain, causing termination. [...] Modifications to tunnel residues based on this structure were able to alter the chain length of the final product. [...] The final condensation causes the polyketide chain to [...] "buckle" [...] allowing an intramolecular attack by the C-12 methylene carbanion, generated by enzyme catalyzed proton removal and stabilized by electrostatic interactions in the tunnel, on the C-7 carbonyl (see 3 in Figure 1). This tunnel aided intramolecular <b>aldol</b> <b>condensation</b> provides the first cyclization when the chain is still in the tunnel.

In the quest of sustainable catalytic ways for such <b>aldol</b> <b>condensations,</b> this paper assesses the use of dried chitosan-gels as naturally immobilized, readily available and non-hazardous amino-based organocatalysts. At room temperature chitosan dried gels are not suitable catalysts for the desired reaction.

The set-up of closed reactor set-ups (thermoshakers or microwave reactions) proved highly beneficial for the reaction outcome. Furthermore, chitosan dried gels were successfully re-used {{for a number of}} cycles. An efficient catalyst drying method (either lyophilization or scCO 2 drying) was crucial to achieve virtually full conversions in 4 h.
