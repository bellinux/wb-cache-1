5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> is the largest force resisting forward motion. At faster speed, <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting forward motion.|$|E
5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when the front wheel is turned to {{one side or the}} other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle and the amount of trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
40|$|For Mach 3. 20 cruise {{propulsion}} systems, {{preliminary design}} studies for two supersonic thrQugh-flow fan primary inlets {{and a single}} core inlet were undertaken. Method of characteristics and one-dimensional performance techniques were applied to assess the potential improvements supersonic through-flow fan technology has over more conventional systems. A fixed geometry supersonic through-flow fan primary inlet {{was found to have}} better performance than a conventional inlet design on the basis of total pressure recovery, air flow, <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drags</b> and size and weight.

5|$|The {{majority}} of Uranus's rings are opaque {{and only a}} few kilometers wide. The ring system contains little dust overall; it consists mostly of large bodies 0.2–20m in diameter. However, some rings are optically thin: the broad and faint 1986U2R/ζ, μ and ν rings are made of small dust particles, while the narrow and faint λ ring also contains larger bodies. The relative lack of dust in the ring system may be due to <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> from the extended Uranian exosphere.|$|E
5|$|The net <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> forces may be {{considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to the rear wheel. Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|The pilot lay flat on {{the lower}} wing, as planned, to reduce <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag.</b> As a glide ended, the pilot was {{supposed}} to lower himself to a vertical position through {{an opening in the}} wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} to optimize, in terms of <b>aerodynamic</b> wave <b>drag</b> minimization, arbitrary (nonaxisymmetric) hypersonic vehicles in modified Newtonian flow, while maintaining the initial volume and length of the vehicle. This new method uses either a surface fitted Fourier series to represent the vehicle's geometry or an independent point motion algorithm. In either case, the coefficients of the Fourier series or the spatial locations of the points defining each cross section were varied and a numerical optimization algorithm based on a quasi-Newton gradient search concept {{was used to determine}} the new optimal configuration. Results indicate a significant decrease in <b>aerodynamic</b> wave <b>drag</b> for simple and complex geometries at relatively low CPU costs. In the case of a cone, the results agreed well with known analytical optimum ogive shapes. The procedure is capable of accepting more complex flow field analysis codes...|$|R
40|$|Increasing jet {{aircraft}} fuel costs from 25 percent to nearly 60 {{percent of the}} aircraft direct operating costs {{have led to a}} heavy emphasis on the development of transport aircraft with significantly improved aerodynamic performance. The application of the concept of relaxed static stability (RSS) and the utilization of an active control stability augmentation system make it possible to design an aircraft with reduced <b>aerodynamic</b> trim <b>drag</b> due to a farther-aft cg balance. Reduced <b>aerodynamic</b> parasite <b>drag</b> and lower structural weight due to a smaller horizontal tail surface can also be obtained. The application of RSS has been studied under a NASA-sponsored program to determine ways of improving the energy efficiency in current and future transport aircraft. Attention is given to a near-term pitch active control system, an advanced pitch active control system, and an operational overview...|$|R
5000|$|The Bagheera {{was also}} very <b>aerodynamic,</b> with a <b>drag</b> {{coefficient}} (...) of 0.33 for the early models. This rose slightly to 0.35 after a mid-life redesign.|$|R
5|$|At {{the first}} {{race of the}} season in Melbourne, Webber {{qualified}} in 7th place and held that position for {{the early part of the}} race, managing to finish in 13th position after the RB3 suffered from a throttle-related malfunction and a jammed fuel flap. At the , he again out-qualified his more experienced teammate Coulthard and finished tenth, which was encouraging for the team in such a new and radical car. Bahrain was also going well for both drivers, who were running in sixth and seventh positions, until both cars retired due to mechanical malfunctions. Webber again was hampered by the aforementioned jammed fuel flap, radically affecting the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag,</b> a vital set-up consideration for the Sakhir circuit.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} risks, a massive testing program was started. By mid-1954, the first production drawings were issued and wind tunnel work began, along with extensive computer simulation studies carried out both in Canada and the United States using sophisticated computer programs. In a related program, nine instrumented free-flight models were mounted on solid fuel Nike rocket boosters and launched from Point Petre over Lake Ontario while two additional models were launched from the NACA facility at Wallops Island, Virginia, over the Atlantic Ocean. These models were for <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> and stability testing, flown {{to a maximum}} speed of Mach 1.7+ before intentionally crashing into the water.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, mid- to long-range, {{wide-body}} twin-engine jet airliner {{built by}} Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag,</b> a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft {{such as the}} 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design range of , depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exterior}} of the T1 closely resembles that of a racing prototype or Formula One racing car. It features a carbon fibre <b>aerodynamic</b> low <b>drag</b> body design, composed of individual sections, with an adjustable twin element front wing, single element rear wing, adjustable flaps, and a ground effect diffuser, allowing it to create [...] of downforce at [...] The wings are replaceable with road and track variations.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to measure the <b>aerodynamic</b> properties (<b>drag</b> and lift) contributed by fabric in order to design aerodynamically efficient sports garments for higher speed sports.

Specially developed cylindrical methodology was used to quantify the effects of aerodynamic properties and fabrics&# 039; surface parameter...|$|R
50|$|The final entry was {{a series}} diesel hybrid, a car that would only use the power from the {{electric}} motor for propulsion. The combustion engine, a 1.4L Volkswagen motor, would only be used to generate power and recharge the batteries, which would then give power to the electric motor to drive the car. The vehicle would also feature a very <b>aerodynamic,</b> low <b>drag</b> design.|$|R
5|$|The F-16 was {{designed}} to be relatively inexpensive to build and simpler to maintain than earlier-generation fighters. The airframe is built with about 80% aviation-grade aluminum alloys, 8% steel, 3% composites, and 1.5% titanium. The leading-edge flaps, stabilators, and ventral fins make use of bonded aluminum honeycomb structures and graphite epoxy lamination coatings. The number of lubrication points, fuel line connections, and replaceable modules is significantly lower than predecessors; 80% of access panels can be accessed without stands. The air intake was placed so it was rearward of the nose but forward enough to minimize air flow losses and reduce <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{is among}} {{only a few}} {{aircraft}} that can supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel-inefficient afterburners; it can intercept targets which subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The Raptor's high operating altitude is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters {{due to a lack}} of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> from external stores. The F-22's structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and composites comprise 39% and 24% of the aircraft's structural weight.|$|E
5|$|The front {{landing gear}} is offset to the aircraft's right to allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the T1 closely resembles that of a racing prototype or Formula One racing car. It features a carbon fibre <b>aerodynamic</b> low <b>drag</b> body design, composed of individual sections, with an adjustable twin element front wing, single element rear wing, adjustable flaps, and a ground effect diffuser, allowing it to create 875 kg of downforce at 240 km/h. The wings are replaceable with road and track variations.|$|R
5000|$|According to Acura the {{exterior}} is more <b>aerodynamic</b> reducing <b>drag</b> by 16% {{with the new}} model lapping Nürburgring 8 seconds faster than its predecessor. The headlights are Acura's Jewel Eye LED Headlights (first introduced on the RLX). [...] Each headlamp uses five separate LED sources with three used for low-beam lighting and two for high-beam lighting. LED bumper mounted fog lamps are offered as a dealer installed option.|$|R
5000|$|Research in the G7 {{programme}} {{showed that}} the bulk of the longitudinal <b>aerodynamic</b> resistance (<b>drag)</b> of the pantograph and the largest component of vertical aerodynamic forces (lift) acting on it derive from the contact shoe. [...] For the HEMU-400X, researchers developed an aerodynamically optimised contact shoe cross section that reduced drag by about 40% and lift amplitude by about 25% in comparison to the contact shoe of the KTX-II pantographs.|$|R
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{thickness of}} the ε ring is not precisely known, although the ring is certainly very thin—by some estimates as thin as 150m. Despite such infinitesimal thickness, it consists of several layers of particles. The ε ring is a rather crowded place with a filling factor near the apoapsis estimated by different sources at from 0.008 to 0.06. The mean size of the ring particles is 0.2–20.0m, and the mean separation is around 4.5 times their radius. The ring is almost devoid of dust, possibly due to the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> from Uranus's extended atmospheric corona. Due to its razor-thin nature the ε ring is invisible when viewed edge-on. This happened in 2007 when a ring plane-crossing was observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{switch from}} high-altitude to low-altitude flight {{profiles}} severely affected the B-70, whose design was highly tuned {{to provide the}} desired high-altitude performance. Planners outlined a series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range. The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed than the B-52, but less range. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was cancelled in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.|$|E
5|$|The {{unpressurized}} rotodome is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two struts. It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag,</b> which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The rotodome uses bleed air, outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} power consumed by typical magnetic hard disk drives (HDD) not only increases linearly {{with the number}} of spindles but, more significantly, it increases as very fast power-laws of speed (RPM) and diameter. Since the theoretical basis for this relationship is neither well-known nor readily accessible in the literature, we show how these exponents arise from <b>aerodynamic</b> disk <b>drag</b> and discuss their import for green storage capacity planning.

40|$|Sensor/actuator {{networks}} {{promised to}} extend automated {{monitoring and control}} into industrial processes. Avionic system {{is one of the}} prominent technologies that can highly gain from dense sensor/actuator deployments. An aircraft with smart sensing skin would fulfill the vision of affordability and environmental friendliness properties by reducing the fuel consumption. Achieving these properties is possible by providing an approximate representation of the air flow across the body of the aircraft and suppressing the detected <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drags.</b> To the best of our knowledge, getting an accurate representation of the physical entity {{is one of the most}} significant challenges that still exists with dense sensor/actuator network. This paper offers an efficient way to acquire sensor readings from very large sensor/actuator network that are located in a small area (dense network). It presents LIA algorithm, a Linear Interpolation Algorithm that provides two important contributions. First, it demonstrates the effectiveness of employing a transformation matrix to mimic the environmental behavior. Second, it renders a smart solution for updating the previously defined matrix through a procedure called learning phase. Simulation results reveal that the average relative error in LIA algorithm can be reduced by as much as 60 % by exploiting transformation matrix...|$|R
5|$|The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body {{twin-engine}} jet airliner {{that was}} designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member glass cockpit, turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail and, for reduced <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>drag,</b> a supercritical wing design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727 on short and medium routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of , depending on variant.
