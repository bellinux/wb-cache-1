25|$|Wright {{expressed}} the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat {{in an interview}} he conducted with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:My {{heart goes out to}} my family <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Well, if you think you're right, then you're right. Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, {{but at the end of}} the day no one will force their opinions down my throat – no one.|$|E
2500|$|News of {{casualties}} {{suffered by the}} British Expeditionary Force in Belgium was already turning the public mood against [...] "business as usual" [...] and on 27 August a letter written by W.G. Grace was published in The Sportsman in which he declared that [...] "I think the time has arrived when the county cricket season should be closed, for it is not fitting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> that able-bodied men should be playing cricket by day and pleasure-seekers look on. I should like to see all first-class cricketers of suitable age {{set a good example}} and come to the help of their country without delay in its hour of need." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Harper and Dion {{addressed}} {{the nation on}} December 3, 2008, with televised statements broadcast on Canada's major television networks. Harper's five-minute pre-recorded statement, televised nationally in English and French at 7 pm Eastern Time (ET), outlined the steps the government had taken to address the economic crisis and attacked the Liberals for forming a coalition with the Bloc Québécois. Harper said: [...] "at a time of global economic instability, Canada's government must stand unequivocally for keeping the country together. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> a coalition with the separatists cannot help Canada. And the opposition {{does not have the}} democratic right to impose a coalition with the separatists they promised voters would never happen." [...] The press noted that while he used the word sovereigntist in the French version of his speech, Harper used separatist in English.|$|E

2500|$|On 28 May, {{they heard}} that the Belgian army was surrendering. [...] General Réquin spoke to Mrs Spears and {{emphasised}} the serious of the military situation. She received telephone calls from Paris – her husband wanted {{her to come to}} Paris before he flew to London. [...] She resisted – how could she leave her unit <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> [...] Spears was insistent but she was reluctant, as was Captain Gosset, who feared the road might be cut and that she would be unable to get back. [...] They heard that Dunkirk had been evacuated. [...] Then Spears rang again – this time ordering her to come to Paris. [...] She decided to make a dash to the capital and back. [...] They met at the British embassy. [...] With the French army collapsing on all fronts, Spears was exhausted. 'His eyes were bloodshot. [...] There were lines inches deep in his face. [...] I saw for one second what was going to happen. [...] The war leapt at me out of his eyes. [...] I was terrified.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Our misfortune {{was very}} sudden,' said Kate, turning away, 'or I might perhaps, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> be enabled {{to support it}} better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your maid, then," [...] he suggested. [...] "Useless creatures maids, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> They {{are nearly}} always seasick, {{especially}} {{the first day}} out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Were I so {{fortunate}} as to possess relatives so near and dear," [...] returned the other, with emphasis [...] "nothing should separate us <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{think the}} captain much relished {{the notion of}} being {{questioned}} about his son's feelin's, and visit up here, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this," [...] put {{in one of the}} Americans.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this," [...] Morrison pleaded passionately. [...] "Every {{one does}} it sometimes. He'd {{be glad to}} help you. I know he would. Have you ever thought {{what it will be}} like, Laverick, to be hammered?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wasn't it dreadful, Miss Oliver? I don't {{know why}} Jem tells such gruesome things <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> when we're all out for fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{must tell}} you something, first. I should not have a secret from you. You would not blame me, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> I know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] {{cried the}} convert. [...] "Are {{you going to}} respect a taboo <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> And you were always so opposed to taboos when you were alive!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gee, don't mention school <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this!" [...] {{burst out}} Andy. [...] "I {{want to forget}} all about {{studying}} until it's absolutely necessary {{to go back to}} it. And don't forget it's high time to eat," [...] he added.|$|R
6000|$|... "Words are idle {{things to}} deal with <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this," [...] he said. [...] "One thing, however, I will venture to say to you, Prince, here and under these circumstances. There will be no war unless it be the will of your country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is kind of}} you, dear Lucy," [...] I said, as we {{took our}} seats at the little table; [...] "my cousin John Wallingford, though a good man in the main, is {{scarcely}} near enough, or dear enough, to be admitted <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
6000|$|Francisca smiled. [...] "One {{does not}} ask {{questions}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> It is prudent {{to believe what}} one is told. When the soldiers lost their leader they ran away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{never thought}} much about it," [...] said Bridge; [...] "but <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> I rather hope so--I'd like {{to come back and}} haunt this bunch of rat brained rubes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] Mr. Lavender replied, [...] "the {{thought of}} bed is {{abhorrent}} to me <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> What more ignoble fate than to die in, one's bed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Up, and off, tell you. No use talkin' now. Put {{all he can}} in canoe, and paddle away fast as can." [...] There was {{no mistaking}} Peter's manner. The bee-hunter saw the uselessness of {{questioning}} such <b>a</b> man, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> that, and he called to Gershom to join him.|$|R
50|$|Veronica Morgeson is Cassandra’s younger sister. She has a pureness and otherworldliness {{that link}} {{her to the}} Virgin Mary. She {{experiences}} sudden fits of illness that incapacitate her for months <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Like</b> Cassandra, she too is on a quest for autonomy, yet she finds herself too weak to combat the pressures of society.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was very}} keen {{on the idea}} of going wide <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> that, just seeing how big this thing could get. I had always admired Colonel Parker and Brian Epsteinfor {{realising}} that music could capture the imagination of the whole world." [...] —U2 manager Paul McGuinness, explaining his original motivation to make a movie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not when I am {{carrying}} {{my life in}} my hands," [...] Trent answered grimly. [...] "I {{get drunk}} sometimes--when there's nothing on and the blues come--never <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> though." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis no use," [...] Sullivan objected. [...] "As if ye cud be slapin' <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Ye'll not slape, and ye'll not warm up. Look at ye now. You've an ague." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Turn to! turn to!--I make no promise; to your duty! Do {{you want}} to sink the ship, by {{knocking}} off <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this?</b> Turn to!' and he once more raised a pistol.|$|E
5000|$|Concealment (miegakure, [...] "hide and reveal"). The Zen Buddhist {{garden is}} meant to be seen all at once, but the {{promenade}} garden {{is meant to}} be seen one landscape <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> scroll of painted landscapes unrolling. Features are hidden behind hills, trees groves or bamboo, walls or structures, to be discovered when the visitor follows the winding path.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cards are}} then dealt into three piles one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>like</b> when dealing out {{hands in a}} card game. Each time they are dealt out, after the spectator {{indicates}} which pile contains the thought of card, the magician places that pile between the other two. After the first time, the card {{will be one of}} the ones in position 8-14.|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite understand, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this," [...] said Mrs. Pomfret, and added, for {{the benefit}} of her audience, [...] "when Mr. Crewe has been public-spirited and unselfish enough to {{undertake}} such a gigantic task. Tell him Miss Pomfret and I call from time to time because we are so interested, and that the whole of Leith wishes him success." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a misfortune, and {{at such a}} moment! Is it not scandalous that, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> {{when every}} gentleman's sword is needed in defence of our king and faith, they should indulge in private quarrels? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} wonderful," [...] she declared. [...] "Remember that <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> {{it is not}} a woman's will alone that speaks. It is her soul which lights the way. Prince Shan, I do not know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely, my friend! You see, I use the epithet 'my friend' because <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> all Frenchmen must {{forget their}} {{differences}} {{and work together}} for the good and honour of their country. Is it not so, monsieur?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... “A veteran missionary, {{speaking}} to some 20 Christian {{workers who were}} housed temporarily in a YMCA washroom, expressed what many were thinking. ‘The Oriental Missionary Society starting a work in China <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this?’ he exclaimed. ‘You must be fools.’ Ironically, it was this same missionary whose home was rented by the OMS, making it the first headquarters for the work in China,” (Page 59).|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not {{entitled}} to ask your story," [...] Lady Casterley went on, [...] "but if you make mysteries you must expect the worst interpretation put on them. My grandson {{is a man of}} the highest principle; he does not see things with the eyes of the world, and that should have made you doubly careful not to compromise him, especially <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this." ...|$|R
2500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s, Baez began writing many of her own songs, {{beginning}} with [...] "Sweet Sir Galahad" [...] and [...] "A Song For David," [...] both songs appearing on her 1970 (I Live) One Day <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time</b> album; [...] "Sweet Sir Galahad" [...] was written about her sister Mimi's second marriage while [...] "A Song For David" [...] was a tribute to Harris.
