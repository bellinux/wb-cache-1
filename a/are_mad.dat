25|$|While {{some critics}} have argued that some of Sondheim’s musicals lack {{commercial}} appeal, others have praised their lyrical sophistication and musical complexity, {{as well as the}} interplay of lyrics and music in his shows. Some of Sondheim's notable innovations include a show presented in reverse (Merrily We Roll Along) and the above-mentioned Anyone Can Whistle, in which the first act ends with the cast informing the audience that they <b>are</b> <b>mad.</b>|$|E
500|$|High {{school student}} Kim Possible (Christy Carlson Romano) fights crime {{alongside}} {{her best friend}} and sidekick Ron Stoppable (Will Friedle), aided by his pet naked mole-rat Rufus (Nancy Cartwright) and computer genius Wade (Tahj Mowry). The character lives in fictional Middleton, USA with her parents James (Gary Cole) and Ann (Jean Smart), a rocket scientist and neurosurgeon respectively, and her younger brothers, identical twins Jim and Tim. Kim goes on extraordinary missions {{to save the world}} from danger at the hands of various supervillains and evil geniuses. Her most consistent adversaries <b>are</b> <b>mad</b> scientist Dr. Drakken and his sidekick Shego, the latter of whom is a former superheroine and skilled martial artist who has the ability to generate powerful energy blasts from her hands, and thus poses as her main combatant and threat.|$|E
500|$|On Bennett's {{return to}} London {{he took up}} a {{teaching}} post at the RAM which he held until 1858. During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to about such things, all the people <b>are</b> <b>mad</b> with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June. I sincerely hope that Prince Albert... will do something to improve our taste.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't mind," [...] he declared. [...] "I guess I don't mind telling. You see, {{whatever}} I {{was when}} I did it, I <b>am</b> <b>mad</b> now--quite mad. My friend Pritchard here says I <b>am</b> <b>mad.</b> I must have <b>been</b> <b>mad</b> or I shouldn't {{have tried to}} hurt that dear beautiful lady over there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a funny}} sight. I want {{to laugh}} out loud, Ha! ha! just like that, it is so funny. It is a race of dead men and dead dogs. It is like in a dream {{when you have a}} {{nightmare}} and run away very fast for your life and go very slow. The man who is with me <b>is</b> <b>mad.</b> The woman <b>is</b> <b>mad.</b> I <b>am</b> <b>mad.</b> All the world <b>is</b> <b>mad,</b> and I want to laugh, it is so funny.|$|R
500|$|Pinchwife {{was played}} by the elderly Michael Mohun, who was best known for playing menacing villains, such as Volpone and Iago. Mrs. Pinchwife was Elizabeth Boutell or Bowtel, a young actress who had [...] "a childish look. Her voice was weak, tho' very mellow; she {{generally}} acted the young innocent lady whom all the heroes <b>are</b> <b>mad</b> in love with". Boutell's previous recorded roles had in fact all been unmarried as well as innocent girls, and Margery was her first married role. Matching Boutell and Mohun as a couple would emphasise [...] "her youth and innocence against Mohun's age and violence". The other husband to be cuckolded by Horner, Sir Jaspar Fidget, was played by another elderly actor, William Cartwright, best known for comic parts such as Falstaff. This casting suggests that Sir Jaspar was played as a straightforwardly comic part, while Pinchwife would be [...] "alarming as well as funny".|$|E
2500|$|Calhoun {{rushed to}} Charleston {{with the news}} of the final compromises. The Nullification Convention met again on March 11. It {{repealed}} the November Nullification Ordinance and also, [...] "in a purely symbolic gesture", nullified the Force Bill. While the nullifiers claimed victory on the tariff issue, even though they had made concessions, the verdict was very different on nullification. The majority had, in the end, ruled and this boded ill for the South and their minorities hold on slavery. Rhett summed this up at the convention on March 13. Warning that, [...] "A people, owning slaves, <b>are</b> <b>mad,</b> or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands," [...] he continued: ...|$|E
2500|$|Maria {{arrived in}} England with the {{intention}} of making a success of her life in her adopted country, but she found difficult to settle at the British Court. For her, the climate was detestable, and the food bland. She found Clarence House, her London home, [...] "gloomy". She described London as [...] "an impossible place, where people <b>are</b> <b>mad</b> of pleasure" [...] and a let down compared to the broad streets, golden domes, and magnificent palaces of Saint Petersburg. In her eyes, Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle could never compete with the splendours of the Winter Palace. Constant visits to her mother-in-law at Windsor Castle and Osborne in the Isle of Wight were tedious. The Queen's company was oppressive, the late nights were tiring, and her husband was a philanderer. Of her sisters and brothers-in-law, she only cared for the two youngest: Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice. Proud of her strong intellect, she considered Alexandra, the Princess of Wales, a light-minded and foolish woman. Although she loved music, the duchess did not like the Royal Albert Hall, describing it as [...] "all ecclesiastical and ... quite boring ... Every concert goes on for several hours”. When she visited Scotland, Maria Alexandrovna was frozen in her unheated bedroom in Balmoral Castle and ordered a fire to be lit. When she was out, Queen Victoria entered the room and ordered a maid to throw water on the fire and open all the windows. The Duchess was soon writing letters home to her father describing Queen Victoria as a [...] "silly obstinate old fool". Disenchanted with Britain and life with her difficult mother-in-law, the Duchess of Edinburgh became increasingly homesick for Russia and was happy for any excuse to return there. British people thought her rough and masculine in her manners. Her imperious attitude towards her servants and her defiance of English convention by smoking in public made her unpopular. She made it equally plain that she did not care what people thought.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1990s, {{frontman}} Greg Graffin {{used to sing}} [...] "don't <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> about it, Bobby", {{referring to}} then-drummer Bobby Schayer, instead of [...] "don't <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> about it, baby".|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{but that}} picture was a sight!" [...] cried the fun-loving Rover, and gunned broadly. [...] "No wonder old Sharp <b>was</b> <b>mad.</b> I'd <b>be</b> <b>mad</b> myself, {{especially}} {{if it was a}} photo of my best girl." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, a {{great deal}} is the matter," [...] Madame Duburg began, vehemently. [...] "You and your English husband <b>are</b> <b>mad.</b> Your wretched boys <b>are</b> <b>mad.</b> They have made my sons mad, also; and--my faith--I believe that my husband will catch it. It {{is enough to make}} me, also, mad." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Lawrence," [...] she cried, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> {{the other}} day. It {{was all the}} pent-up {{bitterness}} of years which seemed to escape me so suddenly. I said so much that I did not mean to--I <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> dear. Oh, Lawrence, I am so lonely!" ...|$|R

60|$|Of {{course she}} might <b>be</b> <b>mad,</b> after all, and {{possibly}} the bandit, too, but it seemed unbelievable that the officer <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> and his entire troop of cavalry should be composed of maniacs, yet they all persisted in speaking and acting as though he <b>were</b> indeed the <b>mad</b> king of Lutha and the young girl at his side a princess.|$|R
