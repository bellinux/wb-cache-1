40|$|There are {{numerous}} researches which analyze mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions,</b> {{but most of}} them do not focus on a certain industry, but their sample considers companies from different industries.

40|$|With the {{liberalization}} of economy and globalization, business communications among nations has become more frequently. The same is true as the cooperation and competition between financial institutions from different countries. Under such condition, there is a driving trend of large-scale mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> (M&A) activities worldwide. China, {{as one of the}} outstanding representatives of emerging economies, has achieved high-speed in economic growth. Many commercial banks of China have set about the cross-border mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> not only to promote the international influence but also to increase their profitability and efficiency. This paper uses the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) model to examine the relationships between mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> <b>and</b> cost efficiency in Chinese bank industry. According to the announcement time of mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions,</b> the two groups that pre and post mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> groups are built.

5|$|Joseph {{understood}} {{the problems facing}} his multi-ethnic patrimony and the ambivalent position the Austrians held in the Holy Roman Empire. Although the Habsburgs and their successor house of Habsburg-Lorraine had, with two exceptions, held the position of Emperor since the early 15th century, the basis of 18th-century Habsburg power lay not in the Holy Roman Empire itself, but in Habsburg territories in Eastern Europe (where the family had vast domains), the Italian peninsula, and the Lowlands. For Joseph or his successors to wield influence in the German-speaking states, they needed to acquire additional German-speaking territories. Acquisition of Central European territories with German-speaking subjects would strengthen the Austrian position in the Holy Roman Empire. As far as Joseph was concerned, only this could shift {{the center of the}} Habsburg empire into German-speaking Central Europe. This agenda made dispensable both the Austrian Netherlands—Habsburg territories which lay furthest west—and Galicia, furthest east. It also made the recovery of German-speaking Silesia <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> of new territories in Bavaria essential.|$|E

5|$|The Mycenaean economy, {{given its}} pre-monetary nature, {{was focused on}} the {{redistribution}} of goods, commodities and labor by a central administration. The preserved Linear B records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring a variety of industries and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to the dependent personnel. The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods. For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000-100,000 sheep grazing in central Crete, and the quantity of the expected wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated. The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in the stages of production, notably in textiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{years of}} neglect {{following}} {{the closing of the}} hotel took a toll on the building's appearance with both the interior and exterior facade crumbling. In 2005, it was announced that the hotel would undergo a $112million renovation <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> with a planned opening in 2007 in a deal between Marriott International/Renaissance Hotels and Sage Hospitality, a Denver, Colorado-based company. The hotel's restoration process was quite lengthy because of the extensive interior damage. $22million of the expected $112million was the cost associated with the acquisition. Sage sought $22million in tax increment financing from the Chicago Community Development Commission. They eventually were approved for $18million in tax-increment financing. The final cost of the restoration came to $128million, of which the city of Chicago provided $13.5million for street-front improvement, including the restoration and recasting of over 10,000 pieces of decorative terra cotta, and federal historical tax credits because the building is a historical landmark. The Chicago Landmark status necessitated renovation oversight by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
