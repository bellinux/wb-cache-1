40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} time-marching model which simulates the {{exchange}} of water ice between the Martian northern cap, the tropics and a high-latitude surface reservoir. Net <b>annual</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of water and their sensitivity to variations in orbital/rotational parameters are examined using the Martian water cycle modeled by the LMD 3 -D Global Climate Model. These rates are propagated over the last 10 Myr to follow {{the thickness of the}} reservoirs. The effect of a sublimation dust lag is taken account to test simple models of layer formation. Periods of high mean polar summer insolation (∼ 5 - 10 Ma ago) lead to a rapid exhaustion of a northern polar cap and a prolonged formation of tropical glaciers. The formation of a northern cap and of a high-latitude icy mantle may have started 4 Ma ago with the average decrease of polar insolation. Tropical ice may have disappeared around 2. 7 Ma ago, but small glaciers could have formed during the last peaks of polar summer insolation. Over the last 4 Myr, most of the present cap may have formed at the expense of tropical and high-latitude reservoirs forming distinct layers at almost each ∼ 51 -kyr/ 120 -kyr insolation cycle. Layers thickness ranges from 10 to 80 meters, variations being produced by the modulation of the obliquity with ∼ 2. 4 and 1. 3 Myr periods. Because only ∼ 30 insolation cycles have occured since 4 Ma ago, we found an inconsistency between the recent astronomical forcing, the observed number of layers and simple astronomically-based scenarios of layers formation...|$|E

The decrease in GDP in 1996 and 1997 was largely due to significant problems in the financial sector and, in 1997, a severe island-wide drought (the worst in 70 years) that drastically reduced agricultural production.

40|$|Does {{the choice}} of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime affect the way an economy''s {{adjustment}} to real shocks? Exploiting the randomness of natural shocks, this paper assesses empirically the often contrasting answers found in the theoretical literature. The evidence supports key themes in this literature, and points to an important tradeoff between regimes. First, adverse natural shocks are associated with both higher investment and foreign direct investment (FDI) only in developing countries with fixed rate regimes. Second, over a 24 -month horizon, growth rebounds earlier in flexible rate regimes. Third, in the long run, more adverse shocks are associated with higher growth and investment only in predominantly fixed regimes. Thus, while claims of faster adjustment to real shocks under flexible rate arrangements have merit, so does the idea that <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variability can impede investment. And the benefits from faster adjustment may come {{at the cost of}} foregoing the long run productivity benefits embodied in the larger investment response in fixed <b>rate</b> regimes. <b>Exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes;exchange <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> per capita income, gross capital formation, terms of trade, trade openness, adjustment process, trade growth, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variability, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> classification, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> uncertainty, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy, investment goods, export sector, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime classification, currency depreciation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> dummy, flexible flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>annual</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> adjustment to shocks, effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> categories, history of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, domestic prices, trade shocks, prevailing <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> political economy, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> choice, international trade, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, costs of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variability, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, commodity prices, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> channel, <b>annual</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> classification system, parallel nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> shocks, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> stability, foreign <b>exchange,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime durability, terms of trade shocks, currency unions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements, price stability, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> uncertainty, policy regimes, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> monetary union, optimum currency areas, domestic price, output growth...|$|R

These forward interest rate differentials have statistically and economically significant forecast power for <b>annual</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, both in- and out-of-sample, and the signs and magnitudes of the corresponding coefficients are consistent with economic theory.

40|$|Jamaica {{has been}} plagued by high murder rates for some time and the issue has become a {{national}} problem. This seeks to: 1) model murder, 2) determine factors of mortality, 3) examine the role of poverty on murder, and 4) provide policy markers, particularly the police, with an understanding of how murders can be effectively addressed. This study is a secondary data analysis of statistics from different agencies. Data were entered and stored into Microsoft Excel and SPSS for Window version 17. 0 (SPSS Inc; Chicago, IL, USA) which were both used to analyze the data. The averaged murders per decade have been increasing by geometrical progression, with the greater proportion occurring in the last decade (2000 - 2010). Although averaged murders for each decade have been increasing, the lowest increased occurred in the 1990 s compared to the 1980 s (43. 4 %). There is a strong positive correlation between the <b>annual</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and lnmurder (rs = 0. 934, p< 0. 0001).

Annual change in the industrial production index, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and inflation as well as deviation of the change in <b>annual</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> from its sample mean are used as threshold variables. The latter variable is used to capture asymmetric effects of small versus big changes in <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> on the extent of pass-through.

It traces the history of the interest parity concept, summarizes evidence on the empirical validity of uncovered interest parity, and discusses different interpretations of the evidence and the implications for macroeconomic analysis. The uncovered interest parity assumption has been an important building block in multiperiod models of open economies, and although its validity is strongly challenged by the empirical evidence, at least at short time horizons, its retention in macroeconomic models is supported on pragmatic grounds by the lack of much empirical support for existing models of the exchange risk premium. <b>Exchange</b> rates;Interest rates;exchange <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> expectations, spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> risk, forward <b>exchange,</b> spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> international finance, <b>exchange</b> markets, forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> market intervention, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> economics, foreign assets, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> risk, <b>exchange</b> risks, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> uncertainty, financial globalization, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, forward <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>annual</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> futures, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, capital flows, foreign <b>exchange</b> market, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, globalization...|$|R

40|$|The {{weakness}} of the euro has been surprising given the widely-held expectation {{that it would be}} a strong currency. This paper critically examines explanations for the slide in the euro, finding that many are questionable on conceptual or empirical grounds. Two explanations are instead advanced that appear to be consistent both with theory and data. The first originates in the global surge in equity prices since the mid- 1990 s, which created a demand shock that disproportionately affected the U. S. economy. Model simulations indicate that this can explain the strength of the dollar against other currencies in recent years, accounting for about half of the decline in the effective value of the euro. The other component of euro weakness can be attributed to a mismatch between the demand and supply of euro-denominated assets that arose with the creation of the single currency in 1999. The effect of both these factors should fade over time, although near-term market volatility could be exacerbated by uncertainties about the fundamentals driving currency values. <b>Exchange</b> rates;exchange <b>rate,</b> real interest <b>rates,</b> inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, real interest rate, aggregate demand, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> monetary policy, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, relative price, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> change, effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation rates, currency values, euro <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> current <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign currency, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> developments, foreign <b>exchange,</b> real wages, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> real output, <b>exchange</b> markets, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, price level, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> uncertainty, monetary economics, home currency, exchange risk, forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> levels, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, relative prices, forward <b>exchange,</b> <b>annual</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> rational expectations, terms of trade shock, lower inflation, price elasticity, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, real <b>rates,</b> dollar <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> terms of trade, inflation equation, inflation <b>rate,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> appreciation, currency appreciation, currency risk, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> behavior, hard ? currency, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy...|$|R

Furthermore, when west and central African countries are considered together, we find significant heterogeneities within the CFA franc zone, and some interesting similarities between the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) and WAMZ countries.

The reduction in fertility is primarily attributable to contraceptive measures; but murder and other selected macroeconomic variables {{have never been}} included in the literature. Objectives: This study examines murder, mortality, and selected macroeconomic variables are factors of births, using data for Jamaica from 1989 - 2009. Methods: The study is a secondary data analysis of statistics on Jamaica from 1989 - 2009 but also includes data on births from 1900 s. Find- ings: In the decade of the 1950 s, births increased by 79. 9 % over the decade of 1900 s, grew by 22. 4 % in the 1960 s over the previous decade and declined by 17. 6 % in 2000 s compared with the 1990 s. Four emerged as statistically significant predictors of lnbirth—inflation, GDP per capita growth, mortality and murder, with an explanatory power of 90. 6 %—F = 19. 291, P s = 0. 962), when murder was excluded and replaced by <b>annual</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> the factors influencing lnbirth was <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation, unemployment, GDP per capita growth and mortality—all factors account for 92. 2 % of the variability in lnbirth—F = 30. 572, P < 0. 0001.

In {{the first part of the}} research is presented an analysis regarding the evolution of the number of tourists within the tourist accommodation establishments in the Bihor – Hajdú-Bihar Euroregion. The analysis is based on the following aspects: the evolution of the number of tourists within the Bihor – Hajdú-Bihar Euroregion is presented; a comparison regarding the number of national tourists registered in the two counties belonging to the Bihor – Hajdú-Bihar Euroregion and finally an analysis based on the number of foreign tourists registered within the two counties belonging to the Bihor – Hajdú-Bihar Euroregion. In the second part of the research, the study continues with the analysis of the activities of the hotel units from Bihor and Hajdú-Bihar starting from the data obtained from the Bihor County Statistics Department, for Bihor County, and from the Debrecen Central Statistics Office, for the Hajdú-Bihar data. The research covers the period from 2008 - 2011, following the indicators regarding: the number of active units, turnover, and employee related expenses, staff and gross investments in tangible assets. This statistical and economic analysis presents on one hand the centralization of the indicators used within a table, (initially, in a rough form and subsequently in a shaped form based on the <b>annual</b> average <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of the leu and forint compared to the euro during 2008 - 2011) and on the other the evolution of each indicator in chart form. Due to the fact that a part of the analyzed indicators are expressed in the national currency of the two countries (Romania and Hungary), I have used the <b>annual</b> average <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of the leu and forint compared to the euro, in order to bring them to comparable units of measurement.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a small {{open economy}} model under inflation targeting. It shows {{why such a}} monetary regime is vulnerable to speculative attacks that take place over a short period rather than instantaneously. The speed at which the regime collapses, {{and the extent of}} reserve losses, are increasing in the central bank''s explicit or implicit commitment to intervene in the foreign exchange market. Attacks are therefore ranked, from most to least severe, as follows: <b>Exchange</b> <b>rate</b> targeting, CPI inflation targeting, domestic nontradables inflation targeting, and money targeting.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for understanding trade patterns in the Mashreq. An augmented gravity model is used to compare actual with expected levels of trade. Trade barriers, political uncertainty, and over-appreciation of domestic currencies seem to explain low levels of international trade. At the intra-regional level, specific trade barriers between Israel and other Mashreq countries reduce further levels of trade. Quite surprisingly, removing Israel from the sample leads to higher actual intra-regional trade than predicted. The analysis suggests that trade liberalization, correction of currency misalignments, reduction of political uncertainty, and improved trade relations with Israel would boost trade in the region.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and estimates a small open economy dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model (DSGE) for the Jordanian economy. The model features nominal and real rigidities, imperfect competition and habit {{formation in the}} consumer’s utility function. Oil imports are explicitly modeled in the consumption basket and domestic production. Bayesian estimation methods are employed on quarterly Jordanian data. The model’s properties are described by impulse response analysis of identified structural shocks pertinent to the economy. These properties assess {{the effectiveness of the}} pegged <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime in minimizing inflation and output trade-offs. The estimates of the structural parameters fall within plausible ranges, and simulation results suggest that while the peg amplifies output, consumption and (price and wage) inflation volatility, it offers a relatively low risk premium.

40|$|Using recent {{advances}} in the classification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, this paper finds no support for the popular bipolar view that countries will tend over time {{to move to the}} polar extremes of free float or rigid peg. Rather, intermediate regimes have shown remarkable durability. The analysis suggests that as economies mature, the value of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed or relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-inflation credibility gain without compromising growth objectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be considerable benefits to more flexible regimes.

We analyze these issues in an intertemporal optimizing model that allows a portion of aid to be devoted to reducing the government’s seigniorage requirement. This creates a strong link between official aid flows and private capital flows. When the credibility of policymakers’ commitment to low inflation is firm, some degree of dirty floating, with little or no sterilization of increases in the monetary base, is the most attractive approach in the short run.

40|$|This paper studies optimal {{monetary}} policy in a two-sector small open economy model under segmented asset markets and sticky prices. We solve the Ramsey problem under full commitment, and characterize the optimal {{monetary policy}} in a calibrated {{version of the}} model. The findings of the paper are threefold. First, the Ramsey solution mimics the allocations under flexible prices. Second, under the optimal policy the volatility of non-tradable inflation is close to zero. Third, stabilizing nontradable inflation is optimal regardless of the financial structure of the small open economy. Even for a moderate degree of price stickiness, implementing a monetary policy that mitigates asset market segmentation is highly distortionary. This last result suggests that policymakers should resort to other policy instruments in order to correct financial imperfections.

40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the reasons}} why Isoniazid {{preventive}} therapy (IPT) for Tuberculosis (TB) is not widely used in low income countries is concerns on cost of excluding active TB. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of IPT provision in Tanzania having ruled out active TB by a symptom-based screening tool. Methods Data on IPT cost-effectiveness was prospectively collected from an observational cohort study of 1283 HIV-infected patients on IPT and 1281 controls; followed up for 24  months. The time horizon for the analysis was 2  years. Number of TB cases prevented and deaths averted were used for effectiveness. A micro costing approach was used from a provider perspective. Cost was estimated on the basis of clinical records, market price or interviews with medical staff. We annualized the cost at a discount of 3 %. A univariate sensitivity analysis was done. Results are presented in US$ at an average <b>annual</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> for the year 2012 which was Tanzania shillings 1562. 4 for 1 US $. Results The number of TB cases prevented was 420 / 100, 000 persons receiving IPT. The number of deaths averted was 979 / 100, 000 persons receiving IPT. Incremental cost due to IPT provision was US$ 170, 490. The incremental cost effective ratio was US $ 405. 93 per TB case prevented and US $ 174. 15 per death averted. These costs were less than 3 times the 768 US $ Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita for Tanzania in the year 2014, making IPT provision after ruling out active TB by the symptom-based screening tool cost-effective. The results were robust to changes in laboratory and radiological tests but not to changes in recurrent, personnel, medication and utility costs. Conclusion IPT should be given to HIV-infected patients who screen negative to symptom-based TB screening questionnaire. Its cost-effectiveness supports government policy to integrate IPT to HIV/AIDS care and treatment in the country, given the availability of budget and the capacity of health facilities...|$|R
