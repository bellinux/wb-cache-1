5|$|By early April 1999, TouchWave had {{upgraded}} their WebSwitch 1608 {{local area}} network distributed phone system to a product called WebSwitch 2000. On April 13, 1999, Swedish telecommunication company Ericsson announced that it had purchased TouchWave for $46 million. In exchange for the $46M, TouchWave provided Ericsson with Internet Protocol centric network products such as business phone and private business exchanges. The acquisition of TouchWave {{came at a time}} when multibillion-dollar companies were acquiring other relatively small Internet-connected companies, such as WebLine, Selsius, GeoTel, NBX, Dialogic, and Summa Four. Some employees from TouchWave eventually followed serial entrepreneur and former TouchWave president and CEO Samir Lehaff to Adomo, Inc., a provider of voicemail majordomo services. TouchWave co-founder Jeff Snider would go on to be vice president of enterprise sales at Ericsson and then <b>a</b> <b>CEO</b> co-founder of Adomo in 1999.|$|E

In the final at the Olympiastadion in Munich, West Germany, Malmö FF were defeated 1–0 by the English side Nottingham Forest, but the side's achievement in reaching the final is still the club's most prominent in European football.

40|$|We {{explore how}} {{compensation}} policies following mergers affect <b>a</b> <b>CEO's</b> incentives {{to pursue a}} merger.

Following <b>a</b> merger, <b>a</b> <b>CEO's</b> pay and overall wealth become insensitive to negative stock performance, but <b>a</b> <b>CEO's</b> wealth rises in step with positive stock performance. Corporate governance matters; bidding firms with stronger boards retain the sensitivity of their CEOs' compensation to poor performance following the merger. In comparison, we find that CEOs are not rewarded for undertaking major capital expenditures. Copyright 2007 by The American Finance Association. ...|$|R

NBA commissioner Adam Silver stated in a press conference regarding the decision that he will try to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, which would require the consent of ¾ of the league's 29 other team owners. Silver later announced that the NBA would appoint <b>a</b> <b>CEO</b> to run the team.

40|$|To empirically {{test the}} impact of CEOs' outside wealth on their compensation, I use spousal divorce {{as a proxy for}} an exogenous, {{negative}} shock to <b>a</b> <b>CEO's</b> outside wealth. I hypothesize that this shock decreases <b>a</b> <b>CEO's</b> risk tolerance. I also expect that the board of directors responds to this decrease by raising the CEO's cash compensation and by increasing the sensitivity of the CEO's compensation to changes in firm value. I find that cash bonuses, restricted stock grants, and option grants increase following <b>a</b> <b>CEO's</b> divorce, consistent with boards reacting to changes in CEOs' outside wealth and risk incentives. I also find that firms' total risk and idiosyncratic risk significantly drop during the year of <b>a</b> <b>CEO's</b> divorce, consistent with a drop in the CEO's risk tolerance. Overconfident CEOs, who are more risk tolerant, do not receive the same increases in compensation following divorce. I find little support for the relation between divorce and compensation being endogenously determined by performance or by poor corporate governance. Overall, the results support predictions that the board of directors takes the CEO's wealth into account when setting compensation and that outside wealth impacts the CEO's risk preferences...|$|R

[...] Newt Gingrich then criticised Romney's record at Bain Capital, saying [...] "I'm very much for free enterprise...
