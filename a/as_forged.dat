5|$|Walter Skinner's {{old college}} friend, Hollywood {{producer}} Wayne Federman, {{is involved in}} a film project about the FBI. During Federman's research phase, Skinner gives him access to Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, who are investigating the attempted murder of Cardinal O'Fallon. Federman tags along and constantly interrupts the agents. While searching the catacombs of O'Fallon's church, Mulder finds the remains of Micah Hoffman, a missing 1960s counter-culturalist. Searching Hoffman's apartment, they find bombs and counterfeiting tools, as well <b>as</b> <b>forged</b> gospel of Mary Magdalene. Mulder and Federman return to the church and search the catacombs, finding several skeletons and pieces of the forged gospel. Federman wanders off and stumbles upon animated bones, who attempt to assemble a shattered piece of pottery. He panics and leaves the scene.|$|E
25|$|Ehrman {{examines}} the historicity of Jesus and includes some criticism of Christ mythicists. As {{he does in}} other works such <b>as</b> <b>Forged</b> and Jesus, Interrupted, he disregards an apologetics-based or otherwise religiously-charged approach to aim at looking at the New Testament using historical-critical methodology. He argues that a specific historical Jesus {{is likely to have}} really existed in the 1st century AD. Even as accounts about that figure later on brought in additional misinformation and legendary stories, Ehrman states, multiple reasons still remain to see things as framed around a flesh-and-blood actual person, at least at first.|$|E
25|$|When {{the fifth}} guru, Guru Arjan Dev, was {{collecting}} religious writings of his predecessor, {{he discovered that}} pretenders to the guruship were releasing what he considered <b>as</b> <b>forged</b> anthologies of writings of the previous guru and including their own writings with them. In order to prevent spurious scriptures from gaining legitimacy, Guru Arjan Dev began compiling a sacred scripture for the Sikh community. He finished collecting the religious writings of Guru Ram Das, his immediate predecessor, and convinced Mohan, the son of Guru Amar Das, {{to give him the}} collection of the religious writings of the first three gurus. In addition, he sent disciples to go across the country to find and bring back any previously unknown religious writings of theirs. He also invited members of other religions and contemporary religious writers to submit writings for possible inclusion. Guru Arjan selected hymns for inclusion in the holy Adi Granth and Bhai Gurdas acted as his scribe.|$|E

2500|$|This {{argument}} {{reflects the}} question raised in 1955 by Lord Russell concerning their existence {{at the time}} of Casement's trial. The argument proposes a paradigm shift – the diaries were fabricated after Casement's execution <b>as</b> <b>forged</b> versions of the original typescripts. Anatomy of [...] a Lie, another research essay, purports that the homosexual dimension was largely the invention of British Minister Findlay in Christiania, Norway (now Oslo) in a false memorandum on 29 October 1914. The rarely-seen document containing the first innuendo has never been analysed before and is unmentioned by all Casement authors save one. It is posited that, in the following months Findlay amplified his allegations because he feared exposure of his written bribe through a threatened lawsuit against him by Casement; a subsequent diplomatic scandal which might have destroyed his career.|$|E
2500|$|Influenced {{by early}} mission furnishings, [...] "mission oak" [...] {{furniture}} bears some similarity to the related Arts and Crafts style furniture, using similar materials but without Arts and Crafts' emphasis on refinement of line and decoration. Oak is the typical material, finished with its natural golden appearance that will age {{to a rich}} medium brown color. Components such as legs will often be straight, not tapered, and surfaces will be flat, rather than curved. [...] Generous use of materials leads to heavy and solid furnishings, giving an impression of [...] "groundedness", through simplicity, functionality and stability. Straightforward lines predominate, {{with little or no}} decoration, other than that which is incidental to function, such <b>as</b> <b>forged</b> iron hinges and latches. The leading designer of furnishings in this style during the Arts and Crafts movement was Gustav Stickley.|$|E

2500|$|Tejada {{understood}} {{political thought}} {{as a vehicle}} of sustaining tradition and ignored the imperial and ethnic dimensions of Hispanidad. He viewed the Hispanic political community <b>as</b> <b>forged</b> by {{will of the people}} forming its components, not as a result of conquest. Ethnic features were merely means of transmitting heritage and a nation was defined as commonality of tradition, as opposed to positivist definitions focusing on features like language, geography, regime etc.; it enabled implantation of Hispanidad in vastly different settings of the Philippines, Uruguay or Franche-Comté. Tejada saw the Hispanic tradition against a decisively providential background, e.g. when confronting Islam, Protestantism or the New World; scholars saw this approach as indebted to the vision of Giambattista Vico. Another frequently applied personal comparison was that to Marcelino Menéndez Pelayo: the two shared passion for Hispanic patrimony, massive erudition, reconstructive profile and Traditionalist leaning; Tejada’s approach is dubbed [...] "menéndezpelayismo".|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the 196 engine, this engine was originally designed by Nash and introduced in the 1941 Nash Ambassador 600 model. It featured only four main bearings, unlike the 7-main-bearing 234 flathead engine it replaced. It was a flathead design displacing [...] It was later enlarged to , and finally to [...] It was redesigned as an OHV engine in 1956. The flathead version was discontinued for 1956–1957, but reemerged in 1958 as the economy engine for the [...] "new" [...] Rambler American. When the engine was changed to an OHV configuration the water pump was moved from {{the left side of the}} engine (driven by a shaft extending from the back of the generator) to the front above the timing chain. When the flathead model was reintroduced it also received the new water pump. Equipped with such high quality parts <b>as</b> <b>forged</b> crankshafts and connecting rods, these engines earned a reputation for remarkable durability. The flathead, however, was prone to the typical flathead problem of overheating under sustained heavy load. This was from the hot exhaust traveling through the cylinder block to the exhaust manifold.|$|E

60|$|Any one {{who will}} {{consider}} the gospels, will {{see that there is}} a peculiar calm, a soberness and modesty about them, very different from what we should have expected to find in them. Speaking, as they do, of the grandest person who ever trod this earth, of the grandest events which ever happened upon this earth--of the events, indeed, which settled the future of this earth for ever,--one would not be surprised at their using grand words--the grandest they could find. If they had gone off into beautiful poetry; if they had filled pages with words of astonishment, admiration, delight; if they had told us their own thoughts and feelings at the sight of our Lord; if they had given us long and full descriptions of our Lord's face and figure, even (<b>as</b> <b>forged</b> documents have pretended to do) to the very colour of his hair, we should have thought it but natural.|$|E
6000|$|But Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and all {{the needy}} exiles, held a {{different}} point of view. Probabilities are as various as the faces to be seen at will in fretwork or paper-hangings: every form is there, from Jupiter to Judy, if you only look with creative inclination. To the poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since Peter had done nothing for them in his life, he would remember them at the last. Jonah argued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills, while Martha said that nobody need be surprised if he left the best part of his money to those who least expected it. Also {{it was not to be}} thought but that an own brother [...] "lying there" [...] with dropsy in his legs must come to feel that blood was thicker than water, and if he didn't alter his will, he might have money by him. At any rate some blood-relations should be on the premises and on the watch against those who were hardly relations at all. Such things had been known <b>as</b> <b>forged</b> wills and disputed wills, which seemed to have the golden-hazy advantage of somehow enabling non-legatees to live out of them. Again, those who were no blood-relations might be caught making away with things--and poor Peter [...] "lying there" [...] helpless! Somebody should be on the watch. But in this conclusion they were at one with Solomon and Jane; also, some nephews, nieces, and cousins, arguing with still greater subtilty as to what might be done by a man able to [...] "will away" [...] his property and give himself large treats of oddity, felt in a handsome sort of way that there was a family interest to be attended to, and thought of Stone Court as a place which it would be nothing but right for them to visit. Sister Martha, otherwise Mrs. Cranch, living with some wheeziness in the Chalky Flats, could not undertake the journey; but her son, as being poor Peter's own nephew, could represent her advantageously, and watch lest his uncle Jonah should make an unfair use of the improbable things which seemed likely to happen. In fact there was a general sense running in the Featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else, and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the Almighty was watching him.|$|E
