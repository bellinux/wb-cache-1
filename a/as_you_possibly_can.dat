500|$|Spotnitz wanted [...] "Deadalive" [...] {{to open in}} a {{way that}} would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He {{concluded}} that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that [...] "the death of the hero [...] was shocking enough", but that no one expected [...] "Deadalive" [...] to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, [...] "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E
2500|$|Provocations {{also took}} the form of fomenting racial strife. The Sherman Service Company, Inc., of Chicago sent {{instructions}} to an operative to [...] "stir up as much bad feeling <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> between the Serbians and the Italians... The Italians are going back to work. Call up every question you can in reference to racial hatred between these two nationalities." ...|$|E
60|$|For God's sake {{come here}} as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> The whole burden is thrown on me--and I am quite unequal to it.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Twill be {{diamond cut}} diamond, I doubt," [...] said Griffith, laughing; [...] "you will find him as acute at evasion, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> be at a cross- examination." ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{tell you}} how sorry I am to receive your bad account of your health, or how anxious I shall be to receive a better one <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> give it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want you}} to come to my room as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can,</b> child," [...] Berenice said. [...] "Shall I wait while you finish your game?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good. Now, {{one thing}} more. Don't get scared. Shoot quickly, but take as good an aim <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> If the deer is coming toward you, let him git putty close before you let drive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mind you now," [...] said Ham, [...] "I {{want you}} to make it just as disagreeable for that crowd <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> You can soak their {{firewood}} with water, hide their guns and provisions, and fix it so the snow will break in their roof--and things like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Caroline rapidly closed shutter and lattice. [...] "Do {{not fear}} that I shall not have breath to run <b>as</b> fast <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> run, Shirley. Take my hand. Let us go {{straight}} across the fields." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} over, Rajah," [...] he said, [...] "to {{tell you that}} Colonel Ochterlony {{requests}} that you will send every available fighting man to Delhi, at once. He prays <b>you</b> to despatch <b>as</b> many <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> gather together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've no inclination, Jasper lad, {{to trust}} {{yourself}} too near our neighbours the French," [...] observed Muir, who took that occasion to recommence the discourse. [...] "Well, well, your prudence {{will never be}} questioned by me, for I like the Canadas <b>as</b> little <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> like them yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To the other, I might say; 'you {{have been}} a {{careless}} boy to-day; you have not got your lessons well. Now take your seat, and copy this poetry. Do it carefully. Unless you take pains, and do it as well <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can,</b> I shall punish you severely, before you go home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, she's all ready," [...] said Jane. [...] "We must {{kiss her}} quiet brows and, Diana, you say, 'Sister, {{farewell}} forever,' and Ruby, you say, 'Farewell, sweet sister,' {{both of you}} as sorrowfully <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> Anne, for goodness sake smile a little. You know Elaine 'lay as though she smiled.' That's better. Now push the flat off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your foot!" [...] {{cried the}} Ork. [...] "why, you've {{only one to}} hurt you, while I have four. So I suffer {{four times as much}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> Here; hold the candle while I look at the bottoms of my claws. I declare," [...] he said, {{examining}} them by the flickering light, [...] "there are bunches of pain all over them!" ...|$|E
60|$|If {{you should}} ever be going up a hill, and should meet such a {{procession}} as {{that on the}} opposite page, coming down, I would recommend you to get just as far to one side <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> go. Bears, especially when {{there are so many}} of them together, are by no means pleasant companions in a walk.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Bounderby,' said James, dismounting, {{and giving}} his bridle to his servant, 'I do see it; and am <b>as</b> {{overcome}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> desire me to be, by the spectacle afforded to my mental view. Nevertheless, I may be allowed, I hope, to congratulate you - which I {{do with all}} my soul, I assure you - on your not having sustained a greater loss.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "A real-life {{description}} to {{me would}} be a rape victim, brutally raped, savaged. The girl was a virgin. She was religious. She planned on saving her virginity until she was married. She was brutalized and raped, sodomized <b>as</b> bad <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> make it, and is impregnated. I mean, that girl could be so messed up, physically and psychologically, that carrying that child could very well threaten her life." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{for my own}} business. As soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> do {{something}} respecting the abridgment of Tucker,[1] do so; you will, on my honour, be doing [...] "good", {{in the best sense}} of the word! Of course I cannot wish you to do anything till after the 24th, unless it should be [...] "put" [...] in your way to read that part of the letter to Phillips.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{think it}} will do," [...] mused Miss Sally. [...] "We'll make it do. There's such {{satisfaction}} getting as much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> out of a dollar, and {{twice as much as}} anybody else would get. I enjoy that sort of thing. This will be a game, and we'll play it with a right good will. But I do wish you would give the place a sensible name." ...|$|E
60|$|Come, fire {{up again}} on your fiction-mill {{and give us}} another good promise. And this time keep it--for it is your turn to be astonished. Come and stay as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> I invented a new {{copyright}} extension scheme last Friday, and sat up all night arranging its details. It will interest you. Yesterday I got it down on paper in as compact a form as I could. Harvey and I have examined the scheme, and to-morrow or next day he will send {{me a couple of}} copyright-experts to arrange about getting certain statistics for me.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was passing}} the grand stand, and, glancing up, I saw [...] "Mrs. Waller, twelve to one," [...] chalked on a bookmaker's board. Then it dawned upon me that [...] "Mrs. Waller" [...] was a horse, and, {{thinking}} further upon the matter, I evolved {{the idea that}} my friend's advice, expressed in more becoming language, was [...] "Back 'Mrs. Waller' for <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> afford." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which in {{the present}} case means nowhere," [...] he said. [...] "Do you mean to tell me, Millicent, that in this town there are not a hundred dressmakers, each of whom could turn you out a wedding dress and as many other {{garments}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> require {{in the course of a}} month, or even if that effort were too stupendous, that you could not divide the work among a dozen of them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{if it is}} {{necessary}} to speak to you at once, one of us will meet you in the passage between {{the bottom of the stairs}} and the room where the food is. If you see one of us, you will know that the matter is urgent, and <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> slip away, <b>you</b> must come here. In the evening you had better again look out from the door where you first met me.|$|R
60|$|But I must {{remember}} that my design in this paper {{was not so much}} to instruct you in your business either as a clergyman or a preacher, as to warn you against some mistakes which are obvious to the generality of mankind as well as to me; and we who are hearers, may be allowed to have some opportunities in the quality of being standers-by. Only perhaps I may now again transgress by desiring you to express the heads of your divisions in as few and clear words <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can,</b> otherwise, I and many thousand others {{will never be able to}} retain them, nor consequently to carry away a syllable of the sermon.|$|E
6000|$|DARLING LOUISA,--I {{can assure}} you that I am no more likely than [...] {{yourself}} to form another attachment, as you will perceive by what [...] follows. Before we left town I thought that {{to be able to see}} you [...] occasionally was sufficient for happiness, but down in this lonely [...] place the case is different. In short, my dear, I ask you to consent [...] to a union with me as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> Your prettiness has [...] won my eyes and lips completely, sweet, and I lie awake at night to [...] think of the golden curls you allowed to escape from their confinement [...] on those nice times of private clothes, when we walked in the park and [...] slipped the bonds of service, which you were never born to any more [...] than I. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|As I {{was in a}} {{great concern}} at his making his will unknown to me, and before we were friends, I thought of it in too serious a manner not to speak about it. I {{did not know where}} to apply first, but after mature {{consideration}} sent for the chaplain, and he coming to me, I desired he would give me the best intelligence he could about it. [...] "My lady," [...] said he, [...] "you cannot be so unacquainted with the duty of my function, and the trust my lord has reposed in me, but you must know I shall go beyond my trust in relating anything of that nature to you; all that I can say on that head is, that I would have you make friends with my lord as soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can,</b> and get him to make another will, or else take the best care of yourself as lies in your power; for, I assure you, if his lordship dies, you are but poorly provided for." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wood. I {{shall never}} make you amends for this kindness, my dear Padron. But {{would it not}} be better, if you would take the pains to run after Limberham, and stop him in his way ere he reach the place where he thinks he left his mistress; then hold him in {{discourse}} <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> till you guess your wife may be returned, that so they may appear together? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her difficulty," [...] Strether returned, [...] "has been {{simply that}} she finds she's afraid of you. She's {{not afraid of}} ME, Sarah, one little scrap; {{and it was just}} because she has seen how I can fidget when I give my mind to it that she has felt her best chance, rightly enough to be in making me as uneasy as possible. I think she's at bottom as pleased to HAVE you put it on me <b>as</b> <b>you</b> {{yourself}} <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> be to put it." ...|$|R
5000|$|..... just {{still to}} this day. Like, I mean, just because, for me, skateboarding was never about just progression; it was about, like, the individual, and the person, {{and what they}} brought to, to skateboarding. Not many skaters could have a career {{as long as he}} has and still {{maintain}} that idea, you know? Like, still, he is skateboarding; that is, everything, is Mark—it's freedom; it's not caring about anything; it's about going on your board and enjoying yourself; pushing yourself physically, mentally, and having as much fun <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> have. That's what skateboarding is and that's what Mark is.|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless you, Miles," [...] {{returned}} the mate, who could presume to be familiar, again, now we had walked so far aft {{as not to}} have any listeners; [...] "call me Moses as often <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can,</b> for it's little I hear of that pleasant sound now. Mother will dub me Oloff, and little Kitty calls me nothing but uncle. After all, I have a bulrush feelin' about me, and Moses will always seem the most nat'ral. As for the mutual principle, it is just this; I'm to show mother the Dawn, {{one or two of the}} markets--for, would you believe it, the dear old soul never saw a market and is dying to visit one, and so I shall take her to see the Bear first, and the Oswego next, and the Fly last, though she cries out ag'in a market that is much visited by flies. Then I must introduce her to one of the Dutch churches;--after that 't will go hard with me, but I get the dear soul into the theatre; and they tell me there is a lion, up town, that will roar as loud as a bull. That she must see, of course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our {{officers}} are beastly good chaps, {{nearly all of}} them. That's where the perplexity {{of the whole thing}} comes in. If only they weren't such good chaps! If only they were like the Prussian officers to their men, then we'd just take on a revolution as well as the war, and make everything tidy at once. But they are decent, they are charming.... Only they do not think hard, and they do not understand that doing a job properly means doing it as directly and thought-outly <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> They won't worry about things. If their tempers were worse perhaps their work might be better. They won't use maps or timetables or books of reference. When we move to a new place they pick up what they can about it by hearsay; not one of our lot has the gumption to possess a contoured map or a Michelin guide. They have hearsay minds. They are fussy and petty and wasteful--and, in the way of getting things done, pretentious. By their code they're paragons of honour. Courage--they're all right about that; no end of it; honesty, truthfulness, and so on--high. They have a kind of horsey standard of smartness and pluck, too, that isn't bad, and they have a fine horror of whiskers and being unbuttoned. But the mistake they make is to class thinking with whiskers, as a sort of fussy sidegrowth. Instead of classing it with unbuttonedupness. They hate economy. And preparation....|$|E
6000|$|... 116. Thirdly. When {{you have}} neither time for careful study nor for Düreresque detail, sketch the outline with pencil, then dash {{in the shadows}} with the brush boldly, trying {{to do as much}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> at once, and to get a habit of {{expedition}} and decision; laying more color again and again into the tints as they dry, using every expedient which your practice has suggested to you of carrying out your chiaroscuro in the manageable and moist material, taking the color off here with the dry brush, scratching out lights in it there with the wooden handle of the brush, rubbing it in with your fingers, drying it off with your sponge, etc. Then, when the color is in, take your pen and mark the outline characters vigorously, in the manner of the Liber Studiorum. This kind of study is very convenient for carrying away pieces of effect which depend not so much on refinement as on complexity, strange shapes of involved shadows, sudden effects of sky, etc.; and it is most useful as a safeguard against any too servile or slow habits which the minute copying may induce in you; for although the endeavor to obtain velocity merely for velocity's sake, and dash for display's sake, is as baneful as it is despicable; there are a velocity and a dash which not only are compatible with perfect drawing, but obtain certain results which cannot be had otherwise. And it is perfectly safe for you to study occasionally for speed and decision, while your continual course of practice is such as to insure your retaining an accurate judgment and a tender touch. Speed, under such circumstances, is rather fatiguing than tempting; and you will find yourself always beguiled rather into elaboration than negligence.|$|E
6000|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the winter}} Cowles remarked to me that he {{intended}} to marry Miss Northcott as soon as possible--probably some time in the spring. He was, as I have already remarked, fairly well off, and the young lady had some money of her own, so that there was no pecuniary reason for a long engagement. [...] "We {{are going to take a}} little house out at Corstorphine," [...] he said, [...] "and we hope to see your face at our table, Bob, <b>as</b> often <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> come."

6000|$|DEAR GIRLS: I am {{so sorry}} to {{disappoint}} you, but I cannot help [...] it.

Your [...] uncle and I must go to Streatham immediately and are leaving [...] on the eight o'clock express. I know you have started before [...] this, so there is no use in telegraphing. We want you to go [...] right to the house and make yourself at home. You will find [...] the key under the kitchen doorstep, and the dinner in the [...] pantry all ready to cook. There are two mince pies on the [...] third shelf, and the plum pudding only needs to be warmed up. [...] You will find a little Christmas remembrance for each of you [...] on the dining-room table. I hope <b>you</b> will make <b>as</b> merry <b>as</b> <b>you</b> [...] <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> and we will have <b>you</b> down again <b>as</b> soon as we [...] come back.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of an {{experiment}} I might try, which would illustrate to you a very important subject. Suppose I should call one of the boys, A., to me, and should say to him; 'I {{want you to go}} to your seat and transcribe for me a piece of poetry, <b>as</b> handsomely <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can. If it is written <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>possibly</b> write it, I will give you 25 cents.' Suppose I say this to him privately, so that none {{of the rest of the}} boys can hear, and he goes to take his seat, and begins to work. You perceive that I have presented to him a motive to exertion." ...|$|R
