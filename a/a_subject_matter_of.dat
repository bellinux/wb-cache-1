It {{can be anything}} thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as Prince Hamlet. All of those are special or partial objects.

2500|$|Redford did not direct {{again until}} The Milagro Beanfield War (1988), a well-crafted, though not commercially successful, screen version of John Nichols' {{acclaimed}} {{novel of the}} Southwest. The Milagro Beanfield War {{is the story of}} the people of Milagro, New Mexico (based on the real town of Truchas in northern New Mexico), overcoming big developers who set about to ruin their community and force them out because of tax increases. [...] Other directorial projects have included the period drama A River Runs Through It (1992), based on Norman Maclean's novella, and the exposé Quiz Show (1994), about the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s. In the latter film, Redford worked from a screenplay by Paul Attanasio with noted cinematographer Michael Ballhaus and a strong cast that featured Paul Scofield, John Turturro, Rob Morrow, and Ralph Fiennes. Redford handpicked Morrow for his part in the film (Morrow's only high-profile feature film role to date), because he liked his work on Northern Exposure. [...] Redford also directed Matt Damon and Will Smith in The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000). In 2010, Redford released The Conspirator, a period drama revolving around the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Despite <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> personal interest to Redford, the film received mixed reviews and proved to be a flop at the box office.|$|E

Every one in the room understood the exact position in which each stood to the other. That Rebecca would willingly have become Anton's wife, that she had refused various offers of marriage in order that ultimately it might be so, was known to Stephen Trendellsohn, and to Anton himself, and to Ruth Jacobi. There had not been the pretence of any secret among them in the matter. But the subject was one which could hardly be discussed by them openly. [...] "Father," [...] said Anton, after a while, during which the black thunder-cloud which had for an instant settled on his brow had managed to dispel itself without bursting into a visible storm--"father, I am neither ashamed to think of my intended marriage nor to speak of it. There is no question of shame. But it is unpleasant to make such <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> general conversation when it is a source of trouble instead of joy among us.

[65] The {{territorial}} possessions in the East Indies {{were acquired}} to the Company, in virtue of {{grants from the}} Great Mogul, {{in the nature of}} offices and jurisdictions, to be held under him, and dependent upon his crown, with the express condition of being obedient to orders from his court, and of paying an annual tribute to his treasury. It is true that no obedience is yielded to these orders, and for some time past there has been no payment made of this tribute. But it is under a grant so conditioned that they still hold. To subject the King of Great Britain as tributary to a foreign power by the acts of his subjects; to suppose the grant valid, and yet the condition void; to suppose it good for the king, and insufficient for the Company; to suppose it an interest divisible between the parties: these are some few of the many legal difficulties to be surmounted, before the Common Law of England can acknowledge the East India Company's Asiatic affairs to be <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> prerogative, so as to bring it within the verge of English jurisprudence. It is a very anomalous species of power and property which is held by the East India Company. Our English prerogative law does not furnish principles, much less precedents, by which it can be defined or adjusted. Nothing but the eminent dominion of Parliament over every British subject, in every concern, and in every circumstance in which he is placed, can adjust this new, intricate matter. Parliament may act wisely or unwisely, justly or unjustly; but Parliament alone is competent to it.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{traditionally}} believed {{that at this}} point, after {{the decline of the}} Pala dynasty, a Hindu king, Adisura brought in five Brahmins and their five attendants from Kanauj, his purpose being to provide education for the Brahmins already in the area whom he thought to be ignorant, and revive traditional orthodox Brahminical Hinduism. Multiple accounts of this legend exist, and historians generally consider this to be nothing more than myth or folklore lacking historical authenticity. Likewise, the original varna status of the five attendants, accompanying the Brahmins, according to the legend, is also <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> debate. Majority of sources mention them as Shudra servants, many others refer to them as Kayastha attendants, and very few as Aryan Kshatriya consorts. The tradition continues by saying that these incomers settled and each became the founder of a clan. In the case of the five attendants, each clan was of the Kayastha caste, and these founders are sometimes referred to as the five legendary Kayasthas. According to Swarupa Gupta, [...] "this legend was fitted into a quasi-historical, sociological narrative of Bengal and deployed to explain the realities of caste and sub-caste origins and connections during {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth century".|$|E

5000|$|Another {{basis for}} {{preemption}} would be whether [...] "the {{nature of the}} subject matter, namely, the maturity of avocados, or any explicit declaration of congressional design to displace state regulation require § 792 to yield to the federal marketing orders." [...] The Court said {{this is not a}} subject requiring national uniformity. On the contrary, as a regulation of food, [...] "the maturity of avocados is <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> the kind this Court has traditionally regarded as properly within the scope of state superintendence," [...] because it is regarded as a matter of [...] "peculiarly local concern." [...] The majority distinguished between pre- and post-commerce federal regulation; it said that regulation of standards of the picking, processing, and transportation of agricultural commodities in commerce as properly a field of comprehensive federal regulation, but it should not displace [...] "state control over the distribution and retail sale of those commodities {{in the interests of the}} consumers of the commodities within the State." [...] Thus a state such as Florida could not prohibit exportation in commerce of federally certified avocados, but another state such as California may regulate their marketing in that state. At least: [...] "Such a displacement may not be inferred automatically from the fact that Congress has regulated production and packing of commodities for the interstate market." [...] The Court found it immaterial that this was an economic rather than health and safety measure: [...] "neither logic nor precedent invites any distinction between state regulations designed to keep unhealthful or unsafe commodities off the grocer's shelves and those designed to prevent the deception of consumers." ...|$|E

The poster released on 3 October 2014 portrayed a young boy, barely in his teens, ogling at the near bare mid-riff of a sari-clad woman. Women’s organisations began spitting fire at the director the moment the news of the poster became public and his effigy was burnt in Guntur. The poster also drew severe criticism from the moral police and on social media. The State Child Rights Protection Commission took suo motu recognition of the matter opining that the poster involving a child was vulgar and is a violation of child rights and also held that violating child rights by involving children in any obscene or vulgar scenes or picturisation is a crime under Section 292 sub-clauses (I) and (II) of the IPC and punishable with imprisonment of five years or more. The Commission for the Protection of Child Rights issued notices to the Police Commissioner to prevent display of the poster, and the Censor Board and the director seeking an explanation.|$|E
