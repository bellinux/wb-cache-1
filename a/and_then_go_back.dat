25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} the non-radiative transition between 3E and 1A {{is that it is}} stronger for ms = ±1 and weaker for ms = 0. This property results in a very useful manipulation of N-V center, which is called optical spin-polarization. First, an off-resonance excitation which has a higher frequency (typically 2.32 eV (532nbsp&nm)) than the frequencies of all transitions and thus lays in the vibronic bands for all transitions. By using a pulse of this wavelength, people can excite all spin states and create phonons as well. For a spin state with ms = 0, due to conservation of spin in transition, it will be excited to the corresponding ms = 0 state in 3E <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to original state. However, for a spin state with ms = ±1 in 3A, after the excitation, it has a relatively high probability to jump to the intermediate state 1A by non-radiative transition and go to the ground state with ms = 0. After sufficient cycles, the state of the N-V center can be regarded as in the ms = 0 state. Such a process can be used in the initialization of quantum state in quantum information processing.|$|E

25|$|According to Appian, in 60 BC Caesar {{came back}} from his {{governorship}} in Hispania (Spain and Portugal) and was awarded a triumph for his victories there. He was making preparations to celebrate this outside the city walls. He also {{wanted to be a}} candidate for the consulship for 59 BC. However, the candidates had to present themselves in the city and it was not legal for those who were preparing a triumph to enter the city <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> out for these preparations. Since he was not ready yet, Caesar asked to be allowed to register in absentia and to have someone to act on his behalf, even though this was contrary to the law. Cato the Younger, who was against this, used up {{the last day of the}} presentation with speeches. Caesar dropped the triumph, entered the city and presented his candidacy. Pompey had failed to get the acts for his settlements he made in the east during the Third Mithridatic War ratified by the senate. Most senators opposed this because they were envious, particularly Lucius Licinius Lucullus who had been replaced in the command of this war by Pompey. Crassus had co-operated with Lucullus in this matter. An aggrieved Pompey ‘made friends with Caesar and promised under oath to support him for the consulship'. Caesar then brought Crassus into friendly relations with Pompey and ‘these three most powerful men pooled their interests.’ Appian also noted that Marcus Terentius Varro wrote a book about this alliance called Tricaranus (the three-headed monster). Appian's version and Plutarch's Life of Pompey are the only sources that have Pompey seeking an alliance with Caesar, rather than the other way round.|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} studio {{version of}} [...] "What Is Life" [...] – in fact, a rough {{mix of the}} original backing track with different orchestration (in this case, piccolo trumpet and oboe) – was issued as one of five bonus tracks on the 2001 remaster of All Things Must Pass. In the accompanying booklet, Harrison writes that this orchestral arrangement was discarded because he [...] "didn't like the feel". Speaking to Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White in December 2000, Harrison explained {{the reason for the}} lack of a guide vocal on this version: [...] "I'm playing the fuzz guitar part that goes all through the song. So all I could do on the [...] take was to give the band the cue line – the first line of each verse – <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to playing that riff. So that rough mix without the vocal – I'd forgot all about it …" [...] The track also appears on the 2014 Apple Years 1968–75 reissue of All Things Must Pass.|$|E

Rather than use the time to rest, lead vocalist Bono and guitarist The Edge were keen to record new material. Following a hectic year of touring, the two {{did not want to}} settle back into domestic life. Bono said, [...] "We thought we could live a normal life <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> on the road [...] But it turns out that your whole way of thinking, your whole body has been geared toward the madness of Zoo TV... So we decided to put the madness on a record. Everybody's head was spinning, so we thought, why not keep that momentum going...?" [...] The Edge also wished to distract himself from the emotions he was feeling after separating from his wife during the Achtung Baby sessions in 1991. The other members, bassist Adam Clayton and drummer Larry Mullen, Jr., ultimately agreed to join them for recording.|$|E

500|$|When Levi {{was first}} {{cast as the}} voice of Flynn, the {{character}} had been scripted as a British farmer at the time, requiring Levi to voice him with a British accent until Flynn was eventually developed into a bandit with an American accent. Although Flynn and Rapunzel share several scenes together during the film, Levi and singer Mandy Moore, his co-star who provides the voice of Rapunzel, recorded virtually none of their dialogue together due to scheduling conflicts, which Levi cited as one of the challenges he endured while working on the film, in addition to having to star in the television series Chuck simultaneously. Levi's starring role on Chuck required the actor to constantly [...] "shed a character and take on another character and shed that character <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to something else". However, Levi and Moore did meet on one occasion to record their romantic duet [...] "I See the Light", Levi was not intimidated by the thought of recording the song, describing the experience as [...] "an added bonus". However, he admitted to having been nervous to sing with Moore, a professional singer, and working with composer Alan Menken. Although the actor identifies himself as [...] "no stranger to singing" [...] due to his background in musical theatre, Levi's performance of [...] "I See the Light" [...] is considered to be his [...] "big singing debut" [...] because it was his first time recording a song professionally.|$|E
500|$|The press heard rumours about Lennon's {{wife and}} child {{at the end of}} 1963—after Beatlemania had already swept the UK and Europe—and descended on her mother's house in Hoylake (where mother and son were staying), in November and December. Friends and {{neighbours}} protected their anonymity, but she was often approached by journalists. In November she had her son christened at the Hoylake parish church, but didn't tell Lennon (who was on tour at the time), because she feared a media circus. She told him two days after, and he was angry as he hadn't wanted his son to be christened, even though Epstein had asked to be Julian's godfather. Not long after the christening, every newspaper was full of the story about Lennon's secret wife and baby boy. Epstein told the other Beatles {{to make the best of}} the situation, and hoped newspapers would not say Cynthia was pregnant before marrying him. [...] After living at Lennon's aunt's house for some months, the couple [...] moved to London and found a three-bedroomed flat at 13 Emperor's Gate, off Cromwell Road. The top floor flat was the third of three, which were each built over two floors. This meant climbing six flights of stairs, as the building had no lift. Cynthia firstly had to carry Julian up to the flat, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> down to collect shopping bags. The Beatles' fans soon found out where they were living, and she would find them camping out in the hallway, and have to push through them when leaving or arriving.|$|E
500|$|After Rachel and Ross drunkenly {{get married}} while on {{vacation}} in Las Vegas during season five, Schwimmer had initially objected {{to the idea of}} having his character Ross divorce her– his third divorce– because he felt that it was taking it [...] "too far." [...] The actor explained that [...] "The whole arc of the relationship was weird then ... because for [...] {{to be able to move}} on enough to marry someone else <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to being in love with Rachel later just went a bit too far." [...] Rachel and Joey's romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay Ross and Rachel's reunion further. Crane felt that pairing Rachel and Joey during season ten [...] "was for the greater good" [...] because [...] "It was inappropriate." [...] However, the cast initially protested the idea, fearing that Rachel, Joey, and Ross would ultimately become unlikeable characters and audiences would either [...] "resent Joey for going after a pregnant woman, or resent Rachel for rejecting him, or resent Ross for standing between the two of them." [...] Meanwhile, the writers also approached the concept of Rachel's pregnancy and baby tentatively, worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want Friends [...] "to become a show about a baby" [...] while [...] "On the other hand, we don't want to pretend that there isn't one." [...] According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, the critical success and popularity of Rachel's pregnancy is ultimately responsible for [...] "propel the show to the top of the ratings". When it finally came time to write the series finale, [...] "The only thing [...] absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get Ross and Rachel together," [...] deciding, [...] "We had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their 'will they or won’t they,' and we didn’t see any advantage in frustrating them" [...] any longer. However, at one point the writers had deliberated ending the series with Ross and Rachel in [...] "a gray area of where they aren’t together, but we hint there’s a sense that they might be down the road." [...] Ultimately, Crane and Kauffman relented in favor of giving the audience what they want.|$|E

2500|$|Since 2004 a US subsidy {{has been}} paid to {{companies}} that blend biofuel and regular fuel. [...] The European biofuel subsidy is paid at the point of sale. [...] Companies import biofuel to the US, blend 1% or even 0.1% regular fuel, and then ship the blended fuel to Europe, where it can get a second subsidy. [...] These blends are called B99 or B99.9 fuel. [...] The practice is called [...] "splash and dash". [...] The imported fuel may even come from Europe to the US, get 0.1% regular fuel, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Europe.

There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|Achill Archaeological Field School {{is based}} at the Achill Archaeology Centre in Dooagh, which {{has served as a}} {{catalyst}} for a wide array of archaeological investigations on the island. It was founded in 1991 and is a training school for students of archaeology and anthropology. Since 1991, several thousand students from 21 countries have come to Achill to study and participate in ongoing excavations. The school is involved in a study of the prehistoric and historic landscape at Slievemore, incorporating a research excavation at a number of sites within the deserted village of Slievemore. Slievemore is rich in archaeological monuments that span a 5,000 year period from the Neolithic to the Post Medieval. Recent archaeological [...] research suggests the village was occupied year-round at least as early as the 19th century, though it is known to have served as a seasonally occupied booley village by {{the first half of the}} 20th century. A booley village (a number of which exist in a ruined state on the island) is a village occupied only during part of the year, such as a resort community, a lake community, or (as the case on Achill) a place to live while tending flocks or herds of ruminants during winter or summer pasturing. Specifically, some of the people of Dooagh and Pollagh would migrate in the summer to Slievemore <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Dooagh in the autumn. The summer 2009 field school excavated Round House 2 on Slievemore Mountain under the direction of archaeologist Stuart Rathbone.

2500|$|Production for {{the episode}} started {{after the first}} run of the series' fourth season, which {{consisted}} of four episodes. At {{the beginning of the}} second run of six episodes (which started broadcasting in June 2000), the episode was assigned a production code number of 405 (meaning the 5th episode of the 4th season), and it was planned to air in June or July that year. However, given the complicated nature of the episode's look, where a lot of things had to be designed from scratch, the studio did not have enough time to finish the episode that summer, and it was moved to the next batch of episodes. As it was already in production before the run, [...] "Pip" [...] was a [...] "banked" [...] episode of South Park, one of the first in the series' history. Whereas most episodes of South Park are done within a week, from scratch, the creators sometimes try to have one episode [...] "in the bank" [...] – meaning that they have [...] "at least half-start" [...] animating it. This way they can take off a few days at one point during the two-month-long, demanding run, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and finish work on the banked show. After finishing the previous episode, [...] "Helen Keller! The Musical", which aired on November 22, 2000, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving (November 23), the creators went to spend time with their families for the holiday, and then came back on Sunday, November 26, to finish [...] "Pip". The episode aired the next Wednesday, on November 29, 2000 on Comedy Central in the United States, as the 14th episode of the season, and the fourth episode of the winter run. Since its original airing, it has been re-run infrequently on Comedy Central.|$|E
