5|$|On 23 March 2013, BBC {{released}} a short prequel video to the episode, written by Steven Moffat. In the prequel, the Doctor {{is sitting at}} the swings of a children's playground when he meets a little girl. They talk about losing things, and the Doctor states that he has lost someone twice and he hopes {{he might be able}} to find her again. The girl tells him that, when she loses something, she goes to a quiet place for a think, and then can remember where she put it. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> leaves, it is revealed that she is Clara Oswald.|$|E
5|$|While the {{original}} game had {{black and white}} graphics in a style similar to The Legend of Zelda, Sword of Manas Game Boy Advance graphics were made similar to the third game in the series, the Super Famicom game Seiken Densetsu 3.

5|$|Musical accompaniment for {{the silent}} films were not {{provided}} by the studios, and the Thanhouser productions were no exception. The musical program for the screenings were decided and played by the individual accompanists. At times, musical accompaniments were shared in trade journals and the musical accompaniment for Adrift was provided by an unnamed writer from Oklahoma in The Moving Picture World. The suggestion was {{to begin with a}} waltz until the friend pats the artist on the shoulder, when All I Get is Sympathy is played. The suggestion for I Don't Know Where I'm Going completes the scene and Life's A Funny Proposition follows the artist packing up until the artist pulls out the gun. A soft hurry follows <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>girl</b> confronts her father, leading to a crescendo at the climax.|$|E

Sean Penn stated in an interview having been second choice for the role. Hanks revealed that he signed onto the film after {{an hour and a half}} of reading the script. He initially wanted to ease Forrest's pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by director Robert Zemeckis to portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel.

25|$|In 2001, the song's {{copyright}} owners (heirs {{of their}} composer fathers) sued Pinheiro {{for using the}} title of the song as the name of her boutique (Garota de Ipanema). In their complaint, they stated that her status <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Girl</b> from Ipanema (Garota de Ipanema) did not entitle her to use a name that legally belonged to them. Public support was strongly in favor of Pinheiro. A press release by Jobim and Moraes, the composers, in which they had named Pinheiro as the real Girl from Ipanema (Garota de Ipanema) was used as evidence that they had intended to bestow this title on her. The court ruled in favor of Pinheiro.|$|E
