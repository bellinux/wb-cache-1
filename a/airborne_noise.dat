Noise from cooling fans, or the HVAC, alternator, and other engine accessories is also fairly common. Many problems are generated as either vibration or noise, transmitted via a variety of paths, and then radiated acoustically into the cabin. These are classified as [...] "structure-borne" [...] noise. Others are generated acoustically and propagated by airborne paths.

40|$|Aero and Vibroacoustics of Automotive Turbochargers {{is a topic}} {{involving}} aspects {{from the}} working fields of thermodynamics of turbomachinery, aerodynamics, rotordynamics, and noise propagation computation.   In this broadly interdisciplinary subject, thermodynamics of turbomachinery is used to design the turbocharger and to determine its operating conditions.  Aerodynamics is needed to study the compressor flow dynamics and flow instabilities of rotating stall and surge, which can produce growling and whining-type noises. Rotordynamics is necessary to study rotor unbalance and self-excited oil-whirl instabilities, which lead to whistling and constant tone-type noises in rotating floating oil-film type bearings. For the special case of turbochargers using ball bearings, some high-order harmonic and wear noises also manifest in the rotor operating range. Lastly, noise propagation computation, based on Lighthill’s analogy, is required to investigate <b>airborne</b> <b>noises</b> produced by turbochargers in passenger vehicles.

On a moving platform, the acceleration disturbance measured by the two accelerometers is the same so that when forming the difference, it cancels in the gravity gradient measurement.

40|$|The {{sources and}} paths by which noise enters the cabin {{of a small}} single engine {{aircraft}} were determined {{through a combination of}} flight and laboratory tests.

For the propeller, the primary airborne paths were through the firewall, windshield and roof. For the engine, the most important airborne path was through the firewall. Exhaust noise was found to enter the cabin primarily through the panels {{in the vicinity of the}} exhaust outlet although exhaust noise entering the cabin through the firewall is a distinct possibility.

A pin-on-disc rig was employed to study the role of noise parameters on the evolution of the wear area. When a pin slides on the disc, the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> is generated and subsequently a sound signal is obtained. These signals, for various sets of experiments, were recorded using a digital microphone. A Matlab code was developed and employed to estimate the noise parameters from the recorded sound.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reduction of agricultural tractor cabs. The characteristics of the noise radiated from a non-cab-equipped tractor have been evaluated and used in conjunction with the classical theories of airborne sound transmission loss to predict the <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reductions of tractor cabs. An experimental cab has beep constructed and used to evaluate these predictions. The theoretical and experimental <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reductions do not show a good agreement. This {{has been shown to be}} due to two ressons. Firstly, there are anomalies in the classical airborne sound transmission loss theory whereby the theoretical and experimental sound transmission loss spectra do not show good agreement. Secondly, one-dimensional standing wave resonances in the cab cavity have been shown to give rise to an irregular plateau in the experimental <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> reduction spectra. Anomalies have been shown to exist between airborne sound transmission loss theory and reverberant room transmission loss measurements. These have arisen because the theory has not hitherto considered panel flexure. Modifications have been introduced which take account of panel flexure and these show that the dependence of classical theory on the angle of incident excitation is false and angular dependence occurs on the transmitted side of the panel, giving rise to a coincidence effect on the transmitted side which is independent of the angle of incidence. These modifications give rise to complete qualitative explanation of the shape of empirical airborne sound transmission loss spectra. Quantitative modifications have not been introduced because of lack of information regarding the angular nature of the transmitted waves...|$|E

The stringers appeared to raise the cylinder transmission loss in the mass-controlled region, although they produced dips at the stringer resonances. The ring-frequency dip in transmission loss, which is characteristic of monocoque shells, was found to still be present. There appeared to be a small increase in transmission loss as the number of stringers was increased. The effect of high damping was also investigated...|$|E

40|$|Noise {{pollution}} {{is an important}} part of the environmental impact of ships. The noise inside the vessel (affecting crew and passengers) has been regulated since a few decades, while the impact of emissions in water on the marine fauna has been under consideration at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) only in the last few years. No specific effort seems to be in place towards a regulatory framework for external <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> emissions from sea going commercial ships. Only the particular cases of inland vessels and pleasure crafts are partially covered by rules.

This suggests that significantly reduced noise sensitivity of a practical free-standing pyroelectric detector can be achieved by paying careful attention to the mounting conditions. We also derive the strains for the case of the trigonal 3 m class within the framework developed for the thin-plate approximation, and show that the result is unchanged.

Green roofs {{have been shown to}} benefit sustainable initiatives by reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere both onsite and offsite, mitigating storm water runoff volume and pollutants, lessening <b>airborne</b> and <b>noise</b> pollutants, and creating wildlife corridors. Economically, the long-term savings they promote quickly offset the initial short-term costs that come from installation of green roofs. Green roofs are projected to have double the service life of traditional roofs, and lower electricity costs substantially by insulating and cooling buildings, thus reducing energy loads.

40|$|The Acoustical Theory for Design of Aircraft Cabins (ATDAC) is a {{computer}} program developed to predict interior noise levels inside aircraft and to evaluate the effects of different aircraft configurations on the aircraft acoustical environment. The primary motivation for development of this program is the special interior noise problems associated with advanced turboprop (ATP) aircraft {{where there is a}} tonal, low frequency noise problem. Prediction of interior noise levels requires knowledge of the energy sources, the transmission paths, and the relationship between the energy variable and the sound pressure level.

The expected levels of propeller wake/vortex-induced structure-borne noise transmission are not known nor can they be determined with present-day technology. A test apparatus has been designed, built and calibrated {{for the purposes of}} studying propeller-induced, structure-borne noise transmission in prototypical aircraft structures. The principal approach to the test apparatus design was to provide a physical means of separating the airborne and structure-borne noise components so that the structure-borne noise transmission response could be studied directly without <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> contamination.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the impact of <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> emitted by {{commercial}} ships moored at quay is gaining attention by Regulatory Bodies. The question is often raised by citizens sending complaints to the municipalities of port cities in which the harbour is located inside the town. The problem may be even more important in the case of pleasure crafts accessing protected areas and mooring there. Limit levels for <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> emissions started therefore to be fixed in normative as well as contract requirements. In the light of what above, an effective measurement procedure to characterise the noise emissions from ships and compare them to limits plays an important role. The procedure needs to take into account aspects linked to the ship source characteristics (dimensions, complexity, directivity) as well as related to the surrounding environment, which is often represented by the shipyard where the ship is built. The latter aspect includes the presence of obstacles and reflecting surfaces around the ship, as well as significant components of background noise. The paper recalls the background of a measurement procedure that was defined within the project SILENV of the 7 th Framework Programme specifically for the purpose of the characterisation of ships as <b>airborne</b> <b>noise</b> sources and reports a trial application of this procedure to a ship moored at a yard quay.

40|$|In this study, we {{assessed}} the mixed exposure of highway maintenance workers to <b>airborne</b> particles, <b>noise,</b> and gaseous co-pollutants. The {{aim was to}} provide {{a better understanding of the}} workers' exposure to facilitate the evaluation of short-term effects on cardiovascular health endpoints. To quantify the workers' exposure, we monitored 18 subjects during 50 non-consecutive work shifts. Exposure assessment was based on personal and work site measurements and included fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), particle number concentration (PNC), noise (Leq), and the gaseous co-pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Mean work shift PM 2. 5 concentrations (gravimetric measurements) ranged from 20. 3 to 321 μg m− 3 (mean 62 μg m− 3) and PNC were between 1. 6 × 104 and 4. 1 × 105 particles cm− 3 (8. 9 × 104 particles cm− 3). Noise levels were generally high with Leq over work shifts from 73. 3 to 96. 0 dB(A); the averaged Leq over all work shifts was 87. 2 dB(A). The highest exposure to fine and ultrafine particles was measured during grass mowing and lumbering when motorized brush cutters and chain saws were used. Highest noise levels, caused by pneumatic hammers, were measured during paving and guardrail repair. We found moderate Spearman correlations between PNC and PM 2. 5 (r = 0. 56); PNC, PM 2. 5, and CO (r = 0. 60 and r = 0. 50) as well as PNC and noise (r = 0. 50). Variability and correlation of parameters were influenced by work activities that included equipment causing combined air pollutant and noise emissions (e. g. brush cutters and chain saws). We conclude that highway maintenance workers are frequently exposed to elevated <b>airborne</b> particle and <b>noise</b> levels compared with the average population.

While underwater noise levels were shown to be harmful for the marine biology, the propagation of <b>airborne</b> piling <b>noise</b> over sea has not been studied in detail before. In this study, detailed numerical calculations have been performed with the Green's Function Parabolic Equation (GFPE) method to estimate noise levels up to a distance of 10 km. Measured noise emission levels during piling of pinpiles for a jacket-foundation wind turbine were assessed and used together with combinations of the sea surface state and idealized vertical sound speed profiles (downwind sound propagation). Effective impedances were found and used to represent non-flat sea surfaces at low-wind sea states 2, 3, and 4. Calculations show that scattering by a rough sea surface, which decreases sound pressure levels, exceeds refractive effects, which increase sound pressure levels under downwind conditions. This suggests that the presence of wind, even when blowing downwind to potential receivers, is beneficial to increase the attenuation of piling sound over the sea.
