5|$|Recommended therapies for {{first-line}} use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics. Procedures such {{as light}} therapy and laser therapy {{are not considered}} to be first-line treatments and typically have an <b>adjunctive</b> role due to their high cost and limited evidence of efficacy. Medications for acne work by targeting the early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; improvement in the appearance of acne is typically expected between six and eight weeks after starting therapy.|$|E
5|$|Within the osteopathic medical curriculum, {{manipulative}} {{treatment is}} taught as an <b>adjunctive</b> measure to other biomedical interventions {{for a number}} of disorders and diseases. However, a 2001 survey of osteopathic physicians found that more than 50% of the respondents used OMT on less than 5% of their patients. The survey follows many indicators that osteopathic physicians have become more like M.D. physicians in every respect —few perform OMT, and most prescribe medications or suggest surgery as the first line of treatment.|$|E
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who do {{not feel}} well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request <b>adjunctive</b> treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety of this approach and to counter its indiscriminate use.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an <b>adjunctive</b> (additional) treatment {{in children with}} drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E
25|$|Zonisamide is {{approved}} in the United States, and United Kingdom for <b>adjunctive</b> treatment of partial seizures in adults and Japan for both <b>adjunctive</b> and monotherapy for partial seizures (simple, complex, secondarily generalized), generalized (tonic, tonic-clonic (grand mal), and atypical absence) and combined seizures. In Australia it is marketed as both an <b>adjunctive</b> therapy and monotherapy for partial seizures only.|$|E
25|$|Glaucoma {{is caused}} by high intra-ocular {{pressure}} (IOP). β-blockers reduce IOP and {{are the most common}} therapy. Most of the patients, who use the topical β-blockers, need <b>adjunctive</b> therapy to achieve a target IOP lowering. One of the most used drug in <b>adjunctive</b> therapy is dorzolamide.|$|E

25|$|The {{daily dose}} of {{reserpine}} in antihypertensive treatment is as low as 0.1 to 0.25mg. The use of reserpine as an antipsychotic drug had been nearly completely abandoned, but more recently it made a comeback as <b>adjunctive</b> treatment, {{in combination with other}} antipsychotics, so that more refractory patients get dopamine blockade from the other antipsychotic, and dopamine depletion from reserpine. Doses for this kind of <b>adjunctive</b> goal can be kept low, resulting in better tolerability. Originally, doses of 0.5mg to 40mg daily were used to treat psychotic diseases.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{vigabatrin}} {{is approved}} {{for use as}} an <b>adjunctive</b> treatment (with other drugs) in treatment resistant epilepsy, complex partial seizures, secondary generalized seizures, and for monotherapy use in infantile spasms in West syndrome.|$|E

25|$|Doses {{in excess}} of 3mg daily often {{required}} use of an anticholinergic drug to combat excessive cholinergic activity {{in many parts of}} the body as well as parkinsonism. For <b>adjunctive</b> treatment, doses are typically kept at or below 0.25mg twice a day.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{studies using}} {{curcumin}} conducted by Bharat Aggarwal, formerly {{a researcher at}} the MD Anderson Cancer Center, were deemed fraudulent and subsequently retracted by the publisher.

25|$|A double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} {{study of}} minocycline for depression in 2017, {{adds to the}} growing body of literature addressing whether depression can be treated with drugs which reduce inflammation and foster nerve growth. The result was significant, suggesting that, in select patients who have failed to respond fully to more commonly used antidepressant drugs, it may be appropriate to try minocycline as an <b>adjunctive</b> therapy for depression, especially considering its relatively good safety profile.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} of benefit in terms of live birth rate of using hyaluronic acid as adherence medium for the embryo. Neither is there any evidence of benefit of having a full bladder, removal of cervical mucus, or flushing of the endometrial or endocervical cavity at the time of embryo transfer. <b>Adjunctive</b> antibiotics in the form of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid does not increase the clinical pregnancy rate compared with no antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely known {{self-help}} organizations in which members support each other not to use alcohol. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. It has been suggested that social skills training <b>adjunctive</b> to inpatient treatment of alcohol dependence is probably efficacious, including managing the social environment.|$|E
25|$|Licensed for {{generalized}} tonic-clonic {{and complex}} partial seizures in the United Kingdom. In the United States, primidone is approved for <b>adjunctive</b> (in {{combination with other}} drugs) and monotherapy (by itself) use in generalized tonic-clonic seizures, simple partial seizures, and complex partimple partial seizures, and myoclonic seizures. In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), it is a second-line therapy, reserved for when the valproates and/or lamotrigine do not work and when other second-line therapiesacetazolamid work either.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to potentially toxic amphetamine metabolites caused by selegiline, another promising treatment is in MAO B propargyl amine inhibitor rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-R-aminoindan, Azilect((R))). The oral bioavailability of rasagiline is 35%, it reaches T(max) after 0.5–1.0 hours and its half-life is 1.5–3.5 hours. Rasagiline undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily by cytochrome P450 type 1A2 (CYP1A2). Rasagiline is initiated at 1-mg once-daily dose as monotherapy in early PD patients and at 0.5–1.0mg once-daily as <b>adjunctive</b> to levodopa in advanced PD patients.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 {{systematic}} review reached inconclusive results {{with regard to}} the effectiveness of acupuncture for treating cancer-related fatigue. A 2013 {{systematic review}} found that acupuncture is an acceptable <b>adjunctive</b> treatment for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, but that further research with a low risk of bias is needed. A 2013 systematic review found that {{the quantity and quality of}} available RCTs for analysis were too low to draw valid conclusions for the effectiveness of acupuncture for cancer-related fatigue.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Sachdeo {{and colleagues}} at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick {{reported}} that 33% of the patients {{in a group of}} patients taking topiramate experienced a minimum 50% reduction in seizures (specifically drop attacks and tonic–clonics), compared with 8% in the placebo group.

25|$|A 2015 Cochrane review {{found that}} there is {{insufficient}} evidence to determine whether acupuncture is an effective treatment for cancer pain in adults. A 2014 systematic review published in the Chinese Journal of Integrative Medicine found that acupuncture may be effective as an <b>adjunctive</b> treatment to palliative care for cancer patients. A 2013 overview of reviews published in the Journal of Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer found evidence that acupuncture could be beneficial for people with cancer-related symptoms, but also identified few rigorous trials and high heterogeneity between trials. A 2012 systematic review of randomised clinical trials published in the same journal found that the number and quality of RCTs for using acupuncture {{in the treatment of}} cancer pain was too low to draw definite conclusions.|$|E
