40|$|A key {{characteristic}} of a market-oriented organization is harmonious interfaces between the {{various parts of the}} organization. One of these interfaces is the marketing-sales interface. While both marketing and sales are focused on serving customers and designed to play complementary roles, recent studies conclude that in practice marketing and sales often work at cross purposes. This paper presents an exploratory investigation of the marketing-sales interface in Dutch and Slovenian B 2 B firms. The Slovenian firms are generally less developed than their Dutch counterparts and lack a true marketing capability. Most of the Dutch B 2 B firms recently implemented marketing in their organizations and managed to develop effective marketing-sales interfaces. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement. Our findings emphasize the need to both create <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>marketing</b> function and develop a supportive organizational culture characterized by a continuous open dialogue between marketing and sales aimed at creating superior value for customers...|$|R

The merger raised a number of antitrust concerns, including whether the merged company would raise {{the price of crude}} oil produced on the Alaskan North Slope (ANS). The combined output of the firms exceeded 70 % of total production of ANS crude oil, suggesting that if ANS crude oil were <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>market</b> the merged firm would possess power over price. We estimate a model of demand for ANS crude oil based on a simple theoretic model of pricing arbitrage to identify the relevant market in which ANS crude oil trades. The dramatic decline in production of ANS crude oil during the 1990 s, as the North Slope passed its peak production, provides an excellent natural experiment to assess the effects on prices of declining output. We find no evidence that ANS is <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>market</b> and argue it is highly unlikely the merged company could have raised the price of ANS. * The {{authors would like to thank}} Dan McFadden and Miguel Herce for their comments on this paper and Bryan Patten for his research assistance. † The authors were retained by BP and ARCO to provide expert economic advice on the competitive effects of this merger...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a consistent and arbitrage-free pricing methodology for bespoke CDO tranches. The proposed method is a multi-factor extension to the (Li 2009) model, {{and it is}} free of the known flaws in the current standard pricing method of base correlation mapping. This method assigns <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>market</b> factor to each liquid credit index and models the correlation between these market factors explicitly. A low-dimensional semi-analytical Monte Carlo is shown to be very efficient in computing the PVs and risks of bespoke tranches. Numerical examples show that resulting bespoke tranche prices are generally {{in line with the}} current standard method of base correlation with TLP mapping. Practical issues such as model deltas and quanto adjustment are also discussed as numerical examples. ...|$|E

Based on a comparison of customer ratings of 6, 850 hotels in Spain with and without ISO 14001 certification, overall guests rate the hotels with ISO 14001 certification higher than those without the certification.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use {{data from the}} British Labour Force Survey to analyse the {{characteristics}} of workers who provide work {{on the basis of}} a civil or commercial contract, but who are dependent on or integrated into the firm for which they work. We argue that these workers lose their rights under labour law, receive less favourable benefits from social security protection and are often beyond trade union representation and collective bargaining. In this paper we test two hypotheses: (1) Dependent self-employed workers are significantly different from both employees and (independent) self-employed individuals, thus forming <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> group. (2) Dependent selfemployed workers have lower labour market skills, less labour market attachment and, thus, less autonomy than self-employed workers. The data support our hypothesis that dependent selfemployed workers are <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> labour <b>market</b> group which differs from both employees and independent self-employed individuals. In comparison to employees, dependent self-employed workers tend to be male, older, married (small effect), Caucasian, with low education and a low job tenure.

We document that abnormal annual returns are significantly greater for firms meeting expectations, controlling for the in-formation in the current year's earnings. We then test whether firms meeting expectations experience higher returns simply because their expected future earnings are also higher. We find firms meeting expectations have significantly higher earnings forecasts and realized earnings than firms that do not. We find that controlling for these higher future earnings, firms meeting expectations in one or two years do not receive a greater valuation than their fundamentals would suggest. We find, however, that the market assigns a higher value to firms that meet expectations consistently, controlling for an estimate of the firm's fundamental value...|$|E

The method was developed as part of a doctoral thesis and evaluated first hand by expert interviews in several logistics association in relation to the application in-volved.

40|$|Although {{research}} on international travelers abounds in the literature, international travel by students remains a neglected area of research. This article reports {{the findings from}} a survey of 370 university students in New Zealand. The survey identified student motives for undertaking international travel, the planning process, and the preferred destinations and methods of financing international trips. Logit models were developed and estimated for two important aspects of international travel by students. In addition, the study also included cross-cultural comparisons of travel behavior. The findings indicate that students traveling overseas represent <b>a</b> <b>distinct</b> <b>market</b> with specific needs and preferences.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{foundation of the}} possibility that multimarket contact enhances firms' abilities to sustain implicit collusion. When firms operate in a single market and cannot perfectly monitor the opponents' choices of supply, it is impossible to achieve efficiency among these firms in a self-enforcing way, even though these firms have the long-term strategic relationship. By using models of infinitely repeated game with discounting, we shows that when firms encounter each other in <b>a</b> number of <b>distinct</b> <b>markets</b> and the degree of multimarket contact is large enough, efficiency can be approximately sustained by a subgame perfect equilibrium. This efficiency theorem in the imperfect monitoring case holds under almost the same condition on the discount factor as the perfect monitoring case. ...|$|R
