5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{kicks off}} with Eric Taylor {{struggling}} as the East Dillon High coach. The team, field and conditions are a complete {{change from the}} privileged <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> conditions at West Dillon. East Dillon High resembles Odessa High from the source novel , Permian High's sister school {{and the home of}} the Odessa Bronchos, with whom they have an annual rivalry match which divides the town. The East Dillon Lions and Odessa Bronchos both wear red uniforms and are considered underdogs to the Panthers. Additionally, Odessa High and East Dillon are both underfunded and considered inferior compared to their rival school, and serve a predominately poor minority community. Additionally, the school district boundaries between East and West Dillon were intentionally drawn to ensure the majority of talented players would be zoned for West Dillon; the districts between Permian and Odessa High were drawn in a similar manner.|$|E

25|$|Riesling is the {{benchmark}} grape in Germany and covers the most area in German vineyards. It is an aromatic variety {{with a high}} level of acidity that can be used for dry, semi-sweet, sweet <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> wines. The drawback to Riesling is that it takes 130 days to ripen and, in marginal years, the Riesling crop tends to be poor.|$|E

25|$|After aging at {{the winery}} most wood-aged Ports, Sherries, Vins doux naturels, Vins de liqueur, basic level Ice wines <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> wines are bottled when the {{producer}} feels {{that they are}} ready to be consumed. These wines are ready to drink upon release and will not benefit much from aging. Vintage Ports and other bottled-aged Ports & Sherries will benefit from some additional aging.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{amounts of}} Syrah {{are also used}} in the {{production}} of other wine styles, such as rosé wine, fortified wine in Port wine style, <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> red wine. While Australian sparkling Shiraz traditionally have had some sweetness, a number of Australian winemakers also make a full-bodied sparkling dry Shiraz, that contains the complexity and sometimes earthy notes that are normally found in still wine.|$|E
25|$|Pinot noir is {{also used}} in the {{production}} of Champagne (usually along with Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier) and is planted in most of the world's wine growing regions for use in both still <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> wines. Pinot noir grown for dry table wines is generally low-yielding and of lesser vigour than many other varieties, whereas when grown for use in sparkling wines (e.g. Champagne) it is generally cropped at significantly higher yields.|$|E
50|$|As Sister <b>and</b> <b>Sparkle</b> arrive home, {{their sister}} Delores/Dee (Tika Sumpter) {{opens the door}} and they sneak upstairs to their room to avoid having their mother hear them come in. Emma (Whitney Houston), the girls' mother, walks into the girls' room <b>and</b> notices <b>Sparkle,</b> Sister <b>and</b> Dee in bed together, and demands that Sister <b>and</b> <b>Sparkle</b> prepare for bed and be ready for church in the morning. The next morning while at church Stix along with his cousin Levi (Omari Hardwick) spot Sister <b>and</b> <b>Sparkle</b> sitting in the choir. Stix tells Levi that Sister <b>and</b> <b>Sparkle</b> are {{siblings}} with musical talent, and Levi is interested in meeting Sister. After church Stix <b>and</b> <b>Sparkle</b> meet <b>and</b> talk for a while, as Emma notices and looks on disapprovingly. Ms. Waters (Tamela Mann) Emma's friend points out that Emma's oldest daughter Sister is almost 30, and due to a bad situation in New York City was forced to move back to Detroit to live with Emma. Later that night Emma hosts a Bible study at her home in which both Levi and Stix are present, however Levi takes the time to make a date with Sister who is uninterested and not participating in her mother's Bible study. After Emma and everyone leave the house, Stix secretly stays behind <b>and</b> notices <b>Sparkle</b> playing an original song that she wrote on a piano. Stix tries to encourage Sparkle to sing. A few nights later Stix comes to Sparkle's home to take her on a date at a nightclub. On the way home while sitting in front of Sparkle's home Stix tries again to encourage Sparkle to pursue a music career and tries to convince her to form a group with her sisters. Sparkle tells Stix that her mother was a singer, but almost died pursuing her dream.|$|R

25|$|Germany {{produces}} wines in many styles: dry, semi-sweet {{and sweet}} white wines, rosé wines, red wines <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> wines, called Sekt. (The only wine style not commonly produced is fortified wine.) Due to the northerly {{location of the}} German vineyards, the country has produced wines quite unlike any others in Europe, many of outstanding quality. Between the 1950s and the 1980s German wine was known abroad for cheap, sweet or semi-sweet, low-quality mass-produced wines such as Liebfraumilch.|$|E
25|$|The {{television}} {{prime time}} shows Dallas and, in particular, Dynasty influenced increasingly oversized shoulder pads. Shoulder pads, popularized by Joan Collins and Linda Evans from {{the soap opera}} Dynasty were popular from the mid 1980s to the early 1990s. Dallas, however, promoted displays of wealth involving jewelry <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> clothing. Meanwhile, women's fashion and business shoes revisited the pointed toes and spiked heels that were popular in the 1950s and early 1960s. Some stores stocked canvas or satin covered fashion shoes in white and dyed them to the customer's preferred color, preferably bright colors.|$|E
25|$|White wine is also {{a dessert}} wine. All choices are allowed even if the sweet and {{fortified}} wines {{are more suitable for}} this. Perfumed wines (Gewurztraminer, Muscat), sparkling, and sweet wines accord well with fruit desserts (salad, tart). The fortified <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> wines support rich desserts made with cream or butter. Crèmes brûlées or caramel which combine sugar and cream can be eaten with a sweet and lively wine such as Jurançon or a late harvest wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine so white wine selection is quite limited: a natural amber sweet wine is the best compromise.|$|E
5000|$|Kelly founded Rockland Records in 1998, in {{conjunction}} with Universal Music Group, shortly before releasing his fourth album (R.).Rockland's artists included Sparkle, rappers Boo & Gotti, Talent, and Vegas Cats (the latter two groups never released an album) among others. The soundtrack to the 1999 Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy movie Life was released on the Rockland label, <b>and</b> <b>Sparkle</b> was the first artist to release an album on the label. Despite various conflicts between <b>Sparkle</b> <b>and</b> the label, her debut album performed well, going platinum. The album's most popular track was a duet between Kelly <b>and</b> <b>Sparkle</b> titled [...] "Be Careful".|$|R

25|$|The white wines {{made from}} the Moscato Bianco (also known as Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains) are most noted for their frizzante <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> spumante styles but some still wines are {{produced}} as well. Located northeast of Alba, the wines from the Asti region {{are known for their}} delicate light bodies, low alcohol content and slightly sweet nature. Like many sparkling wines, Asti are not vintage dated even though a majority of the grapes might all come from the same vintage year. The wines are typically at their peak between 1 and 2 years from their release.|$|E
25|$|Belt press- This press {{utilizes}} {{a series}} of air-inflated pads along a wire mesh belt. Usually several meters long, fresh grapes are loaded onto {{the beginning of the}} belt where it is transferred by rollers through the series of pads that apply pressure, hold it for a time and release with the juice falling through the screens into waiting press pans. Belt presses have been used by high volume wineries for whole-cluster pressing <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> wine production but it has not caught on in many wine regions due to concerns about the amount of oxidation it introduces to the wine as well as the large amount of suspended solids that get past the screens.|$|E
25|$|Other major {{bluegrass}} mandolinists who {{emerged in}} the early 1950s and are still active include Jesse McReynolds (of Jim and Jesse) who invented a syncopated banjo-roll-like style called crosspicking—and Bobby Osborne of the Osborne Brothers, who {{is a master of}} clarity <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> single-note runs. Highly respected and influential modern bluegrass players include Herschel Sizemore, Doyle Lawson, and the multi-genre Sam Bush, who is equally at home with old-time fiddle tunes, rock, reggae, and jazz. Ronnie McCoury of the Del McCoury Band has won numerous awards for his Monroe-influenced playing. John Duffey of the original Country Gentlemen and later the Seldom Scene did much to popularize the bluegrass mandolin among folk and urban audiences, especially on the east coast and in the Washington, D.C. area.|$|E

The girls are invited to open for Aretha Franklin on a television show, and while Dee <b>and</b> <b>Sparkle</b> get ready, Sister walks in with a black eye <b>and</b> bruises. <b>Sparkle</b> <b>and</b> Dee realize that Satin has been beating Sister. Sparkle also notices that Sister has begun using cocaine. <b>Sparkle,</b> Sister <b>and</b> Dee perform [...] "Something He Can Feel", when Emma happens to wake up at home and catches a glimpse of their performance on television. She becomes both shocked and angry that her girls have been singing outside the church against her wishes. After their performance Stix introduces the girls to Columbia Records executive Larry who offers to sign them as a group. Dee <b>and</b> <b>Sparkle</b> try to get Sister to come home with them and leave Satin, but as they leave Sister spots Satin and goes back to him. At home Emma scolds Sparkle about her trying to pursue a career in the music industry, going as far as throwing a book which Sparkle has written song lyrics in the trash. Emma gives Sparkle an ultimatum that if she wants to continue living with her she must give up pursuing a music career.|$|R

25|$|A {{mechanical}} grape harvester {{works by}} beating the vine with rubber sticks {{to get the}} vine to drop its fruit onto a conveyor belt that brings the fruit to a holding bin. As technology improves mechanical harvesters have become more sophisticated in distinguishing grape clusters from mud, leaves and other particles. Despite the improvement many harvesters still have difficulties in distinguishing between ripe, healthy grapes and unripe or rotted bunches which must then be sorted out at the winemaking facility. Another disadvantage is the potential of damaging the grape skins which can cause maceration and coloring of the juice that is undesirable {{in the production of}} white <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> wine. The broken skins also bring the risk of oxidation and a loss of some of the aromatic qualities in the wine.|$|E
25|$|The average {{bottle of}} Champagne {{contains}} enough carbon dioxide to potentially produce 49 million bubbles. (Wine expert Tom Stevenson puts the number at 250 million.) The bubbles initially form at 20 micrometers {{in diameter and}} expand as they gain buoyancy and rise to the surface. When they reach the surface they are approximately 1 millimeter in size. It is speculated that the bubbles in sparkling wine may speed up alcohol intoxication by helping the alcohol to reach the bloodstream faster. A study conducted at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom gave subjects equal amounts of flat <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> Champagne which contained the same levels of alcohol. After 5 minutes following consumption, the group that had the sparkling wine had 54 milligrams of alcohol in their blood while the group that had the same sparkling wine, only flat, had 39 milligrams.|$|E
25|$|The Isonzo and Carso wine {{regions are}} located in the far southeastern part of Friuli-Venezia Giulia {{bordering}} Slovenia. The Isonzo region is located on a plain of alluvial deposits directly south of Collio along the Isonzo river. The best vineyards {{are located in}} the northeast, close to Cormons. The wine regions predominately have a maritime climate with more rainfall than other Friuli regions. The region is known for its sparkling Pinot bianco as well as dry white wines made from Chardonnay, Malvasia Istriana and Sauvignon blanc. Other Isonzo DOC designated wines include dry, off dry <b>and</b> <b>sparkling</b> wines made from Gewürztraminer, Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Franconia, Moscato Giallo, Moscato Rosa, Pinot grigio, Pinot nero, Refosco, Riesling, Schioppettino, Friulano, Verduzzo and Welschriesling. The Vendemmia Tardiva is a late harvest wine made from a varietal style or blend of Chardonnay, Pinot biano, Friulano and Verduzzo.|$|E
