5000|$|Antimicrobial agents kill {{bacteria}} {{through different}} methods {{depending on the}} type of bacteria. Most <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> kill bacteria immediately on contact by causing the bacterial cell to burst, or by depleting the bacteria's source of food preventing bacterial reproduction, also known as bacterial conjugation. Antimicrobial polymers commonly kill bacteria through this first method, which is accomplished through a series of steps, shown in Figure 1. First, the polymer must adsorb onto the bacterial cell wall. Most bacterial surfaces are negatively charged, therefore the adsorption of polymeric cations has proved to be more effective than adsorption of polymeric anions. The antimicrobial agent must then diffuse through the cell wall and adsorb onto the cytoplasmic membrane. Small molecule antimicrobial agents excel at the diffusion step due to their low molecular weight, while adsorption is better achieved by antimicrobial polymers. The disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane and subsequent leakage of cytoplasmic constituents leads to the death of the cell. Comparison of small molecule antimicrobial agents and antimicrobial polymers are shown in the following table: ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> {{represent}} {{a large group}} of compounds that have different effects depending on the used concentration. They are substances that remove bacteria from the skin or materials and are part of the practices for infection control in hospitals. The action of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> is due to mutual reaction with the cell surface of the microorganisms, followed by their penetration into the cells and the influence on a certain target area. Intrahospital (inpatient, nosocomial) infections are localized or generalized infections caused by microorganisms acquired during hospitalization. Intrahospital infections also include recurrent infections acquired during other hospitalizations and other manifest infections in patients that move from one hospital to another. In fact, these infections can result from inappropriate use of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish a correlation between the mechanism of action of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> and their chemical structure. This correlation may be the basis for creating an approach that will be used as prevention from the occurrence of intrahospital or nosocomial infections. The establishment of such an approach is crucial because it is necessary to know which antiseptic or disinfectant has the greatest activity against the microoriganism which is the cause of the intrahospital (nosocomial) infection. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to review the usage of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> in {{selected}} hospitals in Strumica, Ohrid, Veles, Stip, Kavadarci and Gevgelija and their usage as a suitable way for prevention of interhospital infections, which can cause serious problems in the modern medicine. The word intrahospital or nosocomial means infections that develop in hospitals or are caused by microorganisms acquired in time of the hospitalization of the sick and their clinical manifestations occur 48 – 72 hours the earliest from the day that the hospitalization occurred. To achieve the purpose of lowering and prevention of these infections, number of precautions and procedures are taken into practice routinely in the hospitals. The data from the annual reports for <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> such as: Bactosal, Ecosal, Dezintal, Betadine, Hydrogen peroxide, Formaldehyde and Ethanol, used on the selected departments for gynecology, surgery and transfusion, were collected. Our purpoise was to find correlation between the structure of the <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> and the range of their activity (bacteriostatic or bactericidal).

40|$|Abstract Background The study {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} available data on efficacy and tolerability of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> in treating bacterial vaginosis (BV). Methods A systematic search was conducted by consulting PubMed (1966 - 2010), CINAHL (1982 - 2010), IPA (1970 - 2010), and the Cochrane CENTRAL databases. Clinical trials were searched for by the generic names of all <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> listed in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System under the code D 08 A. Clinical trials were considered eligible if the efficacy of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> in the treatment of BV was assessed in comparison to placebo or standard antibiotic treatment with metronidazole or clindamycin and if diagnosis of BV relied on standard criteria such as Amsel’s and Nugent’s criteria. Results A total of 262 articles were found, of which 15 reports on clinical trials were assessed. Of these, four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were withheld from analysis. Reasons for exclusion were primarily the lack of standard criteria to diagnose BV or to assess cure, and control treatment not involving placebo or standard antibiotic treatment. Risk of bias for the included studies was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias. Three studies showed non-inferiority of chlorhexidine and polyhexamethylene biguanide compared to metronidazole or clindamycin. One RCT found that a single vaginal douche with hydrogen peroxide was slightly, though significantly less effective than a single oral dose of metronidazole. Conclusion The use of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> for the treatment of BV has been poorly studied and most studies are somehow methodologically flawed. There is insufficient evidence at present to advocate the use of these agents, although some studies suggest that some antiseptics may have equal efficacy compared to clindamycin or metronidazole. Further study is warranted with special regard to the long-term efficacy and safety of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> for vaginal use. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{bacterial}} contamination of antiseptics and disinfections in-use {{and the risk}} factors for contamination. Material and Method: Bacterial contamination of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> was done by culturing in-use solutions. Eight commonly used solutions were studied: alcohol 70 %, chlorhexidine 4 %, and 0. 5 %, povidone iodine 7. 5 % and 10 %, tincture iodine 1 - 2 %, lysol 2 % and sodium hypochlorite 0. 5 %. Results: The following risk factors for contamination were found: preparation by unskilled personnel, improper containers and prolonged use. Contamination with bacteria were found in 1. 8 % of 16, 142 samples tested. Highest rate of contamination was found in Lysol 2 %. There was no contamination of povidone iodine 10 % and tincture iodine 1 - 2 %. Bacterial contamination of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> was highest in provincial hospitals and was not found in university hospitals.

40|$|AIMS: Development of the resazurin {{microplate}} method (RMM) as a novel {{test system}} {{for the evaluation of}} the antimicrobial activity of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants.</b> The validated RMM was subsequently applied for the evaluation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)) and stabilized H(2) O(2) combination products. METHODS AND RESULTS: The European Committee for Standardization prescribes the plate count challenge test (PCCT) for antiseptic and disinfectant efficacy testing. This protocol was adapted to a microplate-based assay, using resazurin as viability indicator. The RMM was as accurate as the PCCT, had an identical detection limit and showed high intermediate precision. Using the validated RMM, it was shown that H(2) O(2) combined with silver possessed a higher bactericidal and fungicidal activity compared to native H(2) O(2) with and without glycerol. CONCLUSIONS: Validation showed that the RMM may replace the PCCT. When applying the RMM, H(2) O(2) combined with silver was clearly a more potent disinfectant compared to H(2) O(2) in killing bacteria and fungi. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The RMM is easier to use for antimicrobial efficacy testing of <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants.</b> As the RMM is in accordance with the norms of the European Committee for Standardization, it may become a more cost-effective alternative to the more laborious PCCT reference method.

40|$|Abstract Background This study aims {{to assess}} the {{susceptibility}} of Acinetobacter baumannii isolates to the <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> commonly used, and to the non-approved product. Methods This is a prospective study carried out from February to August 2015, in the Bacteriology department of Mohammed V Military Teaching hospital of Rabat on A. baumannii isolates collected from colonized and/or infected patients and environmental samples. The <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> susceptibility testing was assessed using the micromethod validated in our department. The <b>antiseptics</b> <b>and</b> <b>disinfectants</b> studied were: 70 % ethyl alcohol, chlorhexidine, povidone-iodine, didecyldimethylammonium chloride and a commercial product which was presented as a hospital disinfectant (non-registered product). Results Povidone-iodine, 0. 5 % chlorhexidine digluconate, 70 % ethyl alcohol and didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride in combination with N- (3 -aminopropyl) -N-dodecylpropane- 1, 3 -diamine were effective against all the 81 A. baumannii isolates tested, and their logarithmic reduction[*]≥[*] 5 were observed in 100 % of the isolates in their undiluted form. The strains isolated from patients were more resistant than environmental strains: at a dilution of ½ for 70 % ethyl alcohol (37. 77 % vs 11. 11 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 007) and at a dilution of 1 / 10 (100 % vs 69. 44 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) for povidone iodine. The non-registered product was ineffective with a resistance rate of 96. 29 % at a dilution of 1 / 50, 45. 67 % at a dilution of 1 / 10 and 13. 58 % in its purest form. Conclusion Our study revealed {{the effectiveness of the}} main disinfectants and antiseptics used in Morocco; three antiseptics tested were effective in their purest form against the 81 A. baumannii isolates. Regarding disinfectants, our results showed an efficacy of didecyl dimethyl ammonium at the recommended use concentration and in its purest form. This study emphasizes the need for using disinfectants and antiseptics in dilutions recommended by the manufacturer because the insufficient dilutions of these products are not effective.
