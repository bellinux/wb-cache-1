The results can therefore not simply be transferred to production scale facilities. The restoration scheme applied included the first two steps mentioned above.

Although heap leaching using sulfuric acid was introduced to the uranium industry in the 1950 s, sodium carbonate–bicarbonate (<b>alkaline)</b> heap <b>leaching</b> of low-grade Ca-carbonate-rich uranium ores has recently gained popularity. This study presents the results of two column tests on a calcrete-type uranium–vanadium (carnotite) ore using a mixture of sodium carbonate and bicarbonate (Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3) as the leach solution. This data was kindly supplied by Toro Energy Ltd. The experimental data comprised physical–chemical leach information and two different irrigation rates (10 and 20 L/h·m 2). The experimental data indicated that the carnotite ore with high calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) can be leached effectively using the <b>alkaline</b> <b>leach</b> solution. The increase in the irrigation rate increased the uranium and vanadium extraction and decreased their concentration in the effluent. The column leach data was therefore fitted to a simplified first-order kinetic model using two approaches, a general form and a second based on the reagent consumption per unit mass of the initial valuable species (U and V). As reagent consumption is a key economic factor in the heap leaching process, having a kinetic leaching model incorporating reagent consumption would provide useful techno-economic information. In this regards a new leaching index of (β) is also introduced. Both approaches of the first order kinetic model provide a good agreement with the column testing data...|$|R

The carrier-phase extraction of precious metals using activated carbon offers significant advantages over other processes in terms of simplicity, the high pre-concentration factor, rapid phase separation, and relatively low capital and operating costs. As a sorbent, activated carbon is still by far the most important material because of its large surface area, high adsorption capacity, porous structure, negligible environmental toxicity, low cost, and high purity standards. Adsorption tests were performed on a pregnant <b>alkaline</b> <b>leach</b> solution (0. 15 ppm Pt, 0. 38 ppm Pd, 0. 1 ppm Au) resulting from cyanide extraction performed in column leach tests. The initial adsorption rates of platinum, palladium, and gold were very fast and recoveries of these three metals were approximately 90 per cent after 2 hours and 100 per cent, 97. 4 per cent, and 99. 9 per cent respectively after 72 hours. The parameters that influence the extraction of PGMs and Au were examined to assess their relative importance during the adsorption process in order to provide the basis for process optimization. The concentration of thiocyanate was not identified as significant factor for PGMs adsorption, while nickel concentration was the most significant extraction process parameter. Base metal cyanide complexes adsorb and compete with the PGM complexes for sites on activated carbon, and while copper adsorption can be minimized by adjusting the residence time, nickel adsorbs at approximately the same rate as that of the PGMs, influencing the loading capacity and adsorption kinetics of the PGMs. The feasibility of eluting platinum and palladium cyanide complexes from activated carbon using an analogue of the AARL process was investigated. Platinum and palladium elute from activated carbon almost to completion in 4 to 5 bed volumes at 80 °C, while the elution of gold at this temperature is slow, with a significant amount of gold still to be eluted after 16 bed volumes. Cyanide pre-treatment was found to have a significant influence on PGM elution.

While the initial activities and selectivities of catalysts derived from the three zeolites are very similar in the conversion of methylcyclohexane, the presence of mesopores (<b>alkaline</b> <b>leaching),</b> close to the active sites, greatly improves the stability of such a hierarchical catalyst by favoring the desorption of products. This behavior is similar to a reduction in zeolite crystal size. This increased stability is not due to a decrease of the coke toxicity, but rather to an inhibition of the growth of coke precursors, in turn related to the shorter diffusion paths of reactants and products. Two types of coke are present on the meso-/micro-porous zeolite: (i) a "light coke" composed of alkylbenzenes strongly adsorbed on Lewis acid sites and silanols, (ii) a "heavy coke" (alkylphenanthrenes and alkylpyrenes) trapped at the intersection of the zeolite channels. While the light coke has no impact on the catalyst stability, the heavy coke poisons active sites, most probably remote from the mesopore...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{expected}} high cost of vitrifying and disposing of high-level waste at the U. S. Department of Energy`s Hanford Site, pretreatment processes are being developed to reduce the anticipated volume of borosilicate glass. Sludge washing and caustic leaching, the baseline sludge pretreatment process, is expected to leach out {{a substantial portion of}} the {sup 137 }Cs, possibly other radionuclides, and a significant portion of such major nonradionuclides as Al or P. The decontaminated solution will be routed to the low-level waste stream, where it will be immobilized in a glass matrix. The leached solids, which will contain the transuranic elements and {sup 90 }Sr, will be handled as high-level waste. Previous studies indicate that poor removal of chromium in the + 3 oxidation state [Cr(III) ] occurs during baseline pretreatment. Because the concentration of Cr allowed in high level waste glass is low, a relatively small amount of Cr in the sludge can have a relatively large impact on the volume of high level waste glass produced. For this reason, additional leach steps to remove Cr would be desirable, and oxidative <b>alkaline</b> <b>leaching</b> has been proposed as a simple addition to the baseline sludge pretreatment. This report describes small-scale screening tests on the oxidative <b>alkaline</b> <b>leaching</b> of Cr performed with actual Hanford tank sludges...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{evaluates the}} {{efficiency}} of using mechanical activation for the extraction of zinc from sphalerite and zinc ferrite in lean zinc ores or EAF dusts in <b>alkaline.</b> The mechano-chemical <b>leaching</b> is more effective {{in comparison with the}} chemical leaching of non-activated samples. It was found that over 82 % of Zn can be extracted from lean zinc ores containing sphalerite with lead compound as additive, and over 45 % Zn in EAF dusts can be extracted by mechano-chemical leaching when the leaching process is operated in 5 mol/L NaOH solution at 90 °C, and Φ 5 mm stainless steel ball as activation medium, the mass ratio of ball to raw materials of 30 : 1...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} part of the IAEA programme for reactor fuels involves eliciting and circulating information on innovative uranium production technologies. As compared with conventional mining, in situ leach (ISL) technology is both innovative and relatively young. It is recognized as having economic and environmental advantages when properly employed by knowledgeable specialists to extract uranium from suitable sandstone type deposits. In recent years ISL uranium mining has been producing about 13 to 15 per cent of world output. Because of its potential for both low cost recovery and having environmental advantages, the use of the technology will very probably increase. This may occur because sandstone hosted uranium deposits amenable to ISL recovery are relatively widespread in the world. ISL technology recovers uranium using two alternative chemical leaching systems — acid and <b>alkaline.</b> Acid <b>leach</b> is the more widely employed and has historically produced a majority of the world’s ISL production. This technology, with its origins in the 1960 s, was developed and employed in the former Soviet Union and the successor states, as well as in central and eastern Europe. The report describes operational practices developed under th...|$|R
40|$|Studies on the {{synergistic}} {{extraction of}} phosphorus, arsenic and silica as impurities from sodium tungstate and molybdate solutions with a solvent mixture of primary amine and tributyl phosphate (TBP) were made. The experimental {{results indicate that}} phosphorus, arsenic and silica can be extracted and separated very effectively from weakly alkaline sodium tungstate and neutral molybdate solutions. The extraction behavior of phosphorus and arsenic for molybdate systems {{is quite different from}} that for tungstate systems. For molybdenum systems, the optimum separation of phosphorus and arsenic can only be obtained in a narrow range of equilibrium pH values of about 6 - 7; outside this pH range the extraction of these two elements decreases sharply. However, the extraction of phosphorus, arsenic and silica for tungsten systems and silica for molybdenum system increases with decreasing pH. Phosphorus, arsenic and silica cannot be extracted without the presence of tungsten and molybdenum in the aqueous phase. The loaded organic phase can be stripped with dilute sodium hydroxide solution quantitatively. The <b>alkaline</b> crude <b>leaching</b> solutions of sodium tungstate and ammonium molybdate were tested and the results were in agreement with those obtained from solutions prepared by mixing sodium salts of the elements concerned...|$|R
