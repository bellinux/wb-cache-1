25|$|The {{public sector}} effort {{continues}} {{with the goal}} to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, two companies (Monsanto and Illumina), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G. raimondii about 50x. They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled {{from all of this}} raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> work remains.|$|E

25|$|Chambers won the {{starring}} role in film director David Cronenberg's low-budget Canadian movie Rabid, which was released in 1977. Cronenberg stated {{that he wanted to}} cast Sissy Spacek in the film lead, but the studio vetoed his choice because of her accent. Spacek's film Carrie was released during this film's production and proved to be a massive hit (and a movie poster for the film appears when the main character walks by a movie theater at 59:15). The director says that the idea of casting Chambers came from producer Ivan Reitman, who had heard that Chambers was looking for a mainstream role. Reitman felt that {{it would be easier to}} market the film in different territories if the well-known porn star portrayed the main character. Cronenberg stated that Chambers put in <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> work on the film and that he was impressed with her. Cronenberg further states he had not seen Behind the Green Door prior to casting her.|$|E

500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 1986 elections, it {{was unclear}} whether Mathias would seek a fourth term. His support of President Reagan was lukewarm, which had further {{isolated}} him ideologically from his Republican colleagues. One delegate at the Maryland state party convention had even called Mathias [...] "liberal swine" [...] for his record. Additionally, his frequent difficulties in securing a committee chairmanship along with his low attendance rate were raising questions regarding his ability. However, Mathias was showing signs of seeking re-election in 1985, and dismissed any claims of ineffectiveness. Mathias claimed [...] "within a matter of minutes, I can talk to any member of the Cabinet; and I could go see them within 24 hours.... It was no accident that the Chesapeake Bay was mentioned in the President's State of the Union address. That took <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> work".|$|E

The actor had serious reservations about the episode, and called it [...] "the most difficult" [...] he had worked on; he explained {{that the combination of}} Kurt as prom queen, wearing a kilt and tiara and dancing to [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] caused him concern that [...] "they were just pushing it way too much", and that Kurt's [...] "helpful and progressive" [...] depiction would be tarnished.

500|$|Doctors {{were able}} to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of {{baseball}} and American football player Bo Jackson. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating {{that they were the}} only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, [...] "I take my hat off [...] I want him to know I am in his corner. It's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do all the little things he needs to compete on a professional level." [...] Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.|$|E

The video begins with Beyoncé onstage in a shimmery silver minidress, giving the crowd {{a bit of a}} windup about where [...] "I Was Here" [...] came from.

It splices poignant memories throughout Beyoncé's life, from her childhood, to partying and vacations with her family, to most of the locations she visited around the world, to her rise with Destiny's Child into solo stardom and her love story with Jay-Z. Also containing footage from major performances and awards shows, the clip begins with a young Beyoncé thanking the judges in a talent show and later doing the snake in her living room, performing in her TLC-inspired neon overalls.|$|E

However, his extreme temperament led Kakuzu to dislike having a partner and eventually killing whomever he is partnered with {{in a fit of}} rage, being paired up with the immortal Hidan as a result. When Kakuzu was still living in his village, he was given a very important mission: assassinate Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage, but the mission has failed. Defeated and humiliated, Kakuzu returned to his village, where he received <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> punishments. Feeling a great hatred for their fellow village, Kakuzu escape from prison and stole the forbidden techniques of his village, becoming a rogue ninja in the process. Kakuzu's body is composed {{of a large number of}} black threads, allowing him to reattach any body part, being his or another, back onto its owner. The threads are also capable of piercing flesh, which Kakuzu uses to remove the still-beating hearts of his opponents for his personal use and integrates their hearts into his body to extend his life indefinitely. Kakuzu can store up to four spare hearts in animal masks that are sewn to his back, which can be detached during combat situations to shoot elemental blasts at his opponents, and quickly recalled to his body if he needs a replacement heart. Kakuzu's hearts are systematically destroyed soon after his introduction by a group of Konohagakure ninja. After Naruto Uzumaki leaves his final heart on the brink of failure, Kakuzu is easily finished off by Kakashi. After being resurrected by Kabuto, he is sent out to participate in the war until being sealed. In the Japanese anime, Kakuzu's Japanese voice actor is Takaya Hashi and in the English version he is voiced by Fred Tatasciore.|$|E

Bunin became involved with Gorky's Znanie (Knowledge) group. [...] Another influence and inspiration was Leo Tolstoy whom he met in Moscow in January 1894.
