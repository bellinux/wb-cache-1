5|$|During {{the early}} Julio-Claudian period, many {{auxiliary}} regiments raised in frontier provinces were stationed {{in or near}} their home provinces, except during periods of major crises such as the Cantabrian Wars, when they were deployed temporarily in theatre. This carried the obvious risk if their own tribe or ethnic group rebelled against Rome (or attacked the Roman frontier from outside the Empire), auxiliary troops could be tempted to make common cause with them. The Romans would then be faced by <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> included units fully equipped and trained by themselves, thus losing their usual tactical advantages over tribal foes.|$|E
5|$|General Alfred T. Torbert was {{commander}} of the union cavalry. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry {{was part of the}} 2nd Brigade (commanded by Colonel Powell), which was part of the 2nd Cavalry Division (commanded by General Averell). Powell's brigade was positioned on the northwest side of the battlefield between brigades led by Colonel James Schoonmaker and Colonel George Custer. During the battle, Powell sent the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry to the flank and rear of Confederate cavalry consisting of Virginians led by Colonel William H. F. Payne, which was facing Custer's brigade. Powell also sent the 3rd West Virginia Cavalry toward Payne's left flank. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry had been newly armed with 7-shot carbines, and found them very effective against <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> was driven from the area in panic. During this time, Confederate General Fitzhugh Lee's horse was shot out from under him, but Lee escaped on another horse.|$|E
5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E

5|$|In early January 1943, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Mills-Roberts {{arrived from}} the United Kingdom {{to take over the}} unit, and he was in command when on 26 February 1943 they were {{involved}} in bitter fighting against two battalions of German parachute infantry with armoured support which attacked their position as part of an attempt to encircle the 1st Army by cutting the Medjez road. In a fight that lasted over five hours, against <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> outnumbered them and had the advantage of heavy armoured support, the commandos, along with elements from the Reconnaissance Regiment, were able to stop the advance long enough for reinforcements to be brought up. In this action, No. 6 Commando incurred 11 killed, 34 wounded and 55 missing in action. This represented over 40 per cent of the unit's strength at the time, although later a number of those that were captured were recovered after the Germans withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Jarvis {{planned to}} produce sequels, but the North American video game crash of 1983 halted most video game {{production}} {{for a few}} years. Prior to the full effects of the crash, Vid Kidz developed an official sequel, Blaster in 1983. The game {{is set in the}} same universe and takes place in 2085 in a world overrun by Robotrons. Williams considered creating a proper sequel in the mid-1980s as well as a movie adaptation. The company released a sequel with 3D graphics titled Robotron X in 1996 for the Sony PlayStation and personal computers. It was ported two years later to the Nintendo 64 as Robotron 64. In addition to the graphical update, the game includes new audio and multiple camera angles. Though the game features similar gameplay as the original, it was not as well received. Authors Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams considered the moving camera in the 3D environment a negative update. They felt the original format—an overhead perspective of a single screen—presented the player with all the necessary information and relied on the player's skill. The moving camera angle, however, obscured areas of the playing field and could result in the player being shot by <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> suddenly appeared. Vince echoed similar statements, stating that the gameplay suffered from the loss of important aspects from the original. Rollings and Adams, however, attribute the fad of classic video game remakes in the late 1990s in part to Robotron Xs release.|$|E

25|$|The Marine Corps’ {{military}} operations in urban terrain doctrine recognizes that tactical success does not necessarily translate to strategic victory. It notes the Israeli’s tactical victory in Beirut was a strategic defeat—and observes the same about the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War, when Marines defeated <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> sought {{to put up a}} good fight but never expected to win. Much {{the same can be said}} of Fallujah’s defenders. In spite of the beating they took in November, they will continue to assert they repelled the initial attack and fought well thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Uneven {{progress}} of US pacification effort. The American pacification effort was also ineffective over several critical years, hampered by bureaucratic rivalries between competing agencies, {{a focus on}} big-unit operations, and lack of coordination between South Vietnamese civil agencies concerned with pacification, and the US military. The success of pacification efforts were closely linked to security and security and ARVN performance improved in the Creighton Abrams era after 1968's Tet battles. Some resources were shifted away from attrition towards counterinsurgency/pacification, and progress was made on the population base issue. However these reforms were haltingly implemented, and US forces largely continued {{to operate in the}} same way – seeking body counts and other attritional indicators, against <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> could always up the ante indefinitely by introducing more troops.|$|E
25|$|When {{the guerrilla}} sweep was {{successfully}} {{completed by the}} end of May, the communists reclaimed the lost ground. However, Muang Soui was saved from assault; the USAF claimed the credit. With monsoon rains drenching the Plain, communist resupply lines were expected to be bogged down. In past rainy seasons, air operations supporting the Hmong against the communists had occurred during breaks in the weather. However, in mid June 1969, the communists launched their first ever wet season offensive, Campaign Thoan Thang. It circled behind the Hmong positions and used a tank-supported attack to conquer Moang Soui on 27 June. The Hmong were left facing <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> now was being supplied by an all-weather road, Route 7; the communists were still poised to strike.|$|E

25|$|Encountering sporadic, but {{nonetheless}} stiff opposition, the 29th/46th advanced up the coast, suffering casualties from <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> was expert at remaining {{hidden in the}} jungle and from mines that were laid along the various tracks that snaked through the dense scrub. By 10 December they reached Kiligia, from which the Japanese garrison had withdrawn prior to their arrival, and after a brief pause as further artillery support was brought up, the advance continued on towards the Sanga River as Japanese troops from the 80th Regiment rushed to contain the Australians. On 17 December, the 29th/46th conducted a complicated passage of lines manoeuvre, passing through the 22nd Battalion, and with considerable artillery support proceeded to continue the advance up the coast crossing {{near the mouth of}} the Sanga. By the afternoon of the following day they had reached the Masaweng river, where they captured a quantity of Japanese weapons which had been abandoned on the opposite bank. After this the focus of the advance became the imposing feature of Fortification Hill and after the brigade commander moved his headquarters up to Kiligia, the 29th/46th Battalion began the advance on 19 December. Receiving sporadic Japanese mortar fire, which was met by overwhelming direct and indirect fire support from accompanying tanks and artillery, the battalion reached the summit of the hill the following day as the Japanese defenders abandoned the position.|$|E
500|$|Examples {{from the}} early days of aerial {{operations}} stipulated {{that there would be no}} use of napalm in Laos, that no PAVN trucks could be struck more than 200 meters from a road, and that no enemy forces could be bombed within 1,000 meters of a pagoda. Although these restrictions were later altered, there were always others to take their place. There were [...] "no bomb zones" [...] that granted sanctuaries to PAVN and Pathet Lao forces. Pagodas and suspected PAVN hospitals (which were unmarked) were simply turned into ammunition dumps, supply caches, and anti-aircraft sites by <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> intently studied American actions and adjusted to them.|$|E
500|$|As {{the battles}} over the Channel {{continued}}, Galland shot down Spitfires on 25 and 28 July. [...] On 1 August 1940, Galland {{was awarded the}} Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (...) for his 17 victories. Galland continued to make fighter sweeps over southern England before the main assault opened. On 11 August, Galland's unit engaged 74 Squadron. In a brief dogfight, one Spitfire was shot down. During these battles the RAF seemed to know just where and when to send their aircraft. This made Galland suspect {{a high level of}} organisation was at work controlling RAF fighters. The cloudy skies of Britain were a dangerous environment to confront <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> had an effective ground control system. Galland resolved to fly higher, where he could see most things and where the Bf 109 performed at its best.|$|E

500|$|Fort William Henry, {{built in}} the fall of 1755, was a roughly square {{fortification}} with bastions on the corners, in a design that was intended to repel Indian attacks but was not necessarily sufficient to withstand attack from <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> had artillery. [...] Its walls were [...] thick, with log facings surrounding an earthen filling. [...] Inside the fort were wooden barracks two stories high, built around the parade ground. [...] Its magazine was in the northeast bastion, and its hospital was located in the southeast bastion. [...] The fort was surrounded on three sides by a dry moat, with the fourth side sloping down to the lake. [...] The only access to the fort was by a bridge across the moat. [...] The fort was capable of housing only four to five hundred men; additional troops were quartered in an entrenched camp [...] southeast of the fort, near the site of the 1755 Battle of Lake George.|$|E
500|$|In the Americas, Native American {{nations were}} {{severely}} damaged by European settlers, specifically {{because of the}} Europeans' advanced military technology. Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation [...] "in the frustration of not having the technology {{to allow you to}} prevail. It's always the low-tech culture that feels powerless when faced with <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> has technology on their side." [...] In the film, the cowboys are the low-tech culture, and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of Manifest Destiny. Favreau also said of the premise, [...] "It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together, which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy. It sets the Western up in a very classic way and then turns it on its ear." [...] When the aliens appear, the film becomes a road movie in which the main characters try to track the aliens, team up with different groups, and ultimately confront the aliens. Favreau compared the gathering to The Magnificent Seven in facing seemingly insurmountable odds in their confrontation.|$|E
500|$|As part of {{the secrecy}} campaign, Benedict Cumberbatch denied that he was playing Khan during interviews, {{describing}} Harrison as simply a terrorist with his own purposes, as well as [...] "someone that's activated and manufactured in a way by Starfleet, and it's a scene that has {{come back to haunt}} him." [...] He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage [...] "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," [...] adding parallels to the current world order [...] "whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists." [...] Into Darkness writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom—"It’s so easy to fall into the trap of doing something because you {{think people are going to}} love it. You must come up with what the movie can be on its own and then, if it turns out the villain maybe can be Khan, then you can do it.

500|$|Two {{new forms}} of antlion appear in the game. The first is the glow-in-the-dark antlion grub, a harmless, {{worm-like}} creature which functions as a minor health pickup and a light source. Killing all 333 of these earns an Achievement. The second is the worker antlion (or 'acidlion') whose body produces a powerful and poisonous acid. In addition to a ranged acid spit attack, they also explode when killed, launching acid around them in a short radius, making them dangerous close-combat opponents. Although they are thematically similar to the bullsquids of the original Half-Life, they are functionally closer to the poison headcrab—as <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> the player will instinctively prioritize as a target. A new antlion guardian, which has glow-in-the-dark features, was also added. This [...] "Guardian" [...] hunts and attacks Gordon Freeman as the player endeavors to take the larval extract the Guardian protects.

Veteran voice actor Nolan North, who portrays protagonist Nathan Drake in Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, was chosen {{to play the role}} of David. When approached by Druckmann about the role, North immediately accepted the part, appreciating its diversity from his previous acting roles. When portraying David, North was required to change his voice to fit the role. The first voice he proposed to Druckmann was ultimately chosen for the game; he describes it as [...] "very quiet ... and the voice can break a little". To portray the character, North approached his personality from multiple perspectives, viewing David as a [...] "survivor". North empathized with David, stating that most of David's actions were understandable when considering the apocalyptic situation. He felt that David was initially attempting to protect Ellie, who was viewed as a [...] "glimmer of hope". Prior to the writing of the script, David was referred to as the [...] "cannibal king", and it was known that Ellie would encounter <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> would change her. When North was cast, the team found it interesting to make David charismatic, and infatuated with Ellie.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} summer, 1943, the USAAF fighters {{operated}} over German air {{space for the}} first time. Several aircraft crashed near Aachen {{on the cusp of}} Germany's west border. Galland presented these wrecks as proof that the Luftwaffe was facing <b>an</b> <b>enemy</b> <b>that</b> could soon escort its heavy bombers with fighter aircraft to industrial targets inside Germany. Galland submitted his findings to Göring. Göring was livid with Galland and the fighter force. The Reichsmarschall called the report the [...] "rantings of a worn-out defeatist", and gave Galland an [...] "order", that no Allied fighters had crossed into Germany. Göring declared the only possible reason could have been that short range fighters ran out of fuel at high altitude and [...] "they were shot down much further west... and glided quite a distance before they crashed. Galland and Milch denied this. Galland questioned why an Allied pilot would choose to glide east instead of west. Both men also argued that they must increase fighter production to reach a three or fourfold advantage over the attackers immediately to prepare for this new threat. Galland's efforts to produce a fighter force fit for a war of attrition conflicted with Göring's bias in favour of bombers, to maintain the offensive on all fronts. It was a policy the Reichsmarschall persisted with until the autumn, 1943.|$|E
