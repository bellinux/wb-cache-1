500|$|... "Four Rusted Horses" [...] is a blues-inspired rock song, and was {{compared}} {{to the work of}} The Doors and Johnny Cash. Manson described its lyric as being [...] "almost a nursery rhyme. [...] everyone thinks that I was singing about the apocalypse, but it's more just about the four of us, my band, that managed to survive through <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> {{where do we go from}} here." [...] "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] is an uptempo rock song which was described by The Quietus as [...] "classic Manson". Caren Gibson of Metal Hammer claimed that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Chain Reaction" [...] by Diana Ross, as well as the work of Depeche Mode. [...] "Blank and White" [...] deals with censorship, specifically the reaction to Time magazine's cover story [...] "Is God Dead?", which saw protesters brandishing blank picket signs. The lyric [...] "God is dead but god is still white / So shoot up the mall, the school or the president of whatever / Or whoever wants a fight" [...] was censored by Interscope on all editions of the album. Manson has said that this made him happy artistically, as [...] "the song is about censorship, and they censored [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1891, after Mikhail Protopopov's article [...] "The Sick Talent" [...] was published, Leskov {{responded with}} a letter of gratitude, {{pointing}} out: [...] "You've judged me better than those who wrote of me in the past.

Class prejudices and false piety, religious stereotypes, nationalistic narrow-mindedness, what with having to defend the state with its glory...

2500|$|The album's opener, [...] "Doll", {{involves}} {{the fear of}} entering into situations unprepared. [...] "Wind Up" [...] was written {{about the relationship between}} musicians and journalists, wherein the latter tend to paint the former as convicted and reluctant. [...] "My Hero" [...] criticizes idolatry and instead extolls friends who are ordinary heroes, which has been considered a statement on fame and partially inspired by former bandmate Kurt Cobain. On the record's closing track, [...] "New Way Home," [...] Grohl longs for his hometown and recalls the drive there on Highway 99. Through this journey, [...] "I realise that it’s OK, I can make my way through <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> I’m not that freaked out at the end." [...] Three types of songs permeate the record: ballads, up-tempo tracks and combinations of the two. Grohl felt they were representative of the specific emotions he would feel after the divorce.|$|E

Andrew was loyal to his father, but realised that Paul {{stood in his}} way of future success. Smith said [...] "Andrew has tried to gain his dad's approval, but Paul refuses to see his good intentions, leaving Andrew to resort to desperate measures {{to get what he}} wants." [...] Paul's wife, Rebecca, had discovered that he embezzled money from Lassiter's, had sex with Diana, threatened her son and exposed Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) secret. Rebecca felt betrayed by <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> Hall observed that [...] "Rebecca's hurt turns to rage". Following Paul's fall, Rebecca arrived at the scene within a few seconds. Rebecca's son, Declan Napier, went against Paul and tried to take over Lassiter's. When Paul found out he threatened both Declan's mother and daughter, India (Alia and Gabriella DeVercelli). Declan told Rebecca that Paul cannot hurt her {{and get away with it}} shortly before Paul was pushed. Of the situation, Mullally commented [...] "When Declan sees that Paul is the cause of his mother's traumatic state, in addition to his own professional failure, he's had enough." ...|$|E

[...] The school acquired the nickname 'Berkeley of the South' during this period, in reference to similar student activities at the University of California, Berkeley and is also purported to be the site of the genesis of [...] "streaking," [...] which is said to have first been observed on Landis Green. [...] Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly one morning with a chair and spent the day, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students. [...] Elements of free speech activism still exist at FSU today. [...] The Center for Participant Education was established in 1970 [...] as an alternative to traditional university academics. [...] Its purpose is to allow students to [...] "explore socially relevant topics and to foster a healthier philosophy of education through classes in which anyone could teach or attend. Since then, CPE has been investigated by the Legislature, suspended by the Board of Regents, and challenged by FSU administration.

Nothing that men could offer would induce him to leave Khartoum till its inhabitants were rescued. The Government on their side were equally stubborn. Nothing, however sacred, should induce them to send troops to Khartoum, or in any way involve themselves {{in the middle of}} Africa.
