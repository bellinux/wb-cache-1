5|$|In Baraga and Marquette counties, US41/M-28 {{passes through}} hilly terrain before {{entering}} the urban areas of Ishpeming, Negaunee and Marquette. Approximately 13,000–17,000vehicles use this section from Ishpeming eastward through Negaunee. West {{of the city of}} Marquette, US41/M-28 had a peak 2013 AADT of 32,805vehicles in Marquette Township along a retail and business corridor. This peak level is sustained until the start of the Marquette Bypass, where the traffic returns to the 16,500-vehicle <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> seen in Ishpeming and Negaunee. South of the city of Marquette, traffic counts once again climb to 19,620vehicles. In Chocolay Township the AADT drops to 8,840vehicles before tapering off to 3,065vehicles by the county line.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{identify}} perceptions of built and social residential characteristics and their association with behaviors such as physical activity (PA), nutrition and smoking and with cardiovascular risk factors (elevated BMI and fasting blood glucose). Among participants of a preventive medical checkup at an Austrian District Health Insurance Fund (n= 904, response rate = 82. 2 %, 42 % women, 18 - 91 years) self-reported and measured data were collected. Total PA was positively associated with the presence of trees along the streets <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of pro-physical activity social modeling (SM) and it was negatively related to perceived safety from crime. More leisure-time PA was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of cycling/walking infrastructure <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM. PA for transportation was positively related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of connectivity <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM. Better behavioral cardiovascular risk factor profiles (smoking and nutrition) were associated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of total PA. Lower BMI values were associated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of infrastructure <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM.

The US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute urged saturated fats be replaced with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, listing olive and canola oils as sources of healthier monounsaturated oils while soybean and sunflower oils as good sources of polyunsaturated fats.

The new 1.8-litre 2ZR-FE Dual VVT-i - with variable valve timing for both intake and exhaust camshafts - will be the only engine available for the Australian model, promising better fuel economy than before, it also regains its 100kW power output. This figure decreased when the old model's 1.8-litre four-cylinder engine dropped to 93kW of power and 161Nm of torque (from 171Nm) in late 2005 to meet the 2006 Euro IV emissions requirements. A new 6-speed manual gearbox is standard, with a 4-speed automatic optional, despite speculation of a 5-speed like the new Honda Civic, a robotized 5-speed optional in the European Auris, or a CVT available in the Japanese model.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the social}} {{activity}} hypothesis, more frequent participation in social situations creates more frequent, <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels,</b> of positive affect. Therefore, {{it is believed that}} since extraverts are characterized as more sociable than introverts, they also possess higher levels of positive affect brought on by social interactions. Specifically, the results of Furnham and Brewin's study (1990) suggest that extraverts enjoy and participate more in social activities than introverts, and as a result extraverts report higher level of happiness. Also, in the study of Argyle and Lu (1990) extraverts were found to be less likely to avoid participation in noisy social activities, and to be more likely to participate in social activities such as: party games, jokes, or going to the cinema. Similar results were reported by Diener, , and Emmons (1984) who found that extraverts seek social situations more often than introverts, especially when engaging in recreational activities.|$|E
25|$|Agreeableness is of {{fundamental}} importance to psychological well-being, predicting mental health, positive affect, and {{good relations with}} others. In both childhood and adolescence agreeableness has been tied to externalizing issues. Along with this {{it has also been}} implicated in outcomes to conflict management skills, school adjustment, peer-social status and self-esteem. Some work has been done looking into whether agreeableness levels through childhood have effects on adjustment and agreeableness into adulthood. Among young adults, individuals that have been diagnosed with either externalizing as well as internalizing disorders present lower levels of agreeableness and communion, <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of negative emotionality, than those young adults without such disorders. Agreeableness also is reported to mediate links between anger and depression in young adults. Among college students, agreeableness is often associated with self-reports of emotional experience and control along with psycho-physiological responses to affectively charged stimuli. Across adulthood, low agreeableness {{has been found to be}} a health risk. High agreeableness, especially trust and honesty, has been linked to longevity.|$|E

500|$|Throughout 33 {{studies on}} gender differences, a small {{significant}} effect (r = [...]06) {{has been found}} indicating that a base-rate of 10% more females are able to delay rewards than males, which is the typical percentage of difference found between the sexes on measures such as personality or social behavior.

Further studies are needed to analyze if this minute difference begins at a certain age (e.g., puberty) or if it has a stable magnitude throughout the lifespan. Some researchers suggest this gender difference may correspond with a mother's tendency to sacrifice her wants and needs in order to meet those of her child more frequently than a father does.|$|E
