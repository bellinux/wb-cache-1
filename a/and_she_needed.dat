However, Yūkei opened the shutter out of curiosity, and when he peeked inside, there was a mountain of human bones piled up inside. Dumbfounded by this sight, Yūkei recalled a rumor of an onibaba at Adachigahara who would kill travelers and devour their blood and meat, and he got the feeling that this old lady was the rumored onibaba, so he fled the cave.|$|E

Garza reached out to Martínez and told her that the assassins wanted more money. He met with her three times in April 1993 wearing a wire, and had Martínez agree to contact Cisneros to give Garza the money. Police arrested Martínez on April 6 and agreed to work with them to incriminate Cisneros. The next morning, she scheduled a meeting with Cisneros and told her that the assassins requested more money, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to pay. They rode around Brownsville and Cisneros's voice was recorded. The police kept close to the car to stay within the transmitter's signal range. Only portions of the conversation were recorded because the police were unable to remain within range all the time. While in the car, Cisneros gave Martínez an envelope with US$500. Cisneros then asked Martínez if there was any evidence that she had orchestrated the murder. Cisneros mentioned Garza and a man known as [...] "El Cortado," [...] though investigators had no idea who he was. In the recorded conversation, there was no incriminating evidence against the gunmen. since {{there was no evidence that}} Cisneros employed them, or that the assassins murdered Fischer. The meeting concluded when police pulled the vehicle over and arrested Cisneros. She told a police officer that she owed Martínez some money, which Martínez later admitted was not the case.|$|E

In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team.

2500|$|Sackville-West {{constantly}} {{sought to}} improve Woolf's self-esteem, telling {{her not to}} think of herself as a sickly semi-reclusive who needed to hide herself from the world, but rather praised her for her health, her liveliness and sense of wit, her intelligence and achievements as a writer. Sackville-West led Woolf to a reappraisal of herself, helping her to develop a more positive self-image, and a sense that her writings were the products of her strengths, rather than her weakness. From the age of 15 on, Woolf had been led to believe by her father's doctor and her father that reading and writing had a deleterious effect on her nerves, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>needed</b> to engage in physical labour like gardening to prevent a total collapse of her nerves, leading Woolf to spend her time obsessively engaging in physical labor. Woolf tended to push herself relentlessly until illness, whether real or imagined, became the only way that she could relax without guilt. Sackville-West was the first to persuade Woolf that her nervous aliments had been misdiagnosed, and she was better to engage in reading and writing to calm her nerves, advice that was taken. Under her influence, Woolf learned to spend her time switching from one form of intellectual activity to another, from writing a novel to a book review to reading a book, instead of spending her time in physical activities that sapped her strength. In 1925, Sackville-West wrote to Woolf: [...] "Why do you give so much of your energies to the manuscripts of other people? You told me in London that you had at least six novels in your head but were being severe with yourself until you should go to Rodmell. Now you are at Rodmell and what of the six novels? Between Ottoline, Gertrude Stein, and bridal parties which cause you to faint, what time is there for Virginia?" [...] Sackville-West tried to persuade Woolf to learn to relax without guilt, telling her she would feel better if she only learned to rest.|$|E
