5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and <b>acceptor</b> <b>site)</b> can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and {{is seen as a}} band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.|$|E

25|$|Pre-mRNAs of the Transformer (Tra) gene of Drosophila melanogaster undergo {{alternative}} splicing via the alternative <b>acceptor</b> <b>site</b> mode. The gene Tra encodes a protein that is expressed only in females. The primary transcript of this gene contains an intron with two possible acceptor sites. In males, the upstream <b>acceptor</b> <b>site</b> is used. This causes a longer version of exon 2 {{to be included}} in the processed transcript, including an early stop codon. The resulting mRNA encodes a truncated protein product that is inactive. Females produce the master sex determination protein Sex lethal (Sxl). The Sxl protein is a splicing repressor that binds to an ISS in the RNA of the Tra transcript near the upstream <b>acceptor</b> <b>site,</b> preventing U2AF protein from binding to the polypyrimidine tract. This prevents the use of this junction, shifting the spliceosome binding to the downstream <b>acceptor</b> <b>site.</b> Splicing at this point bypasses the stop codon, which is excised as part of the intron. The resulting mRNA encodes an active Tra protein, which itself is a regulator of {{alternative splicing}} of other sex-related genes (see dsx above).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that saturable {{high-capacity}} nuclear binding <b>sites</b> (termed <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites)</b> for the avian oviduct progesterone receptor can be reconstituted by rehybridizing a specific oviduct chromatin protein fraction (CP- 3) to pure hen DNA to generate a reconstituted nucleoacidic protein (NAP). Only a limited number of <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> can be generated on hen DNA even at high protein/DNA ratios. This suggests the existence of a limited number of specific sequences in the avian genome that can participate in the <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites.</b> The studies presented in this paper show a specificity as to the source of DNA that can generate <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> using hen oviduct CP- 3 protein. The acceptor protein binds to all DNAs but generates <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> only on DNAs from certain animals. The <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> for the progesterone receptor, generated with heterologous mammalian DNAs and the avian oviduct CP- 3 fraction, show saturation not only in number of <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> generated on the DNAs but also in progesterone receptor binding. Binding to these sites is also receptor dependent. Using oviduct receptors from particular physiological states of the birds wherein the receptors do not bind to nuclear sites in vivo, {{it was found that the}} cell-free binding to these heterologous complexes of hen CP- 3 protein and DNA from another species, termed heterologous NAP, is similarly absent. Thus, the cell-free binding to the native oviduct NAP and the heterologous NAP markedly resembles the nuclear binding in vivo. Interestingly, synthetic DNAs rich in adenine and thymine, but not those rich in guanine and cytosine, are capable of generating <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites.</b> Species-specific DNA sequences, as well as specific chromatin proteins, therefore, appear to be involved in the nuclear <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> for the avian oviduct progesterone receptor. The DNA sequences appear to be conserved throughout most of the vertebrates but not among nonvertebrates as are the steroid hormones and their receptors. The exact numbers and distributions of these sequences in the avian genome are not known...|$|R

Mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylation is catalyzed by different ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) that have different subcellular localizations and modify different amino acid <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites.</b> However, our knowledge of ADP-ribosylated proteins and their acceptor amino acids is still limited {{due to the lack}} of suitable mass spectrometry (MS) tools.

The presence of diagnostic ions of ADP-ribose in the HCD spectra allowed us to detect putative ADP-ribosylated peptides to target in a second LC-MS/MS analysis. The combination of HCD with ETD fragmentation gave a more comprehensive coverage of ADP-ribosylation sites than that with HCD alone.

Therefore, while the mutation to the human Per2 gene results in a similarly shortened period as in the CK1ε-tau hamsters, the biological mechanisms behind each phenotype are a result of disruptions to different parts of the clock pathway.|$|E
40|$|Conjugation {{of small}} ubiquitin-like {{modifier}} (SUMO) to substrates {{is involved in}} a large number of cellular processes. Typically, SUMO is conjugated to lysine residues within a SUMO consensus site; however, an increasing number of proteins are sumoylated on non-consensus sites. To appreciate the functional consequences of sumoylation, the identification of SUMO attachment sites is of critical importance. Discovery of SUMO <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> is usually performed by a laborious mutagenesis approach or using MS. In MS, identification of SUMO <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> in higher eukaryotes is hampered by the large tryptic fragments of SUMO 1 and SUMO 2 / 3. MS search engines in combination with known databases lack the possibility to search MSMS spectra for larger modifications, such as sumoylation. Therefore, we developed a simple and straightforward database search tool (“ChopNSpice”) that successfully allows identification of SUMO <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> from proteins sumoylated in vivo and in vitro. By applying this approach we identified SUMO <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> in, among others, endogenous SUMO 1, SUMO 2, RanBP 2, and Ubc 9...|$|R

In the proposed transition state, one of the thiourea N-H donors is coordinated to the Michael acceptor and will stabilize the negative charge buildup.

25|$|This is {{an example}} of exon skipping. The intron {{upstream}} from exon 4 has a polypyrimidine tract that doesn't match the consensus sequence well, so that U2AF proteins bind poorly to it without assistance from splicing activators. This 3' splice <b>acceptor</b> <b>site</b> is therefore not used in males. Females, however, produce the splicing activator Transformer (Tra) (see below). The SR protein Tra2 is produced in both sexes and binds to an ESE in exon 4; if Tra is present, it binds to Tra2 and, along with another SR protein, forms a complex that assists U2AF proteins in binding to the weak polypyrimidine tract. U2 is recruited to the associated branchpoint, and this leads to inclusion of exon 4 in the mRNA.|$|E

However, binding of progesterone-receptor to chromatin was greater than that of oestradiol-receptor. Binding also increased more after removal of histones and masking acidic proteins, suggesting the presence of a greater number of progesterone-receptor <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> in hypothalamic chromatin than of estradiol-receptor <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites.</b> The failure to demonstrate a sex-related difference in oestradiol-receptor binding to hypothalamic chromatin in vitro is discussed...|$|R

These enriched binding elements exhibited markedly enhanced PR binding on a per mass DNA basis compared to chromatin (20 - to 25 -fold) or dehistonized chromatin (4 - to 5 -fold). Electrophoretic analysis of the nuclease-resistant DNA showed that there is a set of DNA fragments of 100 - 150 base pairs that are protected from digestion. Excessive digestion resulted in smaller DNA fragments and a loss of PR binding activity. The PR binding was saturable using a crude receptor preparation and displayed a competition with the same receptor preparation that was labeled with nonradioactive progesterone. The enhanced binding was also demonstrable using highly purified receptor preparations that exhibit two classes of binding sites both of which are of high affinity and saturable as assessed by Scatchard analyses. These two high-affinity classes of binding sites are shown to be competed by unlabeled purified PR.

40|$|In {{regulating}} {{gene expression}} in mammalian tissues, steroid hormones bind to cytoplasmic receptors {{and the resulting}} complex associates with the nucleus. In an attempt to study this nuclear association under more precisely controlled conditions, we examined the binding of receptor-[(3) H]steroid complexes to isolated nuclei. Two systems were used: the glucocorticoid-responsive hepatoma cell and the estrogen-sensitive immature rat uterus. Cell-free nuclear binding resembles that observed in the intact cell; it requires the receptor-steroid complex in the appropriate form ("active" complex); it is of high affinity; and it appears to involve about 4000 nuclear <b>acceptor</b> <b>sites</b> per haploid genome. Furthermore, whether binding occurs in intact cells or in cell-free extracts, complexes dissociate from nuclei at similar rates, {{and the ability of}} NaCl to extract either type of nuclear-bound complex and the sedimentation velocities of the extracted complexes are identical.

Within the intron, a donor site (5' end of the intron), a branch site (near the 3' end of the intron) and an <b>acceptor</b> <b>site</b> (3' end of the intron) are required for splicing. The splice donor site includes an almost invariant sequence GU at the 5' end of the intron, within a larger, less highly conserved region. The splice <b>acceptor</b> <b>site</b> at the 3' end of the intron terminates the intron with an almost invariant AG sequence. Upstream (5'-ward) from the AG there is a region high in pyrimidines (C and U), or polypyrimidine tract. Further upstream from the polypyrimidine tract is the branchpoint, which includes an adenine nucleotide involved in lariat formation. The consensus sequence for an intron (in IUPAC nucleic acid notation) is: G-G-cut-G-U-R-A-G-U (donor site) ... intron sequence ...
