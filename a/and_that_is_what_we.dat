[...] Under the {{management}} of John Pemberton, the side were seeking to replicate {{the success of the}} previous season when they had reached the final of the FA Youth Cup final. [...] Shorn of a number of key players (who had either graduated to the first team or left the club), the team completed a solid but unspectacular season. [...] Results fluctuated with impressive victories over the likes of Everton, Bolton and Sunderland being mixed with heavy defeats to Leeds United, Coventry City and West Ham United. [...] Eventually finishing fifth (out of ten teams) in their division, manager John Pemberton described the season as [...] "another successful one for everyone associated with the Academy. We have five players becoming professionals who will all be linking up with the first team next season <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are judged on – producing players." ...|$|E

On the day of the final OTA, June 12, Tomlin stated that while he was pleased with the progress of the team, no positions would be gained or lost based on the voluntary camp. Tomlin added, [...] "it's been teach-oriented, it's been skill-develop-oriented. It's different than playing the game of football." [...] The team was given 44days off until the beginning of training camp.|$|E

500|$|Home's {{attention}} was mainly {{concentrated on the}} Cold War, where his forcefully expressed anti-communist beliefs were tempered by a pragmatic {{approach to dealing with}} the Soviet Union. His first major problem in this sphere was in 1961 when on the orders of the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, the Berlin Wall was erected to stop East Germans escaping to West Germany via West Berlin. Home wrote to his American counterpart, Dean Rusk, [...] "The prevention of East Berliners getting into West Berlin has never been a casus belli for us. We are concerned with Western access to Berlin <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> must maintain." [...] The governments of West Germany, Britain and the US quickly reached agreement on their joint negotiating position; it remained to persuade President de Gaulle of France to align himself with the allies. During their discussions Macmillan commented that de Gaulle showed [...] "all the rigidity of a poker without its occasional warmth". An agreement was reached, and the allies tacitly recognised that the wall was going to remain in place. The Soviets for their part did not seek to cut off allied access to West Berlin through East German territory.|$|E
