5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed <b>and</b> <b>breathe</b> {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E

For the special effects team, one of the hardest parts of the episode was to hide the fact that Lawless was wearing a swimming suit.|$|E
5|$|Sponges are {{worldwide}} in their distribution, {{living in a}} wide range of ocean habitats, from the polar regions to the tropics. Most live in quiet, clear waters, because sediment stirred up by waves or currents would block their pores, making it difficult for them to feed <b>and</b> <b>breathe.</b> The greatest numbers of sponges are usually found on firm surfaces such as rocks, but some sponges can attach themselves to soft sediment by means of a root-like base.|$|E

40|$|SummarySleep <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> are {{physiological}} {{processes that}} begin in utero and undergo progressive change. While the major period of change for both sleep <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> occurs {{during the months}} after birth, considered a period of vulnerability, more subtle changes continue to occur throughout childhood. The systems that control sleep <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> develop separately, but sleep represents an activity state during which <b>breathing</b> <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> control is significantly altered. Infants and young children may spend up to 12 hours a day sleeping; therefore, the effects of sleep on breathing are fundamental to understanding both processes in childhood. This review summarizes the current literature relevant to understanding the normal development of sleep <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> across infancy <b>and</b> childhood...|$|R

25|$|The therapsids had {{sprawling}} forelimbs and semi-erect hindlimbs. This {{suggests that}} Carrier's constraint {{would have made}} it rather difficult for them to move <b>and</b> <b>breathe</b> at the same time, but not as difficult as it is for animals such as lizards, which have completely sprawling limbs. Advanced therapsids may therefore have been significantly less active than modern mammals of similar size and so may have had slower metabolisms overall or else been bradymetabolic (lower metabolism when at rest).|$|E
25|$|Body {{temperature}} {{is not well}} regulated during REM sleep, and thus organisms become more sensitive to temperatures outside their thermoneutral zone. Cats and other small furry mammals will shiver <b>and</b> <b>breathe</b> faster to regulate temperature during NREMS but not during REMS. With the loss of muscle tone, animals lose the ability to regulate temperature through body movement. (However, even cats with pontine lesions preventing muscle atonia during REM did not regulate their temperature by shivering.) Neurons which typically activate in response to cold temperatures—triggers for neural thermoregulation—simply do not fire during REM sleep, {{as they do in}} NREM sleep and waking.|$|E

25|$|Breathing during {{locomotion}} {{has been}} studied in three species, and they show different patterns. Adult female green sea turtles do not breathe as they crutch along their nesting beaches. They hold their breath during terrestrial locomotion <b>and</b> <b>breathe</b> in bouts as they rest. North American box turtles breathe continuously during locomotion, and the ventilation cycle is not coordinated with the limb movements. This is because they use their abdominal muscles to breathe during locomotion. The last species to have been studied is the red-eared slider, which also breathes during locomotion, but takes smaller breaths during locomotion than during small pauses between locomotor bouts, indicating {{that there may be}} mechanical interference between the limb movements and the breathing apparatus. Box turtles have also been observed to breathe while completely sealed up inside their shells.|$|E

The experimental group received the relaxation <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> training for hypertensive patients in 13 sessions of 60 minutes and had blood pressure monitored before and after each session. The control group had blood pressure monitored weekly. It was observed that the relaxation <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> training for hypertensive patients reduced the stress index and symptoms in the experimental group in isolation, except when compared to the control group. However, it did not reduce the levels of blood pressure in the experimental group in comparison to the control group.

In 2008, the group toured with groups such as Tyga, Metro Station, Boys Like Girls, The White Tie Affair, and Forever The Sickest Kids. Their debut full-length album was released digitally on December 23, 2008 on iTunes by Universal Republic Records and physically on January 20, 2009, reaching number 31 on the Heatseekers chart. During the winter of 2008 and 2009, the group did a Hot Topic in-store tour with We The Kings and Hey Monday, performing acoustic songs and doing signings. In April 2009, Cash Cash toured with Kevin Rudolf, Hyper Crush, and Jeremy Greene on the Let it Rock tour. Cash Cash played the main stage at Bamboozle in May 2009 and then toured the United Kingdom opening for Cobra Starship. That summer they performed on the Vans Warped Tour.

25|$|In aerobic {{cells with}} {{sufficient}} oxygen, {{as in most}} human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to acetyl-CoA, giving off one carbon atom as the waste product carbon dioxide, generating another reducing equivalent as NADH. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the citric acid cycle, producing two more molecules of ATP, six more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via FADH2 as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and quinol molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an electron transport system transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released {{energy in the form}} of a proton gradient over a membrane (inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes). Thus, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD+ and quinone are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen <b>and</b> <b>breathe</b> out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and quinol is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional 28 molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle). It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.|$|E
