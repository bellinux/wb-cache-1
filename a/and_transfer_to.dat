5|$|Following {{the season}} on March 28, both Andrew Dakich and Mark Donnal {{announced}} that they would graduate <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> other programs as 5th-year graduate transfers. On April 10, both D. J. Wilson and Moe Wagner declared for the 2017 NBA draft, but did not hire agents, which gave them until May 24 to withdraw their names and retain their athletic eligibility to return to Michigan. 57 of the 78 players who declared for the 2016 NBA draft without hiring an agent withdrew their names. On May 1, Donnal {{announced that he would}} use his final year of eligibility to play with the 2017–18 Clemson Tigers. On May 24, Wagner withdrew his name from the NBA draft and Wilson did not.|$|E

5|$|The {{treatment}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and {{the presence or absence}} of underlying causes. If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1–2), it indicates that a liver transplant may be required, <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> a specialist centre is advised. Hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Agreeing to this proposal, Crisp became first a Seaman and by {{the summer}} of 1916 a Skipper in the Royal Naval Reserve, {{arranging}} for his son to join the crew of his boat, the HM Armed Smack I'll Try, armed with a 3–pounder gun. On 1 February 1917 in the North Sea, I'll Try had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the smack and her companion the larger Boy Alfred. Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes, both smacks scored hits on their larger opponents and reported them as probable sinkings, although post–war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date. Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a present of £200 for this action, and Crisp was offered a promotion <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> an ocean–going Q–ship. He was forced to turn down this offer due to his wife's sudden and terminal illness. She died in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} Re d'Italia <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> Affondatore, though none of his {{subordinates}} on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, though he failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians then turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrian ships concentrated their fire on Re d'Italia, paying particular attention to her stern. In their attempts to ram her, one of the Austrian ships destroyed Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her unmaneuverable.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} his {{flagship}} <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships {{were aware of the}} change. They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of the}} fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, in an attempt to split the Italian line and initiate a melee. He failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass, so he turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrians quickly inflicted serious damage on Re d'Italia and Palestro, eventually sinking both ships. After Palestro withdrew, the Austrian ironclads turned their attention to the 3rd Division, including Re di Portogallo.|$|E
