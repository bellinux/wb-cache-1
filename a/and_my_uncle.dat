500|$|After dinner a {{book would}} be read aloud, {{and he would}} take notes in a cursory way. [...] I {{remember}} {{that one of his}} friends, when the reader pronounced a word wrongly, checked him and made him read it again, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> said to him, [...] "Did you not catch the meaning?" [...] When his friend said [...] "yes," [...] he remarked, [...] "Why then did you make him turn back? [...] We have lost more than ten lines through your interruption." [...] So jealous was he of every moment lost.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} credit family members with {{introducing}} them to rock music through old collections of vinyl records. [...] Boone Daughdrill cites [...] "When the Levee Breaks" [...] as his biggest influence. [...] "When I heard that drum fill {{come in the}} intro...oh! [...] I {{was a little kid}} <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> had all of the Zeppelin records. He was a drummer too and he would always be like, 'Man, check these guys out.' I was only three or four and I didn’t know what music was, but I knew that I loved that." ...|$|E
60|$|I said no more, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> did not {{continue}} the conversation.|$|E
6000|$|Lor. 'Tis moderate--not even {{life for}} life, the rule [...] Denounced of {{retribution}} from all time; [...] They owe me still <b>my</b> father's <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle's.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, I won't. If you, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncles,</b> <b>and</b> Aunt Margaret, will consent, I will go {{whenever}} you choose. Of course I must do just as I'm told." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} {{to this day}} the grasp of Prince Roman's bony, wrinkled hand closing on my small inky paw, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle's</b> half-serious, half-amused way of {{looking down at his}} trespassing nephew.|$|R
60|$|The Widow Canby <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> {{listened with}} close {{attention}} until I had finished.|$|E
60|$|A {{friend of}} mine? What friends had I? My husband was far away; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> Starkweather {{had given me}} up in despair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah; {{but your}} father, Frank, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle.</b> I can never {{bring myself to}} do {{anything}} that shall bring either of them to sorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dad {{helped me}} make out this list," [...] {{explained}} Dick. [...] "He <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncles</b> have had quite some experience hunting, and, of course, they knew just what to take along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{could not}} see how {{this was to be}} done, as we were {{surrounded}} by people on all sides. But, at the third sounding of the trumpets, a lane opened as if by word of command, betwixt me and the champion, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle's</b> voice said, [...] "Now, Lilias, NOW!" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{enough of}} this {{disaster}} of <b>my</b> marriage <b>and</b> of <b>my</b> early love affairs; I have told {{all that is needed}} for my picture to explain how I came to take up aeroplane experiments and engineering science; let me get back to my essential story, to Tono-Bungay <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle's</b> promotions <b>and</b> to the vision of the world these things have given me.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>Uncle</b> Felix motioned me majestically {{into his}} office with one hand, while with the other he pointed in bitter scorn at the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no jest whatever," [...] said Diana; [...] "you {{are accused}} of robbing this man, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> {{believes}} {{it as well as}} I did." ...|$|E
60|$|THE PRINCESS. Well, {{she wore}} my jewels {{and one of}} my dresses at a rather {{improper}} ball with her young man; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> saw her.|$|E
6000|$|How {{bright and}} warm {{it was in}} the kitchen with mother putting things to rights while father <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncles</b> leaned their chairs against the wall and talked of the west and of moving. [...] "I can't get away till after New Year's," [...] father said. [...] "But I'm going. I'll never put in another crop on these hills." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> {{retorted}} {{with some}} inquiries {{about the great}} people of Bladesover, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> mother answered {{in the character of}} a personal friend of Lady Drew's. The talk hung for a time, <b>and</b> then <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> embarked upon a dissertation upon Wimblehurst.|$|R
60|$|We {{procured}} {{some water}} <b>and</b> bathed <b>my</b> <b>uncle's</b> face, <b>and</b> Mr. Canning poured some wine {{that was in}} the desk down his throat.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think not. Their {{rooms are}} {{too far off}} for overhearing, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> saw as little of them as possible. Mrs. Giles was Sam's nurse, and cares for him {{more than any other}} creature; she would not say a word against him even if she knew anything; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> would never have complained. He was fond of Sam to the last, proud of his steeple-chases and his cleverness, and desperately afraid of him; in a sort of bondage, entirely past daring to speak.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{have heard}} bad news. My father <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> were {{attacked}} by some man who tried to ransack the house. My uncle was seriously hurt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{between me}} <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle,</b> and I pay him rent for his part. He's a clergyman you know, {{and he has}} a living in Lincolnshire,--not far off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your lack of {{foresight}} chiefly in indulging {{feelings that}} were not encouraged. That, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle's</b> indiscreet permission to you to travel with us, have precipitated our relations {{in a way that}} I could neither foresee nor avoid, though of late I have had apprehensions that it might come to this. You vex and disturb me by such words of regret.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle's</b> {{gestures}} <b>and</b> promises {{filled me}} with doubt and a sort of fear for him. He seemed to me a lost little creature, too silly to be silent, in a vast implacable condemnation. I was full of pity and a sort of tenderness for my aunt Susan, who was doomed to follow his erratic fortunes mocked by his grandiloquent promises.|$|R
60|$|This {{thought had}} never {{occurred}} to me before, and I gave it considerable attention. When I came to review the whole matter I discovered that in reality I knew very little of my own affairs. I had taken many things for granted, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle's</b> word on all occasions. Whether this was for the best was still to be seen.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no parents. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle,</b> {{with whom}} I lived before I {{was brought to}} this awful place, he loves Jim. He always wanted me to marry him." ...|$|E
60|$|March came in {{that year}} like a lion, {{exceedingly}} hungry and fierce, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>Uncle</b> Hugh had ridden away through the storm nor thought to be back for some days.|$|E
6000|$|Oh, the wild, wild scamperings {{over the}} breezy common--the dog {{trying to catch}} a swallow, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle,</b> unable to hold him back, {{following}} {{at the other end}} of the chain! ...|$|E
50|$|Krsto Papić, 79, Croatian screenwriter <b>and</b> film {{director}} (<b>My</b> <b>Uncle's</b> Legacy).|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} wait here," [...] she said, [...] "I'll go upstairs <b>and</b> see <b>my</b> <b>uncle.</b> If I {{see that it}} is in any way possible, I will do as you ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What freedom {{more than}} we now enjoy Katherine, is needed by two young women? Think you I can remain silent, <b>and</b> see <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> betrayed before <b>my</b> eyes? his life perhaps endangered!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, Sir Lothian: I shall {{hope to see}} you." [...] They bowed, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> stood {{a little}} time looking after him {{as he made his}} way amidst the crowd.|$|E
6000|$|... "P.P.S. I {{hear that}} the Sahara {{flotation}} was really a success, notwithstanding the Judge attacks. Sir Robert <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> have made millions. I wonder how long they will keep them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray sit down, sir," [...] {{said the}} girl; [...] "we have been expecting you for some time, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> {{told me to}} act the part of hostess till his return." ...|$|E
6000|$|I turned, <b>and</b> saw <b>my</b> <b>uncle.</b> He was {{disguised}} in {{a costume}} of reddish-brown cloth. [...] "Golf here?" [...] said I, and then I noticed the tricycle. [...] "A vagrom man on wheels!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Aubrey decided for Leonard's room, and {{was taken}} {{through the front door}} into a {{vestibule}} paved with white stone, with black lozenges at the intersections. 'There,' said Leonard, 'the office is here, you see, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncle's</b> rooms beyond, all on the ground floor, he is too infirm to go up-stairs. This way is the dining-room, and Sam has got a sitting-room beyond, then there are the servants' rooms. It is a great place, and horridly empty.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... “During my stay at Michigan State,” Demain later said, “I {{worked in}} Fred Fabian’s lab on {{spoilage}} (softening) of pickles. In the summers, I worked for <b>my</b> father <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>uncles.</b> <b>My</b> summer responsibilities from 1947 to 1950 were {{to start in}} South Carolina, buying cucumbers from farmers and shipping them by truck to my father’s pickle factory. I followed the cucumber crop virtually state by state from South Carolina to Wisconsin. During this trip north, I also worked at <b>my</b> <b>uncle’s</b> pickle plant in North Carolina, my father’s plant in Maryland, and ran a pickling plant in Brodhead, Wisconsin. During my periods of work at <b>my</b> <b>uncle’s</b> plant, I met Professor John ('Jack') Lincoln Etchells of the US Department of Agriculture and North Carolina State University. When <b>my</b> <b>uncle’s</b> fermentations went awry, they often called on Jack to come to Ayden and recommend measures to correct the problems. Jack became my first mentor.” At MSC Demain met and married a fellow student, Joanna (“Jody”) Kaye from Youngstown, Ohio.|$|R
