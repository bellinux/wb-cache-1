5|$|After the battle, Salih's {{head was}} sent to Cairo and put on display, while Salih's body was nailed to the gateway of Sidon, a town he had enjoyed {{residing}} in. The Fatimids went on to conquer Sidon, Ba'albak, Hims, Rafaniyya and Hisn Ibn Akkar from Salih's deputy governors, who all fled. Salih had designated his second eldest son, Thimal, as his successor and left him in charge of <b>Aleppo.</b> However, his eldest son, Nasr, who fought at al-Uqhuwanah, escaped the battle to wrest control of <b>Aleppo.</b> For a brief period, the two sons ruled <b>Aleppo</b> jointly with Nasr controlling the city and Thimal the citadel, until sometime in 1030 when Nasr compelled Thimal to relocate to al-Rahba. In 1038, Anushtakin killed Nasr and seized <b>Aleppo.</b> Thimal later restored Mirdasid rule in the city, which continued, with occasional interruption, until 1080.|$|E
5|$|In 991 he {{provided}} military {{assistance to the}} Hamdanid emir of <b>Aleppo,</b> Sa'd al-Dawla, which enabled the latter to defeat the rebel Bakjur, who with Fatimid help tried to seize <b>Aleppo.</b> Early in the next year, a Fatimid army under Manjutakin advanced on <b>Aleppo.</b> Manjutakin sent a messenger to Bourtzes, claiming that his conflict was with <b>Aleppo,</b> and did not involve the Byzantines, but Bourtzes had the messenger arrested. After defeating the Hamdanids in battle near Apamea, Manjutakin laid siege to <b>Aleppo</b> for 33 days, after which he left part of his forces behind and led the rest to confront Bourtzes, who was marching to the city's aid. At the ensuing battle at Siderophygon (Arabic Jisr al-Hadith) Bourtzes and his men were defeated. Manjutakin followed up his success by capturing the fortress of Imm, commanded by Bourtzes' nephew, and taking him and 300 troops prisoner, before embarking on a plundering raid through Byzantine territory as far as Germanikeia (Ar. Mar'ash). The Fatimid general returned to <b>Aleppo,</b> {{but was unable to}} take it and withdrew later in the year. At about the same time, the Muslim population of Laodicea, Antioch's seaport, rose in revolt, but Bourtzes was able to put it down and deported the populace to the interior of Byzantine territory in Asia Minor.|$|E
5|$|In January 1016, Mansur fled <b>Aleppo</b> {{after the}} citadel commander, Fath al-Qal'i, revolted and {{recognized}} Salih's emirate and Caliph al-Hakim's suzerainty over <b>Aleppo.</b> According to Aleppine chroniclers, the revolt was coordinated with Salih, who was restored {{his share of}} Aleppo's revenues and given custody of the mother, wives and daughters of Mansur; Salih immediately sent the women to join Mansur, but kept one of the latter's daughters, whom he married. Mansur's ouster and the subsequent disorder in northern Syria drove Basil to halt all travel and trade with Syria and Egypt, but Salih persuaded him to exempt <b>Aleppo</b> and the Kilab from these sanctions.|$|E

5|$|Several Aleppan dignitaries {{supported}} Emir Faisal and in late October 1918, {{following the}} Sharifian army's entry into <b>Aleppo,</b> {{a branch of}} the Arab Club was founded in the city. The Arab Club's ideology was a mix of Arab nationalism and Aleppine regionalism. It promoted the concept of Syrian national unity, and served as a political support base for Emir Faisal. Among the Arab Club's founders were Ibrahim Hananu, the president of <b>Aleppo</b> Vilayet's presidential council, Rashid al-Tali'a, governor of <b>Aleppo</b> Vilayet, Najib Bani Zadih, a wealthy Aleppine merchant, Abd al-Rahman al-Kayyali, an Aleppine physician and Shaykh Mas'ud al-Kawakibi, one of the city's leading Muslim scholars.|$|E
5|$|Abū ʿAlī Ṣāliḥ ibn Mirdās, {{also known}} by the laqab (honorific epithet) Asad al-Dawla ("Lion of the State") (died May 1029), was {{the founder of the}} Mirdasid dynasty of <b>Aleppo,</b> ruling between 1025 until his death. At its peak, his emirate (principality) {{encompassed}} much of the western Jazira, northern Syria and a string of central Syrian towns. With occasional interruption, Salih's descendants would rule <b>Aleppo</b> for the next five decades.|$|E
5|$|Although {{an urban}} revolt in <b>Aleppo</b> {{did not take}} place in the {{aftermath}} of the city's occupation by French forces, many of Aleppo's inhabitants engaged in passive resistance against the French and clandestinely provided material aid to Hananu's rebels fighting in the rural areas west of the city. In addition to the rebels' propaganda campaign, anti-French sentiment in <b>Aleppo</b> was growing due to socio-economic factors. These included the disruption of trade routes between <b>Aleppo</b> and its countryside, the hoarding and profiteering of flour and rising unemployment that was partially a result of an influx of Armenian refugees who had fled their villages in Turkey during the Armenian Genocide. The latter led to soaring prices for bread and subsequent food riots and famine in some of the city's neighborhoods. The French authorities also declared martial law, restricting travel and speech, further frustrating the inhabitants.|$|E
50|$|Abūʾl-Murajjā Sālim ibn al-Mustafād al-Ḥamdānī (died 1034) was the {{commander}} of <b>Aleppo's</b> ahdath (urban militia) during the reigns of the Mirdasid emirs Salih ibn Mirdas (r. 1024/25-1029) and Nasr ibn Salih (r. 1029-1038). He was executed by the latter in 1034 for stirring a local Muslim uprising against <b>Aleppo's</b> vassalage to the Christian Byzantine Empire.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Franco-Syrian War, Turkey annexed the southwestern Anatolian sanjaks (districts) that had been part of <b>Aleppo</b> Vilayet, such as Mar'ash, Gaziantep ('Ayntab), Rumkale (Qal'at Rum), Urfa (al-Ruha). These sanjaks became part of Turkey {{following}} the October 1921 treaty with France. Aleppans opposed the Turkish annexation. The Franco-Turkish treaty allowed for a resumption of commerce between <b>Aleppo</b> and the Alexandretta Sanjak, including Antioch, due to improved security conditions, but commerce between <b>Aleppo</b> and Anatolia largely ceased. Alexandretta was considered by Aleppans to be their port to the Mediterranean Sea and a crucial part of their socio-economic region. It remained part of Syria under French control, but was administered by a semi-autonomous government that was heavily influenced by Turkey. Aleppo's merchants and nationalist politicians feared this autonomy would ultimately lead to its annexation by Turkey and consequently precipitate an economic crisis in Aleppo; Alexnadretta was separated from Syria in 1938 and became part of Turkey in the following year.|$|E
5|$|At Homs, {{the brigade}} rested {{for two days}} and on 19 October headed for Er Rastan, with orders to repair a bridge over the River Orontes, which had been {{destroyed}} by retreating Turkish forces. The next day, assisted by No. 5 Field Squadron Royal Engineers, was spent repairing the bridge, after which the brigade advanced, reaching Hama on 21 October. The brigade had expected to rest there for several days but were ordered to continue the advance to <b>Aleppo.</b> The brigade was preceded by seven light armoured cars, but {{the remainder of the}} division was following a day behind. On 24 October the armoured cars' advance was stopped by Turkish defences near Khan Tuman. The Turkish held a strong defensive line on a ridge line to the south and west of <b>Aleppo.</b> The brigade was ordered to occupy a position on the Aleppo-Alexandretta road and to clear Turkish trenches on the ridge to the west of <b>Aleppo,</b> but when they reached the ridge line on 26 October, the position had been evacuated. Intelligence from locals suggested that a force of 1,000 men with two small artillery guns were heading north out of <b>Aleppo,</b> so the brigade set off in pursuit. At 11:00, the leading two Jodhpur Lancers squadrons and a machine-gun section reached a position overlooking Haritan to the north of <b>Aleppo</b> when they came under Turkish small arms fire. Harbord ordered an immediate brigade attack; the Mysore Lancers would move around to the east of the ridge and charge the village, followed by the other two Jodhpur Lancer squadrons while the remainder of the brigade machine-gun squadron would move onto the ridge to provide covering fire, with the two other Jodhpur squadrons. The armoured cars of No. 12 Light Armoured Motor Battery arrived at 11:30 and were ordered along the main road to support the attack.|$|E
5|$|Despite his rebellion, Salih paid formal {{allegiance}} to the Fatimid Caliphate after conquering <b>Aleppo,</b> and dispatched Ibn Tawq to meet az-Zahir in Cairo; in turn, az-Zahir officially recognized Salih's Mirdasid emirate and sent him numerous honorary robes and presents. There is no information about the Byzantines' relationship with Salih following the conquest of <b>Aleppo,</b> though Emperor Basil II refused to back Salih's rebellion when he appealed for Byzantine support.|$|E

5|$|Francis Marrash {{was born}} in <b>Aleppo,</b> a city of Ottoman Syria (present-day Syria), to an old Melkite family of merchants known for their {{literary}} interests. Having earned wealth and standing in the 18th century, the family was well established in <b>Aleppo,</b> although they had gone through troubles: a relative of Francis, Butrus Marrash, was martyred by Greek Orthodox fundamentalists in April 1818. Other Melkite Catholics were exiled from <b>Aleppo</b> during the persecutions, among them the priest Jibrail Marrash. Francis' father, Fathallah, tried to defuse the Sectarian conflict by writing a treatise in 1849, in which he rejected the Filioque. He had built up a large private library to give his three children Francis, Abdallah and Maryana a thorough education, particularly {{in the field of}} Arabic language and literature.|$|E
5|$|In May 1182, Saladin {{captured}} <b>Aleppo</b> {{after a brief}} siege; the {{new governor}} of the city, Imad al-Din Zangi II, had been unpopular with his subjects and surrendered <b>Aleppo</b> after Saladin agreed to restore Zangi II's previous control over Sinjar, Raqqa, and Nusaybin, which would thereafter serve as vassal territories of the Ayyubids. <b>Aleppo</b> formally entered Ayyubid hands on 12 June. The day after, Saladin marched to Harim, near the Crusader-held Antioch and captured the city when its garrison forced out their leader, Surhak, who was then briefly detained and released by al-Muzaffar Umar. The surrender of <b>Aleppo</b> and Saladin's allegiance with Zangi II had left Izz al-Din al-Mas'ud of Mosul the only major Muslim rival of the Ayyubids. Mosul had been subjected to a short siege {{in the autumn of}} 1182, but after mediation by the Abbasid caliph an-Nasir, Saladin withdrew his forces. Mas'ud attempted to align himself with the Artuqids of Mardin, but they became allies of Saladin instead. In 1183, Irbil too switched allegiance to the Ayyubids. Mas'ud then sought the support of Pahlawan ibn Muhammad, the governor of Azerbaijan, and although he did not usually intervene in the region, the possibility of Pahlawan's intervention made Saladin cautious about launching further attacks against Mosul.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} winter of 1920, Hananu's rebels {{assaulted}} French forces in Idlib {{and according to}} the British consul in <b>Aleppo,</b> looted the town and killed some of its Christian inhabitants. Hananu's victory at Idlib and the arrival of Turkish military assistance led to a French withdrawal from Idlib. Hananu's principal lieutenant commander in the Idlib operations was Tahir al-Kayyali, who also {{served as president of the}} Arab Club of <b>Aleppo</b> and Aleppo's Committee of National Defense. In early December, the French general of the 2nd Division in <b>Aleppo,</b> , assembled a column at Hammam. In mid-December, the French launched a counterattack on Idlib and burned down the city.

5|$|Mansur reached Byzantine-held Antioch {{two days}} after his flight, and Basil II ordered the catepan of that city {{to give him an}} honorable reception; {{providing}} refuge to former rulers of <b>Aleppo</b> was a common Byzantine practice because such ex-rulers could be used to pressure or threaten their successors. In his rush to escape <b>Aleppo,</b> Mansur left behind his mother, wives and daughters, who were detained by Fath, then transferred to Salih's custody. Salih then had Mansur's womenfolk safely returned to him in Antioch, {{with the exception of one}} of Mansur's daughters, whom Salih wed per his previous agreement with Mansur.|$|E
5|$|Mansur {{was the son}} of Lu'lu' al-Kabir, {{a former}} ghulām (slave soldier; pl. ghilmān) of the Hamdanid emirs of <b>Aleppo</b> who became ḥājib (chamberlain) under Emir Sa'd al-Dawla (r. 967–991). Though Sa'd was officially succeeded by his son Sa'id al-Dawla, power was {{effectively}} held by Lu'lu' al-Kabir. When Sa'id al-Dawla died in January 1002, Lu'lu' ruled <b>Aleppo</b> in the name of Sa'id al-Dawla's young sons Abu al-Hasan Ali and Abu al-Ma'ali Sharif until ousting them shortly afterward and declaring himself a ruler in his own right. Mansur ruled as his father's deputy and partner. Both Mansur and Lu'lu' harassed the remaining members of the Hamdanid dynasty in <b>Aleppo,</b> prompting one of them, Abu al-Hayja' to flee the city for Byzantine territory where he received official protection. At one point Mansur was made governor of Raqqa, which was taken from him by the Numayrid emir Waththab ibn Sabiq in 1007.|$|E

Buoyed by his victory, Mansur collected his army of ghilmān in <b>Aleppo</b> along with local toughs, Christians and Jews and confronted Salih's forces {{on the outskirts of}} <b>Aleppo.</b> The Kilab routed their opponents, killing some 2,000 Aleppines in the process, and captured Mansur. Negotiations between Salih and Mansur's representatives ensued, concluding with an agreement that freed Mansur in return for the release of Salih's brothers, a ransom of 50,000 gold dinars and the allotment of half of the Emirate of Aleppo's revenues to the Kilab. Salih was also able to remarry Tarud and was given Mansur's daughter to wed as well.
