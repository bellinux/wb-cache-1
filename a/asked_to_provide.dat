5|$|Murphy {{finds an}} ice core sample {{believed}} to originate from a meteor crater, and theorizes {{that the sample}} might be 250,000 years old. Although Bear insists on leaving, the others are concerned about infecting the outside world. When he is <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a stool sample, he attacks Mulder and tries to flee. Something moves under Bear's skin, and he dies when Hodge removes a small worm {{from the back of}} his neck. Now without a pilot, the group is informed that evacuation is impossible because of the weather.|$|E
5|$|When in 1952 Messiaen was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a {{test piece}} for flautists at the Paris Conservatoire, he {{composed}} the piece Le merle noir for flute and piano. While {{he had long}} been fascinated by birdsong, and birds had made appearances in several of his earlier works (for example La Nativité, Quatuor and Vingt regards), the flute piece was based entirely on {{the song of the}} blackbird.|$|E

5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the governor of Nueva Ecija requested then-Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to declare his province a disaster area. Additionally, UNICEF was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> water-purifying tablets. The Philippine Red Cross, Philippine government, local authorities and civic organizations provided relief assistance {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the storm. Despite private appeals for up to $1.4million for reconstruction aid, the Philippine government did not submit a request for international aid. However, by October 25, eight non-government relief agencies provided relief, which totaled $1.15million. Furthermore, the government of Switzerland provided $8,061worth of aid.|$|E
5|$|In October 1811, Aigle {{was sent}} to the Mediterranean where she and her crew raided the island of Elba before being <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> naval support during the {{invasion}} and occupation of Genoa. Refitted in January 1820, her square stern was replaced with a circular one, giving her a wider angle of fire and improved protection at the rear. Converted to a corvette in 1831, she returned to the Mediterranean under Lord Paget. From 1852, she became a coal hulk, then a receiving ship before being used as a target for torpedoes and broken up in 1870.|$|E

2500|$|Zerai's brother Tesfazien, {{founder of}} the Eritrea Independent Party, {{thinking}} that Zerai was still alive in an Italian prison in Italy, wrote a personal letter to the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie <b>asking</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> an airplane <b>to</b> Italy {{in order to bring}} his brother home. Tesfazien also approached the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ambaye Wolde Mariam to present the case to the Imperial Palace, initially without success.|$|R
5|$|In {{the face}} of {{neighbourhood}} gossip about the death rate in the home, Catherine, Margaret, and Thomas moved their household to 105 Latimer Street and then again to 27 Ascot street. In September 1883, Thomas Higgins, then 45, became yet {{another member of the}} household to fall mysteriously ill. His stomach pains were severe enough that Doctor Whitford was called; the doctor attributed Higgins's illness to dysentery related to drinking cheap whiskey and prescribed opium and castor oil. Higgins died after two days of illness. Days later, the same doctor was contacted and <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a death certificate. He did so, attributing the death to dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi's next {{commission}} from Mantua {{came early}} in 1618, {{when he was}} <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the music for Andromeda, an opera based on the ancient Greek myth of the princess chained to a rock. The libretto was written by Duke Ferdinando's chancellor, Ercole Marigliani, and the project {{was sponsored by the}} duke's younger brother, Don Vincenzo Gonzaga. It is probable that the work was intended for performance at the Mantua Carnival of March 1618, but as Carter records, Monteverdi's approach to his Mantua commissions was often dilatory and half-hearted; his inability or unwillingness to work on Andromeda delayed its performance, first to 1619 and then to 1620.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1838, {{scientist}} Michael Faraday was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> {{a solution to}} the problem of the deteriorating surface of the marbles.

25|$|Most of {{the mines}} were outside city limits, under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Lake County sheriff. The county sheriff was himself a member of the WFM, as were 40 of his 43 deputies. Mine owners complained that armed groups of union men were allowed to threaten and intimidate workers at the mines, and that the sheriff was hostile and uncooperative when <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> protection against union violence.|$|E

25|$|It {{was already}} {{realized}} that one {{major source of}} error in bombing was leveling the aircraft enough so the bombsight pointed straight down. Even small errors in leveling could produce dramatic errors in bombing, so the Navy {{began a series of}} developments to add a gyroscopic stabilizer to various bomb sight designs. This led to orders for such designs from Estoppey, Inglis (working with Sperry) and Seversky. Norden was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> an external stabilizer for the Navy's existing Mark III designs.|$|E

25|$|Grierson faced entrenched {{opposition}} to her enrollment {{in medical school}} in 1883, and was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> written justification for her wish to become a doctor. Another woman, Elida Passo, had entered the School of Medicine to pursue a degree of Doctor of Pharmacy, becoming in 1885 the first Argentine woman to earn a university diploma in Argentina. Passo overcame numerous rejected applications and returned to earn a Medical Degree. She became seriously ill while in the fifth year of medical school, however, and died in 1893 without a diploma.|$|E
25|$|Yonhi {{was able}} to open its doors again on January 21, 1946, and, on August 15, 1946, was {{recognized}} as a university. Baek Nak Jun became president. It {{was a period of}} transition, and Yonhi University faced obstacles including financial ones; after 1947, things settled down. At the time, Korea lacked teachers, and Yonhi was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> education and training; the Temporary Training Center for Secondary School Teachers in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry (임시 수물화학과 중등교원양성소) was established. In December 1948, plans for unification of Yonhi and Severance began to take form. The Graduate School was formed in July 1950.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{the case}} of many other Latin American cities where the private sector was <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> services, the Chilean service {{providers}} were financially self-sufficient when the private sector took responsibility for them. The public companies had been prepared to gradually improve efficiency and profitability since the legal reforms of 1988-1990. This may explain the stable process of private sector participation compared to other Latin American cases. A factor that explains the continuity of sector policies during various administrations is the fact that all Presidents since Chile's return to democracy in 1990 belonged to the same Coalition of Parties for Democracy.|$|E
