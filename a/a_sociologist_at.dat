2500|$|Leif Elinder, a Swedish {{pediatrician}} and Eva Kärfve, <b>a</b> <b>sociologist</b> <b>at</b> the University of Lund, had for {{a number}} of years written numerous articles and a book where they rejected most of neuropsychiatry, and specifically most research carried out by the Gillberg group.

Ethnomethodology has not previously been mentioned in this review, and tends to be overlooked by many reviewers in this field since it cannot easily be assimilated to their theoretical interests. One can note, however, that it has always offered a more radical and thorough-going way of theorizing action than interactionism (although the two approaches {{have a lot in common}} when compared to traditions that view society as a structural whole, like Marxism or structural-functionalism). During his time at the center, J. Maxwell Atkinson collaborated with Paul Drew, <b>a</b> <b>sociologist</b> <b>at</b> the University of York, in what became the first conversation analytic study of courtroom interaction, using transcripts of coroner's hearings in Northern Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} after the RCG's foundation, {{disagreements}} emerged amongst its members regarding such topics as Stalinism and the South African government. One group, dominated by Frank Furedi (1947-), <b>a</b> <b>sociologist</b> <b>at</b> the University of Kent who used the pseudonym of [...] "Frank Richards", began to argue against the views put forward by David Yaffe and his supporters. Yaffe himself later remarked that Furedi had been [...] "organising among a clique of middle-class members, and became their self-styled guru". In November 1976, Furedi and his followers were expelled from the RCG, following which {{they went on to}} form their own rival organisation, the Revolutionary Communist Tendency (RCT). Soon, the RCT itself splintered, with a group calling itself the Committee for a Communist Programme (CPP) being founded by several dissenting members. Following this, the RCT went on to change its name to the Revolutionary Communist Party in 1981, and would publish the magazine Living Marxism from 1988 to 2000, in which their political position moved from Leninism to Libertarian Marxism.|$|E
2500|$|Stallwood {{writes that}} they saw ALF {{activism}} {{as part of their}} opposition to the state, rather than as an end-in-itself, {{and did not want to}} adhere to non-violence. In the early 1980s, the BUAV, an anti-vivisection group founded by Frances Power Cobbe in 1898, was among the ALF's supporters. Stallwood writes that it donated part of its office space rent-free to the ALF Supporters Group, and gave ALF actions uncritical support in its newspaper, The Liberator. In 1982, a group of ALF activists, including Roger Yates, now <b>a</b> <b>sociologist</b> <b>at</b> University College, Dublin, and Dave McColl, a director of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, became members of the BUAV's executive committee, and used their position to radicalize the organization. Stallwood writes that the new executive believed all political action to be a waste of time, and wanted the BUAV to devote its resources exclusively to direct action. Whereas the earliest activists had been committed to rescuing animals, and destroyed property only where it contributed to the former, by the mid-1980s, Stallwood believed the ALF had lost its ethical foundation, and had become an opportunity [...] "for misfits and misanthropes to seek personal revenge for some perceived social injustice". He writes: [...] "Where was the intelligent debate about tactics and strategies that went beyond the mindless rhetoric and emotional elitism pervading much of the self-produced direct action literature? In short, what had happened to the animals' interests?" [...] In 1984, the BUAV board reluctantly voted to expel the ALF SG from its premises and withdraw its political support, after which, Stallwood writes, the ALF became increasingly isolated.|$|E
