5|$|After Game2 {{ended on}} October 3, the Yankees and Cardinals boarded trains to St. Louis, Missouri. The mayor of St. Louis, Victor J. Miller, ordered that the workday end by three the next {{afternoon}} so that the city could welcome the Cardinals at Union Station. The Cardinals players were treated like champions by fans and citizens alike. Just outside the station, Mayor Miller stood at a podium and presented club manager and player Rogers Hornsby with a brand new Lincoln sedan priced at US$4,000 and {{paid for by the}} city's top businessmen. Each member of the Cardinals' team received a new hat, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> shoes, and an engraved white-gold watch valued at a manufacturer's price of $100. As the Cardinals were receiving special treatment from the people of St. Louis, fans were lining up outside Sportsman's Park with the hope of being able to purchase tickets to Game3 for a price of $3.30.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before it}} {{opened to the}} public, the C gave notice of its {{intention}} to submit another private bill to Parliament, to construct a new line from its northern terminus at King William Street towards Islington. Because of the awkward arrangement of King William Street station, the extension {{was not to be}} connected directly to the existing running tunnels but was to be linked via a pedestrian subway through which passengers could make interchanges between the separate lines. The bill was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} extension failed to make a connection to the existing line. In November 1891, the C published details of a revised bill for the extension to Islington. The company had recognised the deficiencies of its King William Street station and, just a year after the line had opened, planned to construct <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> tunnels to bypass the problematic northern section.|$|E

5|$|Swiatek and Breen {{described}} the Alabama half dollar as {{caught up in}} the presidential election of 1920, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to dampen sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive {{at the time of the}} 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of the Montgomery Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.|$|E

25|$|The {{locations}} where {{the band and}} ribbons attach to a shoe is critical, as incorrect placement {{can result in a}} poorly fitting shoe. Optimal placement depends on the physical attributes of the foot to which it will be mated, and consequently the ribbons and elastic bands cannot be attached during the shoe manufacturing process. After acquiring <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> pointe shoes, a dancer must determine the appropriate attachment locations for the ribbons and elastic bands and then sew them, or arrange for them to be sewn, onto the shoes.|$|E

25|$|Gerda, posing under several aliases {{including}} that of Mrs Albert Chapman, invited Sainsbury Seale to visit her, killed her, and took her identity; {{but she had to}} buy new shoes because those of Sainsbury Seale did not fit her.

The woman in the trunk could hardly have worn through <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> shoes in a single day. Ironically, the face of the corpse had been disfigured not because it wasn't Mabelle Sainsbury Seale, but because it was.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> pandas, female Mei Xiang ("Beautiful Fragrance") {{and male}} Tian Tian ("More and More"), arrived {{on loan from}} the Chinese {{government}} in late 2000. The zoo paid an estimated 10 million dollars for the 10-year loan. On July 9, 2005, a male panda cub was born at the zoo. It was the first surviving panda birth at the zoo and the product of artificial insemination by the zoo's reproductive research team. The cub was named Tai Shan ("Peaceful Mountain") on October 17, 100 days after his birth; the panda went without a name for its first hundred days, in observance of a Chinese custom. Tai Shan is property of the Chinese government and {{was scheduled to be}} sent to China after his second birthday, although that deadline was extended in 2007 by two years.

25|$|According to the {{doctrine}} of Valentinus, as described by , the youngest Aeon Sophia, in her passion to comprehend the Father of all, runs the danger of being absorbed into his essence, from which she is saved by coming {{in contact with the}} limiting power Horos, whose function it is to strengthen all things outside the ineffable Greatness, by confining each to its appointed place. According to this version Horos was a previously existing power; but according to another, and apparently a later account, Horos is an Aeon only generated on this occasion at the request of all the Aeons, who implored the Father to avert a danger that threatened to affect them all. Then (as Hippolytus tells the story, vi. 31) he directs the production of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, who restore order by separating from the Pleroma the unformed offspring of Sophia. After this Horos is produced in order to secure the permanence of the order thus produced. Irenaeus (u. s.) reverses this order, and Horos is produced first, afterwards the other pair.|$|E
25|$|Ali {{stood up}} and started towards Angelo Dundee who guided him into the corner. At first Dundee talked and slapped Ali's legs, but after Ali {{misunderstood}} {{and tried to get}} off the stool, Dundee used smelling salts. Dundee has since claimed to have opened a small tear in one of Ali's gloves and told the referee that his fighter needed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> gloves, thus delaying the start of the 5th round. Cooper insisted that this delay lasted anywhere from three to five seconds according to the footage and that this did not deny him the chance to try to knock Ali out while he was still dazed. Tapes of the fight show that Ali received only an extra six seconds, and the gloves were ultimately not replaced. Cooper started the 5th round aggressively, attempting to make good on his advantage, but a recovered Ali effectively countered and Cooper was hit high on the face with a hard right which opened a severe cut under his eye. Referee Tommy Little was forced to stop the fight, and thus Ali defeated Cooper by technical knockout.|$|E
25|$|Upthorpe Mill {{was built}} in 1751. It was {{originally}} built as an open trestle post mill. In 1818 it was moved to its present site. At {{some point in time}} the Common sails were replaced by Double Patent sails, a roundhouse later being added and a fantail fitted to turn the mill into wind automatically. The mill ended its commercial working life on a single pair of sails. It was disused by 1918 and in 1937 was becoming derelict. Rex Wailes inspected the mill on behalf of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings and an appeal for funds to restore the mill was launched in 1938. In 1939, millwright Amos Clarke, along with Messrs Hunts of Soham commenced repairs which cost £600. A new side girt was fitted to {{the left side of the}} mill and the roundhouse roof was repaired. The tailstones were removed at this time. The intention was to fit the cast iron windshaft from Great Mill, Wickhambrook in place of the existing wooden windshaft and to add <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> sails but this work was not done owing to the outbreak of the Second World War. The mill was painted grey to reduce its conspicuousness as a landmark, as it was close to RAF Shepherds Grove. The mill was worked during the war, but ceased to be used in 1946 as it was unprofitable. By the late 1960s, the mill was again becoming derelict, and the fantail was carefully dismantled by Chris Hullcoop and Philip Lennard. In 1979, emergency repairs were carried out by Suffolk Mills Group and in 1986 the mill was bought by Richard Duke. Restoration work was carried out and the mill was able to grind again in 1990. In 1993, the mill was bought by Peter Dolman and further restoration work was carried out.|$|E
