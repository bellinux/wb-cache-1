25|$|Just {{below the}} coronet, {{the walls are}} covered for <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> by a cornified, opaque 'periople' material. In the palmar/plantar part of the hoof, the periople is thicker and more rubbery over the heels, and it merges with frog material. Not all horses have {{the same amount of}} periople. Dry feet tend to lack this substance, which can be {{substituted}} with a hoof dressing.|$|E

25|$|The angusticlavia was the tunic {{associated}} with the rank and office of the eques, or equestrians, {{one of the two}} highest legal orders in aristocratic Rome. Order members were military men, often patricians (patrici), who served as the cavalry units in war. During times of peace they frequently served as personal assistants to Roman senators. Equestrians wore the angusticlavia under the trabea, a short toga of distinctive form and color. They also wore equestrian shoes (calcei), and a gold ring (anulus aureus). The tunic's stripes were <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> wide, which contrasted with the senator's laticlavus, which bore three-inch wide stripes.|$|E
25|$|Oslo Package 3 is a {{political}} agreement between local and national politicians whereby state and municipal grants are combined with revenue from the toll ring to finance NOK58 billion worth of transport infrastructure investments between 2008 and 2027. Ruter has requested NOK100 million to upgrade the tunnel between Nationaltheatret and Majorstuen, where in some places {{there is only a}} few centimeters (<b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch)</b> clearance between the tunnel wall and the trains. The upgrade would also include upgrades to the signaling system. Due to the narrow tunnel profile, evacuations from the trains have to be done from the ends of the trains.|$|E
25|$|George Hodson {{fell to the}} ground. He {{had been}} struck by a single bullet, {{travelling}} from front to back. The bullet had exited through Hodson's back, <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> lower than the point of entry in his right chest. Hodson died {{in the middle of}} Sydney Road. Paterson, now with a rifle, ran back outside and onto Champ Street. He decided he could not get a clear shot, so he stood on a low wall in the prison's front garden. He aimed his rifle at Ryan, and claimed he fired a shot in the air when a woman came into his line of sight.|$|E

25|$|Ice dancers' blades are <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> shorter in {{the rear}} than those used by skaters in other disciplines, to {{accommodate}} the intricate footwork and close partnering in dance. Dancers' blades also {{do not have the}} large toe pick used for jumping. Hard plastic skate guards are used when the skater must walk in his or her skates when not on the ice. The guard protects the blade from dirt or material on the ground that may dull the blade. Soft blade covers called soakers are used to absorb condensation and protect the blades from rust when the skates are not being worn. In competition, skaters may have three minutes to make repairs to their skates.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the dish but a common one is made by soaking cooked rice in water overnight. Rice is boiled the usual way. Then phaen or starch is strained away. Rice is cooled in air temperature for 3–4 hours. Then cool water is added {{in a way that}} <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of water rises above the rice. Rice is generally covered with a light piece of fabric. 12–24 hours later panta bhat is ready. Care must be taken to cover the dish during the long soaking to avoid contamination. The soaked rice is usually eaten in the morning with salt, lime, chili (either raw or roasted) and onions (sliced or whole) mostly for flavor. Water is discarded before consumption. Sometimes edible oils may be added.|$|E
25|$|Max Heindel {{divided the}} subtle body into: Vital Body made of Ether, our {{instrument}} for specializing the vital {{energy of the}} sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> and a half outside the body; the Desire body, which is our emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16inches outside our visible body, related to the Desire World; and the Mental body, which functions like a mirror, reflects the outer world and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The human being {{is seen as a}} threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold Soul. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.|$|E

500|$|Sergeant Boston Corbett {{crept up}} behind the barn and shot Booth in [...] "the {{back of the head}} <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> below the spot where his [...] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln", {{severing}} his spinal cord. Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, [...] "Tell my mother I die for my country." [...] Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as he gazed at them: [...] "Useless... useless." [...] He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.|$|E
500|$|In {{the case}} of any such problems, those present at lambing (who {{may or may not}} include a veterinarian, most shepherds become {{accomplished}} at lambing to some degree) may assist the ewe in extracting or repositioning lambs. [...] After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. The licking clears the nose and mouth, dries the lamb, and stimulates it. [...] Lambs that are breathing and healthy at this point begin trying to stand, and ideally do so between a half and full hour, with help from the mother. [...] Generally after lambs stand, the umbilical cord is trimmed to <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (2.5 centimeters). Once trimmed, a small container (such as a film canister) of iodine is held against the lamb's belly over the remainder of the cord to [...] prevent infection.|$|E

500|$|A {{fusible plug}} {{operates}} as a safety valve when dangerous temperatures, rather than dangerous pressures, are reached in a closed vessel. In steam engines [...] the fusible plug is screwed into the crown sheet (the top plate) of the firebox, typically extending <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (25mm) into the water space above. Its purpose is {{to act as a}} last-resort safety device in the event of the water level falling dangerously low: when the top of the plug is out of the water it overheats, the low-melting-point core melts away and the resulting noisy release of steam into the firebox serves to warn the operators of the danger before the top of the firebox itself runs completely dry, which could result in catastrophic failure of the boiler. The temperature of the flue gases in a steam engine firebox can reach 1000°F (550°C), at which temperature copper, from which historically most fireboxes were made, softens to a state which can no longer sustain the boiler pressure and a severe explosion will result if water is not put into the boiler quickly and the fire removed or extinguished. The hole through the plug is too small to have any great effect in reducing the steam pressure and the small amount of water, if any, that passes through it is not expected to have any great impact in quenching the fire.|$|E
500|$|The concert {{opened with}} Spears taking the stage {{accompanied}} by four blonde female dancers {{to perform a}} short version of [...] "...Baby One More Time", wearing a silver beaded bra, a pleated white skirt and white boots. She wore a long brown (blond in later dates) wig to cover the head she had shaved {{two and a half}} months previously and appeared in physically good shape. (By now her hair was <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> long, and one of her dancers said of her hair without the wig, [...] "It's getting longer and she looks beautiful.") The show then segued into a flashy shortened version of [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U". Though while Spears performed the original choreography, the performance was compared to the style of the Pussycat Dolls. The dancers then left Spears alone onstage to perform a chair routine of [...] "Breathe on Me". They re-entered with a male fan from the audience with them and Spears giving him a lap dance. Half way through the lap dance, Spears disappeared for a costume change leaving her dancers to continue the performance. She then reappeared in a hot pink bra, white fur coat and jean skirt to perform [...] "Do Somethin'" [...] with Spears throwing air guitars to the crowd. The show then concluded with [...] "Toxic", which featured Spears and her dancers performing in a mix of Spears and Shakira dance styles. As the performance came to an end, Spears said [...] "Thank you so much. These are my dancers"– her only words during the show– and left the stage. The show lasted around 12–16 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Digital Dimension {{took charge}} of the visual effects of the film. CG {{supervisor}} Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> off the road when dropped from a logging truck. [...] "They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if CG would work. The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. We sent a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG," [...] Crosby indicated. [...] "It began with R on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through windshields killer instinct' we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role." [...] Senior technical director James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. Digital artist Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also inputed for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. Physics such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a Douglas-fir were also considered.|$|E
