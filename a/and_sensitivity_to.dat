5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean monk seal {{has changed over}} the years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than not, these caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature <b>and</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of Olivier Messiaen on Takemitsu was already apparent {{in some of}} Takemitsu's earliest published works. By the time he composed Lento in Due Movimenti, (1950), Takemitsu had already come into possession of a copy of Messiaen's 8 Préludes (through Toshi Ichiyanagi), and the {{influence of}} Messiaen is clearly visible in the work, in the use of modes, the suspension of regular metre, <b>and</b> <b>sensitivity</b> <b>to</b> timbre. Throughout his career Takemitsu often made use of modes from which he derived his musical material, both melodic and harmonic among which Messiaen's modes of limited transposition to appear with some frequency. In particular, the use of the octatonic, (modeII, or the 8–28 collection), and modeVI (8–25) is particularly common. However, Takemitsu pointed out that he had used the octatonic collection in his music before ever coming across it in Messiaen's music.|$|E

40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} {{is expected}} {{to play a major}} adaptive role in the response of species to ocean acidification (OA), by providing broader tolerances to changes in pCO 2 conditions. However, tolerances <b>and</b> <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> future OA may differ among populations within a species because of their particular environmental context and genetic backgrounds. Here, using the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH), we explored this conceptual framework in populations of the sea urchin Loxechinus albus across natural fluctuating pCO 2 /pH environments. Although elevated pCO 2 affected the morphology, physiology, development and survival of sea urchin larvae, the magnitude of these effects differed among populations. These differences were consistent with the predictions of the CVH showing greater tolerance to OA in populations experiencing greater local variation in seawater pCO 2 /pH. Considering geographical differences in plasticity, tolerances <b>and</b> <b>sensitivities</b> <b>to</b> increased pCO 2 will provide more accurate predictions for species responses to future OA...|$|R
