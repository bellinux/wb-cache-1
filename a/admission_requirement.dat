25|$|During {{his tenure}} in Bowie, from 1911 until 1921, Goodloe {{established}} a faculty of ten members, an enrollment of 80 students, {{completion of the}} seventh grade as an <b>admission</b> <b>requirement,</b> a model school for student teachers at Horsepen Hill School–the first school for black children in Bowie, a summer session, a new dormitory for women, and renovation of living quarters for men.

He made many pleas for additional funding before the legislature in Annapolis, which might have brought more rapid development to the school, but the state seemed to favor the white normal schools in Towson and Frostburg in its appropriations.|$|E

25|$|This case is {{the last}} of a trilogy of cases against Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) and their use of race in {{assigning}} students to schools. The first case started in 1998 when five African American high school students sued JCPS to allow them to attend Central High School, a magnet school. The suit alleged that they were denied entrance because they were black. In 2000, Federal Judge John Heyburn, after finding that the JCPS school system {{did not need to be}} under a court-ordered desegregation policy, ruled that race could not be used for student assignment placement in the JCPS school system in regard to their magnet school programs. In 2004, he ruled the same for the traditional schools, but allowed the regular public schools to use race as the <b>admission</b> <b>requirement.</b> It is this part that went before the US Supreme Court as the other two cases were not appealed by JCPS.|$|E
