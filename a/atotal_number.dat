40|$|Background:The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the significance of the Q angle with respect to the patella position. We assess the correlation between the Q angles(calculated by clinical exam) in different positions and CT indices (with more impression on TTTG). Method: <b>Atotal</b> <b>number</b> of 68 knee joints of 50 cases entered the study. Clinical examination was used to measure Q angle (in 3 positions of sitting, standing and supine). CT scan performed in 2 axial view of proximal tibia, and distal femor for   measurement of Tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance (TTTG) and other CT   indices. Correlation between main variables calculated. and analysed with spss. Results: Supine Q angle were strongly correlated with standing Q angles and moderately with sitting Q angle. Sitting Q angle was moderately correlated with supine and standing Q angle and weakly with PTA. we found no other significant correlation between Q angle and CT indexes. Discussion: Our findings suggest that Q angle is not a valuable index for predicting the presence of patelofemoral malalignment. ...|$|E

Exploitation of radar polarimetric features for operational oil spill detection is relatively new and until recently those properties have not been extensively exploited. This paper describes the development of a oil spill detection processing chain using coherent dual-polarimetric (copolarized channels, i. e., HHVV) TerraSAR-X images. The proposed methodology focuses on offshore platform monitoring and introduces {{for the first time a}} combination of traditional and polarimetric features for objectbased oil spill detection and look-alike discrimination. <b>Atotal</b> <b>number</b> of 35 feature parameters were extracted from 225 oil spills and 26 look-alikes and divided into training and validation dataset. Mutual information content among extracted features have been assessed and feature parameters are ranked according to their ability to discriminate between oil spill and look-alike. Extracted features are used for training and validation of a support vector machine-based classifier. Performance estimation was carried out for the proposed methodology on a large dataset with overall classification accuracy of 90...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to improve}} the {{treatment}} results of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (stage l-ll) accompanied with chronic abacterial prostatitis (category III A) {{by the use of}} terahertz therapy at frequencies of molecular spectrum of emission and absorption of nitric oxide 150, 176 - 150, 664 GHz. Material and methods. <b>Atotal</b> <b>number</b> of 75 patients met the inclusion criteria and were available for analysis. They were divided into three groups: 1 st core group — 25 patients with BPH (stage l-ll) accompanied with chronic abacterial prostatitis (category III), which received standard medical therapy in combination with THZ-therapy; second group — 25 patients with BPH (stage l-ll) accompanied with CAP, which received standard medical therapy; third control group — 25 healthy men. Results. The combination of THZ — therapy with standard medical treatment allowed us to achieve marked improvements in the IPSS and QoL system, rapid anesthetic effect, more significant volume reduction of the prostate tissue in the 1 st core group. Also THZ-therapy in 1 st core group revealed a statistically significant increase of the maximum speed of blood vessels in the prostate tissue, improved a prostate secretion and rheological properties of blood. Conclusion. THZ-therapy as a complementary treatment has a beneficial effect on the clinical course of BPH (stage l-ll) accompanied with CAP (category III) ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Different {{statistical}} methods {{can be used}} to analyze fertility data. When the response variable is discrete, Poisson model is applied. If the condition does not hold for the Poisson model, its generalized model will be applied. The goal {{of this study was to}} compare the efficiency of generalized Poisson regression model with the standard Poisson regression model in estimating the coefficient of effective factors onthe current number of children. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study carried out on a populationof married women within the age range of 15 - 49 years in Kashan, Iran. The cluster sampling method was used for data collection. Clusters consisted ofthe urbanblocksdeterminedby the municipality. <b>Atotal</b> <b>number</b> of 10 clusters each containing 30 households was selected according to the health center's framework. The necessary data were then collected through a self-madequestionnaireanddirectinterviewswith women under study. Further, the data analysiswas performed by usingthe standard and generalizedPoisson regression models through theRsoftware. Results: The average number of children for each woman was 1. 45 with a variance of 1. 073. A significant relationship was observed between the husband's age, number of unwanted pregnancies, and the average durationof breastfeeding with the present number of children in the two standard and generalized Poisson regression models (p < 0. 05). The mean ageof women  participating in thisstudy was 33. 1 ± 7. 57 years (from 25. 53 years to 40. 67), themean age of marriage was 20. 09 ± 3. 82 (from 16. 27 years to 23. 91), and themean age of their husbands was 37. 9 ± 8. 4 years (from 29. 5 years to 46. 3). In the current study, the majority of women werein the age range of 30 - 35 years old with the medianof 32 years, however, most ofmen were in the age range of 35 - 40 yearswith the median of 37 years. While 236 of women did not have unwanted pregnancies, most participants of the present study had one unwanted pregnancy. Conclusion: According to the achieved results, the generalized Poisson regression model is more suitable for data analysis and can estimate the coefficient of effective factors on the number of children more precisely...|$|E

E. g., longer and fewer lateral roots aresuggested to improve drought resistance of wheat. Thus, detailed root architectural parameters are important. However, classical field sampling of roots only provides more aggregated {{information such as}} root length density(coring), root counts per area (trenches) or root arrival curves at certain depths (rhizotubes). We investigate thepossibility of obtaining the information about root system architecture of plants using field based classical rootsampling schemes, based on sensitivity analysis and inverse parameter estimation. This methodology was developed based on a virtual experiment where a root architectural model was usedto simulate root system development in a field, parameterized for winter wheat. This information provided theground truth which is normally unknown in a real field experiment. The three sampling schemes coring, trenching,and rhizotubes where virtually applied to and aggregated information computed. Morris OAT global sensitivityanalysis method was then performed to determine the most sensitive parameters of root architecture model forthe three different sampling methods. The estimated means and the standard deviation of elementary effects of <b>atotal</b> <b>number</b> of 37 parameters were evaluated. Upper and lower bounds of the parameters were obtained basedon literature and published data of winter wheat root architectural parameters. Root length density profiles ofcoring, arrival curve characteristics observed in rhizotubes, and root counts in grids of trench profile methodwere evaluated statistically to investigate the influence of each parameter using five different error functions. Number of branches, insertion angle inter-nodal distance, and elongation rates are the most sensitive parametersand the parameter sensitivity varies slightly with the depth. Most parameters and their interaction with the otherparameters show highly nonlinear effect to the model output. The most sensitive parameters {{will be subject to}} inverse estimation from the virtual field sampling data us-ing DREAMzs algorithm. The estimated parameters can then be compared with the ground truth in order todetermine the suitability of the sampling schemes to identify specific traits or parameters of the root growth mode...|$|E
