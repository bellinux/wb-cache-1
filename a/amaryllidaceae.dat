5|$|The {{eventual}} {{position of}} Narcissus within the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> family only became {{settled in the}} twenty-first century with the advent of phylogenetic analysis and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system. The genus Narcissus belongs to the Narcisseae tribe, one of 13 within the Amaryllidoideae subfamily of the <b>Amaryllidaceae.</b> It is one of two sister clades corresponding to genera in the Narcisseae, being distinguished from Sternbergia by the presence of a paraperigonium, and is monophyletic.|$|E

5|$|Narcissus {{appears to}} have arisen {{in the area of}} the Iberian peninsula, {{southern}} France and north-western Italy, and within this area most sections of the genus appeared, with only a few taxa being dispersed to North Africa at a time when the African and West European platforms were closer together. Subgenus Hermione in turn arose in the southwestern mediterranean and north west Africa. However, these are reconstructions, the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> lacking a fossil record.|$|E
50|$|Pyrolirion is {{classified}} under the tribe Eustephieae of the subfamily Amaryllidoideae, family <b>Amaryllidacea.</b> It was previously sometimes {{considered by some}} authors as a subgenus of Zephyranthes (rain lilies), but DNA sequencing has shown {{that it is a}} distinct genus more closely related to the genera Chlidanthus, Eustephia, and Hieronymiella in the tribe Eustephieae than to members of the tribe Hippeastreae.|$|R
50|$|The genera of the Hippeastreae tribe {{have been}} treated {{in a number of}} {{different}} ways over the years. Traub (1963) in his monograph on the <b>Amaryllidacea</b> distributed those genera now considered in this tribe over a number of other tribes (see Table, below), while Dahlgren et al. included them all under Hippeastrae for the first time. The concept of subtribes came from the Müller-Doblies' (1996), who had three subtribes, Griffinineae, Hippeastrinae and Zephyranthinae.|$|R

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Narcissus is complex, {{and still not}} fully resolved. Known to the ancients, the genus name appears in Graeco-Roman literature, although their interest was as much medicinal as botanical. It is unclear which species the ancients were familiar with. Although frequently mentioned in Mediaeval and Renaisance texts it was not formally described till the work of Linnaeus in 1753. By 1789 it had been grouped into a family (Narcissi) but shortly thereafter this was renamed Amaryllideae, from which comes the modern placement within <b>Amaryllidaceae,</b> although {{for a while it}} was considered part of Liliaceae.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, Narcissus {{contains}} unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation, and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids {{have been identified in}} the genus, about a third of all known <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and Galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage. Narcissus also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} both South African and South American plants {{were placed in}} this same genus. By {{the early nineteenth century}} Amaryllis had become a {{polymorphic}} (diverse) genus with about 50 species from what we would consider a dozen genera today, and attempts were made to separate it into different genera. This work commenced in 1819 with the contributions of the English botanist, the Revd. William Herbert in Curtis's Botanical Magazine which he expanded in 1821 in The Botanical Register, identifying 14 species of the new genus of Hippeastrum, and only leaving three species in Amaryllis. The rest of the Amaryllis species he transferred to other genera, several of which he created. Herbert further refined his descriptions of Hippeastrum in his work on the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> in 1837.|$|E
40|$|Phytotoxic {{microbial}} metabolites {{produced by}} certain phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria, {{and a group}} of phytotoxic plant metabolites including <b>Amaryllidacea</b> alkaloids and some derivatives of these compounds were evaluated for algicide, bactericide, insecticide, fungicide, and herbicide activities in order to discover natural compounds for potential use in the management and control of several important agricultural and household structural pests. Among the various compounds evaluated: i) ophiobolin A was found to be the most promising for potential use as a selective algicide; ii) ungeremine was discovered to be bactericidal against certain species of fish pathogenic bacteria; iii) cycasin caused significant mortality in termites; iv) cavoxin, ophiobolin A, and sphaeropsidin A were most active towards species of plant pathogenic fungi; and v) lycorine and some of its analogues (1 -O-acetyllycorine and lycorine chlorohydrate) were highly phytotoxic in the herbicide bioassay. Our results further demonstrated that plants and microbes can provide a diverse and natural source of compounds with potential use as pesticide...|$|R
5|$|Historically both {{wide and}} narrow {{interpretations of the}} genus have been proposed. In the nineteenth century genus {{splitting}} was common, favouring the narrow view. Haworth (1831) using a narrow view treated many species as separate genera, as did Salisbury (1866). These authors listed various species in related genera such as Queltia (hybrids), Ajax(=Pseudonarcissus) and Hermione(=Tazettae), sixteen in all in Haworth's classification. In contrast, Herbert (1837) took a very wide view reducing Harworth's sixteen genera to six. Herbert, treating the <b>Amaryllidacea</b> as an 'order' as was common then, considered the narcissi to be a suborder, the Narcisseae, the six genera being Corbularia, Ajax, Ganymedes, Queltia, Narcissus and Hermione and his relatively narrow circumscription of Narcissus having only three species. Later Spach (1846) took an even wider view bringing most of Harworth's genera into the genus Narcissus, but as separate subgenera. By the time that Baker (1875) wrote his monograph all of the genera with one exception were included as Narcissus. The exception was the monotypic group Tapeinanthus which various subsequent authors have chosen to either exclude (e.g. Cullen 1986) or include (e.g. Webb 1978, 1980). Today it is nearly always included.|$|R
25|$|A {{phylogenetic tree}} for the Asparagales, {{including}} those families that {{were reduced to}} subfamilies, is shown below. Of these, the two largest families are <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> and Asparagaceae.|$|E
25|$|By 1846, in {{his final}} scheme Lindley had greatly {{expanded}} and refined {{the treatment of the}} monocots, introducing both an intermediate ranking (Alliances) and tribes within orders (i.e. families). Lindley placed the Liliaceae within the Liliales, but saw it as a paraphyletic ("catch-all") family, being all Liliales not included in the other orders, but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better. The order Liliales was very large and had become a used to include almost all monocotyledons with colourful tepals and without starch in their endosperm (the lilioid monocots). The Liliales was difficult to divide into families because morphological characters were not present in patterns that clearly demarcated groups. This kept the Liliaceae separate from the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> (Narcissales). Of these Liliaceae was divided into eleven tribes (with 133 genera) and <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> into four tribes (with 68 genera), yet both contained many genera that would eventually segregate to each other's contemporary orders (Liliales and Asparagales respectively). The Liliaceae would be reduced to a small 'core' represented by the Tulipae tribe, while large groups such Scilleae and Asparagae would become part of Asparagales either as part of the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> or as separate families. While of the <b>Amaryllidaceae,</b> the Agaveae would be part of Asparagaceae but the Alstroemeriae would become a family within the Liliales.|$|E
25|$|The tree {{shown above}} {{can be divided}} into a basal paraphyletic group, the 'lower Asparagales (asparagoids)', from Orchidaceae to Xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato, and a well-supported {{monophyletic}} group of 'core Asparagales' (higher asparagoids), comprising the two largest families, <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> sensu lato and Asparagaceae sensu lato.|$|E
25|$|Engler, in {{his system}} {{developed}} Eichler's ideas into a much more elaborate scheme which he treated {{in a number of}} works including Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien (Engler and Prantl 1888) and Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien (1892–1924). In his treatment of Liliiflorae the Liliineae were a suborder which included both Liliaceae and <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> families. The Liliaceae had eight subfamilies and the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> four. In this rearrangement of Liliaceae, with fewer subdivisions, the core Liliales were represented as subfamily Lilioideae (with Tulipae and Scilleae as tribes), the Asparagae were represented as Asparagoideae and the Allioideae was preserved, representing the alliaceous genera. Allieae, Agapantheae and Gilliesieae were the three tribes within this subfamily. In the Amaryllidacea, there was little change from Bentham and Hooker. A similar approach was adopted by Wettstein.|$|E
25|$|Several mite species (mainly in the genera Proctolaelaps, Tropicoseius and Rhinoseius, family Ascidae) {{have evolved}} a phoretic mode of life, {{climbing}} into the nostrils of hummingbirds that visit flowers and hitching a ride to other flowers where they can feed on the nectar. Hummingbird flower mites favour plants in the families of Heliconiaceae, Costaceae, Zingiberaceae, <b>Amaryllidaceae,</b> Rubiaceae, Apocynaceae, Bromeliaceae, Gesneriaceae, Lobeliaceae and Ericaceae, members of which are associated with hummingbirds.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859 {{changed the way}} that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating evolutionary information into their schemata. The Darwinian approach led {{to the concept of}} phylogeny (tree-like structure) in assembling classification systems, starting with Eichler. Eichler, having established a hierarchical system in which the flowering plants (angiosperms) were divided into monocotyledons and dicotyledons, further divided into former into seven orders. Within the Liliiflorae were seven families, including Liliaceae and <b>Amaryllidaceae.</b> Liliaceae included Allium and Ornithogalum (modern Allioideae) and Asparagus.|$|E
25|$|The 'core Asparagales', {{comprising}} <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> {{sensu lato}} and Asparagaceae sensu lato, are a strongly supported clade, as are clades {{for each of}} the families. Relationships within these broadly defined families appear less clear, particularly within the Asparagaceae sensu lato. Stevens notes that most of its subfamilies are difficult to recognize, and that significantly different divisions have been used in the past, so that the use of a broadly defined family to refer to the entire clade is justified. Thus the relationships among subfamilies shown above, based on APWeb , is somewhat uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Gilliesieae is a {{tribe of}} {{herbaceous}} geophyte plants {{belonging to the}} subfamily Allioideae of the Amaryllis family (<b>Amaryllidaceae).</b> Described in 1826, it contains fifteen genera and about eighty species. It has been variously treated as a subfamily or tribe. It is native to the Southern United States, Central and South America, predominantly Chile. Of the three tribes of genera {{that make up the}} subfamily Allioideae, Gilliesieae is the largest and most variable. The tribe was divided into two tribes in 2014, Gilliesiae s.s. and Leucocoryneae, based on differences in floral symmetry and septal nectaries.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Ipheion {{was divided}} into two sections, Hirtellum and Ipheion. However, the {{development}} of phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ipheion was not monophyletic, although the division into sections was later supported. Beauverdia Herter had been first described in 1943. Originally it was created to distinguish those species with unifloral inflorescences from others with plurifloral inflorescences within Nothoscordum and other genera, no longer considered <b>Amaryllidaceae.</b> As proposed it had ten species but its independence was short lived, being returned to a synonym of Ipheion, {{and a number of}} species were transferred to other genera, including Nothoscordum and Tristagma.|$|E
25|$|The type genus, Asparagus, {{from which}} {{the name of the}} order is derived, was {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, with ten species. He placed Asparagus within the Hexandria Monogynia (six stamens, one carpel) in his sexual classification in the Species Plantarum. The majority of taxa now considered to constitute Asparagales have historically been placed within the very large and diverse family, Liliaceae. The Liliaceae family was first described by Michel Adanson in 1763, and in his taxonomic scheme he created eight sections within it, including the Asparagi with Asparagus and three other genera. The system of organising genera into families is generally credited to Antoine Laurent de Jussieu who formally described both the Liliaceae and the type family of Asparagales, the Asparagaceae, as Lilia and Asparagi, respectively, in 1789. Jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy (phylogeny), placing Asparagus and related genera within a division of Monocotyledons, a class (III) of Stamina Perigynia and 'order' Asparagi, divided into three subfamilies. The use of the term Ordo (order) at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than Order. In creating his scheme he used a modified form of Linnaeus' sexual classification but using the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers. While De Jussieu's Stamina Perigynia also included a number of 'orders' that would eventually form families within the Asparagales such as the Asphodeli (Xanthorrhoeaceae), Narcissi (<b>Amaryllidaceae)</b> and Irides (Iridaceae), the remainder are now allocated to other orders. Jussieu's Asparagi soon came to be referred to as Asparagacées in the French literature (Latin: Asparagaceae). Meanwhile, the 'Narcissi' had been renamed as the 'Amaryllidées' (Amaryllideae) in 1805, by Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire, using Amaryllis as the type species rather than Narcissus, and thus has the authority attribution for <b>Amaryllidaceae.</b> In 1810 Brown proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished {{on the basis of the}} position of the ovaries and be referred to as Amaryllideae and in 1813 de Candolle described Liliacées Juss. and Amaryllidées Brown as two quite separate families.|$|E
500|$|De Jussieu (1789) grouped Narcissus into a [...] "family", {{which he}} called Narcissi. This was renamed Amaryllideae by Jaume Saint-Hilaire in 1805, {{corresponding}} to the modern <b>Amaryllidaceae.</b> For a while Narcissus was considered part of Liliaceae (as in the illustration seen here of Narcissus candidissimus), but then the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> were split off from it.|$|E
500|$|The Narcissus horticultural {{divisions}} are system of classifying the cultivated varieties {{of the genus}} Narcissus (...) , which are predominantly spring perennial plants in the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> (amaryllis) family. Various common names including daffodil, narcissus, and jonquil are used to describe all or {{some members of the}} genus.|$|E
500|$|While {{interspecific}} hybrids of Hippeastrum {{are relatively}} common, hybridization with other genera of <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> are more rare. The most conspicuous {{exception is the}} hybrid obtained through crossbreeding with the Mexican Sprekelia formosissima Herb. (St James's lily, Aztec lily, Jacobean lily), {{another member of the}} tribe Hippeastreae, originally called Amaryllis formosissima, which is apomictic. × Hippeastrelia is the name given to this cross.|$|E
500|$|Narcissus [...] is a genus of {{predominantly}} spring {{perennial plants}} in the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> (amaryllis) family. Various common names including daffodil, daffadowndilly, narcissus, and jonquil are used to describe all or {{some members of the}} genus. Narcissus has conspicuous flowers with six petal-like tepals surmounted by a cup- or trumpet-shaped corona. The flowers are generally white or yellow (also orange or pink in garden varieties), with either uniform or contrasting coloured tepals and corona.|$|E
500|$|De Candolle brought {{together}} Linnaeus' genera and Jussieau's families into a systematic taxonomy {{for the first}} time, but included Narcissus (together with Amaryllis) in the Liliaceae in his Flore française (1805-1815) rather than <b>Amaryllidaceae,</b> a family {{he had not yet}} recognised. Shortly thereafter he separated the 'Amaryllidées' from 'Liliacées' (1813), though attributing the term to Brown's 'Amaryllideae' in the latter's Prodromus (1810) rather than St.-Hilaire's 'Amaryllidées'. He also provided the text to the first four volumes of Redouté illustrations in the latter's [...] Les liliacées between 1805 and 1808 (see illustration here of N. candidissimus).|$|E
500|$|Although the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> {{family are}} {{predominantly}} tropical or subtropical as a whole, Narcissus occurs primarily in Mediterranean region, with a centre {{of diversity in}} the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal). A few species extend the range into southern France, [...] Italy, the Balkans (N. poeticus, N. serotinus, N. tazetta), and the Eastern Mediterranean (N. serotinus) including Israel (N. tazetta). The occurrence of N. tazetta in western and central Asia, China and Japan are considered introductions, albeit ancient (see Eastern cultures). While the exact northern limit of the natural range is unknown, the occurrences of wild N. pseudonarcissus in Great Britain, middle and northern Europe are similarly considered ancient introductions.|$|E
500|$|Hippeastrum is a genus in {{the family}} <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> (subfamily Amaryllidoideae, tribe Hippeastreae, and {{subtribe}} Hippeastrineae) The name Hippeastrum, given to it by William Herbert, means [...] "Knight's-star-lily", although precisely what Herbert meant by the name is not certain. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum, one result {{of which is that}} the common name [...] "amaryllis" [...] is mainly used for cultivars of this genus, often sold as indoor flowering bulbs particularly at Christmas in the northern hemisphere. By contrast the generic name Amaryllis applies to bulbs from South Africa, usually grown outdoors. The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas from Argentina north to Mexico and the Caribbean.|$|E
500|$|As Kron and Chase {{stated in}} 1995, this taxonomic unit {{had been in}} a {{considerable}} state of flux, with significant variation between the systems of Cronquist (1981), Thorne (1983, 1992), and Dahlgren (1985). When classification systems were based on morphological characters alone, lilioid species which clearly departed from the [...] "lily" [...] pattern were easily placed into separate families. For example, the <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> contained species whose flowers had six stamens and an inferior ovary. The Iridaceae contained those with three stamens and an inferior ovary. The remaining taxa were put together in a very broadly defined Liliaceae, usually refereed to as Liliaceae sensu lato (s.l.). The Cronquist system's definition, for example, is the broadest of all. Rolf Dahlgren and colleagues were responsible {{for one of the most}} radical reorganisation of families, and in their 1985 monocot monograph defined the two orders (Asparagales and Liliales) which contain the bulk of monocot geophytes, as constituting the lilioid monocots.|$|E
500|$|Over {{time the}} Liliaceae became {{increasingly}} broadly, and somewhat arbitrarily, defined as all {{species of plants}} with six tepals and a superior ovary. They eventually came to encompass about 300 genera and 4,500 species, within the order Liliales {{in the scheme of}} Arthur Cronquist (1981). Cronquist was a [...] "lumper" [...] preferring a small number of very large groupings and his classification of the Liliaceae represented the greatest expansion of the family to date. Cronquist placed most flowering petaloid monocots with six stamens in this very broad (and clearly polyphyletic) family, hence the alternative name lilioid monocots. He rejected the importance of ovary position and thus included with the Liliaceae with their superior ovary (hypogynous), the <b>Amaryllidaceae,</b> some species of which had an inferior ovary (epigynous), and which others separated into a distinct family. The Liliaceae were one of the major families in the Cronquist system which included 22 families in addition to Liliaceae in the more restricted sense (sensu stricto, s.s.) used by others. Later more conventional schemes include the system of Robert F. Thorne and that of Armen Takhtajan which characterised the family as petaloid monocots, characterised by showy flowers with tepals and without starch in the endosperm.|$|E
500|$|The Liliaceae {{family was}} {{described}} by Michel Adanson in 1763 and formally named by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789. Jussieu defined this grouping as having a calyx of six equal colored parts, six stamens, a superior ovary, single style, and a trilocular (three-chambered) capsule. By 1845, John Lindley, the first English systematist unhappily acknowledged the great diversity in the circumscription of the family, {{and that it had}} expanded vastly, with many subdivisions. As he saw it, the Liliaceae were already paraphyletic ("catch-all"), being all Liliales not included in the other orders, but hoped that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better. He recognized [...] 133 genera and 1200 species. By the time of the next major British classification – that of Bentham and Hooker in 1883 (published in Latin) – several of Lindley's other families had already been absorbed into the Liliaceae. Over time the Liliaceae became increasingly broadly, and somewhat arbitrarily defined as all species of plants with six tepals and a superior ovary, eventually coming to encompass about 300 genera and 4,500 species, within the order Liliales in the Cronquist system (1981). Cronquist merged the Liliaceae with the <b>Amaryllidaceae,</b> making this one of the largest monocotyledon families.|$|E
500|$|Motivated by his {{interest}} in botanical history and taxonomy, Stearn devoted a considerable part of his output to botanical bibliography, including numerous papers and catalogues establishing the exact publication dates of books on natural history, particularly from the early nineteenth century, including William Herbert's work on <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> (1821, 1837) and complete bibliographies of botanists such as John Gilmour (1989). At the RHS library he transformed the minimalist card indexing by introducing British Museum rules and adding extensive bibliographic information. He quickly realised {{that one of the}} major deficits in contemporary taxonomic nomenclature was a lack of precise dates of all the names, and set about rectifying this over a fifteen-year period, resulting in 86 publications, which was a major step in stabilising nomenclature. The importance of this lay in the rules of botanical nomenclature, which gives botanical names priority based on dates of publication. He considered his most important contribution in this regard to be his elucidation of the dating of the early 19th century collection of studies of Canary Islands flora by Webb and Berthelot (1836–1850). Another important work from this period was on Ventenat's Jardin de la Malmaison (1803–1804), also published in the new Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History. In a number of instances his contributions to others' work went unacknowledged, particularly when he was younger, even though his introductions (often with the title [...] "Revised and enlarged by W. T. Stearn") could be as lengthy as the texts they preceded. His contributions to botanical bibliography and in particular the correct interpretation of historical texts from Linnaeus to Arber are considered of central importance to the field of taxonomy.|$|E
500|$|Other botanists in {{the twentieth}} century echoed Lindley's {{concerns}} about the lack of a clearly defined grouping for Liliaceae. The earliest of these was Johannes Paulus Lotsy (1911), building on Wettstein's work. Lotsy suggested four separate families, Liliaceae, Alliaceae, Agapanthaceae and Gilliesiaceae, within the Liliifloren. This recognised the major groupings that would later be transferred to <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> as subfamilies Allioideae and Agapanthoideae, with Gilliesieae as a tribe within the Allioideae. This approach was later followed by Herbert Huber in 1969. These various proposals to separate small groups of genera into more homogeneous families made little impact until Rolf Dahlgren (1985), following Huber's lead, developed a system incorporating new information, including synapomorphic characters (i.e., shared characters believed to have evolved from a common ancestor). While Cronquist was a [...] "lumper", Dahlgren was a [...] "splitter", preferring a larger number of more homogeneous groupings. Where Cronquist saw one family, Dahlgren saw forty distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales), reducing Liliaceae to ten genera (see Table 3). Over the 1980s, {{in the context of a}} more general review of the classification of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. By the end of that decade, the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, the British Museum of Natural History and the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family into smaller taxa, at least for the purpose of organizing their herbaria. That committee finally recommended that 24 new families be created in the place of the original broad Liliaceae, largely by elevating subfamilies to the rank of separate families.|$|E
2500|$|Family <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> J.St.-Hil. (including Agapanthaceae F.Voigt, Alliaceae Borkh.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Chase et al. more {{formally}} {{brought together}} the three families, Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae, <b>Amaryllidaceae,</b> under the single Asparagalean monophyletic family, now renamed <b>Amaryllidaceae</b> from Alliaceae, reversing the Dahlgrenian process of family splitting. This necessitated reducing the existing {{ranks of the}} component subfamilial taxa. [...] This {{formed the basis for}} the 2009 APG classification (APGIII). Thus subfamily Gilliesioideae became tribe Gilliesieae (Baker, J. Linn. Soc., Bot. 14: 509. 24 Apr ...|$|E
