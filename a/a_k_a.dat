[...] In January 2007, McCain said that he thought Putin was using Russia's energy sources as a political weapon.|$|E

It is a well-known pilgrim site for the Jain temple Kesariyaji Tirth (<b>a.</b> <b>k.</b> <b>a.</b> the [...] "Main Temple") dedicated to the first Jain tirthankara Rishabhadeva. Local Bhils also worship the deity. Lord Rishabhadeo is also [...] "Kesariaji" [...] because a large offering of saffron (keshar, a common ingredient in Jain rituals) is made to the deity.|$|E

[...] Another trend in hip hop clothing was pioneered by Dapper Dan in the early 1980s (est. 1982) with the adaptation and brandishing of high-net-worth fashion house brands such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi, and Gucci and logos in custom-designed tracksuits, jackets, mink coats.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHere we have {{identified}} host cell proteins involved with the cellular SUMOylation pathway, SUMO- 1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier) and UBC 9, a SUMO- 1 conjugating enzyme that interact with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) Core protein. Five highly conserved lysine residues (K 179, K 180, K 220, K 221, and K 246) within the CSFV Core were identified as putative SUMOylation sites. Analysis of these interactions showed that <b>K</b> 179 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 180 <b>A,</b> and <b>K</b> 221 <b>A</b> substitutions disrupt Core-SUMO- 1 binding, while <b>K</b> 220 <b>A</b> substitution precludes Core-UBC 9 binding. In vivo, Core mutant viruses (<b>K</b> 179 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 180 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 220 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 221 <b>A)</b> and (<b>K</b> 220 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 221 <b>A)</b> harboring those substitutions were attenuated in swine. These data shows a clear correlation between the disruption of Core protein binding to SUMO- 1 and UBC 9 and CSFV attenuation. Overall, {{these data suggest that}} the interaction of Core with the cellular SUMOylation pathway plays {{a significant role in the}} CSFV growth cycle in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Approximately {{half of the}} NH 2 {{terminus}} of inward rectifier (Kir) channels can be deleted {{without significant}} change in channel function, but activity is lost when more than ∼ 30 conserved residues before the first membrane spanning domain (M 1) are removed. Systematic replacement of the positive charges in the NH 2 terminus of Kir 6. 2 with alanine reveals several residues that affect channel function when neutralized. Certain mutations (R 4 A, R 5 A, R 16 A, R 27 <b>A,</b> R 39 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 47 <b>A,</b> R 50 <b>A,</b> R 54 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 67 <b>A)</b> change open probability, whereas an overlapping set of mutants (R 16 <b>A,</b> R 27 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 39 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 47 <b>A,</b> R 50 <b>A,</b> R 54 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 67 <b>A)</b> change ATP sensitivity. Further analysis of the latter set differentiates mutations that alter ATP sensitivity {{as a consequence of}} altered open state stability (R 16 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 39 <b>A,</b> <b>K</b> 67 <b>A)</b> from those that may affect ATP binding directly (<b>K</b> 47 <b>A,</b> R 50 A, R 54 A). The data help to define the structural determinants of Kir channel function, and suggest possible structural motifs within the NH 2 terminus, as well as the relationship of the NH 2 terminus with the extended cytoplasmic COOH terminus of the channel...|$|R
