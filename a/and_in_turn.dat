40|$|Seven {{mouldboard}} ploughing {{experiments were}} conducted to systematically investigate the effect of different tillage directions on soil redistribution on hillslopes. The present study included tillage directions other than parallel to the gradient or along the contour, that is, in our experiments the slope gradient changed simultaneously <b>in</b> tillage <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> direction. Using physical tracers we developed {{a model of the}} two-dimensional tracer displacement as a function of topography and tillage variables. The displacements <b>in</b> tillage <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> direction were separately described as 2 nd degree polynomials <b>in</b> both tillage <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> directions. This model fully accounted for the directionality of tillage. Displacement <b>in</b> <b>turning</b> direction additionally depended on tillage depth, while that in tillage direction was affected by tillage speed and soil bulk density. We found a large effect of tillage directionality on soil redistribution, and tillage at 45 to the gradient turning soil upslope was the least erosive tillage direction. We obtained non-linear relationships between soil redistribution and profile curvature, instead of the linear relationships reported previously. Consequently tillage erosivity varied <b>in</b> tillage direction <b>and</b> a unique tillage transport coefficient could not be obtained for all tillage directions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.

5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the new millennium, {{president}} Joan Laporta, a supporter of Catalan nationalism, repeatedly expressed his support of Catalonia's secession from Spain and characterised the club as the symbol for Catalan separatism. The politicalisation of the club drew criticism from several club members who accused Laporta of alienating Barcelona fans, both within and outside of Catalunya. By 2003 Barcelona had 1,200 penyes around the world, causing other Spanish clubs to copy the concept. With each individual peña (Castillian Spanish spelling) having different names and rules, it has become a custom in Spain to name a new peña after their favourite player or match, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> the player usually attends to the inaugural supper.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars.

In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, making it difficult to predict future developments.|$|E

The decision was taken to improve the castle's defences and, as part of this, a square, stone tower was added to the castle to provide living accommodation, with three chambers, the first floor containing a garderobe and a fireplace. A gateway was constructed through the curtain wall just to the south of the tower. Two further stone buildings were constructed within the castle walls.|$|E

Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the township, {{there were a number}} of temporary camps established for construction workers.

Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The largest, the trailer camp at Gamble Valley, had four thousand units.
