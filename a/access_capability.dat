40|$|Drawing {{from the}} resource-based view and {{transaction}} costs economics, we develop {{a theoretical framework}} to explain why small and large firms face different levels of resource access needs and resource <b>access</b> <b>capabilities,</b> which mediate the relationship between firm size and hybrid governance. Employing a sample of 317 venture capital firms, drawn across 6 European countries, we empirically assess our framework {{in the context of}} venture capital syndication. We estimate a path model using structural equation modeling and find, consistent with our theoretical framework, mediating effects of different types of resource access needs and resource <b>access</b> <b>capabilities</b> between VC firm size and syndication frequency. These findings advance the small business literature by highlighting the trade-offs that size imposes on firms that seek to manage their access to external resources through hybrid governance strategies. venture capital, firm size, investment syndication, resource <b>access</b> <b>capabilities,</b> resource <b>access</b> needs, transaction cost economics, hybrid governance...|$|R
50|$|All Common Interface {{equipment}} {{must comply}} with the EN 50221-1997 standard. This is a defined standard that enables {{the addition of a}} conditional-access module (CAM) in a DTV receiver to adapt it to different kinds of cryptography.

5000|$|ANTIC's design {{includes}} DMA capability {{so that it}} may read its Display List and Playfield graphics data. This direct memory <b>access</b> <b>capability</b> is leveraged to {{read data}} on behalf of CTIA/GTIA and update the GRAF* graphics pattern registers as each display scan line is generated. In this way ANTIC provides Player/Missile objects with patterns that vary over {{the height of the}} screen and so appear as traditional [...] "sprite" [...] graphics.|$|E
5000|$|UDO has a fast 35-millisecond random <b>access</b> <b>capability.</b> An 8 KB sector size helps read/write {{performance}} {{across a}} wide range of file sizes. UDO is slightly faster as it operates at Constant Angular Velocity (CAV); during reads and writes, the disc spins continuously at a very high speed. In rewritable applications, UDO has a unique, direct over-write capability, doubling rewrite speeds by eliminating the need for a dedicated erase pass.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{improvements}} in technology, {{it is necessary}} to make a distinction between a VMS and the built-in features of modern network based security cameras. Many modern network cameras offer internal capabilities to record and review video directly themselves via a web browser and without the use of a VMS. However a camera's built-in web interface is typically exclusive to the camera itself and does not normally provide a shared <b>access</b> <b>capability</b> across other network cameras.|$|E

A scheduler option to 'Run whether user is logged on or not' permits System administrator users to schedule backups to run silently and unattended without the user-interface. With this option selected, non-administrator users can have there data files backed up, without interruption and without <b>access</b> <b>capability</b> to the backup process.|$|E

50|$|Devices {{communicate}} {{to the world}} via a set of input and output pins. By themselves, these pins provide limited visibility into {{the workings of the}} device. However, devices that support boundary scan contain a shift-register cell for each signal pin of the device. These registers are connected in a dedicated path around the device's boundary (hence the name). The path creates a virtual <b>access</b> <b>capability</b> that circumvents the normal inputs and outputs, providing direct control of the device and detailed visibility for signals.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s the hourly rate fell from over $10 {{an hour to}} $1.95 an hour. In March 1992, it {{launched}} online signups with credit card based payments and a desktop application to connect online and check emails. In April 1995, CompuServe topped three million members, still the largest online service provider, and launched its NetLauncher service, providing WWW <b>access</b> <b>capability</b> via the Spry Mosaic browser. AOL, however, introduced a far cheaper flat-rate, unlimited-time, advertisement-supported price plan in the US to compete with CompuServe's hourly charges. In conjunction with AOL's marketing campaigns, this caused a significant loss of customers until CompuServe responded with a similar plan of its own at $24.95 per month in late 1997.|$|E

5000|$|In 1972, Ampex {{introduced}} the ACR-25, the first automated robotic library {{system for the}} recording and playback of television commercials. Each commercial was recorded on an individual cartridge. These cartridges were then loaded into a large rotating carousel. Using sophisticated mechanics and vacuum pneumatics, the [...] "carts" [...] were loaded into and extracted from the machine with an 8-second cycle time for spots under 61 seconds. This freed TV stations from loading individual machines with spots in real time, or preparing spot reels in advance of a broadcast. The TV newsroom also began to use the ACR-25 to run news stories because of its random <b>access</b> <b>capability.</b> The ACR-25 used AVR-1 signal, servo, and timebase systems, and a machine-programming control bay designed by Ampex engineer E. Stanley Busby. Both machines had a lockup time of 200 milliseconds, as distinct from the industry standard 5 second pre-roll. This was accomplished with optical-vacuum reel servos providing the vacuum capstan negligible inertial mass to control, and predictive digital servos that could re-frame vertically at horizontal rate, as well as timebase correction with a window exceeding 64 microseconds (compared to the VR-2000's window of less than 5 microseconds).|$|E

5000|$|The {{infrastructure}} layer can be partitioned {{into different}} levels (high-level or low-level technical services).

Ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) technology is a promising solution for next generation RFID systems to overcome most {{of the limitations of}} current narrow bandwidth RFID technology, such as reduced area coverage, insufficient ranging resolution for accurate localization, sensitivity to interference, and scarce multiple <b>access</b> <b>capability.</b> In this article, the UWB technology is applied to passive RFID relying on backscatter modulation. A signaling structure with clutter and interference suppression capability is proposed and analyzed. The potential performance is investigated in terms of range/data rate trade-off, clutter suppression, and multiple <b>access</b> <b>capability</b> using experimental data obtained in both the controlled and realistic environments.|$|E
