25|$|In 2010, Newcastle was {{positioned}} ninth {{in the retail}} centre expenditure league of the UK. There are several major shopping areas in Newcastle City Centre. The largest {{of these is the}} Eldon Square Shopping Centre, one of the largest city centre shopping complexes in the UK. It incorporates a Debenhams store as well as one of the largest John Lewis stores in the UK. This John Lewis branch was formerly known as Bainbridges. Newcastle store Bainbridge's, opened in 1838, is often cited as the world's first department store. Emerson Bainbridge (1817–1892), a pioneer and the founder of Bainbridges, sold goods via department, a new for merchant custom for that time. The Bainbridge's official ledgers reported revenue by department, giving birth to the name department store. Eldon Square is currently undergoing a full redevelopment. A new bus station, replacing the old underground bus station, was officially opened in March 2007. The wing of the centre, including the undercover Green Market, near Grainger Street was demolished in 2007 so that the area could be redeveloped. This was completed in February 2010 with the opening of a Debenhams department store as well as other major stores including Apple, Hollister <b>and</b> <b>Guess.</b>|$|E

500|$|Karen Allen, who {{previously}} appeared in Raiders of the Lost Ark, reprises {{the role of}} Marion Ravenwood (under the married name of Marion Williams). Frank Darabont's script introduced the idea of Marion returning as Indiana's love interest. Allen was not aware her character was in the script until Spielberg called her in January 2007, saying, [...] "It's been announced! We're gonna make Indiana Jones 4! <b>And</b> <b>guess</b> what?

A lot of her charm and the charm of the character is there. And again, it's not an age-dependent thing. It {{has to do with}} her spirit and her nature."

500|$|... "The Job" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein and Michael Schur.

Actress Kate Flannery remarked that [...] "we were so excited that we almost had another hot dog eating contest. Not. It's a great script. Lots of questions answered. Lots. The Office fans have been anxiously awaiting a one-hour episode, <b>and</b> <b>guess</b> what? You got it." [...] The original cut of the episode was an hour and twelve minutes long, {{and had to be}} edited down to forty-two minutes of screentime. It was the second Office episode to fill the entire hour timeslot; the first was the third-season episode [...] "A Benihana Christmas".|$|E
500|$|Dylan biographer Sid Griffin {{has noted}} that, because no written records were kept of these 1967 {{recording}} sessions, [...] "the world {{will have to}} live with the fact that it will never know exactly which Basement Tapes tune was recorded when and where". Nonetheless, using clues such as the sound quality of different batches of songs, and where they appear on the original reels of tapes, attempts have been made to place the songs into a rough chronology <b>and</b> <b>guess</b> the locations at which they were likely recorded. Biographer Clinton Heylin places [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] in the summer of 1967 at Big Pink. The liner notes of The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 date it in the fall of that year.

500|$|Coming from a {{relatively}} Catholic district, Neal {{has a more}} conservative record {{on the issue of}} abortion than other Massachusetts representatives. He said in 2010, [...] "I have always opposed taxpayer funding of abortion. I'd keep Roe v. Wade and restrict it, I've always thought: keep abortion, with restrictions for late-term abortion. [...] the voting pattern I have, both sides would say I'm mixed <b>and</b> <b>guess</b> what? That's where the American people are." [...] He voted for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which made the intact dilation and extraction abortion procedure illegal in most cases. During debate on the House health care reform bill, he voted in favor of the Stupak–Pitts Amendment, restricting government funding of abortion. On other social issues Neal has a moderate record: he supports a proposed Constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the U.S. flag, and has twice voted against an amendment to ban same-sex marriage.|$|E
