40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the relationship between falls efficacy, perception of <b>fall</b> risk <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> prevention behavior in frail elderly. The data was collected from 300 elderly through the questionnaire. 1) the mean score of fall efficacy was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, perception of fall risk was 34. 3 ± 11. 5, <b>and</b> <b>fall</b> prevention behavior was 17. 7 ± 2. 75. 2) Fall efficacy was significantly different according to falls experience(t= 2. 905, p<. 05). Perception of fall risk was significantly different according to falls experience (t= 2. 704, p<. 05) <b>and</b> <b>Fall</b> prevention behavior was significantly different according to falls experience (t= 2. 706, p<. 05). 3) It showed the negative relation between <b>fall</b> efficacy <b>and</b> perception of <b>fall</b> risk. It showed the positive relation between <b>falls</b> efficacy <b>and</b> <b>falls</b> prevention behaviors, <b>and</b> <b>falls</b> prevention behaviors <b>and</b> perception of <b>fall</b> risk.

Seventeen years after Hume's death in 1908, the state closed the river to commercial fishing.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision <b>and</b> <b>falling.</b>|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{regarding}} {{the building of}} a line through Lier started in 1895, and construction commenced in 1901. The line opened on 12 July 1904 and was initially profitable, in part because of tourist traffic. In 1920, the Drammen Line was converted to standard gauge, resulting in expensive transshipment between the two lines. This <b>and</b> <b>falling</b> traffic caused the line to become unprofitable. The Lier line was closed for ordinary traffic on 23 October 1932. All traffic ceased on 1 January 1937 and the track was demolished shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal orb webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage by rain <b>and</b> <b>falling</b> debris. Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight. However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs.|$|E
