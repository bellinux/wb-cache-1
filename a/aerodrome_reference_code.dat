The proposed correlator has {{an advantage over}} the previously proposed all-lag correlator, which employs a fixed <b>reference</b> <b>code,</b> in that correlation peaks remain at the same output positions regardless of update from newly arrived data samples. Therefore, the correlation information can be more conveniently manipulated in certain applications, and the posterior signal processing requirement can be reduced. Low-complexity implementation of the correlator using a recursive form is also presented. The degree of implementation complexity is of the order N, the reference-code length. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
