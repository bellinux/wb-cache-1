5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> the Past {{is one of}} {{the best-selling}} SNES games, with 4.61 million units sold worldwide, and has had an {{exceptionally}} long stay on Nintendo Powers top games list (ranking number 2 in Nintendo Power's last issue in December 2012): when the SNES list was finally retired, <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> the Past had more than five consecutive years in the number one spot. It was re-released as a Player's Choice title in North America, indicating that it has sold a minimum of one million copies there. In the United States, <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> the Pasts Game Boy Advance version alone sold 1.4 million copies and earned $41 million by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it was the 8th highest-selling game launched for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable in that country.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{continuing}} to use the side-scrolling perspective introduced to the series by , <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> the Past reverts to an overhead perspective {{similar to that of}} the original. While <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> the Past still uses mechanics and concepts from the original game, it also introduces new elements and innovations. For instance, arrows are now separate items, as bombs are in the original, instead of using a Rupee to fire an arrow. <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> the Past also takes concepts from The Adventure of Link, such as the magic meter, which is used by items such as the Lamp. Control of Link is more flexible than in previous games, as he can walk diagonally and can run with the aid of the Pegasus Boots (Pegasus Shoes in the GBA version),although he cannot use the Pegasus boots diagonally. Link's sword attack was improved to swing sideways instead of merely stabbing forward; this gives his sword a broader range and makes combat easier. Link swings his sword as the default attack in future Zelda games, although stabbing is also possible in the later 3D incarnations.|$|E

The knight's helmet indicates a municipality and the crown is that of King Edgar (referencing his coronation at the Abbey). A mural crown, indicating a city, is alternatively used instead of the helmet and Edgar's crown.|$|E

5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from <b>A</b> <b>Link</b> <b>to</b> the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking how he could best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E
