5|$|Ireland's {{geologic}} history covers {{everything from}} volcanism and tropical seas {{to the last}} glacial period. Ireland was formed in two distinct parts and slowly joined together, uniting about 440 million years <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of tectonics {{and the effect of}} ice, the sea level has risen and fallen. In every area of the country the rocks which formed {{can be seen as a}} result. Finally, the impact of the glaciers shaped the landscape seen today. This variation in the two areas along with the differences between volcanic areas and shallow seas gives Ireland a range of soils as well. There are wide bogs and free-draining brown earths. The mountains are granite, sandstone, limestone with karst areas, and basalt formations.|$|E
5|$|The Willamette River basin {{was created}} {{primarily}} by plate tectonics and volcanism and was altered by erosion and sedimentation, including some related to enormous glacial floods as recent as 13,000years ago. The initial trough-like configuration was created about 35million years <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> forearc basin while the Pacific Plate subducted beneath the North American Plate. Marine deposits {{on top of}} older volcanics underlie the valley, which was initially part of the continental shelf, rather than a separate inland sea. About 20 to 16million years ago, uplift formed the Coast Range and separated the basin from the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} changes in Puerto Rican fauna {{occurred}} about 10,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the post-Ice Age rise in sea level and associated environmental changes. Puerto Rico's transformation from a dry savanna environment to its present moist, forested state led to mass extinctions, especially of the vertebrate fauna. Around this time, the Puerto Rican Bank—a single landmass comprising the archipelago of Puerto Rico (except for Mona, Monito and Desecheo) and the Virgin Islands (except for St. Croix)—became separated. The Puerto Rican Bank has never been connected to its closest eastern bank, St. Maarten.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E

25|$|Mars {{lost most}} of its {{magnetic}} field about four billion years <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, solar wind and cosmic radiation interacts directly with the Martian ionosphere. This keeps the atmosphere thinner than it would otherwise be by solar wind action constantly stripping away atoms from the outer atmospheric layer. Most of the historical atmospheric loss on Mars {{can be traced back}} to this solar wind effect. Current theory posits a weakening solar wind and thus today's atmosphere stripping effects are much less than those in the past when the solar wind was stronger.|$|E

25|$|Volcanic {{activity}} at Maitland Volcano {{was consistent with}} extensional stresses across the northern Canadian Cordillera that began around 10million years <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of new plate motions between the Pacific and North American plates. This contributed to lithospheric thinning and decompression melting of OIB-like mantle to produce alkaline Neogene magmatism. The time span of 600,000years for magmatism at Maitland Volcano is relatively small compared to other large NCVP shield volcanoes. This supports field evidence for rapid, relatively uninterrupted growth of the volcanic edifice. The suspension of Maitland volcanism corresponds with changes in regional tectonics about four million years ago.|$|E

25|$|Thescelosaurus was a bipedal dinosaur with {{a sturdy}} build, small wide hands, {{and a long}} pointed snout from the Late Cretaceous Period, {{approximately}} 66 million years <b>ago.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> herbivore, Thescelosaurus was not a tall dinosaur and probably browsed the ground selectively to find food. Its leg structure and proportionally heavy build suggests {{that it was not}} a fast runner like other dinosaurs. The first fossils of Thescelosaurus were co-discovered in 1891 by John Bell Hatcher and William H. Utterback, in Wyoming. However, this discovery remained stored until Charles W. Gilmore named the dinosaur in 1913.|$|E

25|$|The canals of Lake Xochimilco were {{initially}} created along with artificial agricultural plots called chinampas. Chinampas were invented by the pre-Hispanic {{peoples of the}} region around 1,000 year <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to increase agricultural production. On the shallow waters of the lakes, rafts were constructed of juniper branches. Onto these rafts floating on the water, lakebed mud and soil were heaped and crops planted. These rafts, tied to juniper trees, would eventually sink and a new one be built to replace it. Over time, these sunken rafts would form square or rectangular islands, held in place {{in part by the}} juniper trees. As these chinampa islands propagated, areas of the lake were reduced to canals. These “floating gardens” were {{an important part of the}} economy of the Aztec Empire by the time the Spanish arrived.|$|E
25|$|On December 4, 2006, Agere's President and CEO, Rick Clemmer, {{announced}} that it would be bought by LSI Logic Corporation of Milpitas, California in an all-stock transaction. On March 29, 2007, this merger was approved by shareholders of both companies, making it official. The companies together own a patent portfolio consisting of more than 10,000 issued and pending U.S. patents. Spun off by Lucent Technologies in 2001, Agere Systems was the creation of a corporate behemoth, while LSI was born 25 years <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tiny startup. LSI Logic already has decided to dump the Agere name, which once symbolized the Lehigh Valley's aspirations to become a technology hub. Compared to Agere Systems, LSI Logic has run a tight ship. It generates roughly 20 percent more revenue — $2 billion — with fewer employees worldwide: 3,900, compared to Agere's 5,300. LSI Logic will use the Agere Systems facilities as the center of its research operations, but the combined company's headquarters will be in Milpitas, California.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{attraction}} is the Bosque de los Arboles de Navidad (Christmas Tree Forest), {{one of the}} few places in Mexico where one can go and cut his/her own tree. The Bosque plants trees such as the “vikingo mexiquense” and the “vikingo canadiense” coming here has become a tradition for many families in the Mexico City area. It is a business that was conceived forty years <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> way to help preserve the forest here as well as benefit economically. Visitors come to spend a day in the area and can cut trees only from designated locations. Picnicking is permitted with the requirement that no garbage is left behind. The Christmas tree area covers 300 acres (120 hectares), and cut trees are left to regrow instead of being killed. The park also hosts food stalls and a Christmas market, selling about 30,000 trees per year and employing 50 permanent and 250 seasonal workers.The money earned from the enterprise helps to preserve more wild areas of the mountains here. This work has earned a Premio Nacional de Ecología (National Ecology Prize). The only problem the forest experiences is that the enterprise is so popular that the roads leading to the area are jammed with traffic.|$|E

We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
