Evidence accumulating over the years emphasized the indisputable link between certain insecticides, chromosomal damage and possibility of gene mutation.

Their chemical relationship to ethyl carbamate makes them worthy of study for their possible deleterious effect on biological system. The main object of the present study is to evaluate the mutagenic effect of a carbamate insecticide" Aldicarb" alone and in combination of vitamin C as an <b>antioxidant</b> <b>agent</b> to decrease their mutagenicity.

In vivo treatment with raxofelast (5, 10, 20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 intraperitoneally 5 [*]min before carrageenan) prevented in a dose dependent manner carrageenan-induced pleural exudation and polymorphonuclear migration in rats subjected to carrageenan-induced pleurisy. Lung myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as histological organ injury were significantly reduced by raxofelast. Immunohistochemical analysis for nitrotyrosine, a footprint of peroxynitrite, revealed a positive staining in lungs from carrageenan-treated rats. No positive nitrotyrosine staining {{was found in the}} lungs of the carrageenan-treated rats, which received raxofelast (20 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) treatment.

40|$|Metabisulfite {{is used as}} an <b>antioxidant</b> <b>agent</b> in {{a number}} of {{pharmaceutical}} formulations. In order to quantify simultaneously both metabisulfite and its oxidation product (sulfate), a capillary zone electrophoretic (CZE) method with indirect UV detection was developed. Best results were achieved with a background electrolyte (BGE) constituted of 15 mM pyromellitic acid, 15 mM tris-(hydroxymethyl) -aminomethane and 0. 2 mM tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide at pH 8. 3 and an applied electrical field of 123 V/cm in a 32. 5 cm fused silica capillary. Indirect UV detection was performed at a wavelength of 225 nm. In order to validate this method, an internal standard (IS), namely ammonium formate, was used. Moreover, due to the high chloride concentration in the pharmaceutical formulation, conductivity was adjusted by adding sodium chloride into standard solutions to prevent matrix effect. Linearity and accuracy were successfully tested in a concentration range of 33. 3 - 250 microg/ml for sodium metabisulfite and of 50 - 375 microg/ml for sodium sulfate. Method precision was determined on six samples each day. Thereby, relative standard deviations (R. S. D.) of 6 % and 12 - 13 % were obtained for intra-day and inter-day precision, respectively.

40|$|Largely due {{to better}} control of {{infectious}} diseases and significant advances in biomedical research, life expectancy worldwide has increased dramatically {{in the last three}} decades. However, as {{the average age of the}} population has risen, the incidence of chronic age-related diseases such as arthritis, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and late-onset diabetes have increased and have become serious public health problem, as well. The etiology of these disorders is still incompletely understood, therefore, neither preventive strategies nor long-term effective treatment modalities are available for these disorders. In keeping with the aforementioned, the ultimate goal in cardiovascular research is to prevent the onset of cardiovascular episodes and thereby allow successful ageing without morbidity and cognitive decline. Herein, I argue that cardiovascular episodes could be contained with relatively simple approaches. Cardiovascular disorder is characterized by cellular and molecular changes that are commonplace in age-related diseases in other organ system, such alterations include increased level of oxidative stress, perturbed energy metabolism, and “horror autotoxicus” largely brought about by the perturbation of ubiquitin -proteasome system, and excessive oxidative stress damage to the cardiac muscle cells and tissues, and cross-reactions of specific antibodies against human heat shock protein 60 with that of mycobacterial heat shock protein 65. ” Horror autotoxicus”, a Latin expression, is a term coined by Paul Ehrlich at the turn of the last century to describe autoimmunity to self, or the attack of “self” by immune system, which ultimately results to autoimmune condition. Based on the currently available data, the risk of cardiovascular episodes and several other age-related disorders, including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes, is known to be influenced by the nature and level of food intake. Now, a wealth of scientific data from studies of rodents and monkeys has documented the significant beneficial effects of calorie restriction (CR) or dietary restriction (DR), and multiple <b>antioxidant</b> <b>agents</b> in extending life span and reducing the incidence of progeroid-related diseases. Reduced levels of cellular oxidative stress, protection of genome from deleterious damage, detoxification of toxic molecules, and enhancement of energy homeostasis, contribute to the beneficial effects of dietary restriction and multiple <b>antioxidant</b> <b>agents.</b> Recent findings suggest that employment of DR and multiple <b>antioxidant</b> <b>agents</b> (including, catalase, gluthatione peroxidase, CuZn superoxide dismutase, and Mn superoxide dismutase = enzymes forming the primary defense against oxygen toxicity), and ozone therapy may mount an effective resistance to pathogenic factors relevant to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular episodes. Hence, while further studies will be needed to establish the extent to which CR and multiple <b>antioxidant</b> <b>agents</b> will reduce incidence of cardiovascular episodes in humans, it would seem prudent to recommend CR and multiple <b>antioxidant</b> <b>agents</b> as widely applicable preventive approach for cardiovascular disorders and other progeroid-related disorders...|$|R
