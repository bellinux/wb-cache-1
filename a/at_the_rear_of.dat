5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from {{the centre of the}} elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, a fire almost {{destroyed}} {{the upper level}} of the school building, but the congregation repaired the damage. Another renovation was begun in 1928, and included installing illuminated stained glass over the ark and bronze memorial tablets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the sanctuary, and repainting the sanctuary walls and columns in a trompe-l'œil manner imitating Jerusalem stone and marble.|$|E

5|$|A service ramp <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the {{basement}} {{led to a}} sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with {{so it could be}} opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|A {{snow melting}} vehicle works by {{scooping}} snow into a melting pit {{located in a}} large tank <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle. Around the melting pit is a thin jacket full of warm water, heated by a powerful burner. The gases from the burner are bubbled through the water, causing some of the heated water to spill over into the melting pit, melting the snow instantly. The meltwater is discharged into the storm drains.|$|E
30|$|Of course, {{reduction}} in Jsc further intensifies {{due to the}} recombination <b>of</b> charge carriers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CdTe layer. As {{can be seen in}} Fig.  15, {{reduction in}} Jsc due to removal of the photocurrent diffusion component and recombination <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absorber layer (labeled as “Photoelectric losses”) amounts to ~ 5  % <b>at</b> <b>the</b> thickness of the CdTe layer d =  1  μm and increases up to ~ 12  % at d =  0.5  μm.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} target {{thickness}} on emission directions of hot electrons are investigated in {{the interaction of}} subrelativistic intensity laser pulses with foil targets. The {{results show that the}} emission direction of <b>the</b> hot electrons <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target shifts towards the target normal direction as the target thickness increases. It can be seen that <b>the</b> electrostatic field <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target surface is the main cause affecting the emission direction of the hot electrons...|$|R

5|$|Another {{witness who}} had {{attended}} the concert <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the crowd testified that Blythe's behavior was standard to metal concerts, saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception. She {{said that it}} was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage. Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of Nosek's fall {{at the end of the}} concert.|$|E
5|$|Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station {{adjacent}} to the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, the trains of the Walt Disney World Railroad travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's main line, and on any given day, either two or three trains run, with two running on a typical day. Each train is operated by an engineer and fireman in the locomotive, {{as well as a}} conductor <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the train who supervises the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Both Boadicea and Bellona {{began their}} careers with {{destroyer}} flotillas of the First Fleet, Boadicea as senior officers' ship for the 1st Destroyer Flotilla and Bellona with the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. The former {{was transferred to}} the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla in mid-1912 and the sisters were transferred to the 2nd and the 1st Battle Squadrons, respectively, of the First Fleet in 1913. Both ships were assigned to positions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> their squadrons and did not fire their guns during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916.|$|E

5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E
5|$|By 1:00 pm, the two fleets were roughly {{facing each}} other, but sailing on {{opposite}} tacks. In order to engage, {{and to avoid}} some shoals (known as the Middle Ground) {{near the mouth of}} the bay, Graves around 2:00 pm ordered his whole fleet to wear, a manoeuvre that reversed his line of battle, but enabled it to line up with the French fleet as its ships exited the bay. This placed the squadron of Hood, his most aggressive commander, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the line, and that of Admiral Francis Samuel Drake in the van.|$|E
5|$|Engadine was {{purchased}} in February 1915 by the Admiralty {{and she was}} modified by Cunard at Liverpool from 10 February to 23 March 1915 with a permanent, four-aircraft, hangar in the rear superstructure {{and a pair of}} cranes were mounted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> the hangar to hoist the seaplanes {{in and out of the}} water. Four quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns, each with 130 rounds, and two Vickers QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns, each with 65 rounds, were fitted for self-defence. She also carried a pigeon loft that housed carrier pigeons to be used by her aircraft if their wireless was broken.|$|E
