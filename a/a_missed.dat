5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the Malaysian opposition leveled criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E

The turning point of the game was described as <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> call by the referees when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but was called for a foul, resulting in two made free throws by Siva.

5|$|After {{each team}} traded punts {{on their first}} possessions, LSU took a 3–0 first quarter lead when Drew Alleman {{connected}} on a 38-yard field goal. After each team again traded punts, Alabama scored the first touchdown of the game {{early in the second}} quarter. A seven-yard Eddie Lacy touchdown run completed an 11-play, 92-yard drive and gave the Crimson Tide a 7–3 lead. On the LSU possession that ensued, the Alabama defense held the Tigers to a three-and-out. However, Cyrus Jones fumbled the Brad Wing punt that was recovered by LSU at the Crimson Tide 36-yard line. LSU then failed to capitalize on the turnover as Alleman was tackled for a two-yard loss on a fake field goal attempt and gave Alabama possession at their 33-yard-line. After another Alabama punt and <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> 54-yard Alleman field goal, the Crimson Tide took a 14–3 halftime lead on a nine-yard McCarron touchdown run with only 0:11 left in the half.|$|E

Following a Florida three and out on their first possession, Alabama responded with an 8-play, 76-yard touchdown drive. On the drive, Greg McElroy completed key passes to Colin Peek and Marquis Maze and Mark Ingram rushed for 37 yards and the touchdown in taking a 9–0 lead following <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> extra point.

5|$|Auburn, like Virginia Tech, {{had gone}} 8–5 during the 2003 college {{football}} season, {{and entered the}} 2004 season with high expectations. The Tigers were using a new offensive scheme—the West Coast offense—and boasted two highly rated running backs on offense. In its {{first game of the}} 2004 season, the 18th-ranked Auburn football team overwhelmed the University of Louisiana-Monroe, 31–0. It was Auburn's first shutout since 2002. One week later, the Tigers backed up their good start with an emphatic 43–14 victory over Southeastern Conference foe Mississippi State University. In the third week of the season, Auburn faced its first challenge of the young season, against the fourth-ranked Louisiana State Tigers. In a hard-fought defensive struggle, Auburn won, 10–9, when <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> extra point was replayed after a penalty.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} game against Mike Bellotti's Oregon Ducks, Oklahoma {{defensive}} coordinator Brent Venables made some major changes to the defensive depth chart after giving up four long running plays {{through the heart of}} the defensive line against Washington. The starters at defensive tackle, cornerback, and strong safety were all demoted, opening opportunities for some freshmen to step up. D.J. Wolfe was replaced by Marcus Walker at cornerback while senior Jason Carter started in place of Keenan Clayton at strong safety. Carter replaced Clayton in the game against Washington after <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> tackle by the freshman led to a Husky touchdown on their first offensive play. Even though all four players at defensive tackle had almost the same number of plays, Steven Coleman was moved {{off the top of the}} depth chart as well.|$|E

The Athletics retook a 10–4 lead when they scored a touchdown and converted the extra point, but then Walker scored his second touchdown of the game that made the final score 10–8 after <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> extra point. The second loss against the B.A.C. marked the only time in Alabama football history the same team defeated the Crimson Tide twice in the same season.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} two games of the season, Tech {{followed}} through on that promise, winning 3316 and 6321 against Bowling Green and Pittsburgh, respectively. A loss to No.3 Miami followed, but a victory over Maryland in the game that followed gave Tech a 31 record, already better than its 1992 win total. After a close loss at No.14 West Virginia that was determined by <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> last-second field goal by Tech placekicker Ryan Williams, the Hokies won five of their last six regular-season games. These wins included victories over Big East opponent Syracuse and No.23 , Tech's traditional rival.

5|$|In {{the second}} half, both teams had more {{offensive}} success. Auburn scored the game's first touchdown {{four and a}} half minutes into the third quarter, widening the Tigers' lead to 16–0. Virginia Tech fought back, driving inside the Auburn 10-yard line before settling for a field goal attempt. Kicker Brandon Pace missed the 23-yard field goal try, leaving the score at 16–0. Tech would have other chances, however. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, Tech scored its first points of the game after a six-play, 78-yard drive. A 29-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Bryan Randall made the score 16–6 after <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> two-point conversion. As time ran down, Tech closed the gap even further. With just over twominutes remaining in the game, Randall connected on an 80-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan for a touchdown. With the score now at 16–13 and time running out, Tech elected to attempt an onside kick in hopes of having a chance for a game-winning offensive drive. Auburn recovered the kick, however, and ran out the clock.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as <b>a</b> <b>missed</b> chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E
