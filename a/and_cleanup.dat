5|$|Early {{forecasts}} {{suggested that}} Bonnie would attain 80mph (130km/h) winds or Category 1 status. In {{response to the}} threat, 15 shelters in 7 northwestern Florida counties were put on standby. In the hours prior to landfall,2 shelters were opened, 4 were put on standby, and health <b>and</b> <b>cleanup</b> teams were deployed to the area. Parts of Gadsden, Wakulla, and Levy Counties issued voluntary evacuations, and numerous schools were closed. In anticipation of the storm, Florida Governor Jeb Bush issued a state of emergency.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{expected}} to impact operations regarding the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, with both containment <b>and</b> <b>cleanup</b> operations being affected by repercussions from the storm (such as wave action and wind direction). Although Alex stayed relatively away from the site, the storm caused BP to delay plans to increase oil capture from the leak by a week. Tarballs from the spill as large as apples washed onshore around Grand Isle, {{as well as other}} parts of Louisiana, Alabama and Florida, from high storm tides created by the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations had been turned over to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation <b>and</b> <b>cleanup</b> {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E

5|$|Plains All American Pipeline {{estimated}} that the cleanup had cost $96 million during a joint oversight hearing of the State Assembly Natural Resources Committee and Senate Select Committee on June 26, 2015. Overall expenses related to the spill were estimated to be $257 million in an earnings report for Plains All American Pipeline issued around the same time. This included the emergency response <b>and</b> <b>cleanup</b> efforts along with the expected legal claims and potential settlements. The CEO stated in the report that all but $65 million would be covered by insurance and that the figure did not include lost revenue from the pipelines that have been shutdown.|$|E
5|$|September 16, 1999- Tropical Storm Floyd crosses {{over the}} southeastern {{portion of the}} state. The storm {{produces}} strong wind gusts of up to 64mph (103km/h) in Sussex County and heavy rainfall peaking at 10.58inches (269mm) in Greenwood, a 24-hour state record. The flooding, which exceeds the 100-year flood return period, kills two and causes record-breaking river levels across the state. Hundreds of roads, railroad lines, and bridges are closed or destroyed, trapping dozens due to flooded vehicles. The winds uproot hundreds of trees, leaving 25,000 homes and businesses without power for 3days. Floyd damages 171 homes, 44 severely, and destroys 33 in New Castle County. Damage is minimal near the ocean, and amounts to minor beach erosion and tidal flooding. Throughout the state, damage totals to $8.42million (1999USD, $10.9million 2008USD). In response to the damage, President Bill Clinton declares {{the state as a}} disaster area, which allows for federal funding to rebuild <b>and</b> <b>cleanup</b> after the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{flooding}} on Mangaia persisted {{for nearly}} a week before finally subsiding. Once the waters receded, {{the full extent of}} damage was revealed. Although only minor structural damage was sustained, the agricultural sector received extensive losses. Nearly 90% of the islands' staple crop was lost and about 60% of all the livestock perished. Following an assessment made by the Cook Islands National Disaster Management Council, it was determined that US$52,000 was needed to repair losses from Trina. International assistance from the United Nations was eventually requested on December12, allowing for relief funds from several agencies to be delivered to the area. Fears of food shortages also prompted the local government to begin stockpiling food should it become a necessary relief supply. A total of US$24,140 was committed in relief funds by New Zealand, Norway and the United Nations to assist the Cook Islands in recovering from the storm. By late-December, an additional F$20,000 (US$11,000) was distributed by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to the affected islands. In the months following Cyclone Trina, debris removal <b>and</b> <b>cleanup</b> was relatively slow, delaying efforts to replant crops lost in the floods. Food shortage issues became apparent in February 2002, prompting the IFRC to distribute food to all of Mangaia's residents.|$|E

50|$|A second HHE was {{conducted}} afterwards to assess exposures to workers performing onshore cleanup work. Worker tasks evaluated as onshore work include wildlife <b>cleanup</b> <b>and</b> rehabilitation, beach <b>cleanup,</b> <b>and</b> decontamination and waste management. Exposure to oil residues and other chemicals {{were found to}} be minimal for workers assigned to wildlife <b>and</b> beach <b>cleanup</b> duty. Sampling for chemicals, particulates, and noise exposures {{were found to be}} below occupational exposure limits for decontamination and waste management activities. For all onshore work, heat stress and ergonomic hazards were found to be the greatest threats to worker safety and health.|$|R

25|$|From its {{original}} development until the wide-scale adoption of natural gas, more than 50,000 manufactured gas plants {{were in existence}} in the United States alone.
