5|$|Rancho Grande {{was located}} at a {{mountain}} pass in {{a branch of}} the Andes known as the Venezuelan Coastal Range, which was an important migration route for butterflies, and the station proved very lucrative in the study of insects. During his work at Rancho Grande, Beebe broke his leg in a fall from a ladder, and the forced immobility which resulted from having his leg in a cast presented him with a new opportunity for observing the area's wildlife. At his request, he and his chair were transported into the nearby jungle, and as he sat motionless the wild animals around him soon began to go <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>business</b> without noticing his presence. His immobility also presented him with the opportunity to spend hours at a time observing a pair of bat falcons through binoculars, documenting the behavior of their two chicks and every prey item fed to them by their parents. His observations documented several behaviors which were new to science, including the first documented example of play in birds.|$|E
25|$|With al-Anbar now lacking any defense, its {{residents}} decided to surrender on terms. After giving guarantees of safe conduct to the Anbaris, the Turks and North Africans entered the town, {{and allowed the}} people to go <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>business.</b> The next day, however, the soldiers seized a shipment of goods arriving from Raqqa and began looting the town. They sent {{the heads of the}} slain to Samarra, along with the prisoners that had been captured, and unsuccessfully attempted to dam a water route running between the Euphrates and Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|Forsyth's novels {{typically}} {{show the}} ways in which spies, gangsters, assassins, mercenaries, diplomats, business leaders and politicians go <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>business</b> behind the scenes; the sort of things that the average reader would not suspect while reading a simple headline. For example, the Jackal (The Day of the Jackal) does not simply attempt to shoot Charles de Gaulle. He prepares meticulously by researching his quarry at the British Museum library; he obtains papers for his various false identities; he travels around Paris to find a good location for a sniper's nest; he buys and tests his weapons; and so on.|$|E

25|$|York may {{explore the}} Greenvale on foot, by car, or {{by using a}} special item {{obtained}} by completing a sidequest. Cars must be maintained, as they consume fuel, which York must purchase, and accumulate damage that eventually renders them useless unless York pays for their repair. York often has a specific time frame for investigating sites and interviewing non-player characters; however, if he misses the timeslot, the player may simply try again during the next day without a penalty. Places of business and entertainment venues in Greenvale have specific hours of operation and must be visited at the proper time {{to make use of}} their services. Non-player characters also have their own specific routines and travel around town as they go <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>business.</b> It also features a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle which affects the responses of the non-player characters. If York engages one at the right place and time of day, he or she may offer him a side-quest to perform for additional rewards. In addition to side-quests, trading cards are scattered throughout the town, which the player can collect while exploring. York can also participate in mini-games, such as darts, racing through checkpoints, and fishing, and may accelerate the passing of time by smoking cigarettes.|$|E
25|$|With {{the return}} of {{democratic}} rule in 1980, President Belaúnde reopened the university. The radical elements among the students and lecturers were quick to return, and by the mid-1980s the country's two main insurgent groups, Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) and the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), had a strong presence on campus. By the early 1990s, due to a strategic withdrawal by MRTA and the fragmentation of the other left-wing groups on campus, legal and illegal alike, Sendero Luminoso had the upper hand. This was in spite of operations {{such as that of}} 13 February 1987, when 4000 police officers conducted night-time raids at the dormitories of three state universities (including La Cantuta); 20 April 1989, when a joint force of police and army descended on La Cantuta University and San Marcos National University and arrested over 500 students on charges of subversion; or 22 May 1991, when, in response to a hostage crisis and rumors of an explosive device squirreled away on campus, Fujimori sent the army in to restore order at La Cantuta. Graffiti alluding to Sendero Luminoso and its leader, Abimael Guzmán, were painted over with patriotic slogans; students went <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>business</b> only after passing checkpoints and under close supervision from the armed forces; and the campus remained under military control for several years.|$|E

500|$|Another season two episode, [...] "Gnomes", {{revolves}} around {{a group of}} [...] "underpants gnomes" [...] who, as their name suggests, run a corporation stealing people's underpants. When asked <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>business</b> model, various gnomes reply that theirs is a three-step process: Phase 1 is [...] "collect underpants". Phase 3 is [...] "profit". However, the gnomes are unable to explain what is to occur {{between the first and}} final steps, and [...] "Phase 2" [...] is accompanied by a large question mark on their corporate flow chart.

500|$|The {{title of}} the episode is a parody of 1967 Swedish art house film I Am Curious (Yellow). The episode {{references}} the dot-com bubble, a speculative bubble covering roughly 1995–2000.

Club wrote: [...] "By April 2002, the dot-com bubble of the late '90s had been popped {{for a couple of}} years, taking with it myriad Internet start-ups.

Touring the laid-back start-up that hosts the cartoons, Lisa asks head honcho Todd Linux <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>business</b> model.

2500|$|At most times, Rome's {{thoroughfares}} {{would have}} been with crowded with citizens and non-citizens jostling <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>business,</b> in {{a great variety of}} colourful garments, with few togas in evidence. Only a higher-caste Roman, a magistrate, would have had lictors to clear his way, and even then, wearing a toga was hard work. Its apparent natural simplicity and [...] "elegant, flowing lines" [...] were the result of diligent practice and cultivation; its wearer must walk with measured, stately gait, or risk an embarrassing disarrangement. In this respect, Wilson (1924), after experiment with various fabrics, found the rough texture of the woolen toga a practical necessity; smoother fabrics refused to stay in their proper place. Vout (1966) suggests that the toga's most challenging qualities as garment fitted the Romans' view of themselves and their civilization. Like the empire itself, the peace that the toga came to represent had been earned through the extraordinary and unremitting collective efforts of its citizens, who could therefore claim [...] "the time and dignity to dress in such a way".|$|E

During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now I believe that if Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house".
