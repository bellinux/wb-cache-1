Hence, in such a situation, the legislature may make laws that go against the rights given in Article 19. Also, the President may by order suspend the right to move court for the enforcement of other rights as well.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} is <b>a</b> {{discrepancy}} between <b>stated</b> and actual aims in biomechanical research, {{particularly with respect to}} hypothesis testing. We present an analysis of one hundred papers recently published in The Journal of Experimental Biology and Journal of Biomechanics, and examine the prevalence of papers which (a) have hypothesis testing as <b>a</b> <b>stated</b> aim, (b) contain hypothesis testing claims that appear to be purely presentational (i. e. which seem not to have influenced the actual study), and (c) have exploration as <b>a</b> <b>stated</b> aim. We found that whereas no papers had exploration as <b>a</b> <b>stated</b> aim, 58 per cent of papers had hypothesis testing as <b>a</b> <b>stated</b> aim. We had strong suspicions, at the bare minimum, that presentational hypotheses were present in 31 per cent of the papers in this latter group...|$|R

5|$|During the 1950s, {{agitation}} grew in Alaska for {{the territory}} to become <b>a</b> <b>state.</b> Alaskans could not vote in presidential elections {{and had a}} territorial legislature with limited powers. Efforts to lobby federal legislators for an Alaska statehood bill met with limited success, so prominent territorial officials decided to draft <b>a</b> <b>state</b> constitution to prove Alaska's readiness to become <b>a</b> <b>state.</b> On November 8, 1955, 55 elected delegates gathered at the University of Alaska to begin drafting <b>a</b> <b>state</b> constitution. The resulting debates lasted {{more than two months}} and caused a sensation in Fairbanks. Debates of the constitutional convention were broadcast on Fairbanks radio, and the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner dedicated daily reports to the progress of the convention. On February 5, 1956, the delegates signed the constitution in front of 1,000 people who crowded into the University of Alaska gymnasium. The building where deliberations took place was subsequently named Constitution Hall.|$|E

The portion of roads between Riverton and Sharptown, Brookview and Hurlock, Church Hill and southeast of Chestertown, northeast of Chestertown and northeast of Kennedyville, and Chesapeake City and Elkton were under contract to be built as state roads. At this time, <b>a</b> <b>state</b> highway was proposed along the segments between Ocean City and Berlin, Salisbury and Hebron, Sharptown and Brookview, Hurlock and Easton, Longwoods and Centreville, northeast of Kennedyville and Chesapeake City, and Elkton and Fair Hill.
