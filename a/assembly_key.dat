Approach: Cable structures are very light and flexible and they undergo appreciable deflections when subjected to external loading. Results: Since all the main load-carrying members in cable structures are usually in tension, there are no stability problems and the strength of high tensile steel used for cables can be rationally utilized. Conclusion/Recommendations: In order to define the position of equilibrium the method of analysis should, therefore, cater for the change in geometry caused by any form of applied load. Hence the classical linear theories of structural mechanisms cannot be used for the solution of cable <b>assemblies.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Nonlinear dynamic response optimization, structural, optimization, nonlinear dynamic analysi...|$|R

Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP) {{is an essential}} question for aircraft assembly process design. Modern aircraft assembly contains plenty of complex shape components, which have so many assembly features to ensure, {{this leads to a}} large number of feasible assembly sequences using traditional sequence planning algorithms; and it is hard to evaluate the contribution to assembly quality for every sequence. A methodology called Key Characteristics Based ASP is proposed in this paper, which can significantly reduce unavailable sequences and ensure key features for quality in assembly process designing compared with previous methods. The methodology focuses on the final assembly quality and considers it as <b>Assembly</b> <b>Key</b> Characteristics (AKCs) in the beginning of assembly process design. With tools such as AKCs decomposition, Datum Flow Chain, precedence constraint matrix, the methodology describes the main process for ASP.

Individual DNA components {{have been used}} several times to achieve self-assembled crystalline arrangements in two dimensions. The design of a fractal system {{is a much more}} difficult goal to achieve with molecular components. We present DNA components whose cohesive portions are compatible with a fractal assembly. These components are DNA parallelograms that have been used previously to produce two dimensional arrays. To obtain a fractal arrangement, however, we find it necessary to combine these parallelograms with glue-like constructs. The assembly of the individual parallelograms and a series of glues and protecting groups appear to ensure the fractal growth of the system in two dimensions.
