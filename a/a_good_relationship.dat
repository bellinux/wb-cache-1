5|$|Although historians {{differ in}} their {{opinions}} about his relationship, if any, to Kings Edgar the Peaceable and Edward the Martyr, it is generally thought that he enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with King Æthelred II.

Thored was ealdorman in Northumbria {{for much of his}} reign, disappearing from the sources in 992 after being appointed by Æthelred to lead an expedition against the Vikings.|$|E
5|$|Before he {{was elected}} king of the Commonwealth, Władysław fought in many campaigns, seeking {{personal}} glory. After his final campaign against Russians in 1617–1618 (the end of Dymitriads), in 1619 he went to Silesia, looking {{for an opportunity to}} aid the Habsburgs in their struggle against the Czech Hussites in the Thirty Years' War. That opportunity never came, but from that point onward, Władysław had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with George William, Elector of Brandenburg.|$|E

Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date again as it had on its previous release Louder Than Love (1989). Frontman Chris Cornell said the band decided to work with Date again seeing as the band had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with him {{and did not want to}} go through the pressure of trying to find a new producer.|$|E
5|$|Eadbald's {{influence}} {{was less than}} his father's, but Kent was powerful enough to be omitted {{from the list of}} kingdoms dominated by Edwin of Northumbria. Edwin's marriage to Eadbald's sister, Æthelburg, established <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> between Kent and Northumbria which appears to have continued into Oswald's reign. When Æthelburg fled to Kent on Edwin's death in about 633, she sent her children to Francia for safety, fearing the intrigues of both Eadbald and Oswald. The Kentish royal line made several strong diplomatic marriages over the succeeding years, including the marriage of Eanflæd, Eadbald's niece, to Oswiu, and of Eorcenberht to Seaxburh, daughter of King Anna of East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|Edward enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with Pope Clement V, {{despite the}} King's {{repeated}} {{intervention in the}} operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed. With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest and concern for their own protection.|$|E

5|$|Swaminarayan {{developed}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> {{with the}} British Raj. He had followers {{not only from}} Hindu denominations but also from Islam and Zoroastrianism. He built six temples in his lifetime and appointed 500 paramahamsas to spread his philosophy. In 1826, Swaminarayan wrote the Shikshapatri, a book of social principles. He died on 1 June 1830 and was cremated according to Hindu rites in Gadhada, Gujarat. Before his death, Swaminarayan appointed his adopted nephews as acharyas to head the two dioceses of Swaminarayan Sampraday. Swaminarayan is also remembered within the sect for undertaking reforms for women and the poor, and performing yajñas (fire sacrifices) on a large scale.|$|E
5|$|An ala or hala (plural: ale or hali) is {{a female}} mythological {{creature}} {{recorded in the}} folklore of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Serbs. Ale are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail-producing thunderclouds {{in the direction of}} fields, vineyards, or orchards to destroy the crops, or loot and take them away. Extremely voracious, ale particularly like to eat children, though their gluttony is not limited to Earth. It is believed they sometimes try devouring the Sun or the Moon, causing eclipses, and that it would mean {{the end of the world}} should they succeed. When people encounter an ala, their mental or physical health, or even life, are in peril; however, her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust. Being in <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with an ala is very beneficial, because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble.|$|E
5|$|Bremner {{signed a}} new three-year {{contract}} in summer 1987. New arrivals {{at the club}} were Glynn Snodin (£150,000 from Sheffield Wednesday), winger Gary Williams (£230,000 from Aston Villa) and Bobby Davison (£350,000 from Derby County), as well as Jim Melrose and Ken DeMange. A more significant new face was David Batty, a key player of the future who was given his debut from the youth team. United started the season inconsistently, but five straight wins in December won Bremner the Second Division Manager of the Month award. The inconsistent results returned however, and Leeds finished the 1987–88 season in seventh place, eight points outside the play-offs. Bremner did not enjoy <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with the club's board, who felt him to be uncommunicative with them, and after a poor start to the 1988–89 season he was sacked in September 1988. His successor, Howard Wilkinson, was given money to spend by the board and Leeds {{went on to win}} promotion in 1990.|$|E

5|$|During this time, the U.S. Army {{underwent}} a drastic reduction in size. At {{the end of}} World War II, it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, there were just 10 active divisions in the force, {{along with a few}} reserve divisions such as the 45th Infantry Division which were combat-ineffective. The division retained many of its best officers as senior commanders as the force downsized, and it enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with its community. The 45th in this time was {{regarded as one of the}} better-trained National Guard divisions. Regardless, by mid-1950 the division had only 8,413 troops, less than 45 percent of its full-strength authorization. Only 10 percent of the division's officers and 5 percent of its enlisted men had combat experience with the division from World War II.|$|E
5|$|Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on {{the death}} of his father Edward I. The {{expectations}} of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden on the country, and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in the drafting of the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set of complaints about royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father had, and ignored the opinions of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with his two surviving heirs was fraught, for, while the King had great affection for his youngest son John, he showed little warmth towards Richard and indeed seems to have borne him a grudge after their argument in 1184. The bickering and simmering tensions between Henry and Richard were cleverly exploited by the new French king, Philip Augustus. Philip had come to power in 1180 and he rapidly demonstrated {{that he could be}} an assertive, calculating and manipulative political leader. Initially Henry and Philip Augustus had enjoyed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship.</b> Despite attempts to divide the two, Henry and Philip Augustus agreed a joint alliance, even though this cost the French king the support of Flanders and Champagne. Philip Augustus regarded Geoffrey as a close friend, and would have welcomed him as a successor to Henry. With the death of Geoffrey, however, the relationship between Henry and Philip broke down.|$|E

They formed an artistic partnership as well as being a married couple and worked on films and plays together. In 1953, Bence returned from working abroad to discover Closas was having an affair, and decided to end the marriage.

As years pass, Elspeth forms <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>relationship</b> with her new husband, John, and stepdaughter, Snow White (who now becomes a beautiful princess 16 years later). However, Elspeth is vain and keeps a room full of magical mirrors which assure her each day that she is the fairest of them all whenever she asks.|$|E
5|$|Laurer had a {{strained}} {{relationship with her}} family.
