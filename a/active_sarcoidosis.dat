50|$|Two main {{approaches}} to genitourinary sarcoidosis have been proposed. Based on the marked relationship between testicular cancer and sarcoidosis, orchiectomy is recommended, even if evidence of sarcoidosis in other organs is present. By contrast, others consider immediate orchiectomy as being quite aggressive because of several {{factors associated with}} a benign diagnosis, {{as well as the}} involvement of the epididymis or vas deferens and bilateral testicular involvement. If the malignant diagnosis is established by exploration and intraoperative ultrasound-guided biopsy, orchiectomy is performed in cases of diffuse involvement of a testis. Spontaneous resolution has been reported in 50% to 70% of patients with <b>active</b> <b>sarcoidosis.</b> If the diagnosis is not established unequivocally, immunosuppressive agents (frequently steroids) will resolve the inflammation in patients who wish to salvage their fertility; and in those with severely advanced disease, after careful consideration.|$|E

40|$|Background: Sarcoidosis is a {{multisystemic}} {{disease of}} unknown etiology {{characterized by a}} disproportionate Th 1 granulomatous immune response in the organs involved.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed blood B cell subsets and BAFF levels in 33 patients with chronic sarcoidosis (<b>active</b> <b>sarcoidosis</b> n = 18; inactive sarcoidosis n = 15) and 18 healthy donors.

40|$|Current {{concepts}} of the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis suggest that the expanded numbers of activated T-helper/inducer cells at sites of disease activity result, at least in part, from their proliferation in the local milieu. Normal clonal proliferation of T cells involves activation and expression of the IL 2 receptor (IL 2 R) gene. Thus, knowing that IL 2 R mRNA transcripts are relatively long lived, we hypothesized that sarcoid blood T cells may contain IL 2 R mRNA transcripts and express functional surface IL 2 R, although the cells are probably activated elsewhere. Northern analysis using a 32 P-labeled cDNA probe for the IL 2 R p 55 protein demonstrated that blood T cells of patients with <b>active</b> <b>sarcoidosis,</b> but not of normal patients, express 3. 5 - and 1. 5 -kb IL 2 R mRNA transcripts, {{the same as those}} observed in normal T cells activated in vitro. Consistent with this, using flow cytometry and an MAb directed against the IL 2 R p 55 protein (2 A 3), we observed detectable levels of IL 2 R surface protein on increased numbers of blood T cells of <b>active</b> <b>sarcoidosis</b> patients (4. 7 +/- 0. 9 %) compared with blood T cells of normal patients (0. 9 +/- 0. 2 %). Importantly, when the sarcoid blood T cells were exposed to IL 2 in vitro, they proliferated at a rate greater than that of normal blood T cells under the same conditions, suggesting that the IL 2 R spontaneously expressed by sarcoid blood T cells were functionally active. In the context of the known compartmentalization of spontaneous IL 2 production and T cell proliferation at sites of disease in active pulmonary sarcoidosis, these IL 2 R positive blood T cells would probably have a proliferative advantage if they trafficked to sites of <b>active</b> <b>sarcoidosis,</b> such as the lower respiratory tract...|$|E

METHODS [...] The different classes of circulating immune complexes containing immunoglobulin A, G, or M, {{and the content of}} complement in circulating immune complexes (polyethylene glycol precipitation) as well as levels of complement binding circulating immune complexes (complement binding assay) were determined in 19 patients with <b>active,</b> untreated pulmonary <b>sarcoidosis.</b> The results were compared with other parameters in the serum (soluble interleukin 2 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme, immunoglobulin A, G, and M) and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (lymphocytes, helper cells, suppressor cells, activated T cells), and with radiological stage and functional parameters (FEV 1, vital capacity, total lung capacity, transfer coefficient (KCO), and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference during exercise). RESULTS [...] In all patients circulating immune complexes could be detected by polyethylene glycol precipitation and were similar to control subjects. The content of C 1 q in circulating immune complexes was higher than in controls, yet in {{all but one of the}} cases was still within normal limits. In contrast, elevated levels of complement binding circulating immune complexes were found in 67 % of the patients. No correlation was seen between circulating immune complexes and any of the other parameters in the serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or lung function values. No differences were found between radiological type I and II presentations of sarcoidosis.

Since the proteasome is involved in antigen presentation, alterations in the alveolar and parenchymal proteasomal system may be a feature of sarcoidosis. ObjectivesTo explore the role of proteasomes and immunoproteasomes in sarcoidosis. MethodsTotal proteasome concentration and activity was assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) supernatant obtained from sarcoidosis patients (nÂ =Â  67) and healthy controls (nÂ =Â  18) using ELISA and cleavage of specific fluorogenic substrates (Â±epoxomicin), respectively. Immunohistochemistry of lung tissue sections and immunocytochemistry of BAL macrophages for immunoproteasome was performed in sarcoidosis patients and controls. ResultsProteasome was present in BAL supernatants of all sarcoidosis patients. In sarcoidosis, abundant immunoproteasome staining was seen in pneumocytes type II and granulomas. Total proteasome concentration was greater in <b>active</b> <b>sarcoidosis,</b> stages II (101 Â ng/mlÂ Â±Â  79; pÂ =Â  0. 009) and III (119 Â ng/mlÂ Â±Â  66; pÂ =Â  0. 012), than in inactive sarcoidosis or in healthy controls (35 Â ng/mlÂ Â±Â  34).

However, the incidence of subclinical neurosarcoidosis may be much higher [3, 4]. Necropsy studies suggest that ante mortem diagnosis is made in only 50 % of patients with nervous system involvement [5].

In contrast, cells positive for interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) were located in CD 11 c+ cells within granulomas. Lymph nodes of patients with sarcoidosis contained significantly higher amounts of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL- 1 beta than control lymph nodes.

40|$|In an {{investigation}} of the immunopathogenesis of sarcoidosis, the authors undertook the tissue localization of those lymphokines and lymphokine receptors which are known to {{play a central role in}} T-cell and macrophage activation. Using monoclonal antibodies and an ABC immunoperoxidase technique. They determined the distribution of gamma interferon (IFN-g), interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), and corresponding IL- 2 receptors (IL- 2 R), plus T cells and T cell subsets, B cells, and macrophages within thoracic lymph nodes and lung specimens of 9 patients with <b>active</b> pulmonary <b>sarcoidosis.</b> Epithelioid and multinucleate giant cells within sarcoid granulomas of all specimens showed membrane labeling for IL- 2 R and IFN-g, in addition to IL- 2, suggesting that these cells indeed express functional IL- 2 receptors. Infiltrating T cells, largely T 4 +, were also IL- 2 R+, and many showed IL- 2 and IFN-g labeling. By comparison, macrophages within sections of normal lung or lymph node failed to stain for IL- 2, IL- 2 R, or IFN-g. These immunohistologic studies extend recent in vitro observations by these authors and others that normal human blood monocytes and alveolar macrophages are induced by IFN-g or IL- 2 to express functional membrane-bound IL- 2 receptors. The in vivo expression of IL- 2 R by mononuclear phagocytes in pulmonary sarcoidosis is demonstrated, and a new role is suggested for T-cell-derived lymphokines in macrophage activation...|$|R
