50|$|Genealogists must {{consider}} the effects that copying and compiling errors may have had on the information in a source. For this reason, sources are generally categorized in two categories: original and derivative. An original source {{is one that is}} not based on another source. A derivative source is information taken from another source. This distinction is important because each time a source is copied, information about the record may be lost and errors may result from the copyist misreading, mistyping, or miswriting the information. Genealogists should consider the number of times information has been copied and the types of derivation a piece of information has undergone. The types of derivatives include: photocopies, transcriptions, <b>abstracts,</b> <b>translations,</b> extractions, and compilations.|$|R

Moreover, in agglutinative languages {{which do not}} have reliable stemmers, miss-ing various lexical formations in bilingual dictionaries degrades CLIR performance. This paper aims to introduce a probabilistic translation model to solve the ambiguity problem, and also to provide most likely formations of a dictionary candidate. We propose Minimum Edit Sup-port Candidates (MESC) method that exploits a monolingual corpus and a bilingual dictionary to translate users ’ native language queries to documents ’ language. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dictionary-based English-Persian CLIR. ...|$|E

We present an Interprocedural Translation Validation algorithm that automatically proves correct translation of the source program to the target program in presence of interprocedural optimizations such as global constant propagation, inlining, tail-recursion elimination, interprocedural dead code elimination, dead argument elimination, and cloning. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Translations</b> to (first-order) datalog {{have been}} used in a number of inferencing {{techniques}} for description logics (DLs), yet the relationship between the semantic expressivities of function-free Horn logic and DL is understood only poorly. Although Description Logic Programs (DLP) have been described as DLs in the “expressive intersection ” of DL and datalog, it is unclear what an intersec-tion of two syntactically incomparable logics is, even if both have a first-order logic semantics. In this work, we offer a characterisation for DL fragments that can be expressed, in a concrete sense, in datalog. We then determine the largest such fragment for the DL ALC, and provide an outlook on the extension of our methods to more expressive DLs. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Domain-independent {{planning}} {{in general is}} broadly ap-plicable {{to a wide range}} of tasks. Many formalisms exist that allow the description of different aspects of realistic problems. Which one to use is often no obvious choice, since a higher degree of expres-siveness usually comes with an increased planning time and/or a de-creased policy quality. Under the assumption that hard guarantees are not required, users are faced with a decision between multiple ap-proaches. As a generic model we use a probabilistic description in the form of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We define <b>abstracting</b> <b>translations</b> into a classical planning formalism and fully observable nondeterministic planning. Our goal is to give insight into how state-of-the-art systems perform on different MDP planning domains. ...|$|R

A variety of wavelet systems can appear as π() ψ, where π is a unitary representation of a wavelet group and is the abstract pseudo-lattice.

For a subclass of groups that includes the case where the translation subgroup is Heisenberg, we show that this condition always holds, and we cite familiar examples as applications.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an approach}} to modeling monolingual and bilingual dictionaries in the description logic species of the OWL Web Ontology Language (OWL DL).

The paper addresses the advantages of using OWL DL for the design of monolingual and bilingual dictionaries and proposes a generalized architecture for that purpose. Moreover, mechanisms for querying and checking the consistency of such models are presented, and it is concluded that DL provides means which are capable of adequately meeting the requirements on the design of multilingual dictionaries. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Translation</b> of {{specialized}} information for end users into many languages is necessary, whether it concerns agriculture, health, etc. The quality of translations must be gradable, from poor for non-essential parts to {{very good for}} crucial parts, and translated segments should be accompanied with a measured and certified "quality level". We sketch an organization where this can be obtained {{through a combination of}} "mutualized " human work and automatic NLP techniques, using the UNL language of "anglosemantic " graphs as a "pivot". Building the necessary multilingual lexical data base can be done in a mutualized way, and all these functions should be integrated in a "Montaigne" environment allowing users to access information through a browser and to switch to translating or postediting and back. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Translation</b> {{techniques}} are often employed by cross-lingual ontology mapping (CLOM) approaches {{to turn a}} cross-lingual mapping problem into a monolingual mapping problem which can then be solved by {{state of the art}} monolingual ontology matching tools. However {{in the process of doing}} so, noisy translations can compromise the quality of the matches generated by the subsequent monolingual matching techniques. In this paper, a novel approach to improve the quality of cross-lingual ontology mapping is presented and evaluated. The proposed approach adopts the pseudo feedback technique that is similar to the well understood relevance feedback mechanism used in the field of information retrieval. It is shown through the evaluation that pseudo feedback can improve the matching quality in a CLOM scenario. Keywords: Cross-Lingual Ontology Mapping; Pseudo Feedback. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Abstract</b> <b>Translation</b> {{is an act}} of {{articulation}} {{that takes}} place in the social topos of differ-ence or incommensurability. The topos of difference, to which translation is a response, is anterior to the conceptual difference of species or particularities. Yet, translation is often represented as a process of establishing equivalence according to the model of communication. This misapprehension of translation derives from the confusion of the act of translation with its representation. By representing translation that is unrepre-sentable in itself through the schema of co-figuration, the representation of translation inscribes and re-inscribes the twin figures of languages between which a transfer of infor-mation is supposed to have taken place. This whole regime organized around the schema of co-figuration is a historical construct of modernity that has worked powerfully to project national/ethnic languages and the international world, only within which national languages are possible. Our task is to historicize this regime of translation...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} operational, denotational, and axiomatic {{semantics}} of lazy and call-by-value functional languages, and use these semantics {{to build a}} new expressiveness theory for comparing functional languages. The first part of the thesis develops the theory of lazy and call-by-value languages separately, following paradigmatic studies of call-by-name functional languages. We first describe the operational semantics of two simply-typed languages, lazy PCF and call-byvalue PCF. These two languages provide enough intuition to describe general definitions of denotational models and logics for lazy and call-by-value languages. We prove, via a completeness theorem, that the definitions of models and logic coincide for both the lazy and call-by-value theories. The second part of the thesis compares the two kinds of languages via translations. Specifically, we develop the idea of a fully <b>abstract</b> <b>translation</b> and define new fully abstract translations from call-by-value PCF to lazy PCF, and vi [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to learning phrasal inversion transduction grammars via Bayesian MAP (maximum a posteriori) or information-theoretic MDL (minimum description length) model optimization so as to incorporate simultaneously the choices of model structure as well as parameters. In comparison to most current SMT approaches, the model learns phrase translation lexicons that (a) do not require enormous amounts of run-time memory, (b) contain significantly less redundancy, and (c) provide an obvious basis for generalization to <b>abstract</b> <b>translation</b> schemas. Model structure choice is biased by a description length prior, while parameter choice is driven by data likelihood biased by a parameter prior. The search over possible model structures is made feasible by a novel top-down rule segmenting heuristic which efficiently incorporates estimates of the posterior probabilities. Since the priors reward model parsimony, the learned grammar is very concise and still performs significantly better than the maximum likelihood driven bottom-up rule chunking baseline. ...|$|E

The approach consists in exhibiting fully <b>abstract</b> <b>translations</b> of the more sophisticated LTSs and bisimilarities onto the first-order ones.

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Translation</b> of Multi-word {{expressions}} (MWEs) {{is one of}} {{the most}} challenging tasks of a Machine translation (MT) system. In this paper, we present an innovative technique for dealing with MWEs in the context of MT. The technique permits bilinguals to give translations of MWEs in the form of patterns, without requiring them to be trained linguistically. The interpretation of the patterns is done by a dynamic machine learning algorithm, which allows the main rule-based MT system to operate based on linguistic rules. Thus, the bilingual patterns (without any explicit linguistic input) are used in conjunction with the main linguistic system. This is made possible by the learning pathway templates. These templates need to be specially prepared by trained linguists only once. After that they help to process potentially a large number of patterns. The implemented system is being used with a large-scale rule-based MT system to improve its performance. This framework can also be extended to help example-based or statistical MT systems to deal with MWEs. ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Abstract</b> <b>Translation</b> is {{an effort}} of finding {{equivalent}} meaning of a text into the second language. We emphasis meaning equivalence since in translation meaning is the object to be rendered from the source language text into the target language text. In this case, translator is faced with a text as units of meaning {{in the form of}} sets of words or sentences. The main question in translation is of meaning which always appears in the process of translation, not translation as a product of the process. Translating a text from the source text (ST) must consider the closest natural equivalent meaning. It implies that the meaning of the target text must be equivalent with that of the source. Meaning is classified into two kinds, referential meaning and connotative meaning. A translator must be aware of which meaning is possibly intended by the author. Beside, it should also be paid attention on the components embedded in a certain unit of meaning. By understanding the components of meaning of the source language expressions a translator can make the best decision related to the components...|$|E
