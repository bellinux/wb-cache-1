50|$|Social {{judgment}} theory (SJT) is a self-persuasion theory {{proposed by}} Carolyn Sherif, Muzafer Sherif, and Carl Hovland, defined by Sherif and Sherif as the perception {{and evaluation of}} an idea by comparing it with current attitudes.

SJT is the subconscious sorting out of ideas that occurs at the instant of perception.|$|E

50|$|During {{his time}} at Princeton, Cross began meeting with William S. Hall, one of America’s most {{accomplished}} black psychologists, who was just starting {{his career as a}} psychologist at the time. After discussing his ideas, Hall helped Cross devise ways to empirically test his model. The items that they created for a Q-sort experiment would eventually influence the first version of the Racial Identity <b>Attitude</b> <b>Scale</b> (RIAS). “The Negro-to-Black Conversion Experience: Toward a Psychology of Black Liberation” was published in the July 1971 issue of Black World, Hoyt Fuller’s journal, based in Atlanta. With pressure building against the Black Movement in the 1970s, Fuller was eventually forced to shut down Black World. Shortly thereafter, Bill Hall published the results of his empirical study in 1972, which was later referred to as the Hall-Cross Model. In 1976, Cross completed doctoral studies in Psychology at Princeton University.|$|E
5000|$|Ray and Doratis {{designed}} a groundbreaking <b>attitude</b> <b>scale</b> to measure religiocentrism and ethnocentrism. Their religiocentrism scale comprises 33 items (for instance, [...] "I think my religion is nearer {{to the truth}} than any other" [...] and [...] "Most Moslems, Buddhists and Hindus are very stupid and ignorant"), with five-point Likert scale psychometric response options from [...] "Strongly agree" [...] (Scored 5) to [...] "Strongly disagree" [...] (1). To verify internal consistency among respondents, 11 items were reverse scored ("It makes no difference to me what religion my friends are" [...] is the converse of [...] "I think that it's better if you stick to friends of the same religion as your own"), resulting in a reliability coefficient of [...]88 among 154 first-year university students. The authors tested attitudes among Australian fifth-form students in two Catholic and two public schools, and discovered that neither ethnocentrism nor religiocentrism showed any correlation with religious background. Ray and Doratis concluded (1971:178), [...] "Ethnocentrism, religiocentrism and religious conservatism were all shown to be separate and distinct factors of attitudes in their own right. They are not just three aspects of the one thing. Religiocentric people do however tend to be both religiously conservative and ethnocentric." ...|$|E

40|$|Orientation: The {{concepts}} of the Protean Career and the Boundaryless Career show potential as frameworks for research and practice {{in the contemporary world}} of work. Briscoe, Hall and DeMuth (2006) developed the Protean and Boundaryless Career <b>Attitude</b> <b>Scales,</b> which consist of the Self-Directed Career Management, Values Driven, Boundaryless Mindset and Mobility Preference subscales. However, the standardisation and replication studies conducted by Briscoe et al., left some questions unanswered in terms of the psychometric properties of the subscales. Research purpose: This study examines the psychometric properties of the Protean and Boundaryless Career <b>Attitude</b> <b>Scales</b> with the aim of clarifying the structure of the scales, examining the quality of the items and evaluating the measurement precision of the scales. Research design, approach and method: Responses of adults to the items of the Protean and Boundaryless Career <b>Attitude</b> <b>Scales</b> were analysed with factor analytic and Rasch item response model techniques. Main findings: Factor and Rasch analyses revealed that three of the four postulated dimensions were replicated, but the Values Driven dimension split into two factors. Misfitting items were identified and sources of their misfit were uncovered. The Rasch analysis showed that three of the four subscales provide most of their psychometric information at the lower ends of their respective latent traits (where relatively few persons are located). Hence, the trait estimates of persons with low scores are more precise than those of persons with high scores. Practical/managerial implications: Overall, the quality of the Protean and Boundaryless Career <b>Attitude</b> <b>Scales</b> is satisfactory, but some aspects that may be improved are identified. Researchers may use at least three of the four subscales with confidence, but more work is possibly needed on the Values Driven subscale. Contribution/value-add: The study provides researchers with information on the psychometric properties of the Protean and Boundaryless Career <b>Attitude</b> <b>Scales.</b> The study also highlights ways in which the scales may be improved. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{previous}} positron {{emission tomography}} (PET) study reported increased serotonin 5 -HT(2 A) receptor binding in unmedicated depressed patients with high scores on the Dysfunctional <b>Attitudes</b> <b>Scale.</b> The {{purpose of the present}} study was to use the highly selective 5 -HT(2 A) receptor ligand [(11) C]MDL 100, 907 in a PET imaging paradigm to assess 1) 5 -HT(2 A) receptor binding potential in euthymic subjects with a history of recurrent depression and 2) the relationship between receptor binding and scores on the Dysfunctional <b>Attitudes</b> <b>Scale.</b> METHOD: Cortical 5 -HT(2 A) receptor binding was measured in 20 unmedicated, fully recovered unipolar depressed patients and 20 age- and gender-matched comparison subjects. Regional estimates of binding potential were obtained using a reversible plasma input function compartmental model and the cerebellum as a reference region to estimate the free and non-specifically bound [(11) C]MDL 100, 907 in brain tissue. RESULTS: Relative to the comparison subjects, the recovered depressed patients demonstrated significantly higher 5 -HT(2 A) receptor binding potential in the frontal cortex (mean increase: 19 %), parietal cortex (mean increase: 25 %), and occipital cortex (mean increase: 19 %). 5 -HT(2 A) receptor binding potential correlated negatively with age in both patients and comparison subjects and positively with the Dysfunctional <b>Attitudes</b> <b>Scale</b> in the recovered patients. CONCLUSIONS: These findings should be considered preliminary but suggest that recovered subjects with a history of recurrent major depression have elevated binding potential of cortical 5 -HT(2 A) receptors. The correlation of increased 5 -HT(2 A) receptor binding potential with increased scores on Dysfunctional <b>Attitudes</b> <b>Scale</b> supports earlier work suggesting that increased 5 -HT(2 A) receptor availability characterizes a group of depressed patients with high levels of dysfunctional attitudes...|$|R
