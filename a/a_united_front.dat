5|$|Beginning on 19 February 1971, {{the court}} heard reports from Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr of McCartney's {{attempts}} to control the band, and McCartney's equally unflattering assessment of Klein. Although the other three former Beatles had presented <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>front</b> against McCartney since his April 1970 departure from the band, the recent publication of Lennon's scathing comments to Rolling Stone editor Jann Wenner, about McCartney, Harrison and Starr, added to the ill-feeling surrounding the group.|$|E

They announced a resolution by the armed forces, signed by them and seven others, claiming <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>front</b> against corruption. Apart from Kỳ and Đức, the other seven signatories were Thi, General Cao Văn Viên, an airborne brigade commander, the commander of I Corps General Tôn Thất Xứng, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang, General Nguyen Đức Thang of the General Staff, the commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, and the commander of the Rangers Colonel Pham Xuan Nhuan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{and even as}} late as 1987, Solidarity was seen by many, {{including}} most of its activists, as likely {{a thing of the}} past. It persisted solely as a rather small underground organization, supported by various international institutions, from the Catholic Church to the Central Intelligence Agency. When most senior Solidarity figures were interned or otherwise neutralized by the authorities, Zbigniew Bujak, head of the Union's Warsaw branch, remained in hiding and was the leader of the clandestine organization until his arrest in 1986. But the post-martial law general public showed signs of tiredness and disappointment, as it had become apparent that Solidarity was not <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E

5|$|Too weak {{to resist}} Japan, China {{appealed to the}} League of Nations for help. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being {{condemned}} for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in Shanghai, Rehe and Hebei, until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan. After the 1936 Xi'an Incident, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>front</b> to oppose Japan.|$|E
5|$|After the 1937 Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China and Japan {{formally}} went to war. When the Kuomintang and Communist Party declared <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>front</b> {{to fight}} the Japanese, Peng was confirmed as a general in the unified command structure of the NRA. At the August 20, 1937 Lochuan Conference(洛川会议), Mao believed that the united front should {{be used as a}} feint, giving token resistance to the Japanese while saving the strength of the Red Army for the eventual confrontation with the Kuomintang, but Peng, along with most other senior military and political leaders at the time, disagreed, and believed that the Red Army should genuinely focus on fighting the Japanese. Mao was not able to force his position, and the communists cooperated with the Kuomintang and fought the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the new Constitution, the 2009 general election was called. The opposition sought to delay the election by demanding a new biometric registry system, hoping that it would give them time to form <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>front</b> against MAS. Many MAS activists reacted violently against the demands, and attempting to prevent this. Morales went on a five-day hunger strike in April 2009 to push the opposition to rescind their demands. He also agreed to allow for the introduction of a new voter registry, but insisted that it was rushed through so as not to delay the election. Morales and the MAS won with a landslide majority, polling 64.2%, while voter participation had reached an all-time high of 90%. His primary opponent, Reyes Villa, gained 27% of the vote. The MAS won a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Morales notably increased his support in the east of the country, with MAS gaining a majority in Tarija.|$|E

5|$|The strikes {{reached the}} {{politically}} sensitive Baltic Sea coast, with a sit-down {{strike at the}} Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk beginning on 14 August. Among the leaders of this strike were Anna Walentynowicz and Lech Wałęsa, a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of 21 demands was formulated by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee on 17 August. The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With {{the assistance of the}} activists from the KOR, and the support of many intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations), the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>front.</b> They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of trade unions independent of government control. Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.|$|E
5|$|While MacLachlan was in England {{finding his}} experts, feuding {{continued}} in Alberta. Aberhart fired William Chant, a known Douglasite, from his cabinet after {{he refused to}} resign. Both sides accused one another of subservience to the banking industry, the Social Credit League's sworn enemy. Baker, the board's sole Aberhart loyalist, travelled the province defending his premier; at one 4,000person meeting in Calgary, he was shouted down by angry supporters of the insurgency. A petition calling for Aberhart's resignation circulated among backbenchers, and {{proved to be a}} plant by the cabinet to test MLAs' loyalty. Outwardly, however, the Social Crediters showed <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>front</b> as they awaited the promised experts; in the first recorded vote after the legislature reconvened June7, all insurgents present voted with the government, though 13 were absent.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>front</b> or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also fatal to the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E

5|$|On 27 May 1961, Tunku Abdul Rahman, {{the prime}} {{minister}} of the Federation of Malaya, announced a plan to form a greater federation together with Singapore, Sarawak, Sabah and Brunei, to be called Malaysia. On 17 January 1962, the Cobbold Commission was formed to gauge the support of Sarawak and Sabah for the plan; the Commission reported 80 percent support for federation. On 23 October 1962, five political parties in Sarawak formed <b>a</b> <b>united</b> <b>front</b> that supported the formation of Malaysia. Sarawak was officially granted self-government on 22 July 1963, and became federated with Malaya, North Borneo (now Sabah), and Singapore to form the federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. The governments of the Philippines and Indonesia opposed the federation, as did the Brunei People's Party and Sarawak-based communist groups, and in 1962, the Brunei Revolt broke out. Indonesian President Sukarno responded by deploying armed volunteers and, later, military forces into Sarawak. Thousands of Sarawak communist members went into Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo, and underwent training with the Communist Party of Indonesia. The most significant engagement of the confrontation was fought at Plaman Mapu in April 1965. The defeat at Plaman Mapu ultimately resulted in the fall of Sukarno and he was replaced by Suharto as president of Indonesia. Negotiations were restarted between Malaysia and Indonesia and led {{to the end of the}} confrontation on 11 August 1966.|$|E
