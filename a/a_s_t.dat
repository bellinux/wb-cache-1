This required him to be seconded to the Navy and temporarily becoming a Special Operations Executive operative. In May 1942, Operation Fritham had a bad start, after losing radio contact the two Norwegian ships sailing to Spitsbergen were stuck in the ice fjord and immediately attacked by German Condor aircraft.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mass media {{campaigns for}} stroke {{awareness}} encourage {{the public to}} recognise stroke symptoms and respond to stroke in a timely manner. However, {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that media messages can influence behaviour after stroke onset. The F. <b>A.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>T.</b> (Face Arm Speech Time) test is a common stroke recognition tool used in public education campaigns. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the F. <b>A.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>T.</b> campaign on health service use in Ireland, which has had no previous exposure to a F. <b>A.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>T.</b> media campaign. METHODS: An interrupted time series design was used to detect behaviour change after the introduction of the first Irish F. <b>A.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>T.</b> campaign in presentations of patients with suspected stroke to two emergency departments (EDs), serving a population of about 580 000.

40|$|We {{present a}} tight extremal {{threshold}} {{for the existence}} of Hamilton cycles in graphs with large minimum degree and without a large "bipartite hole" (two disjoint sets of vertices with no edges between them). This result extends Dirac's classical theorem, and is related to a theorem of Chvátal and Erdős. In detail, <b>an</b> (<b>s,</b> <b>t)</b> -bipartite-hole in <b>a</b> graph G consists of two disjoint sets of vertices <b>S</b> and <b>T</b> with |S|= <b>s</b> and |T|=t such that there are no edges between S and T; and α(G) is the maximum integer r such that G contains <b>an</b> (<b>s,</b> <b>t)</b> -bipartite-hole for every pair of non-negative integers <b>s</b> and <b>t</b> with <b>s</b> + <b>t</b> = r. Our central theorem is that a graph G with at least 3 vertices is Hamiltonian if its minimum degree is at least α(G). From the proof we obtain a polynomial time algorithm that either finds a Hamilton cycle or a large bipartite hole. The theorem also yields a condition {{for the existence of}} k edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles. We see that for dense random graphs G(n,p), the probability of failing to contain many edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles is (1 - p) ^(1 + o(1)) n.
