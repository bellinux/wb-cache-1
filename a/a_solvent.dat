5|$|Acetic acid {{is often}} used as <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> for {{reactions}} involving carbocations, such as Friedel-Crafts alkylation. For example, one stage in the commercial manufacture of synthetic camphor involves a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement of camphene to isobornyl acetate; here acetic acid acts both as <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> and as a nucleophile to trap the rearranged carbocation.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} is an {{excellent}} polar protic solvent, as noted above. It is frequently used as <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> for recrystallization to purify organic compounds. Acetic acid is used as <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> {{in the production of}} terephthalic acid (TPA), the raw material for polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In 2006, about 20% of acetic acid was used for TPA production.|$|E
5|$|What {{complicates the}} effect is that a solute can exist in a {{different}} concentration at the surface of <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> than in its bulk. This difference varies from one soluteâ€“solvent combination to another.|$|E
30|$|PA 6 / 66, {{reference}} Ultramid C 40 L, Basf brand was used. <b>As</b> <b>solvent,</b> <b>a</b> {{mixture of}} formic acid and acetic acid was used, and distilled water as the coagulation bath.|$|R

50|$|The liquid organic {{electrolyte}} {{is a solution}} of an ion-forming inorganic lithium compound {{in a mixture of}} <b>a</b> high-permittivity <b>solvent</b> (propylene carbonate) and <b>a</b> low-viscosity <b>solvent</b> (dimethoxyethane).|$|R
5|$|When a {{compound}} has limited {{solubility in water}} it is common practice (in the pharmaceutical industry, for example) to determine pKa values in <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> mixture such as water/dioxane or water/methanol, in which the compound is more soluble. In the example shown at the right, the pKa value rises steeply with increasing percentage of dioxane as the dielectric constant of the mixture is decreasing.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is {{also used}} at the Joint European Torus nuclear-fusion {{research}} laboratory, {{and it will be}} used in the more advanced ITER to condition the components which face the plasma. Beryllium has also been proposed as a cladding material for nuclear fuel rods, because of its good combination of mechanical, chemical, and nuclear properties. Beryllium fluoride is one of the constituent salts of the eutectic salt mixture FLiBe, which is used as <b>a</b> <b>solvent,</b> moderator and coolant in many hypothetical molten salt reactor designs, including the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR).|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} year, Geiling was {{retained}} by the FDA to research unusual deaths related to elixir sulfanilamide, a sulfonamide medicine. Kelsey assisted on this research project, {{which showed that}} the 107 deaths were caused {{by the use of}} diethylene glycol as <b>a</b> <b>solvent.</b> The next year, the United States Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. That same year she completed her studies and received a Ph.D. in pharmacology at the University of Chicago. Working with Geiling led to her interest in teratogens, drugs that cause congenital malformations (birth defects).|$|E

5000|$|Slow {{diffusion}} - {{similar to}} the above. However, <b>a</b> second <b>solvent</b> is allowed to evaporate from one container into a container holding the compound solution (gas-diffusion). <b>As</b> the <b>solvent</b> composition changes due to <b>an</b> increase in <b>solvent</b> that has gas-diffused into solution, the compound become increasingly insoluble in solution and crystallizes.|$|R
5000|$|Slow {{evaporation}} of <b>a</b> single <b>solvent</b> - {{typically the}} compound is dissolved in <b>a</b> suitable <b>solvent</b> and the solvent {{is allowed to}} slowly evaporate. Once the solution is saturated crystals can form.|$|R
5|$|If the ionic {{compound}} is soluble in <b>a</b> <b>solvent,</b> it can {{be obtained}} as a solid compound by evaporating the solvent from this electrolyte solution. As the solvent is evaporated, the ions do not go into the vapour, but stay in the remaining solution, and when they become sufficiently concentrated, nucleation occurs, and they crystallize into an ionic compound. This process occurs widely in nature, and is the means of formation of the evaporite minerals. Another method of recovering the compound from solution involves saturating a solution at high temperature and then reducing the solubility by reducing the temperature until the solution is supersaturated and the solid compound nucleates.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, chloroform, and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} can {{be divided}} into thermotropic, lyotropic and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of organic molecules, although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and concentration of the liquid-crystal molecules in <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Interface/slow mixing (often {{performed}} in an NMR tube). Similar to the above, {{but instead of}} one solvent gas-diffusing into another, the two solvents mix (diffuse) by liquid-liquid diffusion. Typically <b>a</b> second <b>solvent</b> is [...] "layered" [...] carefully {{on top of the}} solution containing the compound. Over time the two solution mix. <b>As</b> the <b>solvent</b> composition changes due to diffusion, the compound becomes increasingly insoluble in solution and crystallizes, usually at the interface. Additionally, it is better to use <b>a</b> denser <b>solvent</b> as the lower layer, and/or <b>a</b> hotter <b>solvent</b> as the upper layer because this results in the slower mixing of the solvents.|$|R
50|$|Together with <b>a</b> high-permittivity <b>solvent</b> (e.g. {{propylene}} carbonate), dimethoxyethane {{is used as}} the low-viscosity {{component of}} the solvent for electrolytes of lithium batteries. In the laboratory, DME is used as <b>a</b> coordinating <b>solvent.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lightly {{crosslinked}} {{refers to}} the lightly woven polymer portion of the scavenger. This type of resin becomes swollen in <b>a</b> particular <b>solvent,</b> allowing <b>an</b> impurity to react with a specified functional group. In many times single solvents are not sufficient to expand the resin, in which case <b>a</b> second <b>solvent</b> must be added. Examples of <b>a</b> secondary <b>solvent,</b> or co-solvent, would be Tetrahydrofuran, or THF. Typically contain 1-3% of divinylbenzene.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary use}} of DMF is as <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> with low {{evaporation}} rate. DMF {{is used in}} the production of acrylic fibers and plastics. It is also used as <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> in peptide coupling for pharmaceuticals, in the development and production of pesticides, and in the manufacture of adhesives, synthetic leathers, fibers, films, and surface coatings.|$|E
25|$|DMF {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>solvent</b> {{to recover}} olefins such as 1,3-butadiene via {{extractive}} distillation.|$|E

40|$|Light {{scattering}} and {{intrinsic viscosity}} measurements {{have been made}} on three different series of vinyl acetate polymers, one linear and two branched. One of the branched series was obtained by [ractionation of a high conversion polymer, the other by a graft polymerization under conditions that allowed structural characterization of the resultant comb-shaped polymers. These data show that {{the ratio of the}} mean-square radii of gyration of branched and linear polymers of the same molecular weight is greater in good solvents than the ratio calculated tl eoretically]or <b>a</b> theta <b>solvent.</b> The ratio of the second virial coefficients of the comb-shaped branched and linear polymers of the same molecular weight is equal within experimental error to the ratio of the intrinsic viscosities. The ratio of the intrinsic viscosities of branched and linear polymers is greater in <b>a</b> good <b>solvent</b> than in <b>a</b> theta <b>solvent,</b> in support of inferences from the behavior of the radius of gyration. A theoretical expression for the ratio of the intrinsic viscosities in <b>a</b> poor <b>solvent</b> is obeyed more nearly in <b>a</b> good <b>solvent</b> han in <b>a</b> theta <b>solvent...</b>|$|R
50|$|Herbal tinctures are {{not always}} made using ethanol as the solvent, though this is most {{commonly}} the case. Other solvents include vinegar, glycerol, diethyl ether and propylene glycol, not {{all of which can}} be used for internal consumption. Ethanol has the advantage of being <b>an</b> excellent <b>solvent</b> for both acidic and basic (alkaline) constituents.Glycerine can also be used, but when used in tincturing fashion is generally <b>a</b> poorer <b>solvent.</b> Vinegar, being acidic, is <b>a</b> better <b>solvent</b> for obtaining alkaloids but <b>a</b> poorer <b>solvent</b> for acidic components. For individuals who choose not to ingest alcohol, non-alcoholic e,g., (glycerite) extracts offer an alternative for preparations meant to be taken internally.|$|R
25|$|The {{other main}} {{application}} of THF is as <b>an</b> industrial <b>solvent</b> for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and in varnishes.
