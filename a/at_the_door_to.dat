Toting her pink backpack, Rosie pauses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> watch Stan (Brent Sexton) conduct business on the phone, then she walks out.|$|E
25|$|Then on 24 December, Darlan {{was assassinated}} in mysterious circumstances. On the {{afternoon}} of 24 December 1942, the admiral drove to his offices at the Palais d'Été and was shot down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> his bureau by a young man of 20, Bonnier de la Chapelle, a monarchist. The young man was tried by court martial under Giraud's orders and executed on the 26th. With the strong backing of the Allies, especially Eisenhower, Giraud was elected to succeed Darlan.|$|E
50|$|The Housewares Show grew swiftly after World War II ended.

Is the difference very great, after all? ...|$|R

25|$|When Corinna (wife) {{arrives with}} Mervyn {{it is clear}} that when we saw Nan in act 1, Jerome had {{modelled}} her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, unwashed and very unfeminine – in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain to the kitchen for a drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her to the bedroom to put her to bed.|$|E
500|$|... "Mole Hunt" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} television critics and media outlets. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News wrote that it [...] "has a little 'Arrested Development' {{and a little}} of 'The Office' and maybe some 'Mad Men,'" [...] and recommended it to readers {{as one of the}} [...] "new and good on TV this fall." [...] Hinkely also commented favorably on the scene where Archer tries firing bullets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the mainframe, only to a bullet ricochet and hit another agent, likening it to [...] "Leslie Nielsen classics." [...] Matt Roush of TV Guide said that he [...] "got many more sustained belly laughs" [...] out of the episode than he did with the aforementioned Philadelphia premiere.|$|E
500|$|There was a {{widespread}} expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband; one family friend stated, as William McKinley lay dying, {{that they should}} be prepared for a double funeral. This did not occur; the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train. Leech noted [...] "the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who huddled in a compartment of the funeral train, praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love". She was thought too weak to attend the services in Washington or Canton, although she listened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street. She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life, setting up a shrine in her house, and often visiting the receiving vault, until her death at age 59 on May 26, 1907. She died only months before the completion of the large marble monument to her husband in Canton, which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30, 1907. William and Ida McKinley are interred there with their daughters, atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton.|$|E
50|$|Some theaters (including {{those with}} IMAX stadiums) have {{detectors}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> pick up recording smugglers. At particularly anticipated showings, theaters may employ night vision equipment {{to detect a}} working camera during a screening. In some jurisdictions this is illegal unless the practice has been announced {{to the public in}} advance.|$|R

500|$|Kung Fu Hustle makes {{references}} {{to a wide}} range of films, animated cartoons, wuxia novels and other sources. Sing and Bone resemble George Milton and Lennie Small from the 1992 film Of Mice and Men. The housing arrangement of the Pig Sty Alley is similar to that of a 1973 Hong Kong film, The House of 72 Tenants. There are two {{references to}} Chow's previous film, Shaolin Soccer. [...] When Sing arrives at Pig Sty Alley, he plays skillfully with a soccer ball, then says, [...] "You're still playing football?". The second reference is the scene in which a clerk beats Sing up on a bus. The clerk also appeared in Shaolin Soccer as the leader of an opposing team who used hidden weapons to beat up the Shaolin soccer team. When Sing challenges a boy in the Pig Sty Alley, Sing calls him [...] "The Karate Kid", a reference to the 1984 film of the same name. During the altercation between Sing and the hairdresser, the hairdresser states, [...] "Even if you kill me, there will be thousands more of me!". This is a reference to a famous quote made by Lu Haodong, a Chinese revolutionary in the late Qing Dynasty. The scene in which Sing is chased by the Landlady as he flees from the Alley is a homage to Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, characters in the Looney Tunes cartoons, even including the pursuer's (the Landlady's) ill fate. In the scene in which Sing robs the ice cream vendor, a poster for the 1935 film Top Hat is in the background. As Sing arrives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the Beast's cell in the mental asylum, he hallucinates a large wave of blood rushing from the cell door, similar to a scene in The Shining. The Landlady says at one point, [...] "Tomorrow is another day," [...] which is a line from the 1936 novel Gone with the Wind and its 1939 film adaptation.|$|E

2500|$|Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) {{are going}} through Regina's stores of potions in her vault and cannot find {{something}} that will unfreeze Marian. [...] Henry surmises that Robin Hood is {{still in love with}} Regina because true love's kiss did not unfreeze her. Regina says that this time Henry may be too young to fully understand everything. Hook walks Emma home and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the loft they share a kiss after Emma jokingly invites him in for coffee with her parents. During the kiss Hook notices his left hand again acting aggressively. Emma walks inside and has a moment when she seems to realize Hook's hand's actions and has a brief conversation with her parents. Hook runs into a drunk Will Scarlet trying to break into the library and punches him in the face when Will refuses to stop. Hook again is put off by his hand controlling his actions and tells Will that if he informs anyone of what happened he will be a dead man. As Mr. Gold is preparing to go home in his car with flowers Hook enters the passenger door and tells Mr. Gold to replace his hand with the hook. He refuses, saying Hook should've heeded his warnings. Hook threatens to inform Belle (Emilie de Ravin) of the dagger, but Gold then tells Hook that he has swapped the daggers and that Belle has the actual dagger. Mr. Gold says he will replace the Hook once Hook does a favor for him. He refuses to give Hook a definite date or time and Hook states he {{can find a way to}} remove it without magic. Mr. Gold tells Hook that since his magic restored the hand, only his magic can take it off. Enraged, Hook thrusts the hook into Gold's chest. Mr. Gold is unharmed, stating he would have thought Hook would have learned the first time he tried to kill Rumplestiltskin. Hook states that it wasn't him that did that, and Mr. Gold states that the next time he may harm someone else who he cares about. Hook states he will do whatever it takes and Mr. Gold says that he loves it when people say that. He tells Hook to meet him on the docks in the morning.|$|E
