5|$|Some scenes shows Timberlake {{performing}} on the stairway with <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> while {{a group of}} unknown girls with red paint on their eyes are seen dancing next to him while one (Johansson) is seen waving her batons with fire on them {{near the end of}} the video.|$|E
5|$|Gillan is {{a passionate}} {{football}} fan, supporting Queens Park Rangers. He {{is also a}} big fan of cricket. He is also known for his intolerance of aggressive crowd security personnel at concerts. On 15 August 1998, he was charged with assault after striking a security guard on the head with <b>a</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|E
5|$|The second {{show was}} widely {{acknowledged}} as {{superior to the}} afternoon performance, although Village Voice reviewer Don Heckman noted that many in the audience reacted to the Shankar–Khan opening set {{with a lack of}} respect. Not aiding the Indian musicians was the failure of <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> on Rakha's hand drums, Heckman observed, so denying the crowd a vital element of the musical interplay between sitar and sarod.|$|E

5000|$|Each of {{the singers}} had two {{microphones}} during the performances: <b>a</b> headset <b>microphone</b> with <b>a</b> flesh-colored pad on the tip, and <b>a</b> hand-held <b>microphone.</b>|$|R
5|$|Though {{numerous}} episodes {{are still}} missing, full-length audio soundtracks for all missing episodes {{are held by}} the BBC. These come from off-air recordings made by fans, often made by use of <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> attached to a tape recorder placed close to the television set. While the quality of these off-air recordings varies greatly, multiple fan recordings exist for every episode.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was filmed and {{released}} in 2000. Filmed inside a nightclub, the video begins with Durand entering the stage while simultaneous images of the band using instruments appear. Durand then {{stands in front of}} <b>a</b> <b>microphone,</b> preparing for an upcoming verse. Various shots of an audience, background dancers and singers, and trumpet performers are also shown. After the second chorus, the clip focuses on Durand, who is now mouthing some of the words of the song; the final chorus resumes the simultaneous images setup.|$|E
5|$|Bor is a {{guide for}} {{visually}} impaired skiers. In this role, he skis {{in front of the}} visually impaired skier and gives him or her direction to get down the course using speakers and <b>a</b> <b>microphone.</b> At the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino, Bor served as an Australian assistant coach. In 2009, following those Games, he shifted his role to serve as Melissa Perrine's guide as Perrine advanced further in the sport. He first skied with Perrine at a World Cup event in January 2010 where they finished fourth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{camera is}} powered by four AA batteries, and records onto SD flash memory cards (512MB maximum capacity). The variable-bitrate codec allows a maximum {{recording}} time of approximately 45-50 minutes with a 512MB card. Other features include <b>a</b> built-in <b>microphone,</b> <b>a</b> 1/8" [...] jack for <b>an</b> external <b>microphone,</b> <b>a</b> 1/8" [...] jack that provides NTSC composite video output with audio, a mini-USB connector for accessing the data on the SD memory card, and a tripod mount.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> GameCube-compatible <b>microphone</b> was {{included}} with Karaoke Revolution Party for GameCube. It plugs into the memory card slot. It is <b>a</b> standardized <b>microphone</b> {{that is also}} compatible with other games (such as Mario Party 6).|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>microphone’s</b> {{sensitivity}} {{varies with}} frequency (as {{well as with}} other factors such as environmental conditions) and is therefore normally recorded as several sensitivity values, each for a specific frequency band (see frequency spectrum). <b>A</b> <b>microphone’s</b> sensitivity can also depend {{on the nature of}} the sound field it is exposed to. For this reason, microphones are often calibrated in more than one sound field, for example a pressure field and a free field. Depending on their application, measurement microphones must be tested periodically (every year or several months, typically), and after any potentially damaging event, such as being dropped or exposed to sound levels beyond the device’s operational range.|$|R
5|$|It was {{a double}} system, that is, {{the sound was}} on a {{different}} piece of film from the picture.... In essence, the sound was captured by <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> and translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, {{where it would be}} photographed {{on the side of the}} film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{worked with}} Alan Splet {{to design the}} film's sound. The pair {{arranged}} and fabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is densely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels. Sounds were created {{in a variety of}} ways—for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet inserted <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub, and recorded the sound of air blown through the bottle. After being recorded, sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch, reverb and frequency.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E
25|$|Most older {{hearing aids}} have only <b>an</b> {{omnidirectional}} <b>microphone.</b> An omnidirectional microphone amplifies sounds equally from all directions. In contrast, <b>a</b> directional <b>microphone</b> amplifies sounds from one direction more than sounds from other directions. This means that sounds originating {{from the direction}} the system is steered toward are amplified more than sounds coming from other directions. If the desired speech arrives {{from the direction of}} steering and the noise is from a different direction, then compared to <b>an</b> omnidirectional <b>microphone,</b> <b>a</b> directional <b>microphone</b> provides <b>a</b> better signal to noise ratio. Improving the signal-to-noise ratio improves speech understanding in noise. Directional microphones {{have been found to be}} the second best method to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (the best method was an FM system, which locates the microphone near the mouth of the desired talker).|$|R
5000|$|Many small video cameras, laptops, {{recorders}} {{and other}} consumer devices use <b>a</b> 3.5 mm <b>microphone</b> connector for attaching <b>a</b> (mono/stereo) <b>microphone</b> to the system.These fall into three categories: ...|$|R
5000|$|In <b>a</b> {{capacitor}} <b>microphone</b> (commonly {{known as}} <b>a</b> condenser <b>microphone),</b> the diaphragm acts as one plate of a capacitor, and vibrations produce {{changes in the}} distance between the diaphragm and a fixed plate, changing the voltage maintained across the capacitor plates.|$|R
5|$|The {{center of}} the {{building}} is occupied by the , 150 seat Great Hall, where the National Assembly convenes. Formerly rectangular, it was renovated into an amphitheater in 2000. Each seat has <b>a</b> <b>microphone,</b> an automatic voting system, plug socket {{and access to the}} National Assembly's computer network. The chair facing the doors to the hall is for the President of the National Assembly. Behind it, a bronze relief of the coat of arms of Slovenia is positioned on the marble wall. The sculptor Marko Pogačnik created the work in 1991 to celebrate independence. There is also a 106-seat gallery for the public and guests to view the Great Hall.|$|E
5|$|The iPad has two {{internal}} speakers reproducing {{left and}} right channel audio located on the bottom-right of the unit. In the original iPad, the speakers push sound through two small sealed channels leading to the three audio ports carved into the device, while the iPad 2 has its speakers behind a single grill. A volume switch {{is on the right}} side of the unit. A 3.5-mm TRRS connector audio-out jack on the top-left corner of the device provides stereo sound for headphones with or without microphones and/or volume controls. The iPad also contains <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> that can be used for voice recording.|$|E
5|$|The third contest had Shane McMahon against Eric Bischoff in a {{standard}} match. McMahon and Bischoff began by brawling on the arena ramp, as Jonathan Coachman appeared from the backstage area and hit McMahon with a steel chair. Bischoff grabbed <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> and announced that the match would be contested under no disqualification, falls count anywhere regulations; as a result, Bischoff could not be disqualified for Coachman's interference. Coachman and Bischoff performed double-team attacks on McMahon until Steve Austin interfered by performing a Stone Cold Stunners on Coachman and Bischoff. After Austin's interference, McMahon positioned Bischoff on the television commentators' table, performed a Leap of Faith onto Bischoff's chest, thereby breaking the table and covered Bischoff for the pinfall.|$|E
50|$|Movies can be {{recorded}} with {{sound and the}} recording time {{is dependent on the}} memory card capacity. They are in QuickTime (.mov) format. There is <b>a</b> built-in <b>microphone</b> on top of the camera, but there is no provision for <b>an</b> external <b>microphone.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Radially {{asymmetric}} {{systems may}} also be modeled with polar coordinates. For example, <b>a</b> <b>microphone's</b> pickup pattern illustrates its proportional response to an incoming sound from a given direction, and these patterns can be represented as polar curves. The curve for <b>a</b> standard cardioid <b>microphone,</b> the most common unidirectional microphone, can be represented as r [...] 0.5 + 0.5sin(ϕ) at its target design frequency. The pattern shifts toward omnidirectionality at lower frequencies.|$|R
50|$|The Blumlein pair {{microphone}} pattern {{can also}} be decoded from <b>a</b> soundfield <b>microphone.</b> And since <b>a</b> well-calibrated soundfield <b>microphone</b> goes down further into the bass than all but the very best directional microphones, and its coherent array performance extends to higher frequencies than the usual Blumlein Pair, <b>a</b> well-calibrated soundfield <b>microphone</b> is potentially the best performing Blumlein Pair.|$|R
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{released}} on December 24, 2010. It was directed by Don Tyler, who previously worked on videos for the bands A Day to Remember and Flyleaf. It was digitally released on June 14, 2011 via iTunes Store and the same day was also uploaded on the band's Vevo channel on YouTube. Shot in an animated technique, the video starts with an animated version of lead singer Levine singing on <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> while hands are behind his back touching his body. As the video progresses, a nude animated woman is shown dancing around him and flirting with {{the other members of}} the band. Several animation effects such as angel wings and devil elements are shown behind Levine as he is singing, while the woman is also dancing for the other members. The video finishes with a close shot of Levine's face.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kazuaki Kiriya. It opens with the camera traveling through a tunnel full of lights, and includes the song's title and Utada's name. For {{the first part of}} the song, it has Utada singing into <b>a</b> <b>microphone,</b> whilst walking inside the head of a spacecraft. The spacecraft exits the station, and flies all over a futuristic cityscape. The first verse has Utada as a hostess on the spacecraft, helping and serving the passengers in a dancing manner; the passengers are wearing theatrical clothing and headpieces that cover their faces. During the pre-chorus, Utada sings in front of a forest-like backdrop, whilst a stop-motion animation of her is walking through the woods, observing disfigured creatures. The chorus has Utada and the passengers marching across a bridge, while continuous intercut scenes of Utada outside a party is seen.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{is home to}} two {{pioneers in}} {{undergraduate}} campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, {{claims to be the}} oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room. The station has its studios {{on the second floor of}} Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest Student television station and home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{efficiency}} of voice control for industrial robot systems is analyzed using a typical manufacturing environment where a speech interaction system reveals strong advantages. Challenges industrial environments bear for speech recognition systems are mainly found in the high-volume and dynamically changing background noises. The effects of such noises are analyzed in detail using a joinery as showcase. As a robust solution for very noisy environments the use of <b>a</b> throat <b>microphone</b> is proposed. Due to their special sensing technique, these microphones present excellent noise cancelling characteristics while the frequency content of the speech signal differs significantly from the sounds recorded using <b>a</b> standard <b>microphone.</b> Two approaches for the integration of <b>a</b> throat <b>microphone</b> into <b>an</b> existing speech application are discussed: using the throat <b>microphone</b> <b>a)</b> as an additional sensor or b) {{as an alternative to}} <b>a</b> standard headset <b>microphone...</b>|$|R

5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> and that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
5|$|One {{month after}} moving to Diego-Suarez, Jaojoby entered a local talent {{competition}} and managed to win despite singing unaccompanied and without <b>a</b> <b>microphone.</b> He began to perform in nightclubs whenever the opportunity presented itself. The uncle with whom he was lodging sent word of Jaojoby's activities to the young singer's parents, who consulted a priest before giving their son permission to continue exploring his musical talents {{on the condition that}} he continue to perform well at school. Jaojoby agreed to this provision, studying during the day and performing at night for several years. In 1972 he began singing with Los Matadores, the well-established house band of the Saigonais nightclub in Diego-Suarez. This group catered to the club's primarily Western clientele by performing cover songs and rhythm and blues compositions in French and English, occasionally incorporating traditional instruments like kabosy and drums, or experimenting with local musical styles using electric guitar, bass, and drum kit, accompanied by traditional Malagasy language vocal performance.|$|E
5|$|The 19-year-old Geoff Emerick was {{promoted}} to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album. This started at 8pm on 6 April 1966, in Studio Three at Abbey Road. Lennon told producer Martin {{that he wanted to}} sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks, which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had. The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker. When the concept was explained to Lennon, he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around <b>a</b> <b>microphone</b> while he sang into it. Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re-recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker.|$|E
5000|$|Microphones can {{be thought}} of as {{speakers}} in reverse. The sound waves strike the thin diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. [...] Microphone diaphragms, unlike speaker diaphragms, tend to be thin and flexible, since they need to absorb as much sound as possible. In <b>a</b> condenser <b>microphone,</b> the diaphragm is placed in front of a plate and is charged. [...] In <b>a</b> dynamic <b>microphone,</b> the diaphragm is glued to a magnetic coil, similar to the one in a dynamic loudspeaker. (In fact, a dynamic speaker can be used as <b>a</b> rudimentary <b>microphone,</b> and vice versa.) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made to {{investigate}} trained listeners preferences regarding <b>a</b> <b>microphone's</b> directivity and distance from a speaker when listening to a voice recorded in a speaker booth. Two directivities (omnidirectional and cardioid) and three distances (5, 25 and 52 cm) were tested on 19 subjects in a multiple comparison listening test regarding their preference and five other attributes taken from earlier studies. The result showed that <b>an</b> omnidirectional <b>microphone</b> placed close to a source might be preferable over a cardioid at the same distance or a cardioid placed a bit away from the source. The omnidirectional microphone however tends to perform more even at different distances compared to a cardioid, which {{makes it easier for}} a engineer to find <b>a</b> good <b>microphone</b> position for it.
