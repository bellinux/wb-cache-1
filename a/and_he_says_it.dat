25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E

A 2017 book stated that grunge [...] "..forever changed the identity of rock music in a way analogous to punk"; moreover, grunge added [...] "introspective" [...] lyrics about [...] "existential authenticity" [...] and [...] "what {{it means to be}} true to oneself". Grunge's Kurt Cobain has been called the [...] "voice of Generation X", playing the same role for this demographic as Bob Dylan played for 1960s youth and that John Lennon played for the 1970s generation. Bob Batchelor states that Nirvana was [...] "as important as Elvis or the Beatles.” ...|$|E

Ignatieff attributes this to the [...] "patch-work quilt of distinctive societies," [...] emphasizing that civic bonds will only be easier when the understanding of Canada as a multinational community is more widely shared.|$|E

2500|$|The Doctor {{exhibits}} some weaknesses {{uncommon to}} humans. For example, according to The Mind of Evil (1971), a tablet of aspirin could kill him. In [...] "Cold Blood", a process meant to decontaminate him of bacteria {{from the surface}} of Earth causes him intense pain, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> could have killed him if allowed to proceed to completion. In the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel The Adventuress of Henrietta Street, the Doctor's second heart was surgically removed, resulting in the loss of his abilities to metabolise drugs and go without air; these are restored when he begins to grow a new heart after his old one 'dies' (Camera Obscura).|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing for La Stampa, Mario Gromo {{argued that}} it was a [...] "film of a certain {{importance}} because of its many intelligent moments, its sound portrayal of provincial life, and because it is the second film of a young director who evidently has considerable talent... The Italian film industry now has a new director and one who puts his own personal ideas before any of the customary traditions of the trade. Fellini's is a fresh approach". [...] "It is the atmosphere that counts most in this unusual film," [...] wrote Francesco Càallari of the Gazzetta del Lunedi, [...] "an intensely human and poetical atmosphere altogether estranged from the provincialism of the setting... Fellini has something to say <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> with an acute sense of observation... Here is someone apart from the other young directors of post-war Italian cinema. Fellini has a magical touch." [...] First published 31 August 1953 in the Gazzeta del Lunedi (Genoa). After praising Fellini's Venice triumph, Ermanno Contini of Il Secolo XIX outlined the film's weaknesses: [...] "I Vitelloni does not have a particularly solid structure, the story is discontinuous, seeking unity through the complex symbiosis of episodes and details... The narrative, built up around strong emotions and powerful situations, lacks solid organic unity, and at times this undermines the story's creative force, resulting in an imbalance of tone and pace and a certain sense of tedium. But such shortcomings are amply atoned for by the film's sincerity and authenticity." [...] Arturo Lanocita of Corriere della Sera wrote: [...] "I Vitelloni gives a graphic and authentic picture of certain aimless evenings, the streets populated by groups of idle youths... The film is a series of annotations, hints, and allusions without unity... With a touch of irony, Fellini tries to show the contrast between the way his characters see themselves and the way they really are. Despite its weaknesses, the film {{is one of the best}} in recent years." [...] For Giulio Cesare Castello of Cinema VI, the film proved [...] "that Fellini is the Italian film industry's most talented satirist, and an acute observer and psychologist of human behaviour. Like any good moralist, he knows how to give his story a meaning, to provide more than just simple entertainment".|$|E

HE didn't go round yellin' and wringin' his hands and sayin' 'Me pay-l! me pay-l!' when it spilt! He just humped himself and trotted back for another.

He bears, I hear, on all sides a very bad character, and I think you {{will be more than}} risking your {{happiness}} with such a man; I think for your own sake {{it would be better to}} give him up. My brother is very incensed against him; he has been out with the other keepers to the place where this fray occurred <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> was a most cowardly business, for the poachers were eight to three, and he seems to have no doubt whatever that Forester was one of the party, and that they will be able to prove it.

Bernard Underwood, a very nice fellow, brother to the husband of one of Harry May's sisters---very much liked and respected, and, by the way, an uncommonly handsome man. That was imminent before Jasper's accident, and the letter to prepare me must be reposing in Harry's care. Mr. Underwood came down with Claude to meet me when I landed, and I scented danger in his eye.

60|$|Our Senator also {{objects that}} those who oppose him in this matter do not entirely agree with one another.

He should remember that he took us by surprise--astounded us by this measure. We were thunderstruck and stunned, and we reeled and fell in utter confusion. But we rose, each fighting, grasping whatever he could first reach--a scythe, a pitchfork, a chopping-ax, or a butcher's cleaver. We struck {{in the direction of}} the sound, and we were rapidly closing in upon him. He must not think to divert us from our purpose by showing us that our drill, our dress, and our weapons are not entirely perfect and uniform.

6000|$|Everything in {{this monster}} city {{interests}} me, and I cannot keep from talking, {{even at the}} risk of being instructive. People here seem always to express distances by parables. To a stranger it is just a little confusing to be so parabolic--so to speak. I collar a citizen, and I think I am going to get some valuable information out of him. I ask him how far it is to Birmingham, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> is twenty-one shillings and sixpence. Now we know that doesn't help a man who is trying to learn. I find myself down-town somewhere, and I want to get some sort of idea where I am--being usually lost when alone--and I stop a citizen and say: [...] "How far is it to Charing Cross?" [...] "Shilling fare in a cab," [...] and off he goes. I suppose if I were to ask a Londoner how far it, is from the sublime to the ridiculous, he would try to express it in coin. But I am trespassing upon your time with these geological statistics and historical reflections. I will not longer keep you from your orgies. 'Tis a real pleasure for me to be here, and I thank you for it. The name of the Savage Club is associated in my mind with the kindly interest and the friendly offices which you lavished upon an old friend of mine who came among you a stranger, and you opened your English hearts to him and gave him welcome and a home--Artemus Ward.
