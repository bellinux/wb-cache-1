In the field of CBM exploitation, the use of non-circular gears is an attempt at an innovation. First of all, according to the working conditions of the pump and use requirements, a scheme is established whereby the one-way rotary motion of the motor is changed into reciprocating motion so that it could drive the oil pumping rod to achieve the upper and lower mining. Secondly, this paper has designed a new type non-circular gear reversing box as the core component to replace the traditional four beam linkage mechanism and also provides elaborate calculations. Finally, the movement simulation of the non-circular gear reversing gear system is completed. Comparing the motion simulation results with the theoretical ones, the correctness of our theoretical analysis can be verified. Compared with the traditional devices, the new coal seam gas drainage machine model design has nearly 11 % higher efficiency, which has obvious energy saving effects and reduces the cost of mining coal seam gas...|$|R

Our approach first partitions a configuration input into fields, and then identifies the semantic relations among these fields and the roles they play in enforcing an access control policy. Based upon such knowledge, ConfigRE automatically generates a specification language to describe the syntactic relations of these fields. The language can be converted into a scanner using standard parser generators for scanning configuration files and discovering the security policies specified in an application. We implemented ConfigRE in our research and evaluated it against real applications. The experiment results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach...|$|E

Tupni can generalize the format specification over multiple inputs. We have implemented a prototype of Tupni and evaluated it on 10 different formats: five file formats (WMF, BMP, JPG, PNG and TIF) and five network protocols (DNS, RPC, TFTP, HTTP and FTP). Tupni identified all record sequences in the test inputs. We also show that, by aggregating over multiple WMF files, Tupni can derive a more complete format specification for WMF. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of Tupni by using the rich information it provides for zeroday vulnerability signature generation, which was not possible with previous reverse engineering tools...|$|E
40|$|Malware {{authors have}} {{recently}} begun using emulation technology to obfuscate their code.

No existing malware analysis can reliably reverse this obfuscation technique. In this paper, we present the first work in <b>automatic</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering of malware emulators. Our algorithms are based on dynamic analysis. We execute the emulated malware in a protected environment and record the entire x 86 instruction trace generated by the emulator. We then use dynamic data-flow and taint analysis over the trace to identify data buffers containing the bytecode program and extract the syntactic and semantic information about the bytecode instruction set. With these analysis outputs, {{we are able to}} generate data structures, such as control-flow graphs, that provide the foundation for subsequent malware analysis. We implemented a proof-of-concept system called Rotalumé and evaluated it using both legitimate programs and malware emulated by VMProtect and Code Virtualizer.

40|$|An {{approach}} for efficient estimation of passive safety system functional reliability {{has been developed}} and applied to a simplified model of the passive residual heat transport system typical of sodium cooled fast reactors to demonstrate the reduction in computational time. The method is based on generating linear approximations to the best estimate computer code, using the technique of <b>automatic</b> <b>reverse</b> differentiation. This technique enables determination of linear approximation to the code in a few runs independent {{of the number of}} input variables for each response variable. The likely error due to linear approximation is reduced by augmented sampling through best estimate code in the neighborhood of the linear failure surface but in a sub domain where linear approximation error is relatively more. The efficiency of this new approach is compared with importance sampling MCS which uses the linear approximation near the failure region and with Direct Monte-Carlo Simulation. In the importance sampling MCS, variants employing random sampling with Box Muller algorithm and Markov Chain algorithm are inter-compared. The significance of the results with respect to system reliability is also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|B-spline {{functions}} {{are widely used}} in many industrial applications such as computer graphic representations, computer aided design, computer aided manufacturing, computer numerical control, etc. Recently, there exist some demands, e. g. in reverse engineering (RE) area, to employ B-spline curves for non-trivial cases that include curves with discontinuous points, cusps or turning points from the sampled data. The most challenging task in these cases is {{in the identification of}} the number of knots and their respective locations in non-uniform space in the most efficient computational cost. This paper presents a new strategy for fitting any forms of curve by B-spline functions via local algorithm. A new two-step method for fast knot calculation is proposed. In the first step, the data is split using a bisecting method with predetermined allowable error to obtain coarse knots. Secondly, the knots are optimized, for both locations and continuity levels, by employing a non-linear least squares technique. The B-spline function is, therefore, obtained by solving the ordinary least squares problem. The performance of the proposed method is validated by using various numerical experimental data, with and without simulated noise, which were generated by a B-spline function and deterministic parametric functions. This paper also discusses the benchmarking of the proposed method to the existing methods in literature. The proposed method is shown to be able to reconstruct B-spline functions from sampled data within acceptable tolerance. It is also shown that, the proposed method can be applied for fitting any types of curves ranging from smooth ones to discontinuous ones. In addition, the method does not require excessive computational cost, which allows it to be used in <b>automatic</b> <b>reverse</b> engineering applications...|$|E
