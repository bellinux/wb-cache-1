500|$|The video {{begins at}} a press conference where Spears, wearing a cropped Mickey Mouse top (paying homage to her days in The New Mickey Mouse Club), is being asked {{inappropriate}} questions by news reporters, such as [...] "Is it true you banned junk food, smiles, candy, sunshine and laughter from your Femme Fatale tour?" [...] Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): [...] "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you â€“ I'm out", referencing a scene from the film Half Baked. After leaving the press conference, Spears walks out of the building and out into the street, wearing a white leather jacket and a black skirt with matching with studded combat boots. She signs a fan's copy of Femme Fatale and then blows a kiss to a baby as he whistles the melody of the chorus. As Spears walks along the street, she flashes several men, including a policeman (played by Adrien Galo). As a criminal offence, the policeman searches Spears, feeling up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> legs, as she is bent over a car. Spears later walks away from the policeman, swinging handcuffs around her finger while he buttons his shirt.|$|E
6000|$|She found Esther {{fluttering}} up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> {{room like}} a newly-caught bird. [...] "Oh, Aunt Carey, I must go home! Please let me!" [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was still}} casting my eye up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> silk and laces when she {{abruptly}} turned upon {{me with a}} direct question: [...] "You seldom, I suppose, go out?" ...|$|E
60|$|Iris {{instantly}} gave <b>her</b> promise, <b>and</b> wrote <b>down</b> <b>her</b> {{address in}} London.|$|R
60|$|Fan {{was filled}} with distress, remembering <b>her</b> promise, <b>and</b> cast <b>down</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|Noie {{looked him}} up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with <b>her</b> soft, dreamy brown eyes.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the captive}} paused on the {{threshold}} of the dungeon; the wanderer stood still on the brow of the last hill. Marian paced up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> own room, and thought and reasoned half aloud,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly he had {{a daring}} and {{brilliant}} smile that changed his face completely. He rubbed his palms together. He laughed as if at a huge joke. He cast a measuring glance up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> slender form.|$|E
6000|$|She drew back, all aghast. Shame and agony held her. Something of maiden modesty burned {{bright in}} her cheek <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> very neck. Red waves coursed through her. How on earth after this could she face Walter Brydges? ...|$|E
60|$|Ayacanora blushed, <b>and</b> hung <b>down</b> <b>her</b> head; she was {{thinking}} of nothing, poor child, but Amyas.|$|R
60|$|Mary {{turned and}} looked him up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with <b>her</b> {{wondering}} blue eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> she gaed <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> farther <b>down,</b> <b>Her</b> love's {{ship for}} to see, And the topmast and the {{mainmast}} Shone like the silver free.|$|R
6000|$|... "Worn out! Worn out!" [...] Madame said, nodding {{slowly up}} <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> <b>Her</b> black veil, pushed up, sagged over her brows like a {{mourning}} band. [...] "You cannot afford to waste the stamina. And will {{you keep on}} the theatre--with Mr. May--?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{clearly the}} {{beautiful}} Rachel was extraordinarily agitated. At night {{she did not}} sleep, but would pace up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> apartments in a state bordering on frenzy, which of course caused M. le Marquis {{a great deal of}} anxiety and of sorrow.|$|E
6000|$|Their {{vigorous}} young {{hands had}} to grip at this, and then Elizabeth had a still more poignant thought {{that brought the}} tears from her wholesome eyes <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> healthy cheeks. [...] "One of us," [...] she said, [...] "one of us might be--" ...|$|E
60|$|Then Tietjens came in <b>and</b> sat <b>down,</b> <b>her</b> teeth bared <b>and</b> her forepaws planted. She {{looked at}} Strickland.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Burton {{had not yet}} {{finished}} with the subject of clothes. The distaste upon her face had rather increased. She looked <b>her</b> husband up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> eyes grew bright with anger.|$|R
60|$|Miss Dartle softly touched <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> bent <b>down</b> <b>her</b> head to whisper, but {{she would}} not hear a word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{write and}} {{tell us how you}} get on now and then; I like to hear about other people's good times while I'm waiting for my own," [...] said Molly, too much {{interested}} to observe that Grif was sticking burrs up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> braids.|$|E
60|$|Patsy wondered, too, {{the cold}} shivers chasing one another up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> back. The boy was coming toward them, coolly puffing a cigar. He {{did not seem}} to totter quite so much as before, but he was glad to sink into an easy chair.|$|E
60|$|While {{the women}} talked together, Fay led Johnny up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> little world, showing all her {{favorite}} nooks, making him rest {{often on the}} seats that stood all about, and amusing him immensely by relating the various fanciful plays with which she beguiled her loneliness.|$|E
60|$|While he was {{speaking}} Nellie herself came softly to her husband's side <b>and</b> sat <b>down.</b> <b>Her</b> face was very grave.|$|R
60|$|She {{went into}} <b>her</b> bedroom <b>and</b> took <b>down</b> <b>her</b> husband's heavy pilot {{overcoat}} and sou'wester, {{and handed them}} to her guest.|$|R
50|$|Daily {{created and}} {{performed}} a one-woman stand-up comedy tour about the ups <b>and</b> <b>downs</b> of <b>her</b> career <b>and</b> life.|$|R
60|$|Little {{he thought}} that three doors off from him, Valencia was sitting up the whole night through, vainly trying to quiet Lucia, who refused to undress, and paced up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> room, hour after hour in wild misery, which I have no skill to detail.|$|E
6000|$|... "What would Ralph Denham say to this?" [...] thought Katharine, {{beginning}} to pace up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> bedroom. She twitched aside the curtains, so that, on turning, she was faced by darkness, and looking out, could just distinguish {{the branches of}} a plane-tree and the yellow lights of some one else's windows.|$|E
60|$|The {{reports about}} Miss Ailie's {{behavior}} {{became more and}} more alarming. She walked up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> bedroom now {{in the middle of the}} night. Every time the knocker clanked she held herself together with both hands. Agnes had orders not to answer the door until her mistress had keeked through the window.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood up}} as she spoke, <b>and</b> put <b>down</b> <b>her</b> cup beside Miss Garvice's. She {{addressed}} Capes as though she spoke to him alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then no harm {{would have}} been done," [...] Muriel rejoined, <b>and</b> putting <b>down</b> <b>her</b> fan, gave him a steady look. [...] "Was I mistaken?" ...|$|R
60|$|Rilla {{found herself}} {{standing}} alone {{and listening to}} disconnected scraps of talk as people walked up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> past <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|And now {{the boat}} which has rounded Harpswell Point is {{skimming}} {{across to the}} head of Middle Bay, where the new ship can distinctly be discerned standing upon her ways, while moving clusters of people were walking up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> decks or lining the shore in the vicinity. All sorts of gossiping and neighborly chit-chat is being interchanged in the little world assembling there.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} risky {{to go back}} to Reddy, whom he had not seen for many weeks; but in trousers! He could not help it. He only meant to walk up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> street, so that she might see him from the window, and know that this splendid thing was he; but though he went several times into the street, Reddy never came to the window.|$|E
6000|$|Her face {{declined}} and was unseen; {{her hair}} [...] Fell in long tresses like the weeping willow, [...] Sweeping the marble underneath her chair, [...] Or rather sofa (for {{it was all}} pillow, [...] A low soft ottoman), and black despair [...] Stirr'd up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>her</b> bosom like a billow, [...] Which rushes to some shore whose shingles check [...] Its farther course, but must receive its wreck.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Markle {{raised her}} eyes quickly, <b>and</b> put <b>down</b> <b>her</b> work. [...] "Olly," [...] she repeated, with great animation--"poor little Olly! what's gone of her?" ...|$|R
60|$|Shrill {{shriek of}} {{laughter}} sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce huffed <b>and</b> snorted <b>down</b> <b>her</b> nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's {{not quite}} the worst of it, Esther dear!" [...] cried Ada, holding me tighter <b>and</b> laying <b>down</b> <b>her</b> face again upon my breast.|$|R
