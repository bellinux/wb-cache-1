2500|$|A more usual {{alternative}} to <b>additional</b> <b>filter</b> components, if the DC load requires very low ripple voltage, {{is to follow}} the input filter with a voltage regulator. [...] A voltage regulator operates on a different principle than a filter, which is essentially a voltage divider that shunts voltage at the ripple frequency away from the load.

30|$|A common {{approach}} for reducing noise artifacts in direct reconstructions is to either change the convolution filter, or to apply <b>additional</b> <b>filtering</b> {{to the image}} after reconstruction. Note that <b>additional</b> <b>filtering</b> usually requires choosing parameters that have a large influence on the final image quality, and can increase the required processing time for large-scale data significantly. In Fig.  9, the SIRT-FBP reconstruction is compared with reconstructions computed using gridrec with the Shepp–Logan <b>filter</b> and <b>additional</b> Gaussian <b>filtering,</b> and using gridrec with the Parzen filter, which is often used in problems with low signal-to-noise ratios. The results show that although both approaches are able to reduce noise artifacts compared with standard gridrec using the Shepp–Logan filter (Fig.  8 a), the SIRT-FBP reconstruction contains less artifacts. Furthermore, the reconstructions using <b>additional</b> <b>filtering</b> and the Parzen filter contain significantly more limited-angle artifacts compared with the SIRT-FBP reconstruction. A possible {{reason for this is}} the fact that the SIRT-FBP filter is computed specifically for the limited-angle geometry of the actual experiment, while the standard <b>filters</b> and <b>additional</b> <b>filtering</b> steps do not take the limited-angle geometry into account.|$|R

30|$|Given the {{designed}} {{properties of}} the transmitted signal, the out-of-band emissions can be partially mitigated by <b>additional</b> <b>filtering.</b> For example, one can apply <b>additional</b> high-order low-pass <b>filtering</b> to the modulating signal or band-pass filtering to the modulated carrier. However, the bandwidth of those <b>additional</b> <b>filters</b> must be sufficiently large {{in comparison with the}} bandwidth of the pulse shaping filter in the modulator in order to not significantly affect the designed signal. Within that bandwidth, the above analysis still generally holds, and the impulsive disturbances may significantly exceed the thermal noise level in the receiver [3] even when the average power of the interference remains below that level.|$|R

In a monochrome or three-CCD or Foveon X3 camera, the microlens array alone, if near 100% effective, can provide a significant anti-aliasing effect,while in color filter array (CFA, e.g. Bayer filter) cameras, an <b>additional</b> <b>filter</b> is generally needed to reduce aliasing to an acceptable level.|$|E

50|$|If the receiver's input is routed via {{a device}} which rejects the {{unwanted}} signals then this additional filtering {{can improve the}} immunity of the installation. It {{is the case that}} the <b>additional</b> <b>filter</b> will improve the situation. When a transmitter needs to be colocated with a receiver where the frequency difference is very small (for example 145.000 and 145.600 MHz) the cavity filters can be used on both the transmitter and the receiver to improve the purity of the transmitter and the immunity of the receiver.|$|E
50|$|The example given below {{can produce}} {{simultaneous}} lowpass, highpass and bandpass outputs {{from a single}} input. This is a second-order (biquad) filter. Its derivation comes from rearranging a high-pass filter's transfer function, which is the ratio of two quadratic functions. The rearrangement reveals that one signal {{is the sum of}} integrated copies of another. That is, the rearrangement reveals a state variable filter structure. By using different states as outputs, different kinds of filters can be produced. In more general state variable filter examples, <b>additional</b> <b>filter</b> orders are possible with more integrators (i.e., more states).|$|E

After the pre-filtering is done, the data can either be sent directly to a CUPS backend if using a PostScript printer, or it can be passed to another filter like Foomatic by linuxprinting.org. Alternatively, it can be passed to Ghostscript, which converts the PostScript into an intermediary CUPS-raster format.

50|$|The {{location}} of the associated CpG sites or islands/regions can then be analyzed in silico to imply possible functional relevance. For example, considering whether the associated CpGs are within a promoter region or determining distance from the transcription start site that may be relevant, especially when we assume that DNA methylation associated with a phenotype acts by regulating gene transcription. Many other inferences based on past biological knowledge can be inferred if that particular region of CpGs have been studied and associated with changes in transcription. This {{can be used as}} an <b>additional</b> <b>filter</b> for identifying regions to pursue for functional validation. Several bioinformatic tools that have been developed for functional enrichment analysis can be applied to differentially methylated regions by first mapping these regions to genes. This is done by mapping the distance between the CpGs and a gene promoter that is potentially regulated by this region. Enrichment analysis based on the genomic region has thus been suggested as a complementary approach and confers substantial interpretive potential. Differentially methylated regions can then be compared to a catalog of genomic regions including, for example, sites enriched for specific chromatin modifications or transcription factor binding sites.|$|E
30|$|The {{effect of}} PSF and TOF-based {{reconstruction}} on quantification, particularly SUVmax, has limited their introduction into routine clinical use despite demonstrated improvements in lesion detectability. This study extends existing studies [39] which {{have shown that}} the impact on SUVmax can be addressed with appropriate post-filters, by demonstrating that the same approach can be used for reconstructions with TOF reconstructions and also with alternative uptake metrics such as SUVpeak or TLG. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that this <b>additional</b> <b>filtering</b> to match SUVmax actually provides added gains in SNR over parameters to match image voxel COV. However, if the additional smoothing is visually undesirable, an alternative methodology can be used which performs the <b>additional</b> <b>filtering</b> required to match SUVmax only for quantification and is not visualised [41].|$|R

5000|$|Electrons {{from the}} cathode collide with the anode material, usually tungsten, {{molybdenum}} or copper, and accelerate other electrons, ions and nuclei within the anode material. About 1% {{of the energy}} generated is emitted/radiated, usually perpendicular to {{the path of the}} electron beam, as X-rays. The rest of the energy is released as heat. Over time, tungsten will be deposited from the target onto the interior surface of the tube, including the glass surface. This will slowly darken the tube and was thought to degrade the quality of the X-ray beam. Vaporized tungsten condenses {{on the inside of the}} envelope over the [...] "window" [...] and thus acts as an <b>additional</b> <b>filter</b> and decreases the tubes ability to radiate heat. Eventually, the tungsten deposit may become sufficiently conductive that at high enough voltages, arcing occurs. The arc will jump from the cathode to the tungsten deposit, and then to the anode. This arcing causes an effect called [...] "crazing" [...] on the interior glass of the X-ray window. As time goes on, the tube becomes unstable even at lower voltages, and must be replaced. At this point, the tube assembly (also called the [...] "tube head") is removed from the X-ray system, and replaced with a new tube assembly. The old tube assembly is shipped to a company that reloads it with a new X-ray tube.|$|E

At high x-ray energies (> 35 keV) the subject {{contrast between the}} normal and Malignant tissues in the breast is poor, at very low x-ray energies (10 - 15 keV) the contrast is highest, however the high absorption result in a high tissue dose.
