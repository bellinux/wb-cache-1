During these sessions, founding guitarist Jason Cropper left the band {{and was replaced by}} current guitarist Brian Bell, leading to some speculation about how much Bell contributed to the album. While Bell's vocals are clearly audible on some tracks, Cuomo re-recorded all of Cropper's guitar parts. According to Ocasek, all ten tracks were laid down by Cuomo in one day, each in one take. However, Bell is still credited for playing guitar in the album liner notes. Cropper's writing credit on [...] "My Name Is Jonas" [...] is earned by his coming up with the intro to the song.|$|E

[...] Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder, willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. [...] Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he noted: [...] "What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... I missed it a lot." [...] That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: [...] "Players with the commitment of Steve Begin, I really believe that there’s not enough (of them) in the NHL.

500|$|In 1921 Wood {{was awarded}} the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first English {{conductor}} to receive the honour. By now {{he was beginning to}} find his position as Britain's leading conductor under challenge from rising younger rivals. [...] Thomas Beecham had been an increasingly influential figure since about 1910. He and Wood did not like one another, and each avoided mention of the other in his memoirs. Adrian Boult, who, at Wood's recommendation, took over some of his responsibilities at Birmingham in 1923, <b>always</b> <b>admired</b> and respected Wood. Other younger conductors included men who had been members of Wood's orchestra, including Basil Cameron and Eugene Goossens. Another protégé of Wood was Malcolm Sargent, who appeared at the Proms as a composer-conductor in 1921 and 1922. Wood encouraged him to abandon thoughts of a career as a pianist and to concentrate on conducting. Wood further showed his interest in the future of music by taking on the conductorship of the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music in 1923, rehearsing it twice a week, whenever possible, for the next twenty years. In the same year, he accepted the conductorship of the amateur Hull Philharmonic Orchestra, travelling three times a year until 1939 to rehearse and conduct its concerts.|$|E

[...] David Bowie, who performed at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded the song [...] "Under Pressure" [...] with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: [...] "Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest... he took it over the edge. And of course, I <b>always</b> <b>admired</b> a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience {{in the palm of his}} hand." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make [...] "the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected". Mercury's main prop on stage was a broken microphone stand, which after accidentally snapping off the heavy base during an early performance, he realised could be used in endless ways.|$|E

500|$|Tyler {{retired to}} a Virginia plantation, {{originally}} named Walnut Grove (or [...] "the Grove"), {{located on the}} James River in Charles City County. He renamed it Sherwood Forest, in {{a reference to the}} folk legend Robin Hood, to signify that he had been [...] "outlawed" [...] by the Whig Party. He did not take farming lightly and worked hard to maintain large yields. His neighbors, largely Whigs, appointed him to the minor office of overseer of roads in 1847 in an effort to mock him. To their displeasure he treated the job seriously, frequently summoning his neighbors to provide their slaves for road work, and continuing to insist on carrying out his duties even after his neighbors asked him to stop. He withdrew from politics, rarely receiving visits from his friends. He was asked to give an occasional public speech, but was not sought out as an adviser. One notable speech was at the unveiling of a monument to Henry Clay; acknowledging the political battles between the two, he spoke highly of his former colleague, whom he had <b>always</b> <b>admired</b> for bringing about the Compromise Tariff of 1833. The former president's time was spent with the doings of the Virginia aristocracy, including parties, visiting or being visited by prominent families, and summers at the family seaside home, [...] "Villa Margaret".|$|E
