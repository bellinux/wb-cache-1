5|$|In 2009, Campbell became {{addicted}} to painkillers prescribed for his spinal stenosis, taking {{as many as}} ten OxyContin pills a day with Budweiser. He went through rehabilitation and broke his addiction the same year, and since publicizing the incident in 2013 has spoken out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> substance abuse.|$|E
5|$|In late 1989, {{the former}} First Lady {{established}} the Nancy Reagan Foundation, which aimed {{to continue to}} educate people <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> substance abuse. The Foundation teamed with the BEST Foundation For A Drug-Free Tomorrow in 1994, and developed the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Program. She continued to travel around the United States, speaking out against drug and alcohol abuse.|$|E

5|$|In spite {{or perhaps}} because of his role in these nuclear tests, Reines was {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E
5|$|By {{writing for}} a {{scientific}} {{as well as}} popular audience, Beebe did much to make science accessible to the general public. This was particularly significant {{in the area of}} conservation, of which {{he was one of the}} most important early advocates. With his many writings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E
5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that one of the central characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E

40|$|There are 54 % {{tenth grade}} {{students}} of SMK Kristen (TI) who smoke, whereas {{there are some}} counseling and information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> smoking were given and <b>the</b> rule <b>about</b> smoking prohibition has been applied. Seeing the data, it was needed to be investigated, <b>about</b> how <b>the</b> students’ knowledge and perception on <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> smoking for health is. This survey research was in the academic year of 2012 - 2013 using sampling total of 102 students of tenth graders of SMK Kristen (TI) Salatiga. <b>The</b> data <b>about</b> <b>the</b> students’ knowledge and perception <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> smoking {{was taken from the}} questionnaire and was supported through an interview to the Guidance and Counseling teacher and the Sports teacher. The data was analyzed using bivariate analysis using chi quadrate test. The result of the study shows that the students have big knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> smoking for their health. Therefore, all of the efforts above totally can lead the students into positive activities and guide the students into an independent person and aware of the body and soul health...|$|R

5|$|In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{attempts}} to prove {{life in an}} office is dangerous after Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) berates him <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> the warehouse. The attempts lead him {{to the roof of}} the building, where he tries to show that depression caused by an office can lead to desperate circumstances. Meanwhile, gambling between the other employees of the office leads Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) to discover that she is still an outsider.|$|E
5|$|Intending to {{establish}} a farm to support his new family, Chetwin leaves the English countryside for Arizona. Concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> frontier territory, he travels without his newlywed wife, intending to send for her later. When she gives birth to Chetwin's child, Anderson's wife refuses to accept evidence of her marriage, and throws {{her out of the}} farm for having a child out of wedlock. She takes the infant with her to Arizona and reunites with Chetwin at his ranch.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's {{alcoholism}} {{had begun}} to interfere with his busy life prior to his marriage. He arrived at court hung-over on several occasions {{and was unable to}} keep his addiction secret in his small hometown. His wife helped him to overcome his drinking problem and give up liquor after she locked him in their home for two weeks to undergo a treatment regimen. Thereafter, he became active in temperance organizations and delivered several speeches <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> liquor. Although he had stopped drinking, his past alcoholism was later raised by opponents during his gubernatorial election campaign.|$|E

5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E
5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{who had worked}} on the Manhattan Project, Burhop was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> nuclear weapons, and addressed over 500 public meetings {{to raise awareness of}} the subject. He had been {{a founding member of the}} Australian Association of Scientific Workers in 1939, and after the war became chairman of the Atomic Science Committee of the Association of Scientific Workers, and a member of its Science Policy Committee, in Britain. In this capacity he helped organise the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs in 1957. He founded the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science in 1969. He was president of his local branch of the Association of University Teachers from 1970 to 1972, and of the World Federation of Scientific Workers from 1971 to 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{first trial}} series {{consisted}} of three shots. All bombs were dropped and detonated over Malden Island, and exploded high in the atmosphere, rather than being detonated on the ground, {{in order to reduce}} the production of nuclear fallout. British scientists were aware that the Americans had been able to reduce fallout by obtaining most of the bomb yield from fusion instead of fission, but they did not yet know how to do this. Amid growing public concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> fallout, particularly from strontium-90 entering the food chain, a committee chaired by Sir Harold Himsworth was asked to look into the matter. Another, in the United States chaired by Detlev Bronk, also investigated. They reported simultaneously on 12 June 1956. While differing on many points, they agreed that levels of strontium-90 were not yet sufficiently high to be of concern.|$|E
50|$|There {{was some}} {{criticism}} that three CJD newspapers simultaneously presented articles <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> negative Free Trade Agreement rumors on the South Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement among South Korean social network service users, particularly on Twitter.|$|R

5|$|In 1947 Warren {{became the}} first dean of the School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Under his leadership, the new school grew from nothing to a major medical school. Although {{controversial}} and opposed by James Bryant Conant, Warren would speak out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> nuclear fallout from weapons testing from about 1947 onwards and upon the Castle Bravo test in 1954 his views were lent some credence, which informed opinion {{leading up to the}} Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Warren became Vice Chancellor, Health Services in 1962 at UCLA. From 1963 to 1965 he served as special assistant to President John F. Kennedy and later Lyndon B. Johnson on mental retardation. Returning to UCLA in 1965, he became professor emeritus, a position he held until his death in 1981. In 1971, he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award for his contributions to science and medicine.|$|E

30|$|As {{the most}} {{effective}} preventive measures engine drivers considered fencing, followed by information campaigns, prohibitive signs, {{imposition of a fine}} and building an underpass or overpass. Information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> trespassing should be delivered to children in nearby schools and to people living close to railway tracks. The engine drivers also proposed information campaigns in the local papers and on radio and television, and placing fact sheets <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> trespassing close to railway tracks. Furthermore, the police should also make occasional enforcement campaigns at sites where trespassing occurs frequently. During those campaigns they should impose fines that are big enough to act as effective deterrents. Finally, camera surveillance and increasing the number of guards were also suggested as complementary forms of preventing trespass.|$|R
