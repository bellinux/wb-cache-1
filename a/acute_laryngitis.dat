On that cue, the real Carson emerged from behind the curtain (as Letterman's band played [...] "Johnny's Theme"), an appearance that prompted a standing ovation from the audience.

40|$|<b>Acute</b> obstructive <b>laryngitis</b> (croup — J. 05) {{is one of}} the {{pressing}} and insufficiently studied issues in pediatrics. Over recent years focus has been on the issues related to the treatment of this condition due to a relative incidence rate and severity of croup in children of minor age. A clinical and lab study has been undertaken to identify the etiological structure and evaluation of beclo methasone efficiency in 163 children aged 3 months to 5 years with croup. Results of the study have demonstrated that most often the etiological factor of croup is parainfluenza virus (56, 1 % of all cases), respiratory syncytial virus is revealed in 44, 73 % of all cases. Bacterial etiology of the disease have been found in 12, 5 % of children with the etiological agent being Haemophilus influenzae type b. Supplementation of the treatment for <b>acute</b> obstructive <b>laryngitis</b> of virus etiology with inhalant beclomethasone makes it possible {{to reduce the number of}} intubations, hence decrease the frequency of complications after invasive interventions and cut the length of hospital stay.

50|$|King's American Dispensatory (1898) {{says of the}} extract:It is also an expectorant, and {{controls}} irritation of mucous tissues. It has proved useful in irritative cough, chronic bronchial coughs, whooping-cough, <b>laryngitis,</b> <b>acute</b> and chronic, acute catarrh, asthma, tubercular laryngitis, and in the cough of phthisis pulmonalis. Upon the digestive organs it acts kindly, improving the appetite, digestion, and assimilation. However, its most pronounced effects appear to be those exerted upon the urino-genital tracts of both male and female, and upon all the organs concerned in reproduction. It is said to enlarge wasted organs, as the breasts, ovaries, and testicles, while the paradoxical claim is also made that it reduces hypertrophy of the prostate. Possibly this {{may be explained by}} claiming that it tends toward the production of a normal condition, reducing parts when unhealthily enlarged, and increasing them when atrophied.|$|R
40|$|Upper {{respiratory}} tract infections (URTIs) {{are responsible for}} {{a large amount of}} community antibacterial use worldwide. Recent systematic reviews have demonstrated that most URTIs resolve naturally, even when bacteria are the cause. The high consumer expectation for antibacterials in URTIs requires intervention by the general practitioner and a number of useful strategies have been developed. Generic strategies, including eliciting patient expectations, avoiding the term 'just a virus', providing a value-for-money consultation, providing verbal and written information, empowering patients, conditional prescribing, directed education campaigns, and emphasis on symptomatic treatments, should be used as well as discussion of alternative medicines when relevant. The various conditions have differing rates of bacterial infection and require different approaches. For <b>acute</b> rhinitis, <b>laryngitis</b> and tracheitis, viruses are the only cause and, therefore, antibacterials are never required. In acute sore throat (pharyngitis) Streptococcus pyogenes is the only important bacterial cause. A scoring system can help to increase the likelihood of distinguishing a streptococcal as opposed to viral infection, or alternatively patients should be given antibacterials only if certain conditions are fulfilled. Strategies for treating acute otitis media vary in different countries. Most favour the strategy of prescribing antibacterials only when certain criteria are fulfilled, delaying antibacterial prescribing for at least 24 hours. In otitis media with effusion, on the other hand, there is no primary role for antibacterials, as the condition resolves naturally in almost all patients aged > 3 months. Detailed strategies for acute sinusitis have not been worked out but restricting antibacterial prescribing to certain clinical complexes is currently recommended by several authorities because of the high natural resolution rate...|$|R

40|$|Francesco Di Pierro, 1 Maria Colombo, 2 Alberto Zanvit, 3 Amilcare S Rottoli, 4 1 Scientific Department, Velleja Research, Milan, 2 Pediatric Department, University of Parma, Parma, 3 Stomatology Institute, 4 Pediatric Department, Uboldo Hospital, Cernusco S/N, Milan, Italy Background: Streptococcus salivarius K 12 (BLIS K 12 ®) is a {{probiotic}} strain {{producing the}} bacteriocins salivaricin A 2 and salivaricin B, {{both of which}} strongly antagonize the growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, the most important bacterial cause of pharyngeal infections in humans. It successfully colonizes and exhibits persistence in the oral cavity and is endowed with an excellent safety profile. Previous observations {{of a small group}} of children indicated that the use of BLIS K 12 could also reduce the occurrence of viral pharyngitis. The present study focused on a further evaluation of the role of BLIS K 12 in the control of pediatric streptococcal disease and moreover whether its use could also help provide protection against various nonstreptococcal infections. Methods: In total, 48 children with a recent history of recurrent pharyngeal streptococcal disease were enrolled in the treated group. The control group comprised 76 children known to have had a very low recent occurrence of oral streptococcal disease. The treated children were given BLIS K 12 daily for 90 days. The number of episodes of streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis, tracheitis, viral pharyngitis, rhinitis, flu, <b>laryngitis,</b> <b>acute</b> otitis media, enteritis, and stomatitis was recorded during probiotic treatment and for a follow-up period of 9 months, and this was compared with the episodes of the control group over the corresponding period. Results: Compared with the pretreatment time period, 2013, a 90 % reduction of streptococcal pharyngeal disease was observed in 2014; compared with untreated children, a statistically significant reduction of all of the other disease conditions assessed, other than stomatitis, was detected in the probiotic-treated children. Conclusion: In agreement with previous findings, in the present study, it was found that the daily use of BLIS K 12 has been associated with a concurrent and persisting reduction in the occurrence of pharyngeal, recurrent, streptococcal disease. Moreover, the benefits to children may also extend to a reduction of nonstreptococcal diseases, including tracheitis, viral pharyngitis, rhinitis, flu, <b>laryngitis,</b> <b>acute</b> otitis media, and enteritis.

The aim of the work was to find out the specifics of nursing care of children with <b>acute</b> <b>laryngitis</b> and the most frequently occurring nursing diagnoses in children with <b>acute</b> <b>laryngitis.</b> The research questions were formulated as follows: 1 ? What nursing care specifics are required for children with <b>acute</b> <b>laryngitis?</b> 2 ? What are the most frequent nursing diagnoses in children with <b>acute</b> <b>laryngitis?</b> Qualitative research methods of interview, observation and documentation content analysis were applied on data collection.

The second research sample consisted of children suffering from <b>acute</b> <b>laryngitis</b> hospitalized at the paediatric ward of the same hospital. An answer to the first question was formed upon evaluation of the results of interviews with nurses and upon observation: Nursing care of children suffering from <b>acute</b> <b>laryngitis</b> has its specifics based on ensuring upper respiratory tract clearance by dosing inhalation and medicaments according to practitioner?s order, ensuring child?s elevated position of and supply of fresh air to the room where the child lies.
