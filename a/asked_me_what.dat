He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'" ...|$|E

But a few weeks ago, I was sent a re-mixed version of my song 'The Long and Winding Road' with harps, horns, an orchestra, and a women's choir added.

[...] Regarding Nizza (Nice) the situation was different, since the inhabitants of Nice had far more in common with the Piedmontese than with the French, and their incorporation into France would accordingly be entirely contrary to those very principals of nationalism underpinning the military triumph anticipated against Austria." ...|$|E

[...] At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.|$|E

2500|$|In her childhood, Jemison {{learned to}} make {{connections}} to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison's mother {{turned it into a}} learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus. Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not. [...] "In kindergarten, my teacher <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> I wanted to be when I grew up, and I told her a scientist," [...] Jemison says. [...] "She said, 'Don't you mean a nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be." [...] In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. [...] "Growing up...I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo airing, everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts.

2500|$|So I went {{to lunch}} with [...] George Kennan and Erwin Panofsky {{and the great}} Plato scholar Harold Cherniss. Afterwards Cherniss invited me to his {{beautiful}} office and, as we started chatting, Oppenheimer {{came into the room}} and sat on the table behind us. This {{is one of the most}} cruel, brilliant tricks: it makes you master of the situation, and the people who can't see you as you speak to them are completely helpless. Oppenheimer's mastery of these histrionic moves was incredible. Cherniss was showing me how he was editing a passage of Plato with a lacuna, and trying to fill it. When Oppenheimer <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> I would do with such a passage, I began stumbling, and he said, “Well that's very stupid. A great text should have blanks.” There I happily lost my temper: “Of all the pompous clichés,” I said. “First of all, that's a quote from Mallarmé, as you, sir, must know. Secondly, it's the kind of paradox you could play with till the cows come home. But when you're asked to do an edition of a Plato text for us ordinary human beings, I am most grateful if the blanks are filled.” Oppenheimer fought back superbly. He said, “No, precisely in philosophy you should know more than in poetry. It is the implicit missing that stimulates the argument.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Seeing further {{potential}} in the idea, Horn teamed Jeczalik and Langan with Dudley in February to develop the project and brought {{in one of his}} business partners, ex-NME journalist Paul Morley, as a provider of concepts, art direction and marketing ideas. Morley came up with the project name (taken from the essay [...] "The Art of Noises" [...] by noted futurist Luigi Russolo, and finalised at Jeczalik's request by dropping the final 's'). Much later, in a July 2002 article penned for The Guardian, Morley wrote [...] "I loved the name Art of Noise so much that I forced my way into the group. If over the years people <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> I did in the group, I replied that I named them, and it was such a great name, that was enough to justify my role. I was the Ringo Starr of Art of Noise. I made the tea. Oh, and I wrote the lyrics to one of the loveliest pieces of pop music ever, Moments in Love." [...] Horn himself joined the new group as production advisor and provider of further ideas. This {{was the first time that}} he had been part of a group since parting company with his The Buggles' partner Geoff Downes (after they had been part of Yes).
