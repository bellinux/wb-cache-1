50|$|Fittig's {{research}} covered wide {{areas of}} organic chemistry. The aldehydes and ketones provided material for his earlier work. He observed that aldehydes and ketones may suffer reduction in neutral, alkaline, and sometimes acid solution to secondary and tertiary glycols, substances which he named pinacones; {{and also that}} certain pinacones when distilled with dilute sulfuric acid gave compounds, which he named pinacolines. The unsaturated acids also received much attention, and he discovered the internal anhydrides of oxyacids, termed lactones. In 1863 he introduced the reaction known by his name. In 1855 Charles-Adolphe Wurtz had shown that when sodium acted upon alkyl iodides, the <b>alkyl</b> <b>residues</b> combined to form more complex hydrocarbons; Fittig developed this method by showing that a mixture of an aromatic and alkyl haloid, under similar treatment, yielded homologues of benzene. His investigations on Perkin's reaction led him to an explanation of its mechanism which appeared to be more {{in accordance with the}} facts. The question, however, is one of much difficulty, and the exact course of the reaction appears to await solution. These researches incidentally solved the constitution of coumarin, the odoriferous principle of woodruff. Fittig and Erdmann's observation that phenyl isocrotonic acid readily yielded α-naphthol by loss of water was of much importance, since it afforded valuable evidence as to the constitution of naphthalene. They also investigated certain hydrocarbons occurring in the high boiling point fraction of the coal tar distillate and solved the constitution of phenanthrene. We also owe much of our knowledge of the alkaloid piperine to Fittig, who in collaboration with Ira Remsen established its constitution in 1871.|$|E

Capacitance−potential curve measured at Hg in 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF 4) resembles well the inner layer capacity at the Hg/aqueous solution interface containing nonspecifically adsorbing electrolyte.

Both the alkyl group and the charged moiety of the cation of 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium based RTILs are found to interact concurrently with the Hg surface with the possible change of their orientation in response to the applied potential, and the appearance of a shallow minimum in the capacitance−potential curve related to potential of zero charge (PZC) depends on the extent of their interaction. PZC shifts to the negative direction of potential with increasing the chain length of <b>alkyl</b> <b>residue</b> of the cationic moiety because of the constraint in the orientational change needed for the interaction of positively charged imidazolium ring with Hg surface.

Small <b>alkyl</b> <b>residues</b> on the other sulfur provide the best activity as well, which for different bacteria appears to be somewhat dependent on the nature of the alkyl moiety. The mechanism of action of these lipophilic disulfides is likely similar to that of previously reported N-thiolated β-lactams, which have been shown to produce alkyl-CoA disulfides through a thiol-disulfide exchange within the cytoplasm, ultimately inhibiting type II fatty acid synthesis. However, the mixed alkyl-CoA disulfides themselves show no antibacterial activity, presumably due to the inability of the highly polar compounds to cross the bacterial cell membrane.

Gas chromatog-raphy–tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS–MS) was used in this study to differentiate ring-substituted bromoam-phetamine analogs. Free bases, trifluoroacetyl derivatives, and trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of six analytes were successfully separated using DB- 1 ms and DB- 5 ms col-umns. Electron ionization MS–MS analysis of the TMS derivatives allowed for the differentiation of three regioi-somers. TMS derivatives of 2 -positional isomers provided significant product ions. The spectral patterns of 3 - and 4 -positional isomers were different. Chemical ionization MS–MS analysis of free bases for [M?H–HBr]? ions at m/z 134 and 148 allowed for differentiation of the regioisomers. The spectra of 2 -positional isomers con-tained characteristic product ions formed by dehydro-genation at m/z 132 and m/z 146 for 2 Br-AP and 2 Br-MA, respectively. The spectra of 3 -positional isomers contained a-cleaved iminium cations as the base peaks. The spectra of 4 -positional isomers showed a tropylium cation at m/z 91 as the base peak.

40|$|The present mini-review {{summarizes}} the experience gathered by our group in developing different classes of novel quaternarized heterocyclic compounds able to modulate and reverse the electroendoosmotic flow (EOF) {{in a most}} peculiar manner. The first class comprises mono-salt compounds, with the determinant ?-iodoalkyl chains of different lengths (typically C 4 –C 8), able to be adsorbed by silicas, at alkaline pH, and spontaneously alkylate ionised silanols, thus becoming covalently affixed to it. The second class is constituted by di-salt compounds, attached at the termini of an alkyl chain of variable lengths (here too, typically, C 4 –C 8). This second class is unable to bind covalently silica surfaces, although, in thin-layer chromatography, it exhibits an extraordinary affinity for silica beads, contrary to the first one. On {{the basis of the}} strikingly different behaviour, structural rules are derived for the minimum requirements for general classes of amines to bind to silica walls and modify EOF. For compounds unable to bind covalently to the wall, the most important structural motif is two quaternary nitrogens spaced apart by a C 4 chain: this seems to be the average distance (i. e., 0. 8 nm) between two adjacent, ionized silanols for a snug fit. The other structural binding motif is the “hydrophobic decoration”, i. e., the ratio of charged groups to <b>alkyl</b> <b>residue</b> in the various amines; amines with high levels of such alkane groups (i. e., with higher hydrophobicity), seem to bind more tenaciously to the wall, probably due to hydrophobic interaction not to the wall but among the amine derivatives themselves, when carpeting the silica...|$|R

40|$|The autolysin (N-acetylmuramidase) of Clostridium saccharoperbutylaceto nicum (ATCC 13564) {{strongly}} adsorbed to anion exchangers such as diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) -cellulose, triethylaminoethyl (TEAE) -cellulose and ECTEOLA-cellulose. Therefore, the adsorbed autolysin was not eluted with buffer containing various {{concentrations of}} NaCl or buffer of various pHs. However {{it could be}} eluted from them with the buffer containing high concentration of guanidine·HCl, dioxane and ethylene glycol, which were the reagents used for break of hydrogen bonding of proteins or weakening the hydrophobic interaction of proteins. These {{results indicated that the}} hydrophobic interaction would be participate in this strong adsorption of autolysin on the anion exchangers. The autolysin could not adsorb to carriers of the anion exchangers (cellulose, agarose and Sephadex), while it adsorbed to aminoalkyl-Sepharose and alkyl-Sepharose prepared. The adsorption rate of autolysin toward those resins increased in proportion of the elongating length of alkyl chain Therefore, its adsorption to the anion exchangers was thought to be caused by affinity for hydrophorbic residues, namely <b>alkyl</b> <b>residues</b> of di-(or tri-) ethylaminoethyl groups of them. These properties of autolysin were applied on its purification, and the specific activity of DEAE-cellulose eluents by guanidine·HCl increased in 20 times more than that of gel filtrated fraction. 1. Clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum (ATCC 13564) のautolysinはpI 4. 1 で,DEAR-セルロース等のアニオン交換体に強く吸着され,蛋白質の溶出に通常用いられる条件では溶出されなかった. 種々の溶出条件を検討したところ,高濃度の塩酸グアニジン,ジオキサン,エチレングリコール等疎水性の結合を壊す薬剤により溶出することができた. 2. DEAE-セルロース,TEAE-セルロース,ECTEOLA-セルロースへの本酵素の吸着の強さを,塩酸グアニジンによる溶出で検討したところ,DEAE＞ECTEOLA＞TEAEの順位で強い吸着がみられた. これは解離基の解離度の大きさTEAE＞DEAE＞ECTEOLAとことなっており,本酵素の吸着がイオン結合のみによるものでないことを示していた. 一方,イオン交換体の担体であるセルロース,アガロース,セファデックスには吸着がおこらなかった. 3. 種々の鎖長のアルキル基をもつアミノアルキルセファロース,アルキルセファロースを調製し,本酵素の吸着を検したところ,本酵素はアルキル基の鎖長に比例して強く吸着した. また短鎖のアルキル基にも吸着した. 4. 以上の結果から,DEAR-セルロース等に対する本酵素の強い吸着には,DEAE基等を構成するアルキル基に対する疎水結合が与っているものと結論した. これらの性質を利用して,DEA玉-セルロースと塩酸グアニジンにより本酵素の精製をおこなったところ,セファデックスG- 75 ゲル濾過画分よりさらに 20 倍比活性の上昇がみられた...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} 2 -phenylindole {{derivatives}} with one hydroxy {{group in the}} meta or para position of the phenyl ring and a second one in position 5, 6, or 7 of the indole nucleus were synthesized. In addition, different alkyl groups were introduced into positions 1 and 3 of the heterocycle. The influence of these structural variations on the binding affinity for the calf uterine estrogen receptor was studied. A prerequisite for the binding {{is the presence of}} an alkyl group at the nitrogen. Favorable are a hydroxy group located in the para position of the phenyl ring and short alkyl chains both in position 1 and 3 of the indole. The highest relative binding affinity (RBA) values (e. g., 33 for 20 b, 21 for 24 b, 23 for 35 b) are close to that of hexestrol (RBA = 25, estradiol = 100). Depending on the positions of the oxygen functions and size of the <b>alkyl</b> <b>residues,</b> the indole derivatives behaved as strong estrogens (20 c, 24 c, 35 c) or impeded estrogens with antagonistic activity (23 c, 29 c, 30 c, 31 c, 40 c, 44 c) in the immature mouse. Some of these derivatives (20 c, 23 c, 24 c, 29 c, 30 c, 31 c) were tested for their inhibitory effect on dimethylbenzanthracene-induced hormone-dependent mammary tumors of the rat. Both types exhibited a strong growth inhibition with a reduction of the average tumor area at appropriate dosage. A mode of action involving the estrogen receptor system is assumed...|$|E
40|$|Purification {{of methane}} from other light {{hydrocarbons}} in {{natural gas is}} a topic of intense research due to its fundamental importance in the utilization of natural gas fields. Porous materials have emerged as excellent alternative platforms to conventional cryogenic methodologies to perform this task in a cost- and energy-efficient manner. Here we report a new family of isoreticular chiral MOFs, prepared from oxamidato ligands derived from natural amino acids L-alanine, L-valine and L-leucine, where, by increasing {{the length of the}} <b>alkyl</b> <b>residue</b> of the amino acid, the charge density of the MOF's channels can be tuned (1 > 2 > 3), decreasing the adsorption preference towards methane over light hydrocarbons thus improving this purification process. The validity of our rational design strategy has been proved by a combination of single-component adsorption isotherms, adsorption kinetics of CH 4, C 2 H 6, C 3 H 8 and n-C 4 H 10, and breakthrough experiments of binary CH 4 /C 2 H 6 and CH 4 /C 3 H 8 mixtures.

40|$|We {{have drawn}} a few {{interesting}} conclusions while studying reaction products of Ph 2 Si(OH) 2 with Al(iBu) 3 and tetraisobutylalumoxane. In the first place, {{this is the}} production (at a Ph 2 Si(OH) 2 and Al(iBu) 3 equimolar ratio) of an oligomer siloxyalumoxane structure with alternating four- and six-member rings. In addition, it shows isobutyl and phenyl group migration between aluminum and silicon due {{to the formation of}} an intramolecular four-member cyclic complex [Ph 2 (OH) SiO]Al(iBu) 2 → [(iBu) Ph(OH) SiO]Al(iBu) Ph. Ph 2 Si(OH) 2 interaction with Al(iBu) 3 not only starts from intramolecular complex production, but the chain is terminated for the same reason, which {{in the case of the}} Ph 2 Si(OH) 2 reaction with tetraisobutylalumoxane results in failure of to obtain high-polymer siloxyalumoxane compounds. When Al(iBu) 3 interacts with α- and γ-diols, no oligomer compounds are produced. In the Al(iBu) 3 reaction with α, γ-diols are created in monomer compounds that are likely to have a cyclic structure. Notably, when Al(iBu) 3 interacts with only α-diol, a double excess of Al(iBu) 3 allows for full replacement of hydrogen in the α-diol hydroxyl groups by aluminum <b>alkyl</b> <b>residue</b> with 1, 3 -bis(diisobutylalumoxymethyl) - 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyldisiloxane production. At an equimolar ratio of initial reagents, the second isobutyl radical at Al does not interact with the second hydroxyl group of α-diol, apparently due to the steric hindrance, and 1 -(diisobutylalumoxymethyl) - 3 -(hydroxymethyl) - 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyl-disiloxane is produced. Al(iBu) 3 reactions with γ-diol also result in monomer compounds, but the presence of a chain consisting of three CH 2 -groups between Si and the hydroxyl group facilitates interaction between the second hydroxyl group of γ-diol and the second isobutyl radical Al(iBu) 3. Tetraisobutylalumoxane reactions with α- and γ-diols result in oligomer compounds...|$|R
