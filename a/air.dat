5|$|<b>Air</b> {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry <b>air,</b> known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry <b>air</b> (g/kg). The amount of moisture in <b>air</b> is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor <b>air</b> can hold at a particular <b>air</b> temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of <b>air</b> can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer <b>air</b> can contain more water vapor than cooler <b>air</b> before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of <b>air</b> is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh <b>air</b> bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior <b>air</b> sac which extends from the lungs and connects with <b>air</b> spaces in the bones and fills them with <b>air.</b> The other 25% of the <b>air</b> goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used <b>air</b> flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh <b>air</b> from the posterior <b>air</b> sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh <b>air</b> during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
