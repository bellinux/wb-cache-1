The ratio of these two angles was defined <b>as</b> <b>G.</b> <b>We</b> measured <b>G</b> in normals and in patients suffering from intermittent horizontal strabismus. Consistent with previous search-coil experiments and with our previous visual test measures, the results using the synoptophore suggest that, for normals, G is less than 1. In the patient group the mean G was similar in magnitude but more variable. The variations in G did not appear to be related to the patient's measurement of ocular deviation. This result suggests that the vergence-related rotation of LP in these patients may be related to other factors besides the effort required to fuse the lines of sight...|$|R

We study the {{existence}} of G-p fields for fixed G and varying p. For G a finite group and p a prime, we define a G-p field to be a Galois number field K ⊂ C satisfying Gal(K/Q) ∼ = G and disc(K) = ±pa for some a. Let KG,p denote the finite, and often empty, set of G-p fields. The sets KG,p have been studied mainly {{from the point of}} view of fixing p and varying G; see [Har 94], for example. We take the opposite point of view, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> fix <b>G</b> and let p vary.

Introduction and results One of the standard models for a random partial order is the G n;p order, defined as follows. Let ! denote the natural order on the vertex set [n] = f 1; : : :; ng. A graph G on [n] induces a partial order on that vertex set, viz. the transitive closure of the relation fi ! j and there is an edge ijg. I. e., if each edge ij in G, with i ! j, is directed from i to j, i OE j iff there exists a directed path from i to j in G. The random G n;p order is obtained by applying this procedure to the random graph G n;p. Here, <b>as</b> throughout, <b>we</b> let <b>G</b> n;p denote a random graph in G(n; p), i. e., a graph on [n] such that each possible edge appears with probability p, independently of all other edges.

When reflecting on their life, they either {{feel a sense of}} accomplishment or failure. Physically, older people experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, stamina, hearing, distance perception, and the sense of smell. They also are more susceptible to severe diseases such as cancer and pneumonia due to a weakened immune system. Mental disintegration may also occur, leading to Dementia or Alzheimer's disease. However, partially due to a lifetime's accumulation of antibodies, the elderly are less likely to suffer from common diseases such as the cold. Whether or not intellectual powers increase or decrease with age remains controversial, longitudinal studies have suggested that intellect declines, while cross-sectional studies suggest that intellect is stable. It is generally believed that crystallized intelligence increases up to old age, while fluid intelligence decreases with age. For young people, time seems to have no end.

Given a non-polar compact set K, we define the n-th Widom factor Wn(K) as {{the ratio of}} the sup-norm of the n-th Chebyshev polynomial on K to the n-th degree of its logarithmic capacity. We consider results on estimations of Widom factors. By means of weakly equilibrium Cantor-type sets, K(γ), we prove new results on behavior of the sequence (Wn(K)) ∞ n= 1. By K. Schiefermayr[1], Wn(K) ≥ 2 for any non-polar compact K ⊂ R. We prove that the theoretical lower bound 2 for compact sets on the real line can be achieved by W 2 s (K(γ)) <b>as</b> fast <b>as</b> <b>we</b> wish.
