5|$|In his will, Brundage {{provided}} {{for his wife}} and for Ruegsegger, as well as making several charitable bequests. He left his papers and memorabilia to the University of Illinois; he had <b>already</b> <b>given</b> it $350,000 to fund scholarships for students interested in competing in sports who do not receive an athletic scholarship.|$|E
5|$|At the Potsdam Conference in Germany, Truman was {{informed}} that the Trinity test had been successful. He told Stalin, {{the leader of the}} Soviet Union, that the US had a new superweapon, without giving any details. This was the first official communication to the Soviet Union about the bomb, but Stalin already knew about it from spies. With the authorization to use the bomb against Japan <b>already</b> <b>given,</b> no alternatives were considered after the Japanese rejection of the Potsdam Declaration.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Pujols doubled again {{and was able}} to score on an error by Mueller. The Red Sox also scored {{in the bottom of the}} inning when Bellhorn doubled to center with two runners on base, to give them a three-run lead. Cal Eldred came in to relieve Morris in the fifth inning, after he had walked the leadoff hitter, having <b>already</b> <b>given</b> up four runs in the {{previous}} four innings. Mueller committed his World Series record-tying third error of the game, in the sixth inning; however, the Cardinals failed to capitalize. In the bottom of the inning, Trot Nixon led off with a single to center, and two more singles by Johnny Damon and Orlando Cabrera enabled two more runs to score to make it 6–1.|$|E

30|$|The network view {{of contact}} maps <b>already</b> <b>gave</b> {{systemic}} insights on the genome {{organization in the}} nuclear space.|$|R
30|$|So this <b>already</b> <b>gives</b> us {{an upper}} bound for ρ_· _X,x^ξ(τ) if x∈ S_X, ξ∈∂F(x). For generalizing this to all x∈X {{we use the}} following.|$|R
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell), Pam (Jenna Fischer), and Ryan (B. J. Novak) are {{struggling}} {{to adjust to the}} work environment of the new Michael Scott Paper Company. The office space used to be a closet; water pipes run through the room, so they can hear the toilets flush from the Dunder Mifflin bathrooms above them. Ryan openly goofs off in front of Pam and Michael and insults both of them in their presence during phone conversations. Pam and Ryan bicker over who is responsible for making copies until Michael separates them into corners. Pam, who joined the company as a saleswoman, is given the corner where the photocopier sits. She is concerned that Michael will force her to be the receptionist, which is why she quit Dunder Mifflin in the first place. She goes upstairs and asks Charles Miner (Idris Elba) for her job back, but Charles has <b>already</b> <b>given</b> the job to a new employee, Kelly Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who ends up going by her middle name—Erin—to avoid confusion with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling).|$|E
5|$|The game's {{sound and}} music were handled by Takahiro Ogata, Masaki Kurokawa and Kenichi Tsuchiya: Ogata acted as sound director. To {{accurately}} create {{the sound of}} modern-day Tokyo within Nine, Ogata and Kurokawa went to districts such as Kichijōji and Roppongi to make recordings of ambient sounds {{at different times of}} day. While there was a general theme for various city districts, the music subtly changed depending on the player's overall alignment: for instance, to represent the Law and Chaos alignments in the game, piano was used for the former and guitar for the latter. Battle music also featured randomly-generated soundtrack variations, with Ogata estimating somewhere over three hundred possible variants on battle themes. A major improvement enabled by the Xbox was the use of 5.1 surround sound, which could enable richer use of both music and in-game sound effects. According to Okada, this additional sound capacity would compensate for what could not be managed at a visual level. Maken X had <b>already</b> <b>given</b> the team a chance to use 3D sound, but Nine was the first title to make major use of 5.1, and implementing it alongside all the other features proved a challenge for the team.|$|E
5|$|On Stevie's birthday, Naz {{arranges}} {{a dinner}} party for Stevie. Stevie's mother calls, asking her to carry out an errand but not mentioning her birthday. Naz sees a birthday card from when Stevie was thirteen and Stevie says {{it is the last}} card she received from her family. Naz tells her to forget her family. When Sol falls out with both Naz and Asher, Stevie tries to help resolve the problems. She and Sol go to a club where Stevie bumps into Pippa and they are more friendly. The next day, they wake up in bed together and Stevie tries to hide Pippa from her housemates. Olly bursts in saying he will have to let the flat go as he needs his deposit, but Stevie asks for one more day. Pippa writes Stevie a cheque to cover it, says {{she is one of the}} sexiest girls she has ever met, and asks her to call her, before leaving. Stevie gives Olly the deposit but he reveals he has <b>already</b> <b>given</b> notice and Stevie will have to move out the next day. Stevie visits her brother Rupert's grave before returning to the flat and making a list of safety violations. When her landlady Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) arrives, Stevie begs to stay, and says she will contact the council about the violations, so Roxy agrees. Stevie then invites Olly over, and he hopes to rekindle their relationship. However, she ties him naked to a chair, then humiliates him by making him walk home in a dress. She tells Masood they will have tea one day and kisses him before running off. The friends then all reunite and Stevie remarks that she loves a happy ending, saying they are now a happy family.|$|E
50|$|The {{extreme cases}} {{described}} above <b>already</b> <b>give</b> us a trivial upper bound: UPOP ≤ 10000/100 = 100. But {{we can get}} a tighter upper bound.|$|R
5000|$|The Constables Protection Act 1750 <b>already</b> <b>gave</b> constables [...] "and other officers" [...] {{protection}} from being sued {{for carrying out}} the orders of the courts.|$|R

25|$|With {{regard to}} homosexuality, the {{delegation}} recalled {{that it had}} <b>already</b> <b>given</b> the necessary details and stated that decriminalizing homosexuality in Senegal was a complex issue that would require time and careful consideration because of the specific social factors involved.|$|E
50|$|Porta {{was born}} in Paraná, Entre Ríos, and studied civil engineering, {{concluding}} his studies in 1946, {{at a time when}} steam was <b>already</b> <b>giving</b> way to diesel and electric locomotives in Europe and North America.|$|R
3000|$|... the infimum of (10) is reached. It may be {{seen that}} this {{condition}} <b>already</b> <b>gives</b> a quantitative bound to the conditioning of (11) because coherences bound extra-diagonal entries of matrix G, which has ones on its diagonal.|$|R
50|$|From 1956 to 1959, Ellenberger started {{teaching}} {{the history of}} psychiatry at the Menninger Foundation (where George Devereux <b>already</b> <b>gave</b> a lecture on psychoanalysis and anthropology). The experience of exile {{played a key role in}} explaining the Ellenberger's interest in history.|$|R
25|$|While {{other names}} such as Silver Hill (1907) were {{discussed}} for the village or school district they were ultimately passed over and for simplicity sake {{the decision was made}} to keep with the name <b>already</b> <b>given</b> to the train platform and siding there.|$|E
25|$|In October 1967, {{a meeting}} of the Synod of Bishops had <b>already</b> <b>given</b> its opinion on a still earlier draft. Of the 187 members, 78 {{approved}} it as it stood, 62 approved it but suggested various modifications, 4 abstained, and 47 voted against.|$|E
25|$|Gregory {{was also}} asked by emperor Louis’s representative, Amalarius of Metz, {{to provide an}} Antiphonary for use at church {{services}} at Metz, to which Gregory was forced {{to admit that he}} had none suitable for the emperor, as he had <b>already</b> <b>given</b> a number to Wala of Corbie, which he had already taken to Francia.|$|E
5000|$|... that is, in some right {{half-plane}} in {{the complex}} numbers. This <b>already</b> <b>gives</b> some information, since the infinite product, to converge, must give a non-zero value; hence the function given by the infinite series is not zero in such a half-plane.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I did {{not think}} so,' said Tom, looking in amazement at the effect {{produced}} by the bright modern grate with its cheerful fire, the warm delicate tints of the furniture, the appliances for comfort and ornament <b>already</b> <b>giving</b> a home look.|$|R

25|$|On {{the right}} wing, {{in the forest}} from Ács, Görgei's six battalions, were {{subjected}} to an ever-growing pression by the imperials, which, because the order, that after the battle to retreat towards west, was <b>already</b> <b>given,</b> appeared in this place more and more numerous, preventing the Hungarian high commander to achieve a success here.|$|E
25|$|Gadamer {{writes that}} human {{tradition}} and reason {{can serve as}} a standard of measure for testing uncovered truths and avoiding relativism. Heidegger states that we can avoid relativism by testing interpreted truths against Dasein's facticity, or something that is <b>already</b> <b>given</b> in existence that informs our theorizing. Additionally, hermeneutic psychotherapists and theorists say that interpreted truths must be congruent with ontological hermeneutics theory.|$|E
25|$|It was Vandermonde (1771) {{who first}} {{recognized}} determinants as independent functions. Laplace (1772) gave the general method of expanding a determinant {{in terms of}} its complementary minors: Vandermonde had <b>already</b> <b>given</b> a special case. Immediately following, Lagrange (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of elimination theory; he proved many special cases of general identities.|$|E
50|$|Woodall {{was one of}} {{only six}} Republicans who opposed {{legislation}} that would require all states to honor the concealed weapons permits of other states, arguing that the bill was unnecessary because the Second Amendment <b>already</b> <b>gives</b> Americans the right to bear arms.|$|R
60|$|In the drawing-room Beatrix was <b>already</b> <b>giving</b> tea {{to young}} Tharp and the Reverend Husell Barter. And {{the sound of}} these {{well-known}} voices restored to Mrs. Pendyce something of her tranquillity. The Rector came towards her at once with a teacup in his hand.|$|R
50|$|The {{grandson}} of the Italian composer of symphonies, sacred music, chamber music, and opera, Niccolò Piccinni {{and son of}} Giuseppe Luigi Piccinni, Piccinni was <b>already</b> <b>giving</b> piano lessons at age 13. He studied piano, and later attended the Conservatoire where he studied composition from Jean-François Le Sueur.|$|R
25|$|Sir Alan {{commented that}} Tuan had <b>already</b> <b>given</b> {{up on the}} competition, and {{described}} him as 'a broken man'; Tuan confirmed {{that this was the}} case on You're Fired, and said that he deserved to be fired.

25|$|Suddenly, Gyges runs in distraught, {{for he is}} {{the bearer}} of evil news. He is {{followed}} by the priests of Venus who demand an audience with the King.

25|$|Guillou {{has written}} an autobiographical {{book about his}} school years, Ondskan (1981), which also became a film, Evil (2003). The movie was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award in 2003. Guillou, still listed as a terrorist by the US government, was unable to attend. He {{managed to get a}} visa, but it was linked to attending the Academy Award ceremony, and director Mikael Håfström had <b>already</b> <b>given</b> Guillou's ticket to his own wife instead.|$|E
50|$|The weights of the neurons are {{initialized}} {{either to}} small random values or sampled evenly from the subspace spanned {{by the two}} largest principal component eigenvectors.
