5|$|British rule came at <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> many {{ordinary}} {{people as well}} as traders. The Shetlanders' nautical skills were sought by the Royal Navy: some 3,000 served during the Napoleonic Wars from 1800 to 1815 and press gangs were rife. During this period 120 men were taken from Fetlar alone and only 20 of them returned home. By the late 19th century 90% of all Shetland was owned by just 32 people, and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8,000 Shetlanders emigrated. With the passing of the Crofters' Act in 1886 the Liberal prime minister William Gladstone emancipated crofters from the rule of the landlords. The Act enabled those who had effectively been landowners' serfs to become owner-occupiers of their own small farms.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of the}} Commando Hunt campaigns was not to halt infiltration, but to {{make the}} North Vietnamese pay too heavy <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> their effort. Corollary to this was the {{destruction}} of as much of their logistical system as possible and to tie down as many PAVN forces in static security roles as possible. Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation. Despite the expenditure of {{an enormous amount of}} ordnance over five years, the level of that pressure {{was never going to be}} sufficient to deter Hanoi from its goal.|$|E
5|$|While Marlborough {{fought in}} the Low Countries a series of {{personal}} and party rivalries instigated a general reversal of fortune. The Whigs, who were the main prop of the war, had been laying siege to Godolphin. As <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> supporting {{the government in the}} next parliamentary session, the Whigs demanded a share of public office with the appointment of a leading member of their Junto, the Earl of Sunderland (Marlborough's son-in-law), to the post of Secretary of State. The Queen, who loathed Sunderland and the Junto, and who refused to be dominated by any single party, bitterly opposed the move; but Godolphin, increasingly dependent on Whig support, had little room for manoeuvre. With Sarah's tactless, unsubtle backing, Godolphin relentlessly pressed the Queen to submit to Whig demands. In despair, Anne finally relented and Sunderland received the seals of office; but the special relationship between Godolphin, Sarah, and the Queen had taken a severe blow and she began to turn increasingly to a new favourite – Sarah's cousin, Abigail Masham. Anne also became ever more reliant on the advice of Harley, who, convinced that the duumvirate's policy of appeasing the Whig Junto was unnecessary, had set himself up as alternative source of advice to a sympathetic Queen.|$|E

He became disenchanted with music, and virtually didn't touch guitar for almost a year. He finally agreed on <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> his one remaining guitar, a gift from mentor Isaacs, but, on the way to close the deal he pulled his car over to allow himself a final play of the instrument and suddenly found his passion for playing re-ignited.

25|$|Despite violent rivalries and the {{fracturing}} of the kingdom, {{it continued}} to exist independently well into the 19th century. The rise of the clans became noticeable in the 1850s {{at the end of}} the reign of Henrique II. In 1855 or 1856, two potential kings emerged to contest the succession following his death. Álvaro Ndongo claimed the throne on behalf of the Kinlaza faction of Matari (ignoring the existence of Andre's group at Mbanza Puto), calling himself Álvaro XIII and Pedro Lelo claimed the throne on behalf of the Mbidizi Valley faction of the Kinlaza from a base at Bembe. Pedro won the contest, thanks to soliciting Portuguese aid, and with their help his soldiers defeated Álvaro. Like André II, Álvaro XIII did not accept defeat and established his own base at Nkunga, not far from São Salvador. The Portuguese support which had put Pedro V on the throne had <b>a</b> <b>price,</b> <b>for</b> when he was crowned Pedro V (he was actually the second king named Pedro V; the first one ruled in the late 1770s) in 1857 he also swore a treaty of vassalage to Portugal.

500|$|Stu Jackson, {{general manager}} {{for the first five}} seasons, made several non-optimal player {{selection}} decisions.

500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} masculinity as a theme in True Detective.

Slate Willa Paskin said True Detective depiction of its female characters—as sex workers, the deceased, and [...] "a nagging wife"—seemed to reveal an intent to reflect the protagonists' [...] "blinkered worldview and the very masculine, Southern cop culture they inhabited." [...] Some commentators saw Hart's characterization {{as a manifestation of}} this idea, evident through his conventional view of women as virgins and whores, as well as his treatment of Maggie and Audrey. For example, when Hart confronts the two men who had sex with Audrey, he is in essence [...] "charging other men <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> infringing on the daughter he sees, in a muddled way, as both deserving of protection and badly in need of being controlled." ...|$|E

The men had to pay for their ropes and chains, for tools and for services such as sharpening and repairing.

500|$|The {{outcome of}} the 1894 {{elections}} made it increasingly likely that a Republican {{would be the next}} president. At the time, the presidential nominating process started much later than it subsequently would, and McKinley, in quietly organizing his campaign with Hanna's aid in the early months of 1895, was alone among the candidates in acting so early. Other potential Republican candidates were former president Harrison, incoming Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine, Iowa Senator William B. Allison, and several state favorite sons, such as Illinois Senator Shelby Cullom. If former president Harrison entered the race, he would immediately become a major contender, and uncertainty over his status hung over the race in 1895. At the time, unless there was an incumbent elected Republican president, the nomination was generally not decided until the convention, with state political bosses and delegates exacting <b>a</b> <b>price</b> <b>for</b> their support. A candidate's efforts to gain the nomination did not begin until shortly before the state delegate conventions in the spring of the election year, where fights over the makeup of the delegation often focused on who would be on it, rather than who delegates would support. McKinley and Hanna decided on a systematic nationwide effort to gain the nomination, employing what onetime presidential adviser Karl Rove—author of a 2015 book on the 1896 race—called [...] "the first modern primary campaign".|$|E
