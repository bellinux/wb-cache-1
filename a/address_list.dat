CTA detainee, and spy, named Kamil Önal had one of his CTA associates burn an intelligence report originating from the National Security Service (NSS) {{that was at the}} CTA office. In addition, a member from the Kızıltoprak branch, Serafim Sağlamel, was found to be carrying an <b>address</b> <b>list</b> of non-Muslim citizens. However, on September 12, the government blamed Turkish Communists for the pogrom, arresting 45 [...] "card-carrying communists" [...] (including Aziz Nesin, Kemal Tahir, and İlhan Berktay). This type of [...] "false flag" [...] anti-Communist propaganda was a staple of the Counter-Guerrilla. When opposition leader İsmet İnönü delivered a speech criticizing the government for rounding up innocent people instead of the actual perpetrators, the communists were released in December 1955. An angry Menderes said that İnönü would not be forgiven for his speech, pardoning the communists.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the decades}} after the 1970s, some saw the ethnic {{composition}} of the school's enrollment as changing. [...] In 1979, former Prep School Headmaster Richard Howard said in his book Upper Canada College, 1929-1979: Colborne's Legacy: [...] "The growth of the enrolment has {{increased the number of}} boys {{from a wide variety of}} backgrounds and decreased the ratio of those from old Toronto families. [...] The <b>address</b> <b>list</b> now reflects Toronto's ethnic variety and resembles a small United Nations." [...] William Kilbourn also said that the College had been accepting, for many years before the 1980s, a number of foreign students, notably from Latin America and Asia, and that UCC had made a concentrated effort to recruit Quebec francophones into the student body. [...] By the 1980s the school was offering financial assistance to the less affluent, and was making serious attempts to encourage boys from visible minorities to enroll. [...] But, few applied, save for many Chinese, East Indian, and Japanese Canadians who were accepted into the Prep; in 1983 the numbers were 42 out of a total student population of 361. However, even into the 1990s some, while acknowledging the shift to a more multi-cultural student body, claimed anti-Semitism continued in some form. In 1990, The College Times featured an editorial stating that while UCC was no longer [...] "a white-bread, right-wing fortress: it has become much more multi-cultural and (dare I say it?) liberal.... In my years at UCC I have faced anti-Semitism, ugliness, stupidity and bureaucracy." ...|$|E
50|$|Global <b>address</b> <b>list</b> {{management}} {{ensures that}} each server has an up-to-date and synchronized version of all users from all coexisting servers. For example, if Jack leaves Business B and his account is deleted, the global <b>address</b> <b>list</b> at Business B will be updated. The coexistence server will check for updates periodically, then automatically update the global <b>address</b> <b>list</b> at Business A {{so that the}} two are once again synchronized.
