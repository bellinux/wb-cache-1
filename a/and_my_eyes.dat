500|$|With {{the release}} of Tool's {{follow-up}} single [...] "Prison Sex", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: [...] "It {{took so long to}} remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> closed and my throat wide open." [...] The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his [...] "surrealistic interpretation" [...] of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as [...] "metaphoric", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.|$|E
500|$|This highly nuanced {{and largely}} {{theatrical}} letter was unsigned, {{but she had}} included her name on a card and enclosed it in an envelope, along with four of her poems. He praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer, being unaware that she had already appeared in print. She assured him that publishing was as foreign to her [...] "as Firmament to Fin", but also proposed that [...] "If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her". Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, [...] "I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves." [...] She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo. She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not [...] "care for Thought", her father bought her books, but begged her [...] "not to read them– because he fears they joggle the Mind".|$|E

Breeds told Miller {{that she could}} not discuss her departure because of her contract with the series. She added that [...] "Ruby is still very much alive, I'm not free of Ruby just yet". Two months later, the Daily Star's Susan Hill announced that Ruby decides to leave Summer Bay after she makes [...] "an emotional visit" [...] to her mother's grave. She then realises that she needs to move on from recent events and the only way she can do that is to leave the Bay. A spokesperson told Hill [...] "Ruby knows that to save her life she must leave for a fresh start. It's going to be emotional as she has so many good memories but the bad ones are all she can think of." [...] However, Ruby leaves Summer Bay after she confesses to tampering with the brakes of a car, which resulted in Dexter Walker (Charles Cottier) being seriously injured. Ruby regrets what she has done and hands herself in to the police after saying goodbye to Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke). Breeds thanked her fans on Twitter, saying [...] "Thank you. Such beautiful feedback. So sad that it's all over, but kind of relieved to let poor Ruby go and heal... <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>Eyes..</b> Love you." ...|$|E

According to Numan, {{this was an}} unintentional result of acne; before an appearance on Top of the Pops, he had [...] "spots everywhere, so they slapped about half an inch of white make-up on me before I'd even walked in the door. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> were like pissholes in the snow, so they put black on there. My so-called image fell into place an hour before going on the show". His [...] "wooden" [...] stage presence was, in his words, a result of extreme self-consciousness and lack of [...] "showmanship" [...] and {{often referred to as}} being [...] "like an android". During this period, Numan generated an army of fans calling themselves [...] "Numanoids", providing him with a fanbase which maintained their support through {{the latter half of the}} 1980s, when his fortunes began to fall precipitously.|$|E
