40|$|<b>Autocidal</b> <b>control</b> of the Mediterranean {{fruit fly}} Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) is an {{environmentally}} friendly and safe practice employed successfully worldwide. A key {{component in the}} Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is to release sterile males that can compete with wild males in nature. Exposure of sterile males to ginger root oil (GRO) {{in the form of}} aromatherapy prior to release has been shown to significantly improve male competitiveness and performance. However, alternatives to GRO exposure are desired to (i) reduce personnel costs and handling-time requirements and (ii) find new aromatherapeutic compounds. In this study, alternatives to GRO aromatherapy were investigated, such as incorporating GRO into the post-teneral diet, or employing other molecules (limonene and linalool) occurring naturally in citrus release areas. Our results reveal that both the GRO-supplemented diet and linalool aromatherapy were equal to the GRO aromatherapy control in improving mating performance in sterile males. In contrast, exposure to limonene did not afford a mating advantage to sterile mates when compared to the control. In addition, sterile male survival was not affected by any of the treatments tested. Implications for how both new approaches could be implemented in SIT programmes in citrus production areas are discussed...|$|E

This could result in enormous economic benefits in the mass rearing and raise the efficiency of the field operations. The development of genetic sexing of mosquitoes, enabling the release of males only, but impairing the overall fitness of the released insect has been considered greatly. Here we report on a morphological sexing method for the preferential diagnosis and separation of males in late III and IV instar larvae for the mosquitoes Anopheles stephensi Liston and An. culicifacies s. l. (Diptera: Culicidae), the principal vectors of human malaria in Asia and Indian subcontinent. Methods: Male mosquitoes are identified by their tube like organ at the 9 th abdomen segment which originates from segment parallel to the spiracles. Length and width of this organ is measured as 66. 66 ± 9. 5 and 14. 3 ± 1. 5 µm respectively. The whole length of the organ is 201. 63 ± 23. 4 µm. Two fried eggs in the anterior portion of the segment are apparent in males. The length of tube in female is shorter than the male (almost half of the length– 37. 95 ± 4. 0 µm), its width is slightly stout an...|$|E
40|$|The {{prospect}} of <b>autocidal</b> insect <b>control</b> {{was investigated in}} a cellar population of D. melanogaster using a compound-chromosome stock. The released stock was synthesized by irradiating virgin female progeny derived from the cellar and crossing to a second-chromsome compound laboratory stock. Incorporation of an appropriate genetic background into the compound stock was tested in laboratory studies. Larval development to adult emergence and adult survival studies indicated the compound release stock to be relatively similar to the wild population, while behavioral tests detected no mating isolation between wild or compound genotypes. An unstable equilibrium point of compound frequency 0. 7 was observed in population cage experiments with the two genotypes...|$|R
40|$|The diamondback moth Plutella xylostella (L [...] ) (DBM) is {{a serious}} pest of crucifers worldwide. Both augmentative {{biological}} <b>control</b> and <b>autocidal</b> genetic <b>control</b> of DBM require an efficient mass-rearing system. We developed a wheat germ based artificial diet with kale leaf powder (ADK) and one without the powder (AD) and compared development of DBM on these diets, together with cabbage (Cab), its natural host. We used both laboratory and wild strains of DBM. ADK diet supported significantly higher percentage survival to pupation in laboratory and wild strains, than cabbage and AD. Survival rates within diets were relatively higher in laboratory strain than in wild strain. Larval period was significantly shorter with ADK than with cabbage in the laboratory strain but the reverse was observed in the wild strain. Pupal weights were similar between diets in wild strain, although females were significantly heavier than males. ADK diet able to support growth and development of DBM optimally, with no microbial contamination, thus suitable for mass production of DBM in laboratory...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{autosomal}} recessive mutant, green pupa (gp), in Culex qulnquefasciatus has been Isolated. The homozygous (gp/gp) females are viable whereas male homozygotes do not develop beyond the pupal stage. The behavior of this mutant character in pedigree studies has been reported. GENETIC STUDIES ofvector species of mosqui-toes are of considerable importance {{because of the}} advances {{that have been made}} for the con-trol of insect populations through genetic ma-nipulation. Craig 2 has reviewed several possibil-ities for <b>autocidal</b> <b>control</b> of mosquito popula-tions through self propagating deleterious genes. Such studies involve the isolation of mu-tants that may have deleterious effects on their population. Several mutants, both sex-linked and autosomal, have been described in the Cu-lex pipiens complex 1 ' 3 " 8. This paper describes the isolation and genetic analysis of an autoso-mal recessive mutant, green pupa (gp) in Culex qulnquefasciatus, the primary vector of Ban-croftian filariasis in the Oriental region. Materials and Methods The mutant, green pupa, was isolated from a local population of Cx. qulnquefasciatus, which we maintain as a laboratory colony. Three to 4 -day-old males were crossed to 4 -day-old virgin females in cages of 20 cm 3 size. Two days later, the females were given a blood meal from a bird. Seven F | egg rafts were collected and the larvae hatching from each egg raft were reared as individual families in white enamel trays; they were fed yeast tablets. The resulting males and females of each such family units were sib-mated. Egg rafts were collected from these females after the usual blood meal. The resulting F 2 larvae, pupae, and adults were screened under a stereozoom for the isolation of mutants. It was possible to isolate 21 viable green pu-The authors are affiliated with the Department o...|$|E

40|$|E. F. Knipling, on the {{occasion}} of receiving the World Food Prize in 1992, stated that "major advances in coping with most of the major arthropod pest problems will require a change in the tactics and the strategies to manage those pests. They must change for the currently used limited scale, reactive, broad-spectrum measures to preventive approaches that are target specific and applied on an area-wide basis". Since then, practices to manage these pests have hardly changed and pesticide use is still on the rise every year {{to the detriment of the}} environment, human health and the ecosystem. The need for more target specific, sustainable, environmentally-friendly and cost-effective control tactics and pest management strategies remains to date more pertinent than ever. Integrated pest management (IPM) aims at the careful integration of several control tactics which are the most opportune for the particular ecosystem, while safeguarding human health and the environment. It has remained the dominant paradigm of pest control over the last half century. IPM can be applied on a field-by-field basis (localised IPM), or against an entire pest population within a delimited geographic area (area-wide (AW-IPM). AW-IPM seeks to treat all habitats, also those that are of no economic interest to the farmer, so that none produces migrants to re-establish significant infestations in areas of concern. This is in contrast to the field-by-field approach that focuses narrowly on defending the valued entity (crop, livestock, people, building, etc.). In most cases, AW-IPM leads to more effective and sustainable management of the insect pest. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a species-specific <b>autocidal</b> <b>control</b> tactic that interferes with the reproductive potential of the target insect pest. It is a very powerful tool that is most effective when insect populations are low and when applied on an area-wide basis. The SIT within an AW-IPM context can be applied for the suppression, eradication, containment or prevention of insect pest populations. There are numerous AW-IPM programmes where the SIT has been used successfully, especially against dipteran and lepidopteran pests, and examples will be given to illustrate this. On economic, environmental and biological grounds, the case for SIT is compelling...|$|E
