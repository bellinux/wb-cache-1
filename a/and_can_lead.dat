5|$|Cataracts {{can affect}} any breed of dog {{and is the}} same {{condition}} as seen in humans. Here {{the lens of the}} eye hardens and is characterised by cloudiness in the eye. Cataracts will blur the dog's vision <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to permanent blindness if left untreated. While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by diabetes, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|During ashfall events large {{demands are}} {{commonly}} placed on water resources for cleanup and shortages can result. Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} firefighting <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> {{to a lack of}} water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and may need to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with brooms rather than hoses).|$|E

5|$|Heart {{conditions}} {{related to}} the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease, in which the mitral valve degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers {{of the heart and}} eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus, where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.|$|E
5|$|Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} that affect a dog's eyesight <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to blindness. It has been documented in a large number of different dog breeds including both the American and English Cocker Spaniels. The two types of Cockers are susceptible to a specific type of PRA called Progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), symptoms include night blindness leading to total blindness between the ages of three and five. PRCD is the most widespread hereditary retinal disease which may lead to blindness in dogs.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form as {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. Cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E

5|$|A {{few other}} non-essential heavy metals {{have one or}} more toxic forms. Kidney failure and {{fatalities}} have been recorded arising from the ingestion of germanium dietary supplements (~15 to 300g in total consumed {{over a period of}} two months to three years). Exposure to osmium tetroxide (OsO4) may cause permanent eye damage <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to respiratory failure and death. Indium salts are toxic if more than few milligrams are ingested and will affect the kidneys, liver, and heart. Cisplatin (PtCl2(NH3)2), which is an important drug used to kill cancer cells, is also a kidney and nerve poison. Bismuth compounds can cause liver damage if taken in excess; insoluble uranium compounds, as well as the dangerous radiation they emit, can cause permanent kidney damage.|$|E
5|$|Internal parasites of {{the common}} loon include many species of worms, {{including}} flatworms, tapeworms, nematodes and spiny-headed worms. High levels of worms may result from feeding changes due to low availability of fish, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to illness and death. Protozoal infections including one caused by Eimeria gaviae and avian malaria has been recorded in this loon. The black fly Simulium annulus is {{closely associated with the}} common loon to which it is attracted to chemicals in the uropygial gland secretions as well as by visual and tactile cues. This fly is detrimental to loons, their preferred hosts, transmitting blood-borne parasites and viruses, and causing nest abandonment when numbers are high. External parasites include ischnoceran feather lice, although these are not found on the bird's head.|$|E
5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than fat or heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclogenesis}} {{describes the}} process of development of tropical cyclones. Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity, and are warm core. Cyclones can transition between extratropical, subtropical, and tropical phases. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. In the Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific oceans, a tropical cyclone is generally {{referred to as a}} hurricane (from the name of the ancient Central American deity of wind, Huracan), in the Indian and south Pacific oceans it is called a cyclone, and in the northwestern Pacific it is called a typhoon.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{has some}} special {{considerations}} that affect tropical cyclone-related rainfall. Mountains {{to the west}} act as a perfect mechanism for upward motion during sustained east winds, {{which can lead to}} flash flooding and landslides in that region (e.g. Hurricane Camille). As a tropical system approaches from the south, a frontal zone sets up between the moist Atlantic Ocean and the drier landmass to the west. This boundary can set up two or three days in advance of a tropical storm, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> up to prolonged heavy rains across coastal sections (e.g. Hurricane Floyd). As the cyclone advances north, the boundary will slowly shift west, but progresses west of a Richmond/Washington, D.C. line.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} is {{considered}} to be vulnerable due to habitat destruction, its isolated populations, collection of adults, predation, and a low breeding success rate. Its habitat is being destroyed to create large agricultural fields and cocoa plantations, as well as for logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. Due to the highly specialized requirements for its habitat, its population is very fragmented, and the species is believed to be naturally rare. Competition for its nesting sites is a result of these strict requirements <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> to infanticide. Its estimated population is between 2,500 and 10,000 individuals, though it is believed that the population is {{at the lower end of}} the estimate. However, due to the inaccessibility of some parts of its range, it is also possible that this species is more common than believed. The population of some of these colonies is reaching the minimum levels needed for long-term viability. It also falls victim to spring traps set for mammals by hunters. However, a more serious threat to its numbers was the widespread collection of rockfowl for display in zoos in the 1950s and 1960s. There is a risk that it will be negatively affected by ecotourism due to disturbances in its daily routine if proper viewing procedures are not followed.|$|E
