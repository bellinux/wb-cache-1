5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> up to his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.|$|E
5|$|In 1950-51, he hit 490 runs at {{an average}} of 37.69, {{including}} 100 not out against New South Wales at the SCG. However, he struggled the following season and was dropped, and did not play a single first-class match in 1952-53. His only other first-class centuries came in 195354: 102 against South Australia and 111 against Western Australia. He struggled in the following two summers and could not hold a consistent position in the team, and retired. Altogether, he made 1,716 first-class runs (mostly as an opener) in 37 matches {{at an average}} of 27.23. A regular choice for the Queensland baseball team, Harvey later turned to cricket umpiring. His initial first-class match as an umpire was in 1974-75 <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> in two Tests from 1979 to 1980 after many players and officials left for the breakaway World Series Cricket. He stood in six One Day Internationals including one of the finals of the inaugural World Series Cup. In all, he officiated in 31 first-class and 13 List A matches.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Meyer {{resumed his}} prewar pattern of late summer home games in 1946, but then, in 1947, {{at the age}} of 42, allowed himself his solitary season of {{full-time}} cricket as Somerset's captain. By this stage, he was badly affected by lumbago, and though he scored 850 runs and took 43 wickets, the season was not a success for Somerset, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> {{down at the end of}} the year. He played a couple of first-class matches in each of the next three seasons, and then retired from cricket to concentrate full-time on schoolmastering and developing his school at Millfield.|$|E

25|$|Doubts about Muralitharan's action persisted, however. On the 1998–99 tour to Australia he {{was once}} again called for {{throwing}} by Ross Emerson during a One Day International against England at the Adelaide Oval in Australia. The Sri Lankan team almost abandoned the match, but after instructions from the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, the game resumed. The Sri Lankan captain at the time Arjuna Ranatunga, was later fined and given a suspended ban from the game as a result. It later emerged {{that at the time}} of this match Emerson was on sick leave from his non-cricket job due to a stress-related illness <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> down for the rest of the series. Muralitharan was sent for further tests in Perth and England and was cleared again. At no stage was Muralitharan requested to change or remodel his action, by the ICC. Up to this point in his career (1999) Muralitharan primarily bowled two types of deliveries, namely the off-break and the topspinner. He had not yet mastered the doosra.|$|E

500|$|John, which {{regularly}} describes Jesus' opponents {{simply as}} [...] "the Jews", is more consistently hostile to [...] "the Jews" [...] {{than any other}} body of New Testament writing. Historian and former Roman Catholic priest James Carroll states: [...] "The climax of this movement comes in chapter 8 of John, when Jesus is portrayed as denouncing 'the Jews' who were gathered at the Temple as the offspring of Satan." [...] In [...] Jesus tells the Jews: [...] "You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> not in the truth; because truth is not in him." [...] In [...] and , [...] "the Jews" [...] are depicted as wishing to kill Jesus. However, Carroll cautions that this and similar statements in the Gospel of Matthew and the 1 Thessalonians {{should be viewed as}} [...] "evidence not of Jew hatred but of sectarian conflicts among Jews" [...] {{in the early years of}} the Christian church.|$|E
500|$|Against all expectations, the war {{continued}} for five years. During this period, PedroII's {{time and energy}} were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that [...] "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost." [...] "Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness {{had no effect on}} his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously PedroII remarked: [...] "What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me?

500|$|From this mediaeval horse came {{an animal}} called the Old English Black Horse in the 17th century. The Black Horse was {{improved}} by {{the followers of}} Robert Bakewell, of Dishley Grange in Leicestershire, resulting in a horse sometimes known as the [...] "Bakewell Black". Bakewell imported six Dutch or Flanders mares, notable since breeders tended to concentrate on improving the male line. Two different types of black horses developed: the Fen or Lincolnshire type and the Leicester or Midlands type. The Fen type tended to be larger, with more bone and extra hair, while the Midlands type tended to have more endurance while being of a finer appearance. The term [...] "Shire horse" [...] was first used in the mid-17th century, and incomplete records begin to appear {{near the end of}} the 18th century. The [...] "Packington Blind Horse", from Leicestershire, is one of the best-known horses of the era, with direct descendents being recorded from 1770 to 1832. This horse is usually recognised as the foundation stallion for the Shire breed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> at stud from 1755 to 1770. During the 19th century, Shires were used extensively as cart horses to move goods from the docks through the cities and countryside.

Three months later on October 7, silent-screen cowboy star William S. Hart (1864-1946) visited Masterson. They were photographed standing together {{on the roof of the}} New York Morning Telegraph building and went back to Masterson's office where he asked Hart to sit in his chair and pose for a second photo with him. According to Hart: [...] "I did so, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> beside me. Mr. Masterson was sitting in that same chair eighteen days later when he heard the last call." [...] Hart subsequently cast a Masterson lookalike as Masterson in his biographical film Wild Bill Hickok, which was released in 1923.|$|E
2500|$|MacDonald, {{along with}} Keir Hardie and Arthur Henderson, {{was one of}} the three {{principal}} founders of the Labour Party. He was chairman of the Labour MPs before 1914 and, after an eclipse in his career caused by his opposition to the First World War he was Leader of the Labour Party from 1922. The second Labour Government (1929–31) was dominated by the Great Depression. He formed the National Government to carry out spending cuts to defend the gold standard; the gold standard had to be abandoned after the Invergordon Mutiny and he called a general election in 1931 seeking a [...] "doctor's mandate" [...] to fix the economy. The National coalition won an overwhelming landslide and the Labour Party was reduced to a rump of around 50 seats in the House of Commons. His health deteriorated <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> down as Prime Minister in 1935 and remained as Lord President of the Council until retiring in 1937. He died later that year.|$|E
2500|$|Edmonds {{retorted}} that {{he would}} ignore the criticisms as they were [...] "trifling or silly", except for a request to cut a comment that Viscount D'Abernon, Ambassador to Germany (1920–1925) was pro-German. Edmonds {{pointed out that the}} views were his, not officially endorsed and that the official history should not be determined by the War Office, Admiralty or Foreign Office. The volume had been based on official documents <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>stood</b> by it. The source of the criticism was Charles Webster (25 July 1886 – August 1961), who had written memoranda analysing the Armistice and military occupation, ready for the anticipated re-occupation of Germany. Edmonds was most critical of one of the documents and wrote to Webster defending Haig. Obstacles were placed between him and his detractors, with the intention of protecting his feelings, because the Foreign Office harboured another critic, Llewellyn Woodward (1890–1971), who called the book episodic, with slurred chronology and a narrative of the controversy over provisioning the occupied territories, that was misleading; criticism of civilian authorities lacked evidence and was [...] "dogmatic and prejudiced". Woodward, less critical than Webster, asked him to spare Edmonds' feelings but Webster found the book lacking in analytical rigour, refused to devote more time to it and R. A. Butler, Chairman of the Committee on the Control of Official Histories, got the job of rejecting the book for publication. In July 1944, over Edmonds' objections, it was decided to print a hundred copies For Official Use Only but only after many Foreign Office demands had been conceded, including cuts to the preface.|$|E
