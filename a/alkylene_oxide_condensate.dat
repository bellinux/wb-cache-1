40|$|The anionic {{ring-opening}} polymerization of <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxides,</b> except ethylene oxide, {{is accompanied}} by strong side reactions, leading to high molecular weight and low molecular weight byproducts. In this work we investigated the anionic polymerization of hydrophobic <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxides</b> at different temperatures, solvents, and initiating systems. For polymers synthesized in the temperature range between 40 and 80 degrees C and employing potassium and cesium alcoholate initiators significant amounts of byproducts were found. With the help of crown ethers the temperature could be reduced to - 23 degrees C without extending polymerization times too much. This measure allowed eliminating byproducts almost completely. The best results were obtained with potassium alcoholates and 18 -crown- 6 in toluene at - 10 to - 23 degrees C. Poly(1, 2 -butylene oxide), poly(1, 2 -hexylene oxide), and poly(1, 2 -octylene oxide) homopolymers were synthesized up to molecular weights {{in the range of}} 50 000 - 100 000 and M-w/M-n < 1. 1. Furthermore, the method was employed to synthesize amphiphilic block copolymers of the hydrophobic poly(alkylene oxide) s with poly(ethylene oxide) as the hydrophilic moiety. Block molecular weights reached up to 50 000. Even at those high molecular weights the contents of homopolymer byproduct did not exceed 1 %. The results indicate that side reactions usually involved in the anionic polymerization of <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxides</b> were largely suppressed using the employed polymerization technique...|$|R

In this article, {{the theory of}} "Multi-Coordination Centered Catalyst " is proposed for the mechanism of stereoregular ionic polymerization. It is emphasized that the catalysts having two coordination centers would be favorable for stereoregulation: one center is the counter ion of the growing polymer end and the other center is linked with the counter ion by halfbonding,oxide linkage or ion-molecule linking through coordination. In vinyl polymerization, the first center (counter ion center) is paired with growing polymer end by forming ion pair and the second center restricts free rotation in chain end by corrdination with two adjacent polar substituents In the polymerizations of a-olefin, aldehyde and <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxide,</b> the key atom {{is present in the}} monomer side and the coordination centers link with the monomer to regulate the con-figuration of the incoming monomer molecule, where stereoregulation can be effectuated by the ligand of the catalyst.

30|$|These primary {{observations}} {{revealed that}} the least wax was deposited from S 3 {{as a result of}} the unusual wetting ability and solvent characteristics of the trisiloxane. This is due to (1) the super-wetting ability of S 3 and hydrophilicity brought about by the high content of <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxide</b> in the polyalkylenoxy groups, (2) the dispersed particles are associated with formation of very thick wetting films during high rates of spreading which in turn provided an environment to inhibit the wax deposition and (3) the ability of trisiloxane to perform as a cleaning agent to detach oil droplets and films from surfaces as reported by Churaev et al. (2001), which is suggested as a similar mechanism occurred in our study for wax deposition removal. Apart from that, Wang et al.

40|$|Objective: Failed Back Syndrome (FBS) is {{unacceptable}} relief of pain or recurrence of symptoms in patients after spinal surgery, such as laminectomy. One possible cause of FBS is peridural fibrosis (PF). PF is the overproduction of scar tissue {{adjacent to the}} dura mater. Bleeding can cause PF after laminectomy. Ostene is an <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxide</b> copolymer material used to stop bleeding from bony surfaces. Floseal is a gelatin thrombin matrix sealant used to assist fibrin formation and to promote coagulation. Methods: Total of 32 female Sprague–Dawley rats were evenly allotted to 4 experimental groups: laminectomy only, laminectomy + Ostene (Baxter International, Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA), laminectomy + Floseal (Baxter International, Inc., Deerfield, IL, USA), and laminectomy + Adcon-L (aap Implantate AG, Berlin, Germany). After performing total laminectomy, agents were placed over dura mater. Spinal column of test subjects was harvested 6 weeks after laminectomy. Histopathological examination of samples was based on Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin and eosin staining. PF observed in the groups was graded using system previously described by He et al. Statistically significant p value was defined as p <  0. 005. Results: Present study revealed that Adcon-L, Ostene, and Floseal groups had reduced PF compared with laminectomy only group (p =  0. 001). Comparison of Ostene and Floseal groups with Adcon-L group yielded no significant difference. Conclusion: Reoperation as result of FBS has greater risk and often has poor outcome; surgeons must take precautions to avoid FBS, such as careful selection of appropriate patient and operation technique.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to synthesize nanocrystals of highly acidic zeolite Y nanoclusters, encapsulate them within the channels of mesoporous (nanoporous) silicates or nanoporous organosilicates, and evaluate the 'zeolite Y/Nanoporous host' composites as catalysts for the upgrading of heavy petroleum feedstocks. In comparison to conventionally-used zeolite Y catalysts of micron size particles, the nanocrystals (< 100 nm particle size) which contain shorter path lengths, are expected to allow faster diffusion of large hydrocarbon substrates and the catalysis products within {{and out of the}} zeolite's channels and cages (< 1 nm size). This is expected to significantly reduce deactivation of the catalyst and to prolong their period of reactivity. Encapsulating zeolite Y nanocrystals within the nanoporous materials is expected to protect its external surfaces and pore entrances from being blocked by large hydrocarbon substrates, since these substrates will initially be converted to small molecules by the nanoporous host (a catalyst in its own right). The project consisted of four major tasks as follows: (1) synthesis of the nanoparticles of zeolite Y (of various chemical compositions) using various techniques such as the addition of organic additives to conventional zeolite Y synthesis mixtures to suppress zeolite Y crystal growth; (2) synthesis of nanoporous silicate host materials of up to 30 nm pore diameter, using poly (<b>alkylene</b> <b>oxide)</b> copolymers which when removed will yield a mesoporous material; (3) synthesis of zeolite Y/Nanoporous Host composite materials as potential catalysts; and (4) evaluation of the catalyst for the upgrading of heavy petroleum feedstocks...|$|R
40|$|The -effects {{of water}} {{repellent}} solution concentration, distribution of various components and wood-w 9 ter repellent bond type were studied using Corsican pine'(Pinus, nigra) and European beech'(Falas*sylvatica) wood. The -resin component protects treated wood by forming an impermeable coating on cell lumina., whilst the wax gives protection by hydrophobic action. Increased concentration and treatment severity cause deeper penetration and increased loading and provide better protection. Water repellents are distributed in highest concentration at the treate; end and in gradually decreasing amounts inwards. Weathering rapidly reduces {{the effectiveness of}} the coating action, because in the absence of hydrophobes water is able to gain rapid access to all treated capillaries. However, hydrophobic treatments continue to provide protection to inner wood even after end grain degradation, because water is able to penetrate treated cells only to the depth of the degraded zone. Loss of water repellent effectiveness in the surface zone due to weathering occurs even though hydrophobic substances remain. This is almost certainly associated wi. th degrade of wood structure and wooddeposit bond. Pine specimens were treated with alkylchlorosilanes and <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxides</b> and double treated with an epoxide and a resin-wax water repellent to study the performance of chemically bonded treatments. Both silane and epoxide treatments proved to be resistant to exposure. Silanes provide initial water repellency similar to that provided by resin-wax and are far more resistant to weathering. Loss of effectiveness of silane treatments is attributed to wood degrade enhanced by the effect of HC 1 produced in the reaction. Stabilization obtained by epoxides is extremely resistant to exposure. Reduced water absorption, due to OH-group blocking and cell-wall bulking, but no water repellency is shown by epoxy-treated wood. The full potential of water repellents applied to stabilized wood was not realized due to problems encountered in applying resinous solutions to epoxy treated wood...|$|R

SEM studies of these materials reveal an unusually wide spectrum of derivatives from the initial iron meteorite body, including minor amounts of unmelted metal fragments, and an abun-dance of more evolved products resulting from primary oxidation processes. Most of these products are sprays and splashes of liquid iron oxides, and some particles may be ascribed to <b>oxide</b> <b>condensates</b> from a vapor phase, as a result of both atmospheric ablation and vaporization upon impact.

40|$|Our {{laboratory}} {{has recently}} reported {{a series of}} rodcoil polymers for lithium batteries that display dimensionally stable films with good ionic conductivity. The rod segments consist of rigid linear and branched polyimides and the coil segments are polyethylene oxides (PEO). It has been proposed that good mechanical and transport properties are due to phase separation between the rod and coil segments. It was also observed that increased branching and molecular weight lead to increased conductivity. The following study was undertaken to assess the effects of phase separation in polyalkylene oxides connected by melamine linkages. Melamine {{was chosen as the}} linking unit because it provides a branching site, cation binding sites to help ionic transport between polymer chains, and the opportunity for self assembly through hydrogen bonding. Polymers were made by the reaction of cyanuric chloride with a series of amine-terminated <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxides.</b> A linear polymer was first made, followed by reaction of the third site on cyanuric chloride with varying ratios of monofunctional Jeffamine and (3 -aminopropyl) triethoxysilane. The lithium trifluoromethane sulfonamide-doped polymers are then crosslinked through a sol-gel process to form free-standing films. Initial results have shown mechanically strong films with lithium conductivities on the order of 2 x 10 (exp - 5) S/cm at ambient temperature. In a separate study, organically modified silanes (Ormosils) that contain sulfonic acid derivatized melamines have been incorporated into proton exchange membranes. The membranes are made by reaction of the primary amine groups of various ratios of melamine derivative and difunctional Jeffamine (MW = 2000) with the epoxide group of (3 -Glycidyloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane.

40|$|Abstract Background Resorbable bone {{hemostasis}} materials, oxidized {{regenerated cellulose}} (ORC) and microfibrillar collagen (MFC), {{remain at the}} site of application for up to 8 weeks and may impair osteogenesis. Our experimental study compared the effect of a water-soluble <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxide</b> copolymer (AOC) to ORC and MFC versus no hemostatic material on early bone healing. Methods Two circular 2. 7 mm non-critical defects were made in each tibia of 12 rabbits. Sufficient AOC, ORC or MFC was applied to achieve hemostasis, and effectiveness recorded. An autologous blood clot was applied to control defects. Rabbits were sacrificed at 17 days, tibiae excised and fixed. Bone healing was quantitatively measured by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) expressed as fractional bone volume, and qualitatively assessed by histological examination of decalcified sections. Results Hemostasis was immediate after application of MFC and AOC, after 1 - 2 minutes with ORC, and > 5 minutes for control. At 17 days post-surgery, micro-CT analysis showed near-complete healing in control and AOC groups, partial healing in the ORC group and minimal healing in the MFC group. Fractional bone volume was 8 fold greater in the control and AOC groups than in the MFC group (0. 42 &# 177; 0. 06, 0. 40 &# 177; 0. 03 vs 0. 05 &# 177; 0. 01, P < 0. 001) and over 1. 5 -fold greater than in the ORC group (0. 25 &# 177; 0. 03, P < 0. 05). By histology, MFC remained at the application site with minimal healing at the defect margins and early fibrotic tissue within the defect. ORC-treated defects showed partial healing but with early fibrotic tissue in the marrow space. Conversely, control and AOC-treated defects demonstrated newly formed woven bone rich in cellular activity with no evidence of AOC remaining at the application site. Conclusions Early healing appeared to be impaired by the presence of MFC and impeded by the presence of ORC. In contrast, AOC did not inhibit bone healing and suggest that AOC may be a better bone hemostatic material for procedures where bony fusion is critical and immediate hemostasis required...|$|R

The glass was vitrified by mixing the different waste streams with glass-forming chemicals in platinum/gold crucibles and heating the mixture to 1150 degree C.

40|$|Over {{the last}} couple of years, {{replacing}} of petroleum-based products by biodegradable and biorenewable plastics has been burgeoning interests in polymer science. Large portions of trash in landfills are mostly petroleum based polymer materials, such as plastic bags and bottles. The degradability of these petroleum based materials takes a very long time, like thousands of years. Polyglycolic acid (PGA) {{is one of the most}} known biodegradable polymer, which is traditionally synthesized through anionic polymerization of glycolide (mostly with tin ocatanoate catalyst). Despite this route has been the best option for having higher yields and molecular weights; the need to use very expensive glycolide monomer is the limitation for the larger scale production of PGA for industry. The main objective of this research is to find an alternative way to synthesize Polyglycolic acid (PGA) and its copolymers that derive from sustainable C 1 feedstocks, particularly formaldehyde and carbonmonoxide. The idea of the project consisted of the cationic alternating copolymerizations of trioxane (as a formaldehyde resource) and carbonmonoxide (CO) to produce PGA. This method constitutes cost-effective and efficient path for the synthesis of PGA from perfectly alternating copolymerizations of formaldehyde and CO. PGA was successfully synthesized up to 92 % of yield by using triflic acid (TfOH) catalyst under 800 psi CO pressure at 170 oC in three days. Although very high conversion was observed from the copolymerization, the number average molecular weights of the products exhibited oligomeric glycolic acid (GA) structures. Therefore, polycondensation of oligoGA was applied by Zn(OAc) 2. 2 H 2 O catalyst, and Mn was raised up to 700 KDa. The polymer from CO and H 2 CO is sufficiently similar to that prepared from glycolide that it can be readily substituted for the PGA prepared from glycolide. The products show nearly identical 13 C NMR spectra, free of acetal carbon signals, are observed for commercial PGA and the PGA from the C 1 feedstocks. To improve on the physical properties of PGA (such as melting temperature and appearance) terpolymerizations of trioxane, CO and a minor amount of epoxides were performed at the same reaction condition as PGA synthesis. By controlling the comonomer feed ratios and the polymerization temperatures, high quality PGA can be prepared. The method is extended to copolymers of PGA where <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxides</b> or cyclic ether comonomers are included into the polymerization mixture with the C 1 monomers to yield polyester-ether thermoplastics. The melting temperatures of all terpolymers are also lower, and the colors have become lighter than the commercial PGA. Polymer solubility increased by increasing length of the side chains of epoxides. One of the products has indicated similar thermal properties to isotactic polypropylene. The PGA based copolymers will not only replace existing petroleum based materials, but will do so with improved thermal characteristics. The needs of applying very high CO pressure and high temperature for the polymerization directed us to discover transition metal assisted copolymerization of formaldehyde and CO. There is a need to find new catalyst systems that exhibit higher activity to decrease polymerization time, temperature or CO pressure. Some of our efforts involved Co 2 (CO) 8 / 3 -hydroxypyridine catalyst system for this copolymerization, but this catalyst system seems to be not an effective catalyst for the copolymerization. After testing several catalyst systems, scandium triflate [Sc(OTf) 3] catalyst exhibited very good activity towards the cationic copolymerization of trioxane with carbonmonoxide (CO) for the production of PGA from up to 78 % of yield. Sc(OTf) 3 is an environmentally friendly catalyst and can be recycled from the reaction media. These present important advantages for a catalyst system, and polymerization will be a very convenient alternative way to produce PGA...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the relationship between non-invasive inflammatory markers (IM) in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), lung function indices and structural lung changes, visualized by high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans in CF. In 34 CF patients, lung function indices (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, forced vital capacity [FVC], residual volume, and total lung capacity [TLC]) and non-invasive IM (exhaled nitric <b>oxide,</b> and <b>condensate</b> acidity, nitrate, nitrite, 8 -isoprostane, hydrogen peroxide, interferon-gamma) were assessed. HRCT scans were scored in a standardized and validated way, a composite score and component scores were calculated. In general, the correlations between non-invasive IM and structural lung changes, and between IM and lung function were low (correlation coefficients < 0. 40). Patients with positive sputum Pseudomonas cultures had higher EBC nitrite levels and higher parenchymal HRCT subscores than patients with Pseudomonas-negative cultures (p < 0. 05). Multiple linear regression models demonstrated that FVC was significantly predicted by hydrogen peroxide in EBC, and the scores of bronchiectasis and mosaic perfusion (Pearson correlation coefficient R = 0. 78, p < 0. 001).

All the patients (n = 54) have undergone determination of the bronchial hypere activity level, nitrite level in respiratory condensate, relative number of eosinophiles of nasal secretion against the background of the anti-inflammatory basic therapy application adequate to the degree of bronchial asthma severity. the researchers have revealed that application of the anti-inflammatory basic therapy adequate to the degree of bronchial asthma severity led to achievement of the criteria for the control over bronchial asthma symptoms among the majority of patients already {{towards the end of the}} 12 t h week. Nevertheless, the accurate reduction of biomarkers of allergic inflammation was registered only in the end of the treatment period (24 weeks). Thus, the application of the anti-inflammatory basic therapy adequate to the degree of bronchial asthma severity is necessary within no less than 24 weeks. It helps to achieve the control over symptoms of the disease, as well as it is accompanied by the accurate reduction of biomarkers of atopic inflammation, and there? Fore, it leads to the activity reduction of the respiratory tract inflammation. Biomarkers may be used not only for the purpose to assess the inflammation of the respiratory passages, but also as a marker for the asthma therapy effectiveness, which can allow optimizing the bronchial asthma therapy among children.

40|$|Concentrated {{suspensions}} of detergent powder solids in {{a liquid}} nonionic surfactant are considered for practical application as liquid detergent products. If no precautions are taken, upon storage the viscosity of such suspensions increases and the pourability drops because the suspensions are colloidally unstable. It {{has been found}} that after the addition of a small amount of dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid (DoBS-acid or HDoBS) good pourability is maintained on storage. All the phenomena observed with such suspensions suggest that the addition of DoBS-acid reduces coagulation and improves colloidal stability. It was hypothesized that the colloidal stability obtained is of an electrostatic nature. In a liquid non-aqueous medium this is unexpected. A study of the mechanism of stabilization is described in this thesis. After a general introduction to the topic in Chapter 1, in Chapter 2 we discuss the character of the interactions which play a role in nonionic suspensions. The used nonionics are condensates of long chain alcohols and 3 to 9 <b>alkylene</b> <b>oxide</b> units. The dispersed solids are sodium salts as are usually present in current detergent powders, or oxides. They are aggregates or agglomerates of smaller crystalline primary particles and consist of irregular spheroids. The solids, the liquid nonionics and the anionic acid have been characterized with respect to a number of properties, including the molecular and crystalline structure, specific density, specific surface area, porosity, axial ratio and water content. The refractive indices and dielectric constants of the liquids and solids are also measured. Elemental analysis of the supernatants of our suspensions is carried out by Atomic Absorption, by Plasma Emission and by X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Since analysis of the supernatants indicated only very limited dissolution of the solids, it is concluded that the suspensions are lyophobic. It is demonstrated that, when DoBS- acid is added to a suspension of sodium salts in nonionic, it is converted quantitatively into anionic NaDoBS. Sedimentation rates, sediment volumes and viscosities are important physical characteristics of concentrated nonionic suspensions; they reflect the interactions between the suspended particles. The interactions follow the DLVO-theory, meaning that they are governed by the balance between attractive and repulsive or 'stabilizing' forces. The literature on van der Waals attraction (energy and forces) between particles in suspension is discussed in Chapter 3. It shows that for particles in the micron-size range, geometrical parameters (differences in particle size, interparticle distance), retardation and surface roughness are of more importance than in colloidal systems, having smaller particles. This means that the van der Waals bonding energy obtained on approach is larger, but, as a function of increasing interparticle distances, it decays more rapidly. In the van der Waals attraction, material properties are reflected in the Hamaker constant. Hamaker constants for the inorganic crystalline solids considered in this study are not available in the literature. Therefore it was necessary to evaluate them theoretically. Two approaches have been applied, a macroscopic theory and a microscopic theory. In a comparison they gave identical results within a few tens of percent. For the crystalline detergent solids the constants have been evaluated from their dielectric constants and refractive indices. The results showed the Hamaker constants for the detergent solids (except activated Zeolite 4 A) to exceed those of the nonionics, but to be lower than those of the metal oxides. The differences between the constants of crystalline detergent solids and those of nonionics are relatively small, implying that suspensions of detergent solid particles in nonionics can be made to relatively high volume fractions and can be stabilized easily. In Chapter 4 the electrostatic theory for interactions of particle pairs in suspension is evaluated for its applicability in non-aqueous media, using models of plates and spheres. For both models the conclusion is that, for the calculation of the repulsive energies and forces, approximated equations can be used. They result in repulsive energies, pressures and forces, which are in good agreement with those of exact computations at distances> 10 nm, but underestimate the repulsions at shorter distances. DLVO energy and force curves have been constructed and demonstrate the dependence of the repulsion on five parameters that govern the behaviour, viz. the dielectric constant, the ionic strength, the electric surface potential, the Hamaker constant and the particle size. For our suspensions with surface potentials ≥ 20 mV, significant repulsions already develop at distances between 2 and 40 nm. The theoretical repulsions are much higher than the van der Waals attractions and cause much larger repulsive barriers than those usually reported for non- polar, nonaqueous media. They are expected {{to play a role in}} the colloidal stabilization of nonionic suspensions and to influence the resistance against coagulation under pressures at the bottom of sediments. Secondary minima are only a few kT at most and coagulation is only expected at the protrusion points of contact and at relatively high ionic strengths. Ionic strengths in HDoBS-stabilized suspensions in the nonionics Plurafac LFRA 30 and Imbentin C 91 / 35 are evaluated from the conductivity in the supernatants and from their respective limiting molar conductivities. The methodology is described in Chapter 5. It was found that in both nonionics the limiting molar conductivity was lower than predicted from the values in water assuming Walden's rule applies. The results indicate that solvation interactions of Na +and DoBS -ions in nonionics are stronger than in water and stronger in Imbentin than in Plurafac. In Chapter 6 the results of the electric and dielectric measurements have been given. It is shown that the dielectric constant of nonionic is increased by HDoBS. Taking this increase into account, the ionic strengths found can be satisfactorily explained from theory. Only at high HDoBS concentration and relatively high dielectric constants are the ion concentrations lower than theoretically predicted, a feature that could be due to the formation of 'molecular associates'. From the limiting conductivities, at HDoBS concentrations between 10 and 150 mM, the ionic strengths have been found to range from 0. 05 to 4 mM in Plurafac and from 0. 08 to 30 mM in Imbentin. These results demonstrate a weak dissociation of the NaDoBS electrolyte. However, the ionic strengths obtained are considerably larger than those in supernatants of unstable suspensions and are higher than ever reported in the 'non-polar' hydrocarbon media, commonly considered in non-aqueous studies. Liquid nonionic media have a dielectric constant between 5 and 12 and are denoted 'low-polar'. At these ionic strengths, and considering the enhancement of the dielectric constant by HDoBS, in the HDoBS concentration regime between 0. 5 and 150 mM, Debye lengths range from 33 to I nm in Plurafac and from 13 to 1 nm in Imbentin, i. e. in the same range as in aqueous media. Electrokinetic (ζ-) potentials of particles of detergent solids suspended in nonionics, given in Chapter 6, are found to be a function of the HDoBS concentration. The surface potentials tend to level off at HDoBS concentrations as low as 0. 5 % w/w (15 mM dm - 3 ), to a maximum value ranging from + 25 to + 70 mV, depending on the nature of the solid and the nonionic liquid. Addition of water or of a crown-complexant (15 -Crown- 5), reduces the ζ-potential. The formation of positive surface charges can be explained from the dissociation of adsorbed HDoBS. Mechanical properties of concentrated non-aqueous suspensions are discussed in Chapter 7, including their relation to the electrostatic repulsion. Rheology is used to monitor the properties under dynamic conditions. The consistency, which quantifies the particle interactions and shear thinning index was derived from the Sisko model. Addition of HDoBS was found to have little or no influence on the high shear rate viscosity of nonionic suspensions. This viscosity is governed by hydrodynamic interactions, which are, in turn, determined by the viscosity of the nonionic phase, the volume fraction and the temperature. The nature of the solid also has an influence on the 'infinite shear' viscosity, probably due to variations in protrusion size, causing their effective volumes to be larger than the actual volume. Measurements of the intrinsic viscosity of sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) indicated that the particles of this substance are almost spherical. Low shear rate viscosities monitor effects of interparticle interactions. The consistency was found to be inversely proportional to the particle volume. Addition of HDoBS reduces the consistency. As with the ~-potentials, the main effect is already obtained from 0. 5 % w/w HDoBS. In this respect the behaviour of the viscosity is correlated with that of the ~-potential of the particles. It is further found that the drop in the 'normalized' consistency has a direct relation to the electrostatic force. These results support the conclusion that the nature of the obtained stabilization is electrostatic. The correlation of the viscosity with the Péclet number further supports this conclusion. It shows that under shear HDoBS-stabilized systems can be considered as hard-sphere suspensions. Creep compliance measurements of suspensions of STP in Plurafac at high volume fractions demonstrated that at low shear stresses the interactions are completely elastic. Under those conditions, relaxation of the stress leads to almost complete recovery. The shear moduli derived from creep compliance, drop less steeply as a function of the volume fraction than predicted from the electrostatic repulsive barrier. It is possible that this difference is a result of secondary minimum coagulation by the particle protrusions. In static sediments the volume fractions can be measured as a function of height by γ-ray absorption. Measurements of γ-ray absorption shows that the particle concentration from top to bottom in a stable sediment shows a concentration gradient. For HDoBS-stabilized suspensions this gradient is more continuous, whereas in unstable suspensions, due to coagulation, it is very irregular. From these results the relations between the static pressure or the network modulus and the volume fraction are derived. Pressures show an exponential relation with the interparticle distances. With low levels of DoBS-acid the interparticle distances are larger than for high concentrations of HDoBS. These results are in agreement with the dependency predicted by electrostatic repulsion, although the experimental pressure drop as a function of distance is much smoother than that theoretically predicted. The experimental network moduli derived from the pressure-volume fraction relation also drop much more slowly than theoretically predicted. This may again be a result of secondary minimum coagulation occurring by the protrusions. The overall conclusion is that the suspensions under consideration are electrostatically stabilized with DoBS-acid as the charge-determining electrolyte...|$|R
