Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: [...] "I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. I stopped <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature." [...] He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, [...] "for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again." ...|$|E
