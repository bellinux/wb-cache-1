40|$|The paper {{determines the}} effects of {{different}} influencing variables on the media company’s optimal subscription and advertising prices and editorial content. The company maximizes profit consisting of subscription and advertising revenue, minus the costs of content, advertising, and circulation, by setting the subscription and advertising prices {{and the amount of}} editorial content. <b>Subscription</b> <b>demand</b> {{is a function of the}} subscription price, the media’s editorial content, and advertising, and advertising demand a function of the advertising price and circulation. The condition for the circulation spiral to be finite is derived. It is shown that an increase in a variable or a parameter (e. g. circulation demand) causes the respective price to increase only if the demand for the other product (advertising) is elastic enough, the price declining if the other product’s demand is less elastic. Moreover, the increase leads to an increase in editorial content if advertising demand is elastic, and to a decrease in the advertising price. An increase in advertising demand leads to an increase in the advertising price if <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> is elastic enough, and to a decrease in the subscription price and editorial content. An increase in the marginal effect of editorial content on subscriptions leads to an increase in editorial content without affecting the prices...|$|R

40|$|Previous research, {{assuming}} linear pricing, {{has argued}} that telecommunications networks may use a high access charge {{as an instrument of}} collusion. I show that this conclusion is difficult to maintain when operators compete in nonlinear pricing: (i) As long as <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> is inelastic, profits can remain independent of the access charge, even when customers are heterogeneous and networks engage in second-degree price discrimination. (ii) When <b>demand</b> for <b>subscriptions</b> is elastic, networks may increase profits by agreeing on an access charge below marginal cost (relative to cost-based access pricing). Welfare is typically increased by setting the access charge above marginal cost. 1...|$|R

He and other Commissioners paid a preliminary visit to Aberdeen in early July 1638 where they were told politely but firmly by the town's magistrates and other leading citizens that they had no legal authority to exact the <b>subscriptions</b> <b>demanded.</b> The deputation returned in force on the 20th of that month headed by the Earl of Montrose, then an earnest Covenanter, with several notable Covenanting preachers with them. The latter were promptly refused the pulpits of the city churches. The University promptly denounced the Covenant as unlawful, and three of the leading preachers, Henderson, Dickson, and Cant, made a temporary retreat to the safety of Sir Thomas's Muchalls Castle.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} optimal {{sampling and}} pricing of paid content for publishers of news websites. Publishers offer free content samples both to disclose journalistic quality to consumers and to generate online advertising revenues. We examine sampling where the publisher sets {{the number of}} free sample articles and consumers select the articles of their choice. Consumerslearn from the free samples in a Bayesian fashion and base their subscription decisions on posterior quality expectations. We show thatsampling enhances <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> only if consumers have low quality expectations in relation to actual quality. Taking advertising and subscription revenues into account, {{we find that the}} publisher should employ either a paid-only or a free content strategy when consumers have high quality expectations. When consumers have low quality expectations, employing a sampling strategy may be optimal for the publisher...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} how access pricing affects network {{competition}} when <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> is elastic and each network uses non-linear prices and can apply termination-based price discrimination. In {{the case of}} a fixed per minute termination charge, we find that a reduction of the termination charge below cost has two oppos- ing effects: it softens competition but helps to internalize network externalities. The former reduces mobile penetration while the latter boosts it. We find that firms al- ways prefer termination charge below cost for either motive while the regulator prefers termination below cost only when this boosts penetration. Next, we consider the retail benchmarking approach (Jeon and Hurkens, 2008) that determines termination charges as a function of retail prices and show that this approach allows the regulator to increase penetration without distorting call volumes.

40|$|We re-examine the {{literature}} on mobile termination {{in the presence of}} network externalities. Externalities arise when firms discriminate between on and off-net calls or when <b>subscription</b> <b>demand</b> is elastic. This literature predicts that profit decreases and consumer surplus increases when termination charges increase. This is puzzling as in reality regulators are pushing termination rates down while being opposed to do so by network operators. This puzzle is resolved when consumers' expectations are assumed passive but required to be fulfilled in equilibrium, as defined by Katz and Shapiro (1985), instead of being responsive to non-equilibrium prices, as assumed until now. © 2013 Royal Economic Society.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of allocating fixed {{resources}} between two types of demands; (a) spot demand; and (b) package (<b>subscription)</b> <b>demand</b> [...] -demand that is satisfied by selling usage rights over a prespecified time period prior to actual consumption. In Model 1, a probabilistic spot demand for a single resource, stationary over time, is assumed together with externally determined spot and package pricing. It is shown that the optimal (profit maximizing) policy is to sell all the packages in the first period and the optimal number of packages to offer is derived. Model 1 is extended to the case when the package offers rights to any one of a number M of resources at a given time; similar conclusions are obtained. In Model 2, package price {{is considered to be a}} decision variable. It is shown that the optimal price should be monotonically nondecreasing over time, implying that the number of packages offered for sale each period will not increase over time. Finally, managerial uses of the proposed models for entertainment, leisure and tourist services are reviewed. marketing, marketing: pricing...|$|R
