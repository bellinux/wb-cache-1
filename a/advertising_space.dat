The following year, some supporters were displeased when further banners were added over the glass block-walled staircase towers {{on either side of}} the main stand leading up to the Club Deck; the banners were removed within a few months, with the club stating it was a marketing exercise to highlight the potential of the staircases as <b>advertising</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{candidate}} and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch)—whose campaign platform includes {{the elimination of}} funding for school arts programs—editorializes on television to rescind {{the budget of the}} school's production of West Side Story. She succeeds after an angry mother throws a brick at Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba). Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) recruits the members to sell <b>advertising</b> <b>space</b> in the program book to raise money; when Kurt (Chris Colfer) asks his father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) to purchase an ad, he instead gathers a group of businessmen to fund the musical.

5|$|Lehman Brothers sold One Times Square in 1997 to the Jamestown, L.P. for $117 million. Filings {{related to}} the sale {{revealed}} that the billboards on the tower had been generating a net revenue of $7 million yearly, representing a 300% profit. With growing tourism and high traffic in the Times Square area (with a yearly average of over 100 million pedestriansalongside its prominence in media coverage of New Year's festivities, seen by a wide audience yearly), annual revenue from the signs grew to over $23 million by the year 2012rivaling London's Piccadilly Circus as the most valuable public <b>advertising</b> <b>space</b> in the world.|$|E
5|$|Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) convinces Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) not {{to include}} a {{photograph}} of the glee club in the school yearbook, as in previous years, glee club photographs have been heavily defaced in the library copy of the yearbook by fellow students. Club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) personally buys a meager section of <b>advertising</b> <b>space</b> in the book so that a photograph featuring at least two members can be included. Fearing unpopularity, the club nominates Rachel (Lea Michele) to represent them in the photograph. Rachel convinces Finn (Cory Monteith) to appear alongside her, but after being teased by his peers, he drops out. When it transpires that the school photographer (John Ross Bowie) is soon to direct a commercial for his brother-in-law, a local mattress store owner, Rachel convinces him to cast the glee club in it, believing that local celebrity status will prevent the other students from mocking them.|$|E
5|$|The USPHS and {{cooperating}} groups {{created the}} plan for the recruitment of cadet nursing students. It was broad in scope to attract {{the maximum number of}} potential applicants in the shortest time. The primary target was the high school graduate but college girls were also recruited. The selling point of the program was that the cadets would obtain a free education in a proud profession and provide an essential service to their country. Appeals to join the Corps reached more than 7,000,000 newspaper and magazine readers, millions of radio listeners, and movie patrons around the country. Pleas were made in a thousand speeches, through 2,800,000 car-boards and billboards, and in several million leaflets. U.S. corporations donated $13,000,000 worth of <b>advertising</b> <b>space</b> and technical services to the program in one year. Few media sources lacked advertising for the Corps.|$|E

Subscribers are not shown advertisements, and receive benefits including {{the ability to see}} exclusive articles, post in certain areas of the Ars Technica forum, and participate in live chat rooms with notable people in the computer industry. To a lesser extent, revenue is also collected from content sponsorship. A series of articles about the future of collaboration was sponsored by IBM, and the site's Exploring Datacenters section is sponsored by data-management company NetApp. In the past, Ars Technica collected shared revenue from affiliate marketing by advertising deals and discounts from online retailers, and from the sale of Ars Technica-branded merchandise.|$|E
5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular <b>advertising</b> <b>space.</b> This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E

25|$|NBC play-by-play {{announcer}} Bob Costas {{believed that}} the fact that a large bulk of the regular season coverage ended up on cable (namely, ESPN) beginning in the 1990s was because CBS, when it took over the MLB the television rights from NBC in 1990, did not really want the Saturday Game of the Week. Many fans who did not appreciate CBS' approach to scheduling regular season baseball games {{believed that the}}y were only truly after the marquee events (namely, the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and the World Series) in order to sell <b>advertising</b> <b>space</b> (especially the fall entertainment television schedule).|$|E

25|$|Following the {{previous}} bike-sharing systems, {{the first next}} generation bike-sharing system, was introduced in 1991 in Farsø. Even {{though it was a}} small-scale scheme, it {{paved the way for the}} Copenhagen's ByCyklen programme, which was introduced in 1995 and was the first large-scale urban bike-sharing programme to feature specially designed bicycles with parts which could not be used on other bikes. To obtain a bicycle, riders paid a refundable deposit at one of 110 special locking bike stands, and the riders then had unlimited use of the bike within a specified 'city bike zone'. The fine for not returning a bicycle or leaving the bike-sharing zone exceeded US$150, and was strictly enforced by the police. Originally, the programme's founders hoped to completely finance the programme by selling <b>advertising</b> <b>space</b> on the bicycles, which was placed on the bike's frame and its solid disc-type wheels. This funding source quickly proved to be insufficient, and the city of Copenhagen took over the administration of the programme, funding most of the programme costs through appropriations from city revenues along with contributions from corporate donors. Since the City Bikes programme was free to the user, there is no return on the capital invested by the municipality, and a considerable amount of public funds was constantly used to keep the system in service, to enforce regulations, and to replace missing bikes. In 2013 a new version was expected to be introduced but the municipality of Copenhagen temporarily withdrew its support and there were no free bicycles for most of 2013. Copenhagen municipality changed its mind and a new version was introduced in late 2013.|$|E
25|$|The North West Corner, or North West terrace {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} still referred to as, despite now being all seated is the only major section of the stadium to remain uncovered (the other area is the Kop Corner). The original North West Terrace was built between 1919 and 1920 to adjoin both the North Stand and West Stand, but was demolished in early 1965 and replaced in mid 1966, {{in time for the}} 1966 World Cup. The terrace was not in use for two years, and seats were installed in 1991 along with the Leppings Lane terrace. The stand failed to gain a safety certificate for the 2007–08 season. In recent years it had only been used as overspill for away fans when both the upper and lower tiers of the West Stand have been filled, however in the 2011–12 season, with Wednesday needing to better or match the result of their neighbours to gain promotion {{on the final day of}} the season, the Corner was opened to visiting Wycombe Wanderers fans, with the West Stand used by home supporters. Whilst not being used for seating, the Corner has recently been used as extra <b>advertising</b> <b>space,</b> with advertising boards on the back wall, and more recently a large 'My Sheffield Jobs' seat covering appearing alongside their sponsorship of the North Stand. It is sponsored by Handley Brown. This corner is to be roofed, under the Hillsborough stadium Upgrade plans, yet no work has yet been done, due to owners of the nearby terraces complaining. This corner is commonly nicknamed the 'Crows Nest' by Wednesdayites.The corner is still unable to gain a safety certificate and remains unused by fans.

40|$|Although many may not {{be aware}} of it; the. {{technological}} capability currently exists to launch large, billboard-type advertisements into outer space. These ads could be as large as a full moon, and last for an almost infinite duration. Reaction to the possibility of <b>space</b> <b>advertising</b> has been generally negative, with many expressing concerns about the aesthetic effect of floating space billboards. One recent example of this is the proposal to launch a billboard containing the five-ring Olympic symbol in connection with Atlanta 2 ̆ 7 s hosting the 1996 Olympics, which was rejected by Mayor Maynard Jackson as 2 ̆ 2 environmental pollution. 2 ̆ 2 Despite the fact that <b>space</b> <b>advertising</b> is a very real possibility for the near future, the legal framework under which regulation of that advertising would be analyzed is unsettled. A bill which would ban all <b>space</b> <b>advertising</b> was introduced in Congress, but was never acted upon. Comparing a ban on <b>space</b> <b>advertising</b> to other regulations of commercial speech, the Authors analyze whether the proposed ban would withstand constitutional scrutiny under the commercial speech doctrine. They begin by tracing the development of the doctrine and examining the lesser position of commercial speech within the First Amendment hierarchy of protection. They then consider an application of the commercial speech doctrine to a ban on <b>space</b> <b>advertising.</b> Given that <b>space</b> might serve as a platform for other types of speech as well, the Authors examine how a ban on noncommercial speech in space might fare under constitutional scrutiny. Finally, they offer their respective conclusions, which range from qualified to absolute endorsement of restrictions on <b>space</b> <b>advertising...</b>|$|R
