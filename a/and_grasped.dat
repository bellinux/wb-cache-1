It found itself with an odd selection of obsolete, new, and experimental aircraft, <b>and</b> <b>grasped</b> for immediate solutions. To try and coordinate this effort, a task force was established by Lt. General James Ferguson, then Deputy Chief of Staff for Research and Development. Dubbed Operation Shed Light, it began on 7 February 1966 as a means of coordinating a wide variety of technological and other projects and programs that were being pursued in order to improve the United States Air Force’s night fighting capabilities. Outlined in the Task Force’s charter as of April were the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|Altruism {{is central}} to the teachings of Jesus found in the Gospel, {{especially}} in the Sermon on the Mount and the Sermon on the Plain. From biblical to medieval Christian traditions, tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of [...] "disinterested love", as in the Pauline phrase [...] "love seeks not its own interests." [...] In his book Indoctrination and Self-deception, Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated <b>and</b> <b>grasped</b> not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the battles}} with Villa, Obregón had {{his right arm}} blown off. The blast nearly killed him, and he {{attempted}} to put himself out of his misery and fired his pistol to accomplish that. [...] The aide de camp who had cleaned his gun had neglected to put bullets in the weapon. In a wry story he told about himself, he joined {{in the search for}} his missing arm. [...] "I was helping them myself, because it's not so easy to abandon such a necessary thing as an arm." [...] The searchers had no luck. A comrade reached into his pocket and raised a gold coin. Obregón concluded the story, saying [...] "And then everyone saw a miracle: the arm came forth from who knows where, and come skipping up to where the gold azteca [...] was elevated; it reached up <b>and</b> <b>grasped</b> it in its fingers--lovingly--That {{was the only way to}} get my lost arm to appear." [...] The arm was subsequently embalmed and then put in the monument to Obregón on the site of where he was assassinated in 1928. Obregón always wore clothing tailored to show that he had lost his arm in battle, a visible sign of his sacrifice to Mexico.|$|E

40|$|The Dual Visuomotor Channel Theory {{proposes that}} manual {{prehension}} {{consists of two}} temporally integrated movements, each subserved by distinct visuomotor pathways in occipitoparietofrontal cortex. The Reach is mediated by a dorsomedial pathway and transports the hand {{in relation to the}} target’s extrinsic properties (i. e., location <b>and</b> orientation). The <b>Grasp</b> is mediated by a dorsolateral pathway and opens, preshapes, and closes the hand in relation to the target’s intrinsic properties (i. e., size and shape). Here, neuropsychological, developmental, and comparative evidence is reviewed to show that the Reach <b>and</b> the <b>Grasp</b> have different evolutionary origins. First, the removal or degradation of vision causes prehension to decompose into its constituent Reach <b>and</b> <b>Grasp</b> components, which are then executed in sequence or isolation. Similar decomposition occurs in optic ataxic patients following cortical injury to the Reach <b>and</b> <b>Grasp</b> pathways <b>and</b> after corticospinal tract lesions in non-human primates. Second, early nonvisual PreReach and PreGrasp movements develop into mature Reach <b>and</b> <b>Grasp</b> movements but are only integrated under visual control after a prolonged developmental period. Third, comparative studies reveal many similarities between stepping movements and the Reach and between food handling movements <b>and</b> the <b>Grasp,</b> suggesting that the Reach <b>and</b> <b>Grasp</b> are derived from different evolutionary antecedents. The evidence is discussed in relation to the ideas that dual visuomotor channels in primate parietofrontal cortex emerged as a result of distinct evolutionary origins for the Reach and Grasp; that foveated vision in primates serves to integrate the Reach <b>and</b> <b>Grasp</b> into a single prehensile act; and, that flexible recombination of discrete Reach <b>and</b> <b>Grasp</b> movements under various forms of sensory and cognitive control can produce adaptive behavior...|$|R

40|$|Background: Robot-assisted {{rehabilitation}} is {{a rehabilitation}} technique that uses new technologies {{from the field}} of haptic interfaces and virtual environments. It provides repetitive training and also new and interesting tasks in computer-generated virtual environments. Measurements of forces and positions acquired during the tasks allow quantitative assessment of neuro-motor state of the patients and their progress. Methods: This paper presents the HEnRiE device (Haptic environment for reaching <b>and</b> <b>grasping</b> exercises), which is primarily intended for use in robot-aided neurorehabilitation and for training of reaching, <b>grasping</b> <b>and</b> transporting virtual objects in haptic environments. The system combines haptic interface <b>and</b> module for <b>grasping</b> mounted on top of the haptic interface. With the module for grasping subjects can <b>grasp</b> <b>and</b> manipulate virtual objects. This allows combined training of upper extremity movements <b>and</b> <b>grasping.</b> Two tasks that combine upper extremity movements <b>and</b> <b>grasping</b> are presented: a pick and place task, and a winded tube. Results: The paper presents preliminary results acquired in healthy subjects for two tasks. The results we obtained with our device were compared to similar experiments from literature associated with studies of reaching <b>and</b> <b>grasping.</b> During the pick and place task, results show that healthy subjects adopt same principles for reaching <b>and</b> <b>grasping</b> in virtual environments as in real situations. During the winded tube task the haptic feedback is used to ensure that the user applies a sufficiently large force which must not be lower than reference grasp force to successfully complete the task. Conclusions: The HEnRiE device allows combined therapy for upper extremities <b>and</b> <b>grasp</b> therapy. With the use of graphic and haptic visual environments a high level of reality is achieved, which is beneficial for the motivation of the users...|$|R

40|$|Prehension {{movements}} of the right hand were recorded in a right-handed man (AC), with an injury to the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and with {{a section of the}} left half of the splenium. The kinematic analysis of AC’s grasping movements in direct and perturbed con- ditions was compared to that of Wve control subjects. A novel eVect in prehension was revealed—a hemispace eVect—in healthy controls only. Movements to the left hemispace were faster, longer, and with a smaller grasp aperture; perturbation of both object position and distance resulted in the attenuation of the direction eVect on movement time and the time to velocity peak, with a reverse pattern in the time to maximum grip aperture. Nevertheless, the correlation between transport velocity amplitude <b>and</b> <b>grasp</b> aperture remained stable in both perturbed and non-perturbed movements, reXecting the coordination between reaching <b>and</b> <b>grasping</b> in control subjects. In contrast, transport <b>and</b> <b>grasp,</b> as well as their coordination in both direct and perturbed conditions, were negatively aVected by the PPC and sple- nium lesion in AC, suggesting that transport <b>and</b> <b>grasp</b> rely on two functionally identiWable subsystems...|$|R
