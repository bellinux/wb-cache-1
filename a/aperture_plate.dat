50|$|By 1929, most {{movie studios}} had revamped this format {{using their own}} house <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> size to try to {{recreate}} the older screen ratio of 1.33:1. Furthermore, every theater chain had their own house <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> size in which the picture was projected. These sizes often did not match up even between theaters and studios owned by the same company, and therefore, uneven projection practices occurred.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} better hide {{so-called}} [...] "negative assembly" [...] splices, {{the ratio of the}} image was later changed by others to 2.39:1 and, finally, to 2.40:1. All professional cameras are capable of shooting 2.55:1 (special 'Scope <b>aperture</b> <b>plate)</b> or 2.66:1 (standard [...] "Full"/"Silent" [...] <b>aperture</b> <b>plate,</b> preferred by many producers and all optical houses), and 2.35:1 or 2.39:1 or 2.40:1 is simply a hard-matted version of the others.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A new, direct CCD {{acquisition}} and autoguiding camera is in {{use on the}} ANU 2 · 3 m telescope Nasmyth foci. The camera is a model AP 7 manufactured by Apogee Instruments Inc. and {{is controlled by the}} MaxIm CCD camera control and image processing software developed by Diffraction Ltd. The factors influencing our choice of this new camera are discussed, and its performance, operation, and commercial control software are described. The new camera allows stellar objects as faint as B = 21 · 5 to be acquired on the Double Beam Spectrograph slit in 1 · 4 ′′ seeing. The camera has far superior performance to the Fairchild intensified CCD cameras that it replaces. The improved {{acquisition and}} guiding permitted by this camera has already allowed several new scientific programs to begin on the telescope, including the use of <b>aperture</b> <b>plates</b> with the Double Beam Spectrograph...|$|R
5000|$|Following this, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) {{considered}} further alterations to this 1930 standard. Various dimensions were submitted, and {{the projector}} <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> opening size of 0.825 in × 0.600 in was agreed upon. The resulting 1.375:1 aspect ratio was then dubbed the [...] "Academy Ratio". On May 9, 1932, the SMPE adopted the same [...] projector aperture standard.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{research}} on optimal flange focal distance settings, {{it is currently}} considered better for flange focal distance to be set to somewhere within the film's emulsion layer, {{rather than on the}} surface of it. Therefore, the nominal flange focal depth will be equivalent to the distance to the groundglass, whereas the actual flange focal depth to the <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> will in fact be ~0.02 mm less.|$|E
50|$|At the theater, release {{prints are}} {{projected}} through an <b>aperture</b> <b>plate,</b> placed between {{the film and}} the projector's light source. The <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> in combination with a prime lens of the appropriate focal distance determines which areas of the frame are magnified and projected and which are masked out, according to the aspect ratio in which the film {{is intended to be}} projected. Sometimes a hard matte is used in printing to ensure that only the area of the frame shot in the camera that is intended to be projected is actually present on the release print. Some theaters have also used aperture plates that mask away part of the frame area that is supposed to be projected, usually where the screen is too small to accommodate a wider ratio and does not have a masking system in front of the screen itself. The audience may be confused when significant action appears on the masked-off edges of the picture. Director Brad Bird expressed frustration at this practice, which some theaters applied to his film The Incredibleshttp://sfist.com/2005/04/27/sfiff_brad_birds_state_of_cinema_address.php.|$|E
40|$|An ion {{tracking}} system utilizing a single detector {{was designed to}} resolve two dimensional potential distributions in a vacuum. The ion detector consisted of a continuous dynode electron multiplier tube mounted behind a series of <b>aperture</b> <b>plates.</b> The detector was located on a track below a wedge shaped structure used to produce the desired potential distribution. A 150 volt electron beam aimed at selected regions, ionized the residual gas in the chamber. The ions were ejected from their source points by electrostatic forces causing them to drift downward toward the detector. Measurements of particle energy, detector position, and entry angle of the incoming particle flux were used to initialize a computer trajectory-tracing program. The program assumes a known theoretically calculated potential distribution near the wedge for computation of particle trajectories, providing a basis for evaluating the data. Special attention was given to characterization of the ion detector...|$|R
50|$|This {{production}} {{is one of}} a select few general release American films (including Night of the Living Dead) that were not composed for widescreen despite being released after the widescreen transition of the early to mid 1950s. The new Guy Roe-shot sequences were composed for the Academy ratio just like the Japanese footage, and the ending credits were blocked much too tightly for any amount of matting to be possible without causing lines of text to trail off the screen. Since 80% of downtown theaters and 69% of neighborhood theaters had already converted to widescreen by the end of 1953, and since theaters that made the transition would not have had the Academy ratio <b>aperture</b> <b>plates</b> anymore, it is very likely that many people saw the film in a matted widescreen ratio such as 1.85:1, which had become the non-anamorphic industry standard by September 1956.|$|R
40|$|A {{collimator}} is disclosed {{for examining}} the spatial location of distant sources of radiation and for imaging by projection, small, near sources of radiation. The collimator {{consists of a}} plurality of plates, {{all of which are}} pierced with an identical random array of <b>apertures.</b> The <b>plates</b> are mounted perpendicular to a common axis, with like <b>apertures</b> on consecutive <b>plates</b> axially aligned so as to form radiation channels parallel to the common axis. For near sources, the collimator is interposed between the source and a radiation detector and is translated perpendicular to the common axis so as to project radiation traveling parallel to the common axis incident to the detector. For far sources the collimator is scanned by rotating it in elevation and azimuth with a detector to determine the angular distribution of the radiation from the source...|$|R
5000|$|Masked (or flat) {{widescreen}} {{was introduced}} in April 1953. The negative is shot exposing the Academy ratio using spherical lenses, but {{the top and bottom}} of the picture are hidden or masked off by a metal <b>aperture</b> <b>plate,</b> cut to specifications of the theater's screen, in the projector. Alternatively, a hard matte in the printing or shooting stages may be used to mask off those areas while filming for composition purposes, but an <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> is still used to block off the appropriate areas in the theater. A detriment is that the film grain size is thus increased because only part of the image is being expanded to full height. Films are designed to be shown in cinemas in masked widescreen format but the full unmasked frame is sometimes used for television. In such an instance, a photographer will compose for widescreen, but [...] "protect" [...] the full image from things such as microphones and other filming equipment. Standardized [...] "flat wide screen" [...] ratios are 1.66:1, 1.75:1, 1.85:1, and 2:1. 1.85:1 has become the predominant aspect ratio for the format.|$|E
50|$|Use of a {{paraboloidal}} collimator, {{has produced}} 2 arc sec image quality with minimal astigmatism along the central 2-3 arc min. A 2 deg. magnesium fluoride (MgF2) objective prism mounted {{forward of the}} <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> is used to disperse the converging beam from the telescope: with the 1216 Å image focused onto the primary aperture, other wavelengths are excluded from the spectrograph producing a very low level of scattered light on the detector.|$|E
50|$|As a response, Paramount Pictures devised {{their own}} system the {{following}} month to augment their 3-D process known as Paravision. This process utilized a screen size that yielded an aspect ratio of 5 units wide by 3 units high, or 1.66:1. By using a different sized <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> and wider lens, a normal Academy ratio film could be soft matted to {{this or any other}} aspect ratio. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that all of their productions would be shot in this ratio.|$|E

5000|$|In April 1953, a {{technique}} simply {{now known as}} [...] "wide-screen" [...] appeared and was soon adopted as a standard by all [...] "flat" [...] film productions in the US. In this process, a fully exposed 1.37:1 Academy ratio-area is cropped in the projector to a wide-screen aspect ratio {{by the use of}} an <b>aperture</b> <b>plate,</b> also known as a soft matte. Most films shot today use this technique, cropping {{the top and bottom of}} a 1.37:1 image to produce one at a ratio of 1.85:1.|$|E
50|$|The {{spectrograph}} uses {{a replica}} of a prototype grating for the Hubble Space Telescope STIS. For a 5 arc sec aperture width, the measured resolution in the last flight was 0.055 Å FWHM. A camera is included to re-image the focal plane onto a separate detector, providing {{an image of the}} telescope field of view minus the light which passes through the spectrograph aperture. The Venus image on the <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> will be sufficiently dispersed by the objective prism that the Ly α image will be clearly separated from the longer wavelength continuum and emissions.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, in [...] "masked widescreen" [...] {{an image}} with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 {{is created by}} using a standard, 1.37:1 frame and matting out {{the top and bottom}}. If the image is matted during the filming process it is called a hard matte due to its sharp edge. In contrast, if the full frame is filled during filming and the projectionist is relied upon to matte out the top and bottom in the theater, it is {{referred}} to as a soft matte, as the <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> is not on the focal plane and causes a soft edge.|$|E

40|$|Theories which {{describe}} currents {{collected by}} conducting and non-conducting bodies immersed in plasmas {{have many of}} their concepts based upon the fundamentals of sheath-potential distributions and charged-particle behavior in superimposed electric and magnetic fields. Those current-collecting bodies (or electrodes) may be Langmuir probes, electric field detectors, <b>aperture</b> <b>plates</b> on ion mass spectrometers and retarding potential analyzers, or spacecraft and their rigid and tethered appendages. Often the models are incomplete in representing {{the conditions under which}} the current-voltage characteristics of the electrode and its system are to be measured. In such cases, the experimenter must carefully take into account magnetic field effects and particle anisotropies, perturbations caused by the current collection process itself and contamination on electrode surfaces, the complexities of non-Maxwellian plasma distributions, and the temporal variability of the local plasma density, temperature, composition and fields. This set of variables is by no means all-inclusive, but it represents a collection of circumstances guaranteed to accompany experiments involving energetic particle beams, plasma discharges, chemical releases, wave injection and various events of controlled and uncontrolled spacecraft charging. Here, an attempt is made to synopsize these diagnostic challenges and frame them within a perspective that focuses on the physics under investigation and the requirements on the parameters to be measured. Examples include laboratory and spaceborne applications, with specific interest in dynamic and unstable plasma environments...|$|R

50|$|Max Otto Miller was an American film {{producer}} and {{inventor of the}} Miller Stereoscopic Process. It was an early 3-D process of making and projecting pictures, using a conventional camera lens with a concave spherical lens attached to increase field without increasing object distance. It included a special design for the <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> and projection of the picture through a double convexed spherical lens of lesser focal length. The method used 35 mm film printed single strip anaglyphic. It was used on films including the 1925 silent western The Ship of Souls. Miller also produced the 1924 film A Pair of Hellions. His son was director and photographer Max B. Miller.|$|E
50|$|Looking for {{a similar}} alternative, other major studios hit upon a simpler, less {{expensive}} solution by April 1953: using a removable <b>aperture</b> <b>plate</b> in the film projector gate, {{the top and bottom}} of the frame could be cropped to create a wider aspect ratio. Paramount Studios began this trend with their aspect ratio of 1.66:1, first used in Shane, which was originally shot for Academy ratio. It was Universal Studios, however, with their May release of Thunder Bay that introduced the now standard 1.85:1 format to American audiences and brought attention to the industry the capability and low cost of equipping theaters for this transition.|$|E
