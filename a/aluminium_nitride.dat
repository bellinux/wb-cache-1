2500|$|In general, {{ultraviolet}} detectors {{use either}} a solid-state device, {{such as one}} based on silicon carbide or <b>aluminium</b> <b>nitride,</b> or a gas-filled tube as the sensing element. UV detectors that are sensitive to UV {{in any part of}} the spectrum respond to irradiation by sunlight and artificial light. A burning hydrogen flame, for instance, radiates strongly in the 185- to 260-nanometer range and only very weakly in the IR region, whereas a coal fire emits very weakly in the UV band yet very strongly at IR wavelengths; thus, a fire detector that operates using both UV and IR detectors is more reliable than one with a UV detector alone. Virtually all fires emit some radiation in the UVC band, whereas the Sun's radiation at this band is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. The result is that the UV detector is [...] "solar blind", meaning it will not cause an alarm in response to radiation from the Sun, so it can easily be used both indoors and outdoors.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a process-structure-property relationship study of laser welds {{as a continuous}} consolidation method for joining thin monophased steel foils, thereby providing a more effective, less costly method to construct automotive catalytic converters. A body centred cubic (bcc) iron-chromium-aluminium alloy doped with Mischmetal was utilised in this study. Both pulsed and continuous wave modes were used to establish the limit welding diagrams for lap joint configuration. Actual laser welding parameters were selected using several testing conditions. The laser welds behaved substantially different from the base material under creep and high temperature oxidation. The difference was mainly attributed to the changes in grain morphology, precipitation of <b>aluminium</b> <b>nitrides</b> and carbides, and relocalisation of the reactive elements during liquid metal flow upon keyhole formation, solidification and cooling...|$|R
