To implement these long filters on real-time DSP processors, conventional overlap save technique suffers from more computational power as well as processing delay. To overcome these technical problems, mixed uniform partitioned convolution technique is proposed. This method is derived by combining uniform partitioned convolution with mixed filtering technique. With the proposed method, it is possible to perform <b>audio</b> <b>crosstalk</b> cancellation even at the order of ten thousand filter taps with less computations and short processing delay.

40|$|In general, {{frequency}} domain based techniques are preferred to time domain techniques {{for the implementation}} of <b>audio</b> <b>crosstalk</b> cancellation due to time domain techniques suffer from more computations. In this paper, the computational difficulty of real FFT on DSP processors is analyzed and to overcome the disadvantages, two optimization methods (1. Parallel Filtering, 2. Mixed Filtering) are proposed {{for the implementation of}} <b>Audio</b> <b>Crosstalk</b> cancellation. These methods are developed based on fast convolution using overlap save method & Finding DFTs of two real sequences using single Complex DFT. By applying these properties to two real outputs of stereo crosstalk cancellation structure, valid equations are derived for implementation. The proposed methods are simulated in real-time on 32 bit floating point processor. The results show that the proposed methods can significantly reduce the computational complexity when compared to conventional time domain convolution & {{frequency domain}} based individual filtering without affecting the performance...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a speech activity detection system using an HMM-based segmenter for automatic speech recognition on individual headset microphones in multispeaker meetings. We look at cross-channel features (energy and correlation based) to incorporate into the segmenter for the purpose of addressing errors related to cross-channel phenomena such as crosstalk. Results demonstrate that these features provide a marked improvement (18 % relative) over a baseline system using single-channel features as well as an improvement (8 % relative) over our previous solution of separate speech activity detection and cross-channel analysis. In addition, the simple cross-channel energy features are shown to be more robust—and consequently better performing— than the more common correlation-based features.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{refers to}} a process for the reduction of frequency crosstalk during the transmission of digitized <b>audio</b> signals. Frequency <b>crosstalk</b> is always expected if the input signal is divided into subbands in concatenated stages. In the process according to the invention, signals from subbands in which spectral components of specific frequencies occur {{in the form of}} signal components and signals from subbands in which the spectral components occur in the form of crosstalk components in the rejection band, are subjected to a weighted sum formation. After transmission, the subband signals are subjected to an operation which is opposite to the weighted sum formation. The process operates independent of the selected coding process and is therefore universally applicable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To {{reproduce}} {{high fidelity}} audio sound and spatial reverberation characteristics, it is desired {{to use the}} long filter coefficients in audio surround systems. To implement these long filters, the existing frequency domain based techniques such as overlap save method, multi-rate running convolution suffer from more computational complexity. Apart from computational complexity, algorithm delay is another important factor {{that needs to be}} reduced in the real time implementation of these systems. In this paper, mixed single frequency delay line filtering technique was proposed to optimize these factors in multichannel <b>audio</b> <b>crosstalk</b> cancellation and showed analytically how the computations are reduced for different multichannel cases. The ability of proposed method is that it provides less computational complexity even at the impulse response lengths of more than 100 msec duration. Unlike in existing methods, algorithm delay depends only on processing frame size instead of filter length so that it provides short processing delay. The proposed technique was implemented on 32 -bit floating point DSP processor and efficient design is provided to achieve processor level optimization and less implementation complexity. The computational comparison of this method with conventional methods shows that the proposed technique is very efficient for long filter...|$|E
