When this space is not needed <b>able-bodied</b> <b>passengers</b> may make use of the three wall-mounted fold-down seats. The toilet has a wide door and grab bars for use by disabled passengers.|$|R
40|$|Airline {{competition}} with customer service as product differentiator has forced down costs, air fares and investor returns. Two passenger markets operate in aviation: (1) <b>able-bodied</b> <b>passengers</b> for whom airlines openly compete and (2) passengers with reduced mobility (PRMs) – disabled by age, obesity or medical problems – for whom airlines do not compete. Government {{interference in the}} market intended to protect a minority of narrowly-defined PRMs has had unintended consequences of enabling increasing numbers of more widely-defined PRMs to access complimentary airline provisions. With growing ageing and overweight populations and long-haul travelling medical tourists such regulation could lead to even lower investors’ returns. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) (2013) examined the air transport value chain for competitiveness using Porter’s (2008) five forces but did not distinguish between <b>able-bodied</b> <b>passengers</b> and PRMs. Findings during an investigation of these two markets concurred with IATA-Porter that the markets for the bargaining powers of PRM customers and PRM suppliers were ‘highly competitive’. However, {{in contrast to the}} IATA conclusions the threats posed by new entrants, substitute products and intensity of competition for PRM passengers were all ‘low’. The conclusion is that airlines are strategically PRM defensive by omission. Paradoxically, the airline which delivers the best PRM customer service could become the least profitable...|$|R
50|$|High {{platforms}} do {{have significant}} advantages beyond wheelchair accessibility (except for double-decker trains). Mobility-impaired passengers (e.g. those using canes {{or who have}} difficulties climbing stairs) also benefit, as do travelers pulling wheeled luggage or small folding shopping carts. Even fully <b>able-bodied</b> <b>passengers</b> can board a railcar more rapidly {{if they do not}} have to climb stairs to enter, reducing dwell time at a stop, and reducing overall travel time. In addition, high-platform railcars have more floor space for passengers if space is not required for stairways, and wheelwells needed to accommodate railcar bogies.|$|R
50|$|While another widely stated {{benefit of}} low floor buses is quicker {{boarding}} for <b>able-bodied</b> <b>passengers</b> {{due to the}} lack of steps, studies have found the opposite effect in the UK. This is apparently due to the prevailing system of operation where passengers enter and exit through one single front door. It has been suggested that the previous 1980s/90s high floor step entrance buses which featured a centre rail, encouraged a bi-directional flow of entering and exiting passengers simultaneously. The removal of the pole to allow wheelchair/buggy access created the situation where the quintessentially polite British bus passenger would wait for all passengers to alight before boarding, leading to an increase in dwell times.|$|R
50|$|Wheelchair taxicabs {{are most}} often {{specially}} modified vans or minivans. Wheelchair-using passengers are loaded, {{with the help of}} the driver, via a lift or, more commonly, a ramp, at the rear of the vehicle. This feature is however a subject for concern amongst Licensing Authorities who feel that the wheelchair passenger could not easily exit the vehicle in the event of accident damage to the rear door. The latest generation of accessible taxis features side loading with emergency egress possible from either of the 2 side doors as well as the rear. The wheelchair is secured using various systems, commonly including some type of belt and clip combination, or wheel locks. Some wheelchair taxicabs are capable of transporting only one wheelchair-using passenger at a time, and can usually accommodate 4 to 6 additional <b>able-bodied</b> <b>passengers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Originally only {{available}} on the Volvo B12B chassis, the Levante enabled both <b>able-bodied</b> and wheelchair <b>passengers</b> to enter the vehicle via the front door, {{using a combination of}} a front-mounted lift and two single pedestal-mounted seats in place of the traditional double at the front nearside of the passenger area.|$|R
6000|$|On Sunday morning, September 16, 1798, the Hamburg packet {{set sail}} from Yarmouth; and I, {{for the first}} time in my life, beheld my native land {{retiring}} from me. At the moment of its disappearance--in all the kirks, churches, chapels, and meeting-houses, in which the greater number, I hope, of my countrymen were at that time assembled, I will dare question whether there was one more ardent prayer offered up to heaven, than that which I then preferred for my country. [...] "Now then," [...] (said I to a gentleman who was standing near me,) [...] "we are out of our country." [...] "Not yet, not yet!" [...] he replied, and pointed to the sea; [...] "This, too, is a Briton's country." [...] This bon mot gave a fillip to my spirits, I rose and looked round on my fellow-passengers, who were all on the deck. We were eighteen in number, videlicet, five Englishmen, an English lady, a French gentleman and his servant, an Hanoverian and his servant, a Prussian, a Swede, two Danes, and a Mulatto boy, a German tailor and his wife, (the smallest couple I ever beheld,) and a Jew. We were all on the deck; but in a short time I observed marks of dismay. The lady retired to the cabin in some confusion, and many of the faces round me assumed a very doleful and frog-coloured appearance; and within an hour the number of those on deck was lessened by one half. I was giddy, but not sick, and the giddiness soon went away, but left a feverishness and want of appetite, which I attributed, in great measure, to the saeva Mephitis of the bilge- water; and it was certainly not decreased by the exportations from the cabin. However, I was well enough to join the <b>able-bodied</b> <b>passengers,</b> one of whom observed not inaptly, that Momus might have discovered an easier way to see a man's inside, than by placing a window in his breast. He needed only have taken a saltwater trip in a packet-boat.|$|R
500|$|Arctic was {{the largest}} and most celebrated of the four Collins steamers that had {{operated}} a regular transatlantic passenger and mail carrying service since 1850. After the collision Arctics captain, James Luce, first attempted to assist the stricken Vesta, which he believed was in imminent danger of sinking. When he discovered that his own ship had been seriously holed below the waterline, he decided to run her towards the nearest land, in the hopes of reaching safety. His plan failed; the engines stopped when the ship was still far from land. Arctics lifeboat capacity was sufficient for less than half of those on board; when Luce ordered these launched, a breakdown in order and discipline meant that most places in the boats were taken by members of the crew or the more <b>able-bodied</b> male <b>passengers.</b> The rest struggled to build makeshift rafts, but most were unable to leave the ship, and went down with her when she sank, four hours after the collision. [...] Vesta, which initially appeared to have sustained mortal damage, was kept afloat by her watertight bulkheads, and managed to limp into harbor at St. John's, Newfoundland.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an original {{concept of an}} urban transport system based on a hybrid vehicle that can move as an electric vehicle driven by a man or as special PodCar vehicle (Rights of Way a; b or c). The system was developed at the Warsaw University of Technology and will be {{hereinafter referred to as}} HVTSUA system (Hybrid Vehicle and Transit System for Urban Application). The vehicle in the proposed urban transport system is designed for both <b>able-bodied</b> drivers and <b>passengers,</b> as well as persons with reduced mobility caused by broadly understood age-related diseases or civilization diseases (e. g. victims of accidents, multiple sclerosis, etc.). In this context, an original concept of design and HMI (Human Machine Interface) standardization was presented for this type of vehicle. The concept of HVTSUA builds on the work initiated within the framework of “Eco-Mobility” project co-financed by the European Union. HVTSUA integrates the PodCar system developed there with “Eco-Car” system. The integration of these two elements and equipping them with new technology became the basis for a system with new quality...|$|R
