5|$|The venom of {{the black}} mamba is {{extremely}} toxic. Its bites can deliver about 100–120mg of venom on average and the maximum dose recorded is 400mg. It is reported that before <b>antivenom</b> was widely available, the mortality rate from a bite was nearly 100%. The bite of a black mamba can potentially cause collapse in humans within 45 minutes, or less. Without effective <b>antivenom</b> therapy, death typically occurs in 7–15 hours. Presently, there is a polyvalent <b>antivenom</b> produced by the South African Institute for Medical Research to treat black mamba bites from many localities, and a new <b>antivenom</b> is currently being developed by the Universidad de Costa Rica's Instituto Clodomiro Picado.|$|E
5|$|Redback <b>antivenom</b> was {{developed}} by Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, then a government body involved with discovering antivenoms for many venomous Australian creatures. Production involves the milking of venom from redbacks and repeatedly inoculating horses with non-lethal doses. The horse immune systems makes polyclonal antibodies. Blood plasma, containing the antibodies, is extracted by plasmapheresis. The plasma is treated with pepsin, and the active F(ab')2 fragments are separated and purified. Each vial contains 500 units of redback <b>antivenom</b> in approximately 1.5 ml, which is enough to inactivate 5mg of redback spider venom in a test tube. The <b>antivenom</b> has been safely administered to women {{in various stages of}} pregnancy. Redback <b>antivenom</b> has been widely used in Australia since 1956, although evidence from controlled studies for its effectiveness has been lacking. Recent trials show <b>antivenom</b> has a low response rate little better than placebo, and any effect is less than might be achieved with optimal use of standard analgesics. Further studies are needed to confirm or refute its effectiveness. It appears clinically active against arachnidism caused by Steatoda spiders; however, as these cases are often mild and the evidence of its effectiveness is limited, this treatment is not recommended. Similarly, the <b>antivenom</b> has been reported as effective with bites of L. katipo, and L. tredecimguttatus. Animal studies also support its use against envenomation from other widow spiders, having successfully been tested against venom from L. mactans, L. hesperus, and L. tredecimguttatus (synonym L.lugubris).|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{assessment}} is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local pain, or systemic symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics {{may be necessary}} to relieve pain. <b>Antivenom</b> has been historically given for adults suffering severe local pain or systemic symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or systemic pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or excessive sweating (diaphoresis). A significant proportion of bites will not result in envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2–20% of bite victims have been treated with <b>antivenom.</b> In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six were treated with the <b>antivenom.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Antivenoms</b> for {{therapeutic}} use are often preserved as freeze-dried ampoules, {{but some are}} available only in liquid form and must be kept refrigerated. They are not immediately inactivated by heat, however, so a minor gap in the cold chain is not disastrous. The majority of <b>antivenoms</b> (including all snake <b>antivenoms)</b> are administered intravenously; however, stonefish and redback spider <b>antivenoms</b> are given intramuscularly. The intramuscular route has been questioned in some situations as not uniformly effective.|$|R

40|$|Animal-derived <b>antivenoms</b> {{constitute}} the mainstay in the therapy of snakebite envenoming. The efficacy of <b>antivenoms</b> to neutralize toxicity of medically-relevant snake venoms {{has to be}} demonstrated through meticulous preclinical testing before their introduction into the clinical setting. The gold standard in the preclinical assessment and quality control of <b>antivenoms</b> is the neutralization of venom-induced lethality. In addition, depending on the pathophysiological profile of snake venoms, the neutralization of other toxic activities has to be evaluated, such as hemorrhagic, myotoxic, edema-forming, dermonecrotic, in vitro coagulant, and defibrinogenating effects. There {{is a need to}} develop laboratory assays to evaluate neutralization of other relevant venom activities. The concept of the 3 Rs (Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement) in Toxinology is of utmost importance, and some advances have been performed in their implementation. A significant leap forward {{in the study of the}} immunological reactivity of <b>antivenoms</b> against venoms has been the development of “antivenomics”, which brings the analytical power of mass spectrometry to the evaluation of <b>antivenoms.</b> International partnerships are required to assess the preclinical efficacy of <b>antivenoms</b> against snake venoms in different regions of the world in order to have a detailed knowledge on the neutralizing profile of these immunotherapeutics...|$|R
5|$|Studies {{support the}} safety of <b>antivenom,</b> with around a 5% chance of an acute reaction, 1–2% of {{anaphylaxis}} and 10% chance of a delayed reaction due to serum sickness. Nevertheless, {{it is recommended that}} an injection of adrenaline be ready and available in case it is needed to treat a severe anaphylactic reaction, and also that the <b>antivenom</b> from the vial be administered diluted in a 100 ml bag of intravenous solution for infusion over 30 minutes. While it is rare that patients report symptoms of envenomation lasting weeks or months following a bite, there are case reports from the 1990s in which <b>antivenom</b> was reported to be effective in the relief of chronic symptoms when administered weeks or months after a bite, however, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, it is administered within 24 hours.|$|E

5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple analgesia does not resolve local pain or clinical features of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, Redback <b>antivenom</b> can be given. Redback <b>antivenom</b> can also cross-neutralise katipo venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from Latrodectus katipo in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. <b>Antivenom</b> will usually relieve symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated in anyone suffering symptoms consistent with Latrodectus envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it is not limited to patients with signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using <b>antivenom</b> are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast some doubt on antivenoms efficacy in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as parenteral opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on the ability of <b>antivenoms,</b> produced in Brazil and Costa Rica, to neutralize lethal, hemorrhagic and coagulant activities of the venoms of 16 species of Central and South American snakes of the subfamily Crotalinae. Neutralization of lethality was studied by two different methods routinely used in the quality control of <b>antivenoms</b> at Instituto Butantan (IB) and Instituto Clodomiro Picado (ICP). Both <b>antivenoms</b> neutralized the majority of the venoms studied, but the values of effective doses 50 % (ED 50) differed markedly depending on the method used. In general, higher potencies were obtained with the method of ICP, where a challenge dose corresponding to 4 LD 50 s is used, than with the method of IB, where a challenge dose of 5 LD 50 s is employed. All venoms induced hemorrhagic activity in the mouse skin test, which was effectively neutralized by the two <b>antivenoms.</b> All venoms, except those of Porthidium nasutum and Bothriechis lateralis, induced coagulation of human plasma in vitro and both <b>antivenoms</b> were effective in the neutralization of this activity. In conclusion, our results provide evidence of an extensive cross reactivity between these <b>antivenoms</b> and Central and South American crotaline snake venoms.

40|$|Snakebite envenoming {{causes a}} heavy toll in sub-Saharan Africa {{in terms of}} {{mortality}} and sequelae. In the West African savannah, the viperid Echis ocellatus {{is responsible for the}} vast majority of bites. In the last decades, several new <b>antivenoms</b> have been introduced for the treatment of these envenomings, although the assessment of their preclinical efficacy against the venom of E. ocellatus has been studied only for some of them. This work analyzed comparatively the ability of four <b>antivenoms</b> (FAV Afrique, EchiTAb G, EchiTAB-Plus-ICP (R), and Inoserp (TM) Panafricain) to neutralize lethal, hemorrhagic, and in vitro coagulant activities of the venoms of E. ocellatus from Mali, Cameroon, and Nigeria. In addition, an immunoaffinity chromatography antivenomic protocol was used to assess the ability of the four <b>antivenoms</b> to bind to the proteins of these venoms. Results showed that all the <b>antivenoms</b> were effective in the neutralization of the three effects investigated, and were able to immunocapture, completely or partially, the most abundant components in the E. ocellatus venoms from the geographical origins sampled. Our observations also highlighted quantitative differences between <b>antivenoms</b> in their neutralizing and antivenomics profiles, especially regarding neutralization of in vitro coagulant activity, suggesting that different doses of these <b>antivenoms</b> are probably needed for an effective treatment of human envenomings by this species...|$|R
40|$|Species of {{the genus}} Bothrops induce the vast {{majority}} of snakebite envenomings in Latin America. A preclinical study was performed {{in the context of a}} regional network of public laboratories involved in the production, quality control and development of <b>antivenoms</b> in Latin America. The ability of seven polyspecific <b>antivenoms,</b> produced in Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Costa Rica, to neutralize lethal, hemorrhagic, coagulant, defibrinogenating and myotoxic activities of the venoms of Bothrops neuwiedi (diporus) (Argentina), Bothrops jararaca (Brazil), B. neuwiedi (mattogrossensis) (Bolivia), Bothrops atrox (Peru and Colombia) and Bothrops asper (Costa Rica) was assessed using standard laboratory tests. Despite differences in the venom mixtures used in the immunization of animals for the production of these <b>antivenoms,</b> a pattern of extensive cross-neutralization was observed between these <b>antivenoms</b> and all the venoms tested, with quantitative differences in the values of effective doses. This study reveals the capacity of these <b>antivenoms</b> to neutralize, in preclinical tests, homologous and heterologous Bothrops venoms in Central and South America, and also highlight quantitative differences in the values of Median Effective Doses (ED 50 s) between the various <b>antivenoms.</b> Programa Iberoamericano de Ciencia y Tecnología para el Desarrollo/ 206 AC 0281 /CYTED/EspañaUniversidad de Costa Rica/[741 -A 9 - 003]/UCR/Costa RicaFundação Butantan///BrasilUCR::Investigación::Unidades de Investigación::Ciencias de la Salud::Instituto Clodomiro Picado (ICP...|$|R

5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need <b>antivenom.</b> Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require <b>antivenom,</b> which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and abdominal wall rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E
5|$|A katipo bite {{produces}} the toxic syndrome latrodectism; symptoms include extreme pain and, potentially, hypertension, seizure, or coma. Bites are rare, an <b>antivenom</b> is available, and no deaths {{have been reported}} since 1901.

40|$|<b>Antivenoms</b> are {{preparations}} of intact or fragmented (F(ab') 2 or Fab) immunoglobulin G (IgG) used {{in human}} medicine {{to treat the}} severe envenomings resulting from the bites and stings of various animals, such as snakes, spiders, scorpions, or marine animals, or from the contact with poisonous plants. They are obtained by fractionating plasma collected from immunized horses or, less frequently, sheep. Manufacturing processes usually include pepsin digestion at acid pH, papain digestion, ammonium sulphate precipitation, caprylic acid precipitation, heat coagulation and/or chromatography. Most production processes do not have deliberately introduced viral inactivation or removal treatments, but <b>antivenoms</b> have never been found to transmit viruses to humans. Nevertheless, the recent examples of zoonotic diseases highlight the need to perform a careful assessment of the viral safety of <b>antivenoms.</b> This paper reviews the characteristics of equine viruses of <b>antivenoms</b> and discusses the potential of some manufacturing steps to avoid risks of viral contamination. Analysis of production parameters indicate that acid pH treatments and caprylic acid precipitations, which have been validated for the manufacture of some human IgG products, appear {{to provide the best}} potential for viral inactivation of <b>antivenoms.</b> As many manufacturers of <b>antivenoms</b> located in developing countries lack the resources to conduct formal viral validation studies, it is hoped that this review will help in the scientific understanding of the viral safety factors of <b>antivenoms,</b> in the controlled implementation of the manufacturing steps with expected impact on viral safety, and in the overall reinforcement of good manufacturing practices of these essential therapeutic products.

5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of <b>antivenom</b> is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific <b>antivenom</b> have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of <b>antivenom</b> places the patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E

Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases.

5|$|The redback spider {{has been}} {{historically}} {{responsible for more}} envenomations requiring <b>antivenom</b> than any other creature in Australia, however by 2017 the spider was blamed for only 250 envenomations requiring <b>antivenom</b> annually. Estimates {{of the number of}} people thought to be bitten by redback spiders each year across Australia range from 2,000 to 10,000. The larger female spider is responsible for almost all cases of redback spider bites. The smaller male was thought to be unable to envenomate a human, although some cases have been reported; their rarity is probably due to the male's smaller size and proportionally smaller fangs, rather than the male being incapable of biting or lacking potent venom. The bite from both juvenile and mature females appears to have similar potency. The male bite usually only produces short-lived, mild pain. Most bites occur in the warmer months between December and April, in the afternoon or evening. As the female redback is slow-moving and rarely leaves her web, bites generally occur as a result of placing a hand or other body part too close to the spider, such as when reaching into dark holes or wall cavities. Bites often also occur when a hidden spider is disturbed in items such as clothes, shoes, gloves, building materials, garden tools or children's outdoor toys.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antivenom</b> is {{injected}} into the person intravenously, and works by binding to and neutralizing venom enzymes. It cannot undo damage already caused by venom, so <b>antivenom</b> treatment should be sought as soon as possible. Modern antivenoms are usually polyvalent, making them effective against the venom of numerous snake species. Pharmaceutical companies which produce <b>antivenom</b> target their products against the species native to a particular area. Although some people may develop serious adverse reactions to <b>antivenom,</b> such as anaphylaxis, in emergency situations this is usually treatable and hence the benefit outweighs the potential consequences of not using <b>antivenom.</b> Giving adrenaline (epinephrine) to prevent adverse effect to <b>antivenom</b> before they occur might be reasonable where they occur commonly.

Transient bilateral ptosis was attributed to envenoming. The venom of the snake responsible for the bite was immunologically distinct from that of Nigerian E. ocellatus and was clearly not neutralised by the three monospecific <b>antivenoms</b> which had been administered. This case is another illustration of the geographical variation in snake venoms {{and the need for}} pooling venoms from snakes from different parts of the geographical range in the preparation of <b>antivenoms.</b> Envenoming by North African Echis species may not be reversible by available <b>antivenoms...</b>|$|R

In September 2012, it was reported that stocks of <b>antivenom</b> were running low, and members of the public were asked to catch the spiders so that they could be milked for their venom. One dose of <b>antivenom</b> requires around 70 milkings from a spider.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the advent}} of <b>antivenom,</b> bites from some species of snake were almost universally fatal. Despite huge {{advances}} in emergency therapy, <b>antivenom</b> is often still the only effective treatment for envenomation. The first <b>antivenom</b> was developed in 1895 by French physician Albert Calmette {{for the treatment of}} Indian cobra bites. <b>Antivenom</b> is made by injecting a small amount of venom into an animal (usually a horse or sheep) to initiate an immune system response. The resulting antibodies are then harvested from the animal's blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} for a snakebite is as variable as the bite itself. The most common and effective method is through <b>antivenom</b> (or antivenin), a serum made from the venom of the snake. Some <b>antivenom</b> is species-specific (monovalent) while some is made for use with multiple species in mind (polyvalent). In the United States for example, all species of venomous snakes are pit vipers, {{with the exception of}} the coral snake. To produce <b>antivenom,</b> a mixture of the venoms of the different species of rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted from the immunized horse. The serum is separated and further purified and freeze-dried. It is reconstituted with sterile water and becomes <b>antivenom.</b> For this reason, people who are allergic to horses are more likely to suffer an allergic reaction to <b>antivenom.</b> <b>Antivenom</b> for the more dangerous species (such as mambas, taipans, and cobras) is made in a similar manner in India, South Africa, and Australia, although these antivenoms are species-specific.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of <b>antivenoms,</b> which were long deemed ineffective, dangerous {{and difficult to}} use, has improved dramatically These antibodies (immunoglobulin G) are now fragmented, purified and controlled for their quality leading to significantly better safety and facilitating their emergency use. Envenomation can result in various syndromes depending on the snake species: Viperidae venoms are highly inflammatory, hemorrhagic and necrotising, while Elapidae venoms can cause fatal respiratory paralysis. However, some Viperidae venoms can lead to asphyxiation similar to that observed in Elapidae envenomation while, conversely, Elapidae bites may be complicated by hemorrhage or necrosis, thus complicating etiologic diagnosis. Symptomatic treatment is complex, often insufficient, and frequently associated with adverse events. In contrast, <b>antivenoms</b> neutralize the venom and accelerate its clearance, thus providing an etiological treatment for envenomation, particularly in remote healthcare facilities in developing countries. Current formulations consist of polyvalent <b>antivenoms</b> covering most of the venomous species present in a specific region.
