Allaire's early compound engines were of the annular type, with a smaller, high-pressure cylinder placed in the centre of a larger, ring-shaped low-pressure cylinder. Trunk engines were another type of annular engine. A third type of annular marine engine which was sometimes produced utilized the Siamese engine connecting mechanism, but instead of two separate cylinders, had a single <b>annular-shaped</b> cylinder wrapped around the vertical arm of the crosshead (see diagram under [...] "Siamese" [...] above).|$|E
50|$|In the {{gyrotron}} a {{hot filament}} in an electron gun {{at one end}} of the tube emits an <b>annular-shaped</b> (hollow tubular) beam of electrons, which is accelerated by a high-voltage anode and then travels through a large tubular resonant cavity structure in a strong axial magnetic field, usually created by a superconducting magnet around the tube. The field causes the electrons to move helically in tight circles around the magnetic field lines as they travel lengthwise through the tube. At the position in the tube where the magnetic field reaches its maximum the electrons radiate electromagnetic waves in a transverse direction (perpendicular to the axis of the tube) at their cyclotron resonance frequency. The millimeter radiation forms standing waves in the tube, which acts as an open-ended resonant cavity, and is formed into a beam, which radiates through a window in the side of the tube into a waveguide. The spent electron beam is absorbed by a collector electrode at the end of the tube.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the liquid}} medium of a dye laser can fit any shape, {{there are a}} {{multitude}} of different configurations that can be used. A Fabry-Pérot laser cavity is usually used for flashtube pumped lasers, which consists of two mirrors, which may be flat or curved, mounted {{parallel to each other}} with the laser medium in between. The dye cell is often a thin tube approximately equal in length to the flashtube, with both windows and an inlet/outlet for the liquid on each end. The dye cell is usually side-pumped, with one or more flashtubes running parallel to the dye cell in a reflector cavity. The reflector cavity is often water cooled, to prevent thermal shock in the dye caused by the large amounts of near-infrared radiation which the flashtube produces. Axial pumped lasers have a hollow, <b>annular-shaped</b> flashtube that surrounds the dye cell, which has lower inductance for a shorter flash, and improved transfer efficiency. Coaxial pumped lasers have an annular dye cell that surrounds the flashtube, for even better transfer efficiency, but have a lower gain due to diffraction losses. Flash pumped lasers can be used only for pulsed output applications.|$|E

40|$|Preparation of field-ion {{specimens}} {{from various}} materials {{has been accomplished}} using focused ion-beam milling in either a simple cutting mode or by application of an <b>annular-shaped</b> ion-milling pattern. These specimens have been investigated using field-ion microscopy and three-dimensional atom probe analysis. In the cutting mode, gallium implantation is minimised when using a lower beam energy. However, with annular milling, using 30 keV ions opposed to 10 keV ions results in less gallium implantation and produces a smaller shank angle and a sharper apex radius. High-dose ion imaging at 30 keV ion energy, even with relatively low beam currents, results in excessive implantation during held-ion specimen fabrication. Focused ion-beam milling provides not only an alternative method of field-ion sample preparation, but also, in conjunction with atom probe analysis, allows the quantitative investigation of the gallium implantation and damage which occurs during the milling.

40|$|III-nitride {{nanowire}} lasers {{have drawn}} significant attention as potential compact coherent light sources {{for a wide}} range of applications such as on-chip communication, optical sensing, and solid-state lighting. For practical applications, control over the lasing properties is needed. For example, a single mode lasing is beneficial for reducing the pulse broadening and the signal errors during the optical communications. An <b>annular-shaped</b> beam could be potentially used for the atom trapping or the stimulated emission depletion spectroscopy. The polarization-sensitive on-chip optical components also require linear polarization. However, due to the compact size of nanowire lasers and the cross-sectional symmetry of the traditional nanowire lasers, controlling the lasing properties still remains challenging. A top-down two-step etch process developed for vertical GaN nanowires offers the ability to precisely control the cross-section of the nanowire lasers. Consequently, the lasing properties can potentially be tailored by controlling the cross-section. In this dissertation, <b>annular-shaped</b> emission was demonstrated from GaN nanotube lasers with optical pumping at room temperature, consistent with finite-difference time-domain simulation results. Linearly polarized lasing emission was also realized from rectangular cross-sectioned GaN nanowire lasers. When the shorter y-dimension is ~ 120 nm, the rectangular cross-section creates a large contrast of the effective index of refraction, resulting in higher transverse confinement factors for the y-polarized modes than for the x-polarized modes. In order to pursue electrically injected single III-nitride nanowire lasers, non-polar InGaN/GaN multi-quantum-wells core-shell nanowires were fabricated by a combination of the top-down two-step etch process and a regrowth process. Lasing was observed from the core-shell nanowires by optical pumping at room temperature. A Hakki-Paoli measurement shows high modal gains of the non-polar core-shell nanowire lasers and the non-uniform gains resulting from the inhomogeneous regrowth. As a step towards electrical pumping, a Ti “ohmic like” contact to the n-GaN core was fabricated. However, because of the lack of the ohmic contact to the p-GaN shell, the injection efficiency was extremely limited. As a result, instead of electrically-driven lasing, only weak spontaneous emission was observed in the electroluminescence measurement.

40|$|Native Octopus vulgaris {{hemocyanin}} (Hc) {{reacts with}} cyanide stepwise. The first step involves {{the formation of}} a complex HcCN with O 2 displacement. This complex reacts further with cyanide causing the removal of one copper ion from the active site. The same reaction sequence occurs for the extraction of the second metal ion. The formation of the HcCN complex and the removal of the first and the second copper ion can be differentiated according to the KCN concentration. The rate of metal removal is slightly affected by KCN concentration. The kinetics are dominated by site-site interactions.

40|$|Many {{cartilaginous}} tissues such as {{intervertebral disc}} (IVD) display a heterogeneous collagen microstructure {{that results in}} mechanical anisotropy. These structures are responsible for mechanical function of the tissue and regulate cellular interactions and metabolic responses of cells embedded within these tissues. Using collagen gels seeded with ovine annulus fibrosus cells, constructs of varying structure and heterogeneity were created to mimic the circumferential alignment of the IVD.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that protein adsorption constitutes {{the first step}} of the mechanism leading to biofilm formation, which is a precursor of the biofouling. Biofouling is a major problem for any activity in seawater. In order to improve our basic knowledge of the biofilm formation mechanism, the role of salts, dissolved in natural seawater, on protein adsorption on a stainless steel surface have been investigated. Different aqueous solutions were used. They contained different salt mixtures and concentrations (NaCl alone, NaCl + MgCl 2, NaCl + CaCl 2 and artificial seawater), while keeping the total salt concentration the same as in natural seawater (36 g l(- 1)). A protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), was also added to the saline solutions at 20 mg l- 1 concentration. Stainless-steel samples were immersed into the different aqueous solutions for 24 h. After rinsing in demineralized water and drying, the surface of these samples was analysed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The ToF-SIMS spectra showed an influence of the salts contained in the solutions on the protein adsorption. The role of CaCl 2 seemed to be unfavourable whereas MgCl 2 was rather favourable for BSA adsorption. The ToF-SIMS molecular mappings showed that all the salts dissolved in water produced micrometre particles at the sample surfaces. These particles mainly constituted Na+, Mg+ or Ca+. Because there was no space correlation with any counter-ions (Cl-, SO 4 -, OH-, etc.), these particles were not salt residues. Moreover, these particles were found to be the preferential adsorption sites for the proteins.

The effective deuteron energy was 0. 448 MeV. For the 2. 05 MeV level, the l- 2 correlation between the protons and the!. 40 MeV gamma tran-sition to the first excited state was measured simultaneously with the 1 - 3 correlation between the same proton energy group and the 0. 65 MeV gamma transition, with the intermediate 1. 40 MeV gamma radiation unobserved. These correlations were measured in two configurations: one with the protons being detected at an average angle of 170 ° with the beam passing through a centre hole in an <b>annular-shaped</b> detector, and the other with a disc-shaped etector at 135 ° and the gamma detector moving in the plane of the reaction. A plane-wave analysis of these data gave essentially identical correlation coefficients for these two configurations. Directional correlations were also measured in the 170 ° configuration between the proton energy groups and the subsequent ground-state gamma transitions from the 1. 31, 1. 06, 0. 99 and 0. 65 MeV levels. A plane-wave analysis of these data is compared with a distorted-wave analysis of related data from a previous experiment. A thorough computational comparison between all of these data and the predicted correlations, based on a plane-wave analysis using postulated spin values which are consistent with the proton angular distribution data, did not yield a unique spin value for any of these levels.

Results: One year postoperatively, the following changes have been noted: in group-A, average uncorrected distance visual acuity changed from 20 / 63 to 20 / 40. A mean hyperopic refractive increase of + 0. 75 D was achieved. There was some mild reduction in the epithelial thickness. In group-B, average uncorrected distance visual acuity changed from 20 / 70 to 20 / 50. A mean hyperopic refractive increase of + 0. 85 D was achieved. Epithelial thickness returned to slightly reduced levels (compared to baseline) in group-A, whereas to slightly increased levels in group-B. Conclusion: We introduce herein the novel {{application of}} a topographically-customizable collagen crosslinking to achieve a hyperopic refractive effect. This novel technique may be applied either with epithelial removal, offering a more stable result or with a non-ablative and non-incisional approach, offering a minimally invasive alternative.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of six parts in which methods for image analysis and processing are studied. Two-dimensional medical images, image sequences, and three-dimensional image volumes are considered. In the first part, {{the concept of}} optical flows (OF) is employed for restoring the contracting/expanding ventricle motion in ultrasonic echocardiograms. Radial velocities obtained by a scalar approach are summed up to time series representing the motion in different sectors of a circular region in the image. In part two, dynamic programming (DP) is used for matching closed deformable contours to the inner boundary of an <b>annular-shaped,</b> bright object in simulated speckle images. Adjustment of method parameters, scale and resolution aspects, search strategies, and spatio-temporal behavior is considered. Application examples consisting of echocardiographic sequences are also given. Part three presents an image enhancement method based on lowpass pyramid decomposition and modified reconstruction. By retaining only the pixels corresponding to detected edges at each reconstruction stage, edge-preserving noise suppression can be obtained. The method is applied to simulated speckle images, to an ultrasonic image from phantom measurements, and to an echocardiographic image. In part four, the algorithm from part three is reformulated to use morphological operations for smoothing before downsampling, reconstruction, and edge detection. Enhancement of speckle image is evaluated. Part five {{is concerned with the}} registration of abdominal slices from CT and SPECT using Compton scatter images as a basis for determination of the patient boundary. Contour estimation is performed by interactive thresholding and an automatic deformable boundary technique. In part six, closed boundary finding in medical 3 -D image sets is carried out by optimizing Fourier surfaces of gradually increasing order. Algorithmic performance is evaluated for simulated images based on the anthropomorphic Zubal phantom, and various noise levels. Application examples are given for SPECT images acquired from Monte Carlo simulatations and patient measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} 19 F(d, p[gamma]) 20 F {{was used}} to measure the directional correlations of the proton groups in coincidence with subsequent gamma radiations produced in de-excitation of the 2. 05, 1. 31, 1. 06, 0. 99 and 0. 65 MeV levels of 20 F. The effective deutron energy was 0. 448 Mev. For the 2. 05 MeV level, the 1 - 2 correlation between the protons and the 1. 40 MeV gamma transition to the first excited state was measured simultaneously with the 1 - 3 correlation between the same proton energy group and the 0. 65 MeV gamma transition, with the intermediate 1. 40 MeV gamma radiation unobserved. These correlations were measured in two configurations: one with the protons being detected at an average angle of 170 [deg] with the beam passing through a centre hole in an <b>annular-shaped</b> detector, and the other with a disc-shaped detector at 135 [deg] and the gamma detector moving in the plane of the reaction. A plane-wave analysis of these data gave essentially identical correlation coefficients for these two configurations. Directional correlations were also measured in the 170 [deg] configuration between the proton energy groups and the subsequent ground-state gamma transitions from the 1. 31, 1. 06, 0. 99 and 0. 65 and 0. 65 MeV levels. A plane-wave analysis of these data is compared with a distorted-wave analysis of related data from a previous experiment. A thorough computational comparison between all of these data and the predicted correlations, based on a plane-wave analysis using postulated spin values which are consistent with the proton angular distribution data, did not yield a unique spin value for any of these levels. It was possible in some cases, however, to put rather stringent conditions on the ratios of the angular-momentum matrix elements associated with the incoming and outgoing radiations which are compatible with the postulated spins...|$|E
