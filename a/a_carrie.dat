Sony Music Nashville chairman/CEO Gary Overton said that the singer [...] "took nearly a year to compile and record the songs."

The songwriters then {{came up with the}} first verse of the song: [...] "Dry lighting cracks across the skies / Those storm clouds gather in her eyes / Her daddy was a mean old mister / Momma was an angel in the ground / The weatherman called for a twister / She prayed blow it down." [...] Kear commented that it was not the duo's intent or goal to make it a dark, revenge-themed song.

60|$|Leland did not know. He {{had merely}} {{heard that there}} was <b>a</b> <b>Carrie</b> Denham; but as he looked down across the moat he was {{conscious}} of a sudden interest in the girl. She stood {{with one hand on}} the back of a basket-chair, her long white dress flowing in easy lines about her tall and shapely figure. So far as he could see it, her face beneath the big white hat was attractive, too; but it was her pose that vaguely impressed him. There was a suggestion of strength and pride in it that was by no means noticeable in the case of either her father or Jimmy Denham. The appearance of the man with whom she talked was, however, much less pleasing. He was inclined to be portly, his face was coarsely fleshy, with the distinctive stamp of the city on him. He looked out of place in that quaint old pleasance on the desolate border side. He reminded Leland forcibly of the caricatures he had seen of Hebrew usurers.|$|E

50|$|All records giving White's date {{of birth}} as November 18, 1874 date to after her {{hospital}} stay, and as such her {{date of birth}} is unconfirmed. A Census record exists for <b>a</b> <b>Carrie</b> Joyner born in Florida in 1873; {{if this were the}} same Carrie White she would have been 117 when she died, rather than 116. The Social Security Administration found evidence of <b>a</b> <b>Carrie</b> Joyner born in August 1888 to John and Sallie Joyner, based on mentions in newspapers of her having a sibling named Marie Harden (a Marie Joyner Harden had parents named John and Sallie and a sibling named Carrie). Researcher Heiner Maier suggests that this is a more likely match for the Carrie White who died in 1991; if so, she would have been 102 when she died. In this case Florida State Hospital may have simply made up the 1874 date, and later records replicated the error. However, the lack of information on White's early life means that her true date of birth cannot be confirmed unequivocally.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, a {{television}} film based on King's novel and starring Angela Bettis in the titular role was released. The film updated {{the events of}} the story to modern-day settings and technology while simultaneously attempting to be more faithful to the book's original structure, storyline, and specific events. However, the ending was drastically changed: instead of killing her mother and then herself, the film has Carrie killing her mother, being revived via CPR by Sue Snell and being driven to Florida to hide. This new ending marked a complete divergence from the novel and was a signal that the film served as a pilot for <b>a</b> <b>Carrie</b> television series, which never materialized. In the new ending, the rescued Carrie vows to help others with similar gifts to her own. Although Bettis' portrayal of Carrie was highly praised, the film was cited by most critics as inferior to the original.|$|E
50|$|The {{town had}} descended into {{lawlessness}} {{with a number}} of saloons, brothels, dancing halls, and widespread gambling. The town had no law enforcement officers, and the local government officials had become bar keepers. Governor West had extended prohibition laws, but they were widely ignored in Copperfield. Some local residents had appealed to the state government for assistance. Over half the residents of the town had signed a petition, addressed to West, alleging that saloons owned by the mayor and City Council members were selling liquor to minors and staying open later than their posted hours. Governor West responded by ordering county officials to restore order, close the saloons, and force the resignations of the corrupt city leaders by December 25, 1913. Armed? Well, yes; I am. I have a dressing bag, a portfolio and an umbrella. I don't believe I could do much damage with these. Do I look like <b>a</b> <b>Carrie</b> Nationto you? Fern Hobbs responding to the question of if she was armed en route to Copperfield County officials did not take care of the problem, so West sent Hobbs, hoping the presence of a woman would prevent any outbreak of violence. She was dispatched with orders to restore order and to implement martial law if necessary. While Hobbs was traveling to Eastern Oregon, both she and Governor West were coy with reporters about the presence of the militia, suggesting that Hobbs might be acting alone.|$|E

The reboot {{is as good}} <b>a</b> <b>Carrie</b> remake as possible, though it's not truly a scary movie; the film takes its time living up to its R rating." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle also gave the film a favorable review, remarking: [...] "In a way, the new Carrie is almost too easy to enjoy. Everything discordant and all the nagging weirdness and strange feelings surrounding the original have been smoothed down, and what we're left with is a well-made, highly satisfying and not particularly deep high school revenge movie." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film a positive review, stating: [...] "The acting's strong; in addition to Moretz and Moore, Judy Greer is a welcome presence in the Betty Buckley role of the sympathetic gym instructor. But something's missing from this well-made venture. What's {{there is more than}} respectable, while staying this side of surprising." [...] Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave it three out of five stars, saying, [...] "With the exception of some appearances by social media, 'Carrie' doesn't try to hip up King's basic, often slow story. And while De Palma's version is fondly recalled as a high-blood-mark of the 1970s, this new take seems to linger a bit more on the bugaboos of overparenting and bullying while underplaying Mama's fanaticism. Peirce only glancingly lets her heroine have a mild discovery-of-powers moment that feels 'X-Men'-ish." [...] In a positive review on Roger Ebert's website, Matt Zoller Seitz awarded the film three out of four stars, praising the portrayal of Carrie and Margaret's relationship and the feelings of sympathy Carrie manages to evoke, although he criticizes the representation of Chris as [...] "exaggeratedly evil". Seitz ultimately concludes by stating: [...] "The first Carrie was horror. This is tragedy." [...] A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a C- rating, criticizing Moretz's Carrie as [...] "too adjusted, coming across less like the 'very peculiar girl' King described in his novel and more like the stealth babe of some nottie-to-hottie teen romance." [...] Dowd lamented on the film as a whole, [...] "It's a strange thing to say about a movie so obsessed with the red stuff, but this Carrie is bloodless." ...|$|E

The association of the inferred gene network with RA susceptibility was further analyzed by a case–control study of promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and the presence of epistatic interactions was determined using the multifactor dimensionality reduction methodology. Our findings suggest that a specific NF-κB transcriptional regulatory network of 13 genes is associated with SF response to RA proinflammatory stimulus and identify a significant epistatic association of two of its genes, IL 6 and IL 4 I 1, with RA susceptibility...|$|E

It was shown that with very high heating rates (∼ 106 °C/min) the amount of char was significantly lowered (∼ 8 %, carbon basis) compared to the maximum amount, which was produced at low heating rates using a TGA (∼ 30 %, carbon basis; heating rate 1 °C/min).
