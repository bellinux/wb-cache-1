5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the festival Cosima received a long, critical memorandum from an unknown observer, which highlighted numerous divergences from Wagner's directions. This, says Marek, proved to be <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> determining her future life's mission: the maintenance of Wagner's heritage creations through the preservation of his interpretations. In her seclusion, Cosima learned of an abortive plan masterminded by Julius Kniese, the festival's chorus-master, by which Liszt was to assume the role of music director and Bülow would be chief conductor. Neither Liszt nor Bülow was interested in this arrangement, and the plan died. With Groß's assistance, Cosima pre-empted any further attempts by outsiders to assume control of the Wagner legacy, by obtaining legal recognition of herself and Siegfried as sole heirs to all Wagner's property, physical and intellectual. By this means she secured an unassailable advantage over any other claim on direction of the festival's future.|$|E

40|$|In our western culture, many churches, pastors, and Christian {{leaders have}} adopted secular {{leadership}} that emphasizes performance and results rather than emphasizing spiritual leadership based in our identity in Christ as a servant {{leader and the}} process of brokenness that God uses to develop His servants. Recent literature has suggested that pastors and Christian leaders need to revisit the need for brokenness in their Christian formation as <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> success <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> their leadership. The Church should consider brokenness as <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> success <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the effective leadership of the pastor. This dissertation will concentrate on the importance of brokenness {{in the life of the}} pastor as it relates to spiritual leadership in the midst of secular practices and leadership approaches used in the Church. Section 1 outlines the problem pastors and Christian leaders are facing in the church. Section 2 explores the various approaches to brokenness; these approaches fall short of expressing the life and Spirit of the Lord Jesus being released through us. Section 3 outlines the thesis of brokenness as <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> success <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the life and leadership of the pastor/Christian leader and the blessings derived from a lifestyle of brokenness. Section 4 consists of the Artifact description. Section 5 is the Artifact specification (book proposal). Section 6 is the postscript. Appendix A is the artifact itself, a non-fiction ebook written to inform pastors and Christian leaders about brokenness as it relates to the spiritual formation of the leader and the benefits associated with brokenness.

40|$|The procaryotic {{endogenous}} storage material poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) can {{be induced}} to accumulate in the estuarine detrital microbiota under conditions which suggest unbalanced growth, such as limitation of <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>factor(s)</b> <b>in</b> {{the presence of}} carbon and energy sources. Changes in PHB-to-lipid phosphate ratios detected in field samples can be mimicked in the laboratory with common estuarine stresses. Acute anoxia or low pH induces conditions of no growth with depression of both the synthesis and catabolism of PHB without change in the lipid phosphate. Balanced growth induced by nutrients increases the lipid phosphate, depresses PHB synthesis, and stimulates PHB catabolism, resulting in a low ratio of PHB to lipid phosphate. Unbalanced growth induced to a small extent by high salinity or much more readily by dark upland runoff water results in rapid accumulation of PHB and slowing of PHB catabolism with little change in lipid phospate. Unbalanced growth conditions result in high PHB-to-lipid phosphate ratios in the detrital microbiota...|$|R

The traditional agricultural system practiced by tribes in the Amazon is based on swidden cultivation (also known as slash-and-burn or shifting cultivation) and is considered a relatively benign disturbance. In fact, {{when looking at the}} level of individual swidden plots a number of traditional farming practices are considered beneficial.

25|$|The {{ability of}} {{entrepreneurs}} {{to work closely}} with and take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e., their coachability) has long been considered <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> entrepreneurial success. At the same time, economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because entrepreneurs possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of coachability are not actually predictive of entrepreneurial success (e.g., measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots, and firm survival). This research also shows that older and larger founding teams, presumably those with more subject expertise, are less coachable than younger and smaller founding teams.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, non-selective {{serotonin}} receptor antagonists demonstrated {{a relationship between}} serotonin receptors and food intake. Later, animal studies showed that serotonin receptor agonists might act as a mediator of satiety. Serotonin has been implicated as <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the short-term regulation of food intake and in promoting loss of weight associated with hyperphagia. Studies using pharmacological and genetic tools demonstrated that the 5-HT2C receptor subtype {{was one of the}} principal mediators through which serotonin exerts its anorectic effects in rodents. Subsequently, these receptors became a promising pharmacotherapeutic target for further investigation for the treatment of obesity. The development of 5-HT2C receptor knockout mice in the mid-1990s was a hallmark achievement in the identification and development of serotonergic drugs for weight loss. These knockout mice were hyperphagic, which led to obesity, partial Leptin resistance, increased adipose deposition, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance. As a result of these symptoms, the researchers identified a functional role for the receptors in serotonergic regulation of food intake and body weight. Later, 5-HT2C receptors were proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders including: psychiatric disorders, obesity, sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence.|$|E

25|$|While {{most of the}} Millennium Development Goals face a {{deadline}} of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, {{it will be impossible}} to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability. Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, thus placing the rest of the development agenda at risk. It is extremely important that girls have access to an education. For every additional year girls go to school, they receive 20 percent higher wages and suffer 10 percent fewer child deaths. Women with some formal education are more likely to seek medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children’s nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be healthier and better nourished. According to The International Center for Research on Women, the education that a girl receives is the strongest predictor of the age she will marry and is <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> reducing the prevalence of child marriage. The World Bank estimates that an additional year of schooling for 1,000 women helps prevent two maternal deaths. Also, each additional year of formal education that a mother completes translates to her children staying in school an additional one-third to one-half of a year.|$|E

500|$|Three {{homologous}} genes {{have evolved}} in vertebrates, encoding three muscle type-specific isoforms of TnI. Sequence analysis, immunological distance, and examination of evolutionarily suppressed conformational states {{showed that the}} TnI genes have evolved in close linkage with the genes encoding troponin T (TnT), another subunit of the troponin complex. The fast TnI-fast TnT gene pair represents the original TnI and TnT genes (Fig. 1). The three muscle fiber type-specific TnI-TnT gene pairs were likely originated from a TnI-like ancestor gene that presumably duplicated to form a closely linked fast TnI-like and fast TnT-like gene pair. A later duplication events resulted in emergences of a slow TnI-like and cardiac TnT-like gene pair that was further duplicated to give rise of the present-day slow TnI-cardiac TnT and cardiac TnI-slow TnT gene pairs. The seemingly scrambled ssTnI and cTnI gene pair is actually functionally related as they co-express and form troponin complex in the embryonic heart.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of the Battle of Rossbach, Frederick passed over two senior generals and placed Seydlitz in command of the whole of the cavalry, much to those men's {{annoyance}} and to Seydlitz' satisfaction. At Rossbach, Seydlitz's coup d'œil] and his understanding of the King's objectives led to battlefield success. [...] After positioning the cavalry in two ranked lines, he watched the French army move for several minutes, while puffing on his pipe; his troopers never took their eyes off him. [...] When he threw his pipe away, this was the signal they had waited for: the first line of massed squadrons surged forward, smashing the unprepared French in the flank. Typically, cavalry action in the mid-eighteenth century meant a single cavalry charge; the cavalry would {{spend the rest of the}} action pursuing fleeing troops. At Rossbach, though, not content with this single attack, Seydlitz called his second formation of squadrons in another charge; he then withdrew all 38 squadrons into a copse, where they regrouped under cover of the trees. [...] Without waiting for new orders from the King, Seydlitz deployed the Prussian cavalry a third time; this proved <b>a</b> <b>critical</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the battle. As trained, Seydlitz's squadrons charged headlong into the French columns: a massive wall of horses galloping flank to flank, their riders flashing swords and maneuvering at full speed. By the end of the battle, only seven infantry battalions of Frederick's army had fired a shot; the rest of the victory had been the work of Seydlitz's 38 squadrons and Karl Friedrich von Moller's artillery.|$|E
