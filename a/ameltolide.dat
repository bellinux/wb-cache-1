50|$|<b>Ameltolide,</b> a 4-aminobenzamide derivative, is an {{experimental}} anticonvulsant agent, effective at inhibiting seizures in animal models. It is non-toxic at dosing levels and no undesirable side effects {{are attributable to}} its application.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ameltolide</b> {{shares with}} {{phenytoin}} and carbamazepine a common {{mode of action}} involving interaction with central voltage-dependent sodium channels. <b>Ameltolide</b> and structurally related benzanilides were subjected to molecular modeling studies using both molecular mechanics (MM 2, Amber 96, and OPLS) and semiempirical quantum mechanics (AM], PM 3, and PM 3 Cosmo) to resolve a paradox: while compounds with a phenytoin-like pharmacological profile possess a CO-NH moiety in a cis-configuration, <b>ameltolide</b> was found via X-ray crystallography {{to exist in the}} trans-configuration. Results obtained both by molecular mechanics and semiempirical methods indicate that for <b>ameltolide,</b> the cis and trans forms have similar energy content. Additional ab initio calculations performed at 63 31 G** gave a Delta E (Z - E) on the order of 3 kcal/mol. In view of this small energy difference between the cis and trans forms, it is conceivable that these benzanilides bind to their biological target in their cis configuration, therefore assuming a common structure-activity relationship with classical antiepileptic agents...|$|E
40|$|A well {{documented}} {{study on the}} anticonvulsant properties of 4 -amino-N-(2 -ethylphenyl) benzamide (4 -AEPB) is here provided. Initial screening in mice dosed intraperitoneally and rats dosed orally indicated that 4 -AEPB is active against maximal electroshock-induced seizures (MES), bur does not protect animals against subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (sc Ptz) -induced seizures. Quantitative evaluation of anti-MES activity and neurotoxicity of 4 -AEPB: given intraperitoneally to mice provided ED 50 and TD 50 values amounting to 28. 6 and 96. 3 mu mol/kg respectively, resulting in a protective index (PI = TD 50 /ED 50) equal to 3. 36. Further quantitative evaluation in rats dosed orally indicated that the respective ED 50 and TD 50 values for 4 -AEPB were 29. 8 and more than 1, 530 mu mol/kg, resulting in a very high PI value of over 51. Comparison of anticonvulsant properties and neurotoxicity of 4 -AEPB with those previously {{reported in the literature}} for two 4 -aminobenzamide derivatives, 4 -amino-N-(2, 6 -dimethylphenyl) benzamide (or <b>ameltolide,</b> an antiepileptic drug prototype developed by Eli Lilly), and phenytoin, underlines the value of 4 -AEPB for future pharmacological development. In this perspective, an additional favorable element is represented by the ability of 4 -AEPB to increase the seizure threshold in the intravenous Ptz seizure threshold test in mice dosed intraperitoneally. Molecular modeling studies show that the translocation of one carbon unit in the isomerization of the 2, 6 -dimethylphenyl moiety of <b>ameltolide</b> to the 2 -ethylphenyl counterpart succeeds in maintaining the conformational low energy presentation adopted by <b>ameltolide,</b> providing clues as to why the 4 -AEPB here described is an anticonvulsant agent derived from the 4 -aminobenzamide pharmacophore platform as potent as <b>ameltolide...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{original}} <b>ameltolide</b> analogue 4 -amino-(2 -methyl- 4 -aminophenyl) benzamide, {{in which}} a second amino group has been introduced, was synthesized and evaluated for anticonvulsant activity. After intraperitoneal administration to mice, 4 -amino-(2 -methyl- 4 -aminophenyl) benzamide was found active in the maximal electroshock seizure test and against the tonic seizures elicited either by bicuculline or 3 -mercaptopropionic acid. 4 -amino-(2 -methyl- 4 -aminophenyl) benzamide (4 A- 2 M 4 A-PB) gave anti maximal electroshock seizures ED 50 of 63 micromol/kg (15. 4 mg/kg) and a TD 50 of 676 micromol/kg (163 mg/kg), yielding a PI of 10. 7; the potency {{is similar to that}} of the 4 -amino-(2 -methyl- 3 -aminophenyl) phthalimide (4 A- 2 M 3 A-PP), superior to that of 4 -amino-(2, 6 -dimethylphenyl) phthalimide (4 A- 2, 6 -DMPP), close to that of phenytoin and carbamazepine and inferior to that of <b>ameltolide.</b> 4 A- 2 M 4 A-PB with an ED 50 of 41 [28 - 60] micromol/kg (9. 9 mg/kg) is as active after oral administration to rats as carbamazepine, more active than <b>ameltolide,</b> 4 -A- 2 M 3 A-PP and phenytoin and slightly less active than the 4 A- 2, 6 -DMPP. The introduction of a second amino group on the substituted phenyl ring does not affect drastically the anticonvulsant potency after intraperitoneal administration to mice; moreover, it seems to enhance the activity after oral administration. 4 A- 2 M 4 A-PB is a good candidate both for further pharmacokinetic studies and for the study of the precise mechanism of action...|$|E

Along this line we synthesized and evaluated a series of N-substituted 4 -aminophthalimides which were designed according to the models of thalidomide, phenytoin (PHT) and <b>ameltolide.</b> From a series of 24 compounds only N- 1 -adamantyl- 4 -aminophthalimide was endowed with anti-HIV- 1 and -HIV- 2 activity in CEM cell cultures. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{rational}} approach using merely bioisosterism as euristic tool, we designed and tested a short series of congeners of 6 -benzoyl- 2 (3 H) -benzoxazolone as phenytoinergic lead. Among them, 5 -benzoyloxindole showed an impressive {{activity in the}} Maximal Electroshock seizure test in mice {{at the same level}} of activity as phenytoin, carbamazepine and primidone, all these drugs nowadays considered worldwide as reference molecules, and only surpassed by <b>ameltolide.</b> Additional preliminary pharmacomodulations of this lead were unsuccessful. In view of its molecular concision and good druggability characteristics, 5 -benzoyloxindole represents a valid platform for further medicinal chemistry elaborations...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{compounds}} {{related to}} <b>ameltolide</b> (LY 201116) were studied for (i) anticonvulsant {{potential in the}} maximal electroshock-induced seizures (MES) and the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol (sc Ptz) tests in mice and rats and (ii) interactions with neuronal voltage-dependent sodium channels. Compounds were chosen ranging in anticonvulsant activity in mice from very active to inactive. The active compounds were defined as those protecting 50 % of the animals at doses between 10 and 50 mu mol/kg and inactive compounds as those protecting 50 % of the animals at doses greater than 1 mmol/kg. The series studied included three N-(2, 6 -dimethylphenyl) benzamides (compounds 1, 2 (<b>ameltolide),</b> and 3), three N-(2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl) piperidinyl- 4 -benzamides (compounds 4, 5, 6), one phenylthiourea (compound 7), five N-(2, 6 -dimethylphenyl) phthalimides (compounds 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14), two N-phenylphthalimide derivatives (compounds 11 and 12), and one N-(2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl) piperidinyl- 4 -phtalimide (compound 15). Phenytoin (PHT) was employed as the reference prototype antiepileptic drug. After inital screening in mice, compounds 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14 were selected for further testing in rats. Anticonvulsant ED(50) s (effective doses in at least 50 % of animals tested) of compounds in the MES test were determined in rats dosed orally and amounted to 52 (1), 135 (2), 284 (3), 31 (8), 131 (9), 25 (10), 369 (13), 354 (14), and 121 (PHT) mu mol/kg, compound 5 presenting with an ED 50 value higher than 650 mu mol/kg. In our hands, the apparent IC(50) s (inhibitory concentrations 50) of compounds toward binding to rat brain synaptosomes of [H- 3]batrachotoxinin-A- 20 alpha-benzoate were 0. 25 (1), 0. 97 (2), 0. 35 (3), 25. 8 (5), 161. 3 (8), 183. 5 (9), 0. 11 (10), 1. 86 (13), 47. 8 (14), and 0. 86 (PHT) mu M. The relationship between the activity in the MES test {{and the capacity to}} interact in vitro with neuronal voltage-dependent sodium channels {{and the fact that the}} IC 50 values obtained in the in vitro test are close to the brain concentrations at which anticonvulsant activities are reported to occur for <b>ameltolide</b> strongly suggest that the anticonvulsant properties of most compounds tested could be a direct result of their interaction with the neuronal voltage-dependent sodium channel...|$|E
40|$|Design, {{anticonvulsant}} {{properties in}} maximal electroshock-induced seizures [MES] and seizures induced by subcutaneous administration of pentetrazole (scPtz), and neurotoxicity of retrobenzamides (N-(nitrophenyl) benzamides and N-(aminophenyl) benzamides are reported. These data are further {{compared with those}} on carbamazepine, phenytoin, <b>ameltolide</b> and other reference compounds. Studies on retrobenzamides in mice dosed intraperitoneally point out a good anticonvulsant potential in the MES test for the amino derivatives (N-(aminophenyl) benzamides) and moderate activity for corresponding "nitro" derivatives. In rats dosed orally, aminoretrobenzamides were, however, less active in the MES test than in mice dosed intraperitoneally. Differences between experimental animal species and administration routes lead to hypothesize rapid metabolization of compounds, reduced intestinal resorption and increased removal from body. The presence of a methyl substitution on the N-phenyl moiety of aminoretrobenzamides attenuated these discrepancies between mice and rats. Present results indicate that pharmacological values - including the dose offering anticonvulsant protection in 50 % of tested animals (ED 50) and protective indices - obtained on some retrobenzamides may compete with phenytoin and carbamazepine values. By contrast with phenytoin, some retrobenzamides further exhibit activity in the scPtz test...|$|E
40|$|Objective(s) : Recently, {{phthalimide}} derivatives {{were designed}} based on <b>ameltolide</b> and thalidomide as they possess a similar degree of anticonvulsant potency {{due to their}} phenytoin-like profile. The ability of phthalimide pharmacophore to interact with neuronal voltage-dependent sodium channels was studied in the batrachotoxin affinity assay. Therefore, in the present study, a series of 19 compounds of phthalimide pharmacophore possessing a variety of substituents (NO 2, NH 2, Me, Cl, COOH, MeO) at 2 -, 3 -, and 4 - position of the N-phenyl ring and N-(3 -amino- 2 -methylphenyl) succinimide, were subjected to docking studies in order to inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels.   Materials and Methods : Chemical structures of all compounds were designed using HYPERCHEM program and Conformational studies were performed through semi-empirical molecular orbital calculations method followed by PM 3 force field. Total energy gradient calculated as a root mean square (RMS) value, until the RMS gradient was 0. 01 kcal mol- 1. Among all energy minima conformers, the global minimum of compounds was used in docking calculations. Using {{a model of the}} open pore of Na channels, docking study was performed by AUTODOCK 4. 2 program. Results : Docking studies have revealed that these types of ligands interacted mainly with II-S 6 residues of NaV 1. 2 through making hydrogen bonds and have additional hydrophobic interactions with domain I, II, III and IV in the channel's inner pore. Conclusion   : These computational studies have displayed that these compounds are capable of inhibiting Na channel, efficiently...|$|E
