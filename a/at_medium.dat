5|$|Electrical {{generators}} {{mounted on}} each of the E-3's four engines provide the one megawatt of electrical power that is required by the E-3's radars and other electronics. Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter (radar) returns.|$|E
5|$|Lissitzky {{argued that}} as long as humans cannot fly, moving {{horizontally}} is natural and moving vertically is not. Thus, where there is not sufficient land for construction, a new plane created in the air <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> altitude should be preferred to an American-style tower. These buildings, according to Lissitzky, also provided superior insulation and ventilation for their inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fish are}} covered with highly {{reflective}} scales, giving the appearance of silvered mirror glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in fish of the open sea, especially those {{that live in the}} top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. <b>At</b> <b>medium</b> depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by silvering.|$|E

5|$|As the {{aircraft}} aged, the avionics {{were viewed as}} lacking suitable components for the ground attack mission, such as terrain-following radar, GPS navigation or modern night-flight systems; consequently, several upgrades were {{carried out in the}} mid-1990s, including the addition of the Litening targeting pod. India placed an order for 17 additional upgraded Jaguar aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics in 1999 and a further 20 in 2001–2002. The Indian Air Force plans to upgrade up to 125 Jaguars starting in 2013 by upgrading the avionics (including multi mode radar, auto-pilot and other changes) as part of the DARIN III programme and is considering fitting more powerful engines, Honeywell F125IN to improve performance, particularly <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> altitudes.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>medium</b> {{to close}} range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white {{on the head and}} neck than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling the pattern of the black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E

5|$|Galland {{was summoned}} to Karinhall on 18 August 1940, and missed the intense air battle that day, known as The Hardest Day. During the meeting, Göring insisted that, in combat, Bf 109 fighters escort Bf 110s, which could not survive against {{single-engine}} fighters. As high-scoring aces, both Galland and Mölders shared their concerns that close escort of Bf 110s and bombers robbed fighter pilots of their freedom to roam and engage the enemy on their own terms. They also pointed {{to the fact that}} German bombers flew <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> altitudes and low speed, the best height area and speed for the manoeuvrability of the Spitfire. Galland resented his pilots having to carry out a task unsuited to their equipment but Göring would not move from his position.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear weather greeted {{the players on}} the second day. After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon, Edrich was relieved of the new ball, which was given to Barnett, who accompanied Bedser. Both bowlers swung the ball into the right-handed Barnes and away from the left-handed Morris. Not a frontline bowler, Barnett focused on bowling defensively <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> pace, and the Australians wanted to make a safe start, so they decided to play him watchfully. This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the numerical and experimental {{analysis of a}} dielectrophoretic-activated cell sorter (DACS), which is equipped with curved microelectrodes. Curved microelectrodes offer unique advantages, since they create strong dielectrophoretic (DEP) forces over the tips and maintain it over {{a large portion of}} their structure, as predicted by simulations. The performance of the system is assessed using yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells as model organisms. The separation of the live and dead cells is demonstrated <b>at</b> different <b>medium</b> conductivities of 0. 001 and 0. 14 S/m, and the sorting performance was assessed using a second array of microelectrodes patterned downstream the microchannel. Further, microscopic cell counting analysis reveals that a single pass through the system yields a separating efficiency of * 80 % <b>at</b> low <b>medium</b> conductivities and * 85 % <b>at</b> high <b>medium</b> conductivities...|$|R

25|$|Most epipelagic {{predator}} {{fish and}} their smaller prey fish are countershaded with silvery colours which reduce visibility by scattering incoming light.

25|$|Fresnels use a spherical {{reflector}}, {{with the}} lamp at the focus point. The lamp and reflector remain a fixed unit inside the housing, and are moved {{forward and back}} to focus the light. This is accomplished using a slider on the bottom or side of the lantern, or using a worm track. At very tight focus, the lanterns are the least efficient, as the least light can escape the housing. Therefore, Fresnels are not good for tight focus on small areas. They are most often used <b>at</b> <b>medium</b> distances from the stage for area lighting.|$|E
