Routing information as specified by ISO 9362 (also known as Business Identifier Codes (BIC code), SWIFT ID or SWIFT code, and SWIFT-BIC) {{does not require a}} specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. It also does not contain check digits, so errors of transcription were not detectable and it was not possible for a sending bank to validate the routing information prior to submitting the payment. Routing errors caused delayed payments and incurred extra costs to the sending and receiving banks and often to intermediate routing banks.|$|E
30|$|Several studies {{focus on}} <b>{{accounting}}</b> <b>identification,</b> <b>accounting</b> measurement, and accounting policy. The basis of <b>accounting</b> <b>identification</b> is accrual <b>accounting,</b> butliterature raises {{the concept of}} cash flow based accounting, adjusted from cash based accounting, that could provide more useful information for decision making and solve the limitations of accrual based accounting. For accounting measurement, Lin (1997) investigates the relationship between uncertainty and accounting which argues that accounting has a time-lag and that uncertainty comes from monetary measurement. Xie (1997) presents two non-monetary asset measure models on the labor theory of value and marginal utility theory of value which {{are different from the}} capital preservation concept of accounting. Meanwhile, with the development of financial derivatives, Huang (1997 a) believes that historical cost accounting will be replaced by fair value accounting in the twenty-first century and briefly introduces the concept of fair value accounting in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). With respect to accounting policy, Huang and Yang (1995) explore questions such as what is accounting policy and why there is accounting policy. They regard accounting policy as the principle, procedure and method by which a certain accounting unit is used to make financial statements, including macro-level accounting policy such as accounting standards, and firm-level accounting policy issued by the firms themselves according to their particular situations. Consistent with Huang and Yang (1995), Li and Zhu (1996) argue that accounting environment and firm operation should be taken into consideration for the choice of accounting policy. As well, Huang and Yang (1996) investigate accounting policy in details, that is the separation between financial accounting and tax accounting in accounting policy. Financial accounting and tax accounting are separated due to different objectives, legislative authority and calculation principles. Compared with accounting development internationally, Tang and Lu (1997) put forward the challenge for financial accounting in China, including <b>accounting</b> <b>identification,</b> <b>accounting</b> measurement, financial reporting, accounting theory, the release and diffusion of accounting information, and the combination of financial accounting and managerial accounting.|$|R
