However, when he sees Manjula {{for the first time}} in years, he is shocked by her beauty and wit, and feels less reluctant.

His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: [...] "Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'" [...] According to Sigurður, [...] "Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can <b>always</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> new one, a better one." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons", Apu enjoys {{a brief period}} as Springfield's leading ladies' man after being spontaneously drawn into a {{bachelor}} auction. He spends the days following the auction on a whirlwind of dates, which suddenly end when his mother announces his arranged marriage to a woman named Manjula, whom {{he had not seen}} in years. Apu tries {{to get out of the}} arrangement at first, with Marge Simpson pretending to be his wife, until Apu's mother finds her with Homer. However, he is won over when he meets Manjula at the wedding, and the two decide to give the marriage a try, with Manjula noting nonchalantly that they can <b>always</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> divorce. Later, the two actually fall in love.|$|E
2500|$|In game theory, perfect play is the {{behavior}} or strategy {{of a player}} {{that leads to the}} best possible outcome for that player regardless of the response by the opponent. [...] Based on the rules of a game, every possible final position can be evaluated (as a win, loss or draw). By backward reasoning, one can recursively evaluate a non-final position as identical to that of the position that is one move away and best valued for the player whose move it is. Thus a transition between positions can never result in a better evaluation for the moving player, and a perfect move in a position would be a transition between positions that are equally evaluated. As an example, a perfect player in a drawn position would <b>always</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> draw or win, never a loss. If there are multiple options with the same outcome, perfect play is sometimes considered the fastest method leading to a good result, or the slowest method leading to a bad result.|$|E
2500|$|Producer and pianist Sergio George {{helped to}} revive salsa's {{commercial}} {{success in the}} 1990s by mixing salsa with contemporary pop styles with Puerto Rican artists like Tito Nieves, La India, and Marc Anthony. George also produced the Japanese salsa band Orquesta de la Luz. Brenda K. Starr, Son By Four, Víctor Manuelle, and the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan enjoyed crossover success within the Anglo-American pop market with their Latin-influenced hits, usually sung in English. More often than not, clave was not a major consideration in the composing or arranging of these hits. Sergio George is up front and unapologetic about his attitude towards clave: [...] "Though clave is considered, {{it is not always}} {{the most important thing in}} my music. The foremost issue in my mind is marketability. If the song hits, that's what matters. When I stopped trying to impress musicians and started getting in touch with what the people on the street were listening to, I started writing hits. Some songs, especially English ones originating in the United States, are at times impossible to place in clave." [...] As Washburne points out however, a lack of clave awareness does not <b>always</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> pass: ...|$|E

5000|$|From {{the first}} episode right through to the movie finale, {{references}} are made to Pembleton's reputation as a [...] "legend" [...] {{in terms of his}} skills as a detective; he is especially skilled in interrogation, and is depicted as <b>a</b> master of <b>getting</b> confessions from suspects in [...] "the Box." [...] Through a mixture of sympathy, confusion and fear, Pembleton almost <b>always</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> suspect to crack.

5000|$|Here more {{generally}} one can consider algebraically closed fields of prime characteristic. In this generality, character varieties are only algebraic sets {{and are not}} actual varieties. To avoid technical issues, one often considers the associated reduced space by dividing by the radical of 0 (eliminating nilpotents). However, this does not necessarily yield an irreducible space either. Moreover, if we replace the complex group by a real group we may not even <b>get</b> <b>an</b> algebraic set. In particular, a maximal compact subgroup generally gives a semi-algebraic set. On the other hand, whenever [...] is free we <b>always</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> honest variety; it is singular however.|$|R
