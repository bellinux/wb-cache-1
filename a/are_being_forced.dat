25|$|The bay's {{marine park}} zoning plan was renewed in 2008. Despite angst from both {{commercial}} and recreational fishers, draft Queensland Government plans indicate further fishing restrictions aiming to protect more than 15% of important marine and coastal environments. Artificial reefs {{could be placed}} in Moreton Bay to ease the concerns of fishermen who fear they <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>forced</b> out. The Queensland Government will spend 1million on research, planning and {{construction of a new}} concrete reef in the bay.|$|E

The heroes destroy Gargarensis's base and confront him, but he escapes to the underworld of Erebus using the entrance. The heroes follow Gargarensis into the underworld, where they find him trying to burst open a large door in the stone with a huge battering ram. Cautious of his motives, they destroy the ram. Gargarensis confronts them and causes a cave to collapse before escaping, forcing the heroes to find another way out. With {{the help of the}} dead, they reach three temples dedicated to the Greek gods Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades. Arkantos prays to Atlantis's patron Poseidon for help but receives none. He then prays to Zeus, who creates a staircase to the surface.|$|E

25|$|Kiwi are shy {{and usually}} nocturnal. Their mostly nocturnal habits {{may be a}} result of habitat {{intrusion}} by predators, including humans. In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed, such as sanctuaries, kiwi are often seen in daylight. They prefer subtropical and temperate podocarp and beech forests, but they <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>forced</b> to adapt to different habitat, such as sub-alpine scrub, tussock grassland, and the mountains. Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell, unusual in a bird, and are the only birds with nostrils {{at the end of their}} long beaks. Kiwi eat small invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and many varieties of worms. They also may eat fruit, small crayfish, eels and amphibians. Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks, kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell, without actually seeing or feeling them.|$|E
500|$|After the concert, Tammy {{and several}} other girls are invited backstage, where they think the Jonas Brothers {{want to have sex}} with them. Instead, they {{convince}} the girls to wear purity rings as a pledge to abstinence, and tell them to get all of their friends to start wearing them as well because [...] "That is just the way we roll" [...] (a reference to one of their songs). To appease his girlfriend, Kenny reluctantly begins wearing a purity ring. As Kenny becomes dull as a result and ceases to spend time with his friends, it is revealed that the Jonas Brothers <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>forced</b> to wear and promote purity rings by their boss, Mickey Mouse. He is fearsome, greedy, sadistic, and foul-mouthed, and verbally berates and violently beats them when they complain that the rings are overshadowing their music and projecting the wrong message. Mickey explains that the rings allow him to sell sexual stimulation to young girls while giving the false appearance of innocence and purity. Concerned for their friend, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman attempt to confront the Jonas Brothers at a televised appearance in Denver; but Mickey, mistaking the boys for secret agents hired by DreamWorks (or Michael Eisner) to sabotage the televised appearance, tranquilizes them and takes them prisoner backstage.|$|E
500|$|The CPDRC inmates have {{performed}} numerous other songs, including Queen's [...] "Radio Ga Ga" [...] and several songs from Sister Act, with prisoners dressing as nuns in habits. 44 female inmates, {{held in a}} separate wing from the males, joined the men in a dance to [...] "I Will Follow Him". [...] "Hail Holy Queen", from Sister Act 2, and the Algorithm March were also performed by the convicts and then upload onto YouTube. The inmates dance {{in order to help}} pass the time while serving their prison sentences or awaiting a trial. More than 900 of the inmates take part in the routines, {{with a small group of}} dancers at the core of each performance. Every prisoner at CPDRC, apart from the old and the infirm, has a part in the routine. Garcia directs and choreographs each of the dances. The inmates' participation is said to be completely voluntary, with no prisoner being forced to dance. [...] "It would be different if they <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>forced</b> to dance", declared Rubio. [...] "I've never known any prisoners being forced to dance. It's normal to dance." [...] The inmates have express pride at their performing success, and routinely query the viewing figures for their routines. By August 2007, ten of the prisoners' performances had been viewed over 100,000 times each. In 2007, the prisoners stated that they were to perform to Vanilla Ice's [...] "Ice Ice Baby". At the time, they were also practicing Philip Oakey and Giorgio Moroder's [...] "Together in Electric Dreams", a homage to the inmates' fans.|$|E

The progress of recent centuries has changed our world so dramatically that humans <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>forced</b> to adapt to the new environmental order or disorder that we are still creating. Wiener believes the quickness and range of our adaptability has always been the strong point of the human species, which distinguishes us from even the most intelligent of other living creatures.

She informs Firestar of her concerns. However, he does not believe this is ThunderClan's problem and refuses to take action. Hollypaw heads to RiverClan on her own. When she arrives, Willowpaw shows her how human children are disturbing their camp, but the RiverClan cats are widening the river to discourage the children from playing near the camp. Hollypaw is kept with RiverClan so she cannot tell anyone about their secret because they think she is a spy.|$|E

2500|$|The bill Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2013 (H.R. 3370; 113th Congress) {{passed in}} the House on March 4, 2014. The bill delayed indefinitely some of the reforms to the deeply indebted National Flood Insurance Program. The primary issue what the {{premiums}} should be on home and business owners located in flood zones. Miller opposed the bill and argued {{that the state of}} Michigan should opt out of the National Flood Insurance Program entirely and urged the governor to do so. According to Miller, Michigan residents subsidize other, more flood prone parts of the country, by paying higher premiums than they should. Miller accused insurance premiums of being decides by politics rather than actuarial costs. She said that [...] "too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who I represent, <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>forced</b> to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater." ...|$|E

60|$|Now {{the point}} {{must not be}} missed in this way. What {{is wrong with the}} tyranny in Africa is not that it is run by soldiers.
