25|$|On April 19, 2013, Kentucky legalized Hemp when Governor Steve Beshear {{refused to}} sign or veto Senate Bill 50, {{allowing}} the state law to go into effect. Beshear {{had been one of}} the last obstacles blocking SB50 from becoming law. Under federal law, hemp is a Schedule 1 narcotic, just like PCP and heroin, in spite of the fact that hemp typically only has 0.3 percent THC, compared to the three percent to 22 percent usually found in marijuana. The Schedule 1 designation was exempted for Kentucky's pilot hemp research projects when the federal Farm Bill (a.k.a. The <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Act</b> of 2014) was passed.|$|E
25|$|The nation's {{need for}} U.S. made capital goods increased, though ongoing {{limits on the}} Central Bank's {{availability}} of hard currency hampered access to them. Argentina's pound Sterling surpluses earned after 1946 (worth over US$200million) were made convertible to dollars by a treaty negotiated by Central Bank President Miguel Miranda; but after a year, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee suspended the provision. Perón accepted the transfer of over 24,000km (15,000mi) of British-owned railways (over half the total in Argentina) {{in exchange for the}} debt in March 1948. Due to political disputes between Perón and the U.S. government (as well as to pressure by the U.S. agricultural lobby through the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Act</b> of 1949), Argentine foreign exchange earnings via its exports to the United States fell, turning a US$100million surplus with the United States into a US$300million deficit. The combined pressure practically devoured Argentina's liquid reserves and Miranda issued a temporary restriction on the outflow of dollars to U.S. banks. The nationalization of the Port of Buenos Aires and domestic and foreign-owned private cargo ships, as well as the purchase of others, nearly tripled the national merchant marine to 1.2million tons' displacement, reducing the need for over US$100million in shipping fees (then the largest source of Argentina's invisible balance deficit) and leading to the inauguration of the Río Santiago Shipyards at Ensenada (on line to the present day).|$|E
25|$|Amongst the {{legislation}} passed by Congress during the Kennedy Administration, unemployment benefits were expanded, aid {{was provided to}} cities to improve housing and transportation, funds were allocated to continue {{the construction of a}} national highway system started under Eisenhower, a water pollution control act was passed to protect the country’s rivers and streams, and an <b>agricultural</b> <b>act</b> to raise farmers’ incomes was made law. A significant amount of anti-poverty legislation was passed by Congress, including increases in social security benefits and in the minimum wage, several housing bills, and aid to economically distressed areas. A few antirecession public works packages, together with a number of measures designed to assist farmers, were introduced. Major expansions and improvements were made in Social Security (including retirement at 62 for men), hospital construction, library services, family farm assistance and reclamation. Food stamps for low-income Americans were reintroduced, food distribution to the poor was increased, and there was an expansion in school milk and school lunch distribution. The most comprehensive farm legislation since 1938 was carried out, with expansions in rural electrification, soil conservation, crop insurance, farm credit, and marketing orders. In September 1961, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency was established as the focal point in government for the “planning, negotiation, and execution of international disarmament and arms control agreements.” Altogether, the New Frontier witnessed the passage of a broad range of important social and economic reforms.|$|E

500|$|On April 2, 2014, the News Journal {{reported}} that Bevin {{spoke at a}} pro-cockfighting rally in Corbin, Kentucky. Asked about his attendance, Bevin said he understood that the rally was a states' rights event: [...] "I {{was the first person}} to speak and then I left." [...] Organizers of the event, which was closed to the media, said there was [...] "never any ambiguity" [...] regarding its purpose, and WAVE in Louisville published an undercover video from the event showing that Bevin was the third speaker; the speaker who immediately preceded Bevin said the rally was held [...] "for the sole purpose of legalizing gamecock fighting at the state level." [...] Bevin told a WAVE reporter, [...] "I honestly wasn't even paying attention. I was thinking about what I was going to say. I don't even remember him saying that." [...] The WAVE video also showed an attendee asking Bevin if he would support the legalization of cockfighting in Kentucky, to which he replied, [...] "I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is our right to decide what it is that we want to do, and not the federal government's. Criminalizing behavior, if it's part of the heritage of this state, is in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it." [...] Bevin was referencing the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Act</b> of 2014, commonly called the [...] "farm bill", which contained a provision that criminalized spectators at cockfighting events.|$|E
2500|$|The New Deal era farm {{programs}} were {{continued into the}} 1940s and 1950s, {{with the goal of}} supporting the prices received by farmers. [...] Typical programs involved farm loans, commodity subsidies, and price supports. [...] The rapid decline in the farm population [...] led to a smaller voice in Congress. [...] So the well-organized Farm Bureau and other lobbyists, worked in the 1970s to appeal to urban Congressman through [...] food stamp programs for the poor. By 2000, the food stamp program was the largest component of the farm bill. In 2010, the Tea Party movement brought in many Republicans committed to cutting all federal subsidies, including those agriculture. Meanwhile, urban Democrats strongly opposed reductions, [...] pointing to the severe hardships caused by the 2008-10 economic recession. The <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Act</b> of 2014 saw many rural Republican Congressman voting against the program despite its support from farmers; it passed with urban support.|$|E
2500|$|Hemp {{was made}} illegal to grow without a permit in the U.S. under the Controlled Substances Act passed in 1970 {{because of its}} {{relation}} to marijuana, and any imported hemp products must meet a zero tolerance level. [...] Some states have made the cultivation of industrial hemp legal, but farmers in many states have not yet begun to grow it because of resistance from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, making [...] "large-scale hemp growing" [...] in the United States [...] "not viable" [...] as late as 2013. In 2013, after the legalization of cannabis in the state, several farmers in Colorado planted and harvested several acres of hemp, bringing in the first hemp crop in the United States in over half a century. Colorado, Vermont, California, and North Dakota have passed laws enabling hemp licensure. All four states are waiting for permission to grow hemp from the DEA. Currently, Oregon has licensed industrial hemp [...] Congress included {{a provision in the}} <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Act</b> of 2014 that allowed colleges and state agencies to grow and conduct research on hemp in states where it is legal.
