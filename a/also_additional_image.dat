30|$|In our opinion, image {{reconstruction}} techniques {{based on}} joint noise modeling techniques will (in the long term) significantly further improve the image quality, especially when physical {{limits of the}} image sensors are reached. For example, the minimal sensor size of a digital camera is limited by signal-to-noise considerations: if one {{would like to have}} a higher image resolution, one would also have to deal with a higher level of noise in the image, even up to such a degree that further increasing the image resolution does not bring any gain in image quality. Besides this, the dynamic range of a camera sensor is still many orders lower than the dynamic range that the human visual system can deal with, and improving the dynamic range will <b>also</b> bring an <b>additional</b> <b>image</b> quality increase.|$|R

The light-capturing frame (Fig. 1) consists of fiducials and MacBeth color checker chart samples, from which the camera's position and the incident radiant intensity can be estimated, {{as well as two}} glossy black spheres used to indicate the position of the light source. To reconstruct each object, we re-adjusted the size of the frame and placed it around the geometry. We took approximately ten images, each lit with a remotely mounted camera flash at a different position pointed towards the center of the frame. For each set of images, we <b>also</b> took an <b>additional</b> <b>image</b> without the flash, which was subtracted from the other images to remove any ambient # e-mail:einarsson, timh, debevec@ict. usc. edu lighting.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm to successfully achieve viable integrity and authenticity addition and verification of n-frame DICOM medical images using cryptographic mechanisms. The {{aim of this}} work is the enhancement of DICOM security measures, especially for multiframe images. Current approaches have limitations that should be properly addressed for improved security. The algorithm proposed in this work uses data encryption to provide integrity and authenticity, along with digital signature. Relevant header data and digital signature are used as inputs to cipher the image. Therefore, one can only retrieve the original data {{if and only if}} the images and the inputs are correct. The encryption process itself is a cascading scheme, where a frame is ciphered with data related to the previous frames, generating <b>also</b> <b>additional</b> data on <b>image</b> integrity and authenticity. Decryption is similar to encryption, featuring also the standard security verification of the image. The implementation was done in JAVA, and a performance evaluation was carried out comparing the speed of the algorithm with other existing approaches. The evaluation showed a good performance of the algorithm, which is an encouraging result to use it in a real environment. CNPqFINE...|$|R

30|$|Eye {{trackers}} {{are designed}} to track eye gaze {{as a series of}} fixations and saccades; in other words, they {{are designed to}} track foveal attention. This means that they are quite good at tracking overt central visual attention, but they are not intended for tracking covert peripheral visual attention (Holmqvist et al., 2011). However, we also know that visual attention can be covertly shifted to other areas of a visual scene without a subsequent overt fixation on that region (Liversedge & Findlay, 2000; Treisman & Gelade, 1980). This is typically considered a major downfall of eye tracking: that many real-world visual tasks likely involve both covert and overt visual attention, though eye tracking can only measure the latter. However, more recent research has demonstrated that microsaccades reflect shifts in covert attention (Meyberg, Werkle-Bergner, Sommer, & Dimigen, 2015; Yuval-Greenberg, Merriam, & Heeger, 2014). Microsaccades are very small saccades that are less than 1 ° of visual arc and occur very frequently during fixations (about two to three times per second) (Martinez-Conde, Otero-Millan, & MacKnik, 2013). These microsaccades tend to be directional, for instance moving slightly to the left or right of a current fixation point; research has recently demonstrated that these slight directional movements of the eye indicate the orientation of covert attention (Yuval-Greenberg et al., 2014). For example, if you are staring at a point on a screen but monitoring an upper-right area of the periphery for a change, then microsaccades are likely to show a directional shift toward the upper right. Microsaccades are likely to serve many purposes, such as preparing the eye for a subsequent saccade to a peripheral region (Juan, Shorter-Jacobi, & Schall, 2004), but can also provide meaningful metrics of covert attention. With a clinician, it is possible that while they fixated on a given number of regions they <b>also</b> considered <b>additional</b> <b>image</b> regions for fixation (but never visited them). In other words, microsaccades may provide more fine-grained understanding of the strategic search process within individual fixations and allow a more nuanced understanding of which regions might have been ruled-out or ruled-in for subsequent inspection.|$|R
