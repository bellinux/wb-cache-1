50|$|On February 9, 2007, {{following}} Anna Nicole Smith's death, it {{was revealed}} that Stern had custody of Smith's child, Dannielynn. Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt, the husband of the actress Zsa Zsa Gabor alleged he could be the father of Smith's daughter and threatened to file a lawsuit for custody. On April 10, 2007, a Bahamian court determined from DNA evidence presented by court-appointed DNA expert Dr. Michael L. Baird that Larry Birkhead is the father of Dannielynn. Stern announced that he would not contest the ruling and would help Birkhead obtain sole custody. The court ordered Stern to pay $10,000 in court costs for the <b>abandoned</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|E

So I propose to <b>abandon</b> <b>appeals</b> to intuition and look at scientific practice instead. I discuss two cases that illustrate the way in which scientists make judgments about progress. As far as scientists are concerned, progress is made when scientific discoveries contribute to the increase of scientific knowledge of the following sorts: empirical, theoretical, practical, and methodological. I then propose to articulate an account of progress that does justice to this broad conception of progress employed by scientists.

50|$|The Republic of Venice had encroached papal {{rights in}} Venetian territories by filling vacant episcopal sees {{independent}} of the pope, subjected clergy to secular tribunals, and disregarded the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Julius II in other ways. In 1509, Julius II joined the League of Cambrai, a coalition to restore recent continental conquests by Venice to their original owners. Then, also in 1509, Julius II censured Venice with an interdict and deployed Papal States' armies into Venetian occupied Romagna. Venice suffered a complete defeat at the Battle of Agnadello on 14 May 1509, against the combined forces of the League of Cambrai. In 1510, Venice negotiated with Julius II, who withdrew from the League of Cambrai and removed the censure, after Venice agreed to, among other terms: to return disputed towns in Romagna; to renounce their claims to fill vacant benefices; to acknowledge jurisdiction of ecclesiastical tribunals over clergy and immunities of the clergy, including exemption from taxes; to revoke all unauthorized treaties made with towns in the Papal States; to <b>abandon</b> <b>appeal</b> to a future general council against the papal bans; and to concede free navigation of the Adriatic Sea to Papal States subjects.|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{debate about the}} nature of {{scientific}} progress, Alexander Bird and Darrell Rowbottom have argued for two competing accounts of progress. According to Bird, scientific progress consists in the accumulation of scientific knowledge. Rowbottom, on the other hand, thinks that truth alone is necessary for progress. Both appeal to intuitions in support of their views, and it seems that the debate has reached an impasse. In an attempt to avoid this stalemate, I propose that we <b>abandon</b> <b>appeals</b> to intuitions and turn to scientific practice instead. I propose to examine the institution of the Nobel Prize, where scientists award their peers for what they consider to be important contributions to science, in order to shed new light on the question of scientific progress. I discuss two case studies that illustrate what I call “the scientific practice of assessing progress. ” This practice shows that scientists make evaluative judgments about scientific discoveries based on epistemic criteria. As far as scientists are concerned, progress is made when scientific discoveries contribute to the increase of scientific knowledge of the following sorts: empirical (factual), theoretical (inferential), practical, and methodological. I then propose that we should articulate an account of scientific progress that does justice to this scientific practice. I discuss one way of doing so, i. e., by abandoning the distinction between ‘knowing that’ and ‘knowing how’ and granting that know-how counts as scientific knowledge...|$|R

50|$|In May 1986, Barre {{suffered}} {{serious injuries}} {{in an automobile}} accident near Mogadishu, when the car that was transporting him smashed {{into the back of a}} bus during a heavy rainstorm. He was treated in a hospital in Saudi Arabia for head injuries, broken ribs and shock over a period of a month. Lieutenant General Mohamed Ali Samatar, then Vice President, subsequently served as de facto head of state for the next several months. Although Barre managed to recover enough to present himself as the sole presidential candidate for re-election over a term of seven years on December 23, 1986, his poor health and advanced age led to speculation about who would succeed him in power. Possible contenders included his son-in-law General Ahmed Suleiman Abdille, who was at the time the Minister of the Interior, in addition to Samatar.In an effort to hold on to power, Barre's ruling Supreme Revolutionary Council (SRC) became increasingly authoritarian and arbitrary. This caused opposition to his regime to grow. Barre in turn tried to quell the unrest by <b>abandoning</b> <b>appeals</b> to nationalism, relying more and more on his own inner circle, and exploiting historical clan animosities. By the mid-1980s, more resistance movements supported by Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung up across the country. Barre responded by ordering punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerrillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative center of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.|$|R

Cardinal Ottobono imposed a general tax on the English church, which he extended to Scotland.

Current state of Russian policy towards neighboring countries and the prospects for improving its performance are analyzed in the article.

40|$|This book dismantles the {{arguments}} used by policy makers {{to justify the}} abandonment of full employment as a valid goal of national governments. Bill Mitchell and Joan Muysken trace the theoretical analysis {{of the nature and}} causes of unemployment over the last 150 years and argue that the shift from involuntary to ‘natural rate’ conceptions of unemployment since the 1960 s has driven an ideological backlash against Keynesian policy interventions. The authors contend that neo-liberal governments now consider unemployment to be an individual problem rather than a reflection of systemic policy failure and that they are content to use unemployment as a policy instrument to control inflation and coerce the unemployed with work tests and compliance programmes rather than provide sufficient employment. They present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical critique of this policy approach, with a refreshing new framework for understanding modern monetary economies. The authors show that the reinstatement of full employment with price stability is a viable policy goal that can be achieved by activist fiscal policy through the introduction of a Job Guarantee. Full Employment <b>Abandoned</b> will <b>appeal</b> to graduate and postgraduate students and researchers of economics and politics with an interest in macroeconomic policy and the labour market, particularly unemployment and neo-liberal policy frameworks...|$|R
