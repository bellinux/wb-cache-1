5|$|The two {{escape the}} {{warehouse}} and retrieve the Mayan stone from Lobineau. Afterwards, {{they go to}} Quaramonte City in hopes of finding Condor Transglobal. They find the city under dictatorial rule by 'Madame La Presidente' Grasiento, and learn that the town contains no Condor Transglobal offices. The two meet Professor Oubier, who is talking to the chief of police, Raoul 'The General' Grasiento, about a mysterious chart. George confronts Oubier about his girlfriend's abduction, but the professor claims he knows nothing, {{and that he has}} not been in Paris recently. George decides to help a CIA agent, Duane, free a local agitator, Miguel, from jail by distracting General Grasiento. Afterwards, he prepares to detonate the jail wall but is arrested in the process. George gets Duane to tie a rope to the bars <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> wall down with his truck, alerting General Grasiento. Miguel escapes, and Nico and George flee down river on a boat. However, the boat sinks after being attacked by a helicopter.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> body of the weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of}} the weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage {{early in}} the morning and late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> insect from all directions, accidentally tearing it apart. However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E

25|$|The quality {{gap between}} locally {{manufactured}} guns and European arms continued to widen as new rapid {{advances in technology}} and mass production in Europe quickly outstripped the pace of developments in Asia.

The flintlock was much faster, more reliable and more user-friendly than the unwieldy matchlock, which required one hand to hold the barrel, and another to adjust the match <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> trigger.|$|E

25|$|The {{injuries}} of {{the survivors}} ranged from light to critical and were inflicted either from gunshots and/or during accidents while fleeing. The victims' ages ranged from the late teens to their 60s. Among the injuries were two women who were friends and employees at a local high school. One of them, a librarian, jumped {{on top of the}} second woman, a schoolteacher, to save her life and was shot through the leg. Both women were ultimately shot, but the woman who was jumped on was able to stand up <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> fire alarm. Also injured were the cousin of Louisiana Representative Charles Boustany and her husband. Egedahl, the last victim discharged, left Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center on August 14.

25|$|When they {{initially}} {{captured the}} bridge, the American engineers {{were not sure}} it could support {{the weight of the}} tanks, but they only had about 120 troops on the east side and they needed to reinforce them immediately. At about midnight the engineers opened the bridge to armor. At 12:15 am on 8 March, two platoons of nine Sherman tanks from Company A, 14th Tank Battalion, gingerly crept across the bridge in close formation following white tape left by the engineers outlining the holes. When they successfully reached the east bank, they moved into blocking positions to secure the bridgehead. Immediately behind the Shermans, an M10 Tank Destroyer from the 656th Tank Destroyer Battalion fell part way into the hole in the bridge deck left by the German demolition charge. The engineers briefly considered pushing the tank destroyer into the river, but decided they might further damage the bridge. They worked all night to jack the tank up and at 5:30 am finally got a tank on the east side to come back <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> tank destroyer across the hole.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>the</b> lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people?
