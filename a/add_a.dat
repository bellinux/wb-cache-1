40|$|Recently, Scholten and Read (2014) {{found new}} {{violations}} of dominance in intertemporal choice. Although <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small receipt before a delayed payment or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small delayed receipt after an immediate receipt makes the prospect objectively better, it decreases {{the preference for}} that prospect (better is worse). Conversely, although <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small payment before a delayed receipt or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small delayed payment after an immediate payment makes the prospect objectively worse, it increases the preference for that prospect (worse is better). Scholten and Read explained these violations {{in terms of a}} preference for improvement. However, to produce violations such as these, we find that the temporal sequences need not be constructed as Scholten and Read suggested. In this study, <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small receipt before a dated receipt (thus constructed as improving) or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> receipt after a dated payment (thus constructed as improving) decreases preferences for those prospects. Conversely, <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small payment after a dated receipt (thus constructed as deteriorating) or <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> small payment before a delayed payment (thus constructed as deteriorating) increases preferences for those prospects. </p...|$|R

5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the battery and the battery coolant system to improve battery protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the battery pack in a severe side collision; <b>add</b> <b>a</b> sensor in the reservoir of the battery coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and <b>add</b> <b>a</b> tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of}} the battery coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the battery pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E

Sabo's CATACLYSM achieves a machinima verite style through displaying and recapturing the machinima video {{with a low}} resolution black and white hand-held video camera to produce a shaky camera effect. Other element of cinéma vérité, such as longer takes, sweeping camera transitions, and jump cuts may be included to complete the effect.|$|E

5|$|Electric {{multiple}} units began running on 1 January 1905 and by 20 March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. The use of six-car trains was considered wasteful on the lightly used line to Uxbridge and in running an off-peak three-car shuttle to Harrow the Met aroused the displeasure of the Board of Trade {{for using a}} motor car to propel two trailers. A short steam train was used for off-peak services {{from the end of}} March while some trailers were modified to <b>add</b> <b>a</b> driving cab, entering service from 1 June.|$|E
