30|$|Molecular imaging enables minimally-invasive {{visualisation}} {{of molecular}} and cellular biological processes in living organisms. It {{plays an important}} role in cancer drug development and in monitoring disease progression and tumour response to therapeutic interventions [1 – 3]. Animal models are both cost effective and versatile and therefore have been essential in cancer research. Ex vivo biodistribution and/or autoradiography studies <b>are</b> traditionally used <b>to</b> investigate the uptake characteristics of novel radiolabelled tracers prior to translation to in-human clinical trials. However, these methods are limited, as they require <b>animals</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>culled</b> at various time points and the pharmacokinetics are based on data from different animals at different times. Conversely, SPECT and PET pre-clinical imaging enables the prospect of longitudinal studies and therefore has the potential to provide quantitative measurements of radiotracer biodistribution and to reduce the number of animals required per study, which is both more cost effective and more ethical than traditional methods [4].|$|R

40|$|The {{spread of}} a highly virulent (HV) Staphylococcus aureus strain into a rabbit flock leads to a high {{percentage}} of rabbits suffering from subcutaneous abscesses, pododermatitis, mastitis, infertility and death with chronic poor production results for the rabbitry. In practice often all <b>animals</b> have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>culled</b> and the rabbitry has to restart with a new flock. Some rabbit farmers however prefer to use an autovaccine, manufactured from the specific HV S. aureus strain circulating in their rabbitry, in an attempt to control the infection at flock level. Since the efficacy of such an autovaccine has not been scientifically proven, a double blinded experiment <b>was</b> designed <b>to</b> study this effect in an in vivo rabbit skin infection model under standardized experimental conditions. For this purpose, a culture of the HV S. aureus strain KH 171 <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> produce an autogenous bacterin based on a whole cell suspension of formalin killed bacteria in sterile buffered saline. On day one and fourteen of the experiment, ten twelve-week-old rabbits (group A) received subcutaneous injections with the prepared autovaccine while ten rabbits of group B were injected twice with sterile buffered saline. Two weeks after these last injections, the rabbits were briefly anaesthetised and after shaving and disinfection of the flank, an “O”-shaped tattoo pin was pressed into the skin.

40|$|LPAI is a (poultry) disease {{which comes}} with mild and {{non-specific}} clinical symptoms. It {{has the potential}} to mutate <b>to</b> HPAI, which <b>is</b> highly contagious and comes with serious clinical symptoms such as high mortality. In 2003, an HPAI outbreak in the Netherlands cost more than a billion Euro, and approximately 30 million <b>animals</b> had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>culled</b> in order <b>to</b> control the outbreak. Such consequences make it important to detect LPAI as early as possible, before it can mutate to HPAI. We have developed and studied multiple Bayesian tools to assist the veterinarian in this task. The early detection of LPAI should start at the poultry farm, where daily measurements of the production parameters would ideally be registered. Important production parameters of a flock of laying hens are the feed intake, water intake, mortality rate, egg production and egg weight. Comparing the measured values against the expected ones is the basis for detecting anomalies in the production parameters. With living animals, such as laying hens, the expected production values differ among flocks due to natural variability. We have developed the pseudo point method to remove this natural variability from the measurements for a production parameter. Based on an expected trend, expressed by a mathematical function, a prediction function is derived. Each measurement <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> update this prediction function, causing it to slowly adapt to the measured data. For a veterinarian visiting a poultry farm, it <b>is</b> very hard <b>to</b> distinguish LPAI from other poultry diseases. We have developed a Bayesian network to assist the veterinarian in determining whether there is an increased probability of the flock being infected with an LPAI virus. This probability is mainly based on farm-specific details, clinical signs on flock level, clinical signs on individual bird level and post-mortem findings. Upon constructing Bayesian networks, the noisy-OR model and its generalisations are frequently used for reducing the number of parameter probabilities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> assessed. Empirical research has shown that using the noisy-OR model for nearly every causal mechanism in a network, does not seriously hamper the quality of its output. We have provided a formal underpinning of this finding and have identified under which conditions applying the noisy-OR model can potentially harm the network's output. Additionally, we have developed the intercausal cancellation model, of which the noisy-OR model is a special case, to provide network engineers with a tool to model cancellation effects between cause variables...|$|R
40|$|Simian {{retrovirus}} (SRV) type D is {{a common}} cause of simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS), a usually fatal immunosuppressive disease of macaques. Associated gross and histologic lesions have been well described for the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) in experimental and natural infections. However, morphologic changes induced by this virus at the gross and light-microscopic level have not been documented in the cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis). In 1996, sporadic cases of anemia, weight loss, and diarrhea were noted in a colony of cynomolgus macaques in our research facility. Out of 28 animals, 24 tested positive for SRV by serology or virus isolation. Animals could mainly be classified into 1 of 2 categories: 1) positive for virus isolation but negative for SRV antibody and 2) negative for virus isolation but antibody positive. During the process of eliminating the virus from the colony, a complete postmortem examination {{was performed on the}} 24 infected <b>animals</b> that had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>culled.</b> Twelve SRV-negative <b>animals</b> were available as controls. Minimal to mild follicular lymphoid infiltrates were seen in various organ systems in 75 % of the negative animals, compared with moderate to marked infiltrates in 83 % of infected animals.

Overall, the most important <b>cull</b> classes <b>were</b> reproduction (19 %) and production (50 %).

Sows that <b>were</b> <b>culled</b> for production reasons had significantly the highest average parity number at culling (4. 6 ± 0. 2) compared to all other culling reasons such as reproduction (3. 1 ± 0. 2), locomotion (2. 3 ± 0. 3), accident (2. 9 ± 0. 5), general disorder (3. 3 ± 0. 4) and peri-partum (3. 3 ± 0. 4) cull classes.
