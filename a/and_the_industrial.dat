5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended}} {{to make it easier}} for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{reliable}} documentation of the demographic impact of the Black Death in Scotland, there are some indications of the immediate effects of the plague. Walter Bower recorded that 24, about a third, of the canons of St. Andrews died during the outbreak. There are also anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Compared with the distribution of population after the later Clearances <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> Revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the River Tay.|$|E

5|$|Arkham Knight Gotham City is {{approximately}} {{five times the}} scale of the open-air Arkham City prison in Arkham City. The game takes place {{in the center of the}} city, which is split into three islands: Bleake, Founders, and Miagani, with various districts such as the neon-tinged Chinatown, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> shipping yard. Bleake Island features shorter buildings, disheveled areas, and abandoned docks, while Founders Island is a modern development of skyscrapers built on the ruins of Gotham slums, and Miagani Island is an older metropolis with Wayne Tower at its center. Oracle has set up her communications headquarters in the Gotham clock tower, which also houses a makeshift Batcave.|$|E
5|$|Conisbrough Castle {{was bought}} by the Conisbrough local council in the 1940s, who placed the castle into the {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Public Works in 1949, but retained the freehold ownership of the land. Two sets of archaeological excavations were carried out on the site between 1967 and 1969, exposing {{the foundations of the}} buildings in the inner bailey, and then from 1973 to 1977, examining options for future visitor facilities. By 1984, when the government agency English Heritage took over the management of the property, the condition of the visitor services was unsatisfactory <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> character of the surrounding area was discouraging tourists.|$|E
5|$|Economically, {{the area}} depends on agriculture. Maize, rice, yuca, cotton and heart of palm are {{produced}} and exported.

Crafts, often carved of wood using the same techniques as in colonial times, provide additional income. Since {{the launch of the}} Jesuit Mission Circuit– a marketing label to promote regional tourism– in 2005, craftsmanship and tourism have been closely related.|$|E

5|$|This need soon proved itself {{when the}} rise in {{population}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> Revolution that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly.

5|$|As well as {{entertaining}} {{old friends}} {{who came to}} visit her in her home, Cameron also met with younger occultists, such as the Thelemite William Breeze <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> musician Genesis P-Orridge. Cameron aided Breeze in co-editing a collection of Parsons' occult and libertarian writings, which were published as Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword in 1989. Cameron was acquainted with the experimental film-maker Chick Strand and appeared in the latter's 1979 project Loose Ends, during which she narrated {{the story of an}} exorcism. In 1989, an exhibition of her work titled The Pearl of Reprisal was held at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery. It included a selection of her paintings and a screening of Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome and The Wormwood Star, while Cameron attended to provide a candle-lit reading of her poetry. In the mid-1990s, Cameron was diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent radiotherapy treatment, which she supplemented with alternative medicines. The tumor was cancerous and metastasized to her lungs. She {{died at the age of}} 73 in the VA Medical Center on July 24, 1995, and underwent the Thelemic last rites, carried out by a high priestess of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Her body was cremated and its ashes were scattered in the Mojave Desert. A memorial event was held at Venice's Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center in August.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the redistribution of population {{as a result of}} the clearances <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> revolution that began in the eighteenth century, the population was evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. One result of the Little Ice Age was the abandonment of marginal land in the early part of the period, as it became impossible to sustain agriculture in some regions, particularly in the uplands, but new settlements were created {{as a result of the}} opening up of hunting reserves like Ettrick Forest and less desirable low-lying land was also settled, often incorporating features into their names such as bog, marsh and muir.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the redistribution of population in the later clearances <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> revolution, these numbers would have been evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of many burghs that {{grew up in the}} later medieval period, mainly in the east and south. It has been suggested that they would have had a mean population of about 2,000, but many would be much smaller than 1,000 and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 {{at the beginning of the}} modern era and by 1750, with its suburbs it had reached 57,000. The only other towns above 10,000 by the end of the period were Glasgow with 32,000, Aberdeen with around 16,000 and Dundee with 12,000.|$|E

5|$|Early in the Second World War, Crewe Hall {{was used}} as a {{military}} training camp, repatriation camp for Dunkirk troops and a US army camp, becoming the gun operations headquarters for the north-west region in 1942. It housed a prisoner-of-war camp for German officers from 1943. The hall was leased as offices in 1946, becoming the headquarters of Calmic Limited, who eventually employed nearly 800 people at Crewe Hall. Calmic produced hygiene and medical products on the site including tablets, creams, analgesics and antibiotic aerosols; they constructed industrial facilities adjacent to the hall including a drying and filtration plant and pharmaceutical packaging unit. After Wellcome's acquisition of Calmic in 1965, the hall served as the UK and Ireland headquarters of the Wellcome Foundation until the merger with Glaxo in 1995. Wellcome produced liquids, tablets, creams and antibiotic aerosols at the site; the hall itself was used for administration, but the stables block was rebuilt internally for use as laboratories <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> facilities were expanded.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{made a major}} {{contribution}} to the intellectual life of Europe, particularly in the Enlightenment, producing major figures including the economist Adam Smith, philosophers Francis Hutcheson and David Hume, and scientists William Cullen, Joseph Black and James Hutton. In the 19th century major figures included James Watt, James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and Sir Walter Scott. Scotland's economic contribution to the Empire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> revolution included its banking system {{and the development of}} cotton, coal mining, shipbuilding and an extensive railway network. Industrialisation and changes to agriculture and society led to depopulation and clearances of the largely rural highlands, migration to the towns and mass immigration, where Scots made a {{major contribution}} to the development of countries including the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Strikes and {{industrial}} unrest were frequent {{in the aftermath}} of World War I, arising from discontent over poor conditions and the rise of militant labour organizations like the Communist Party of Australia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> Workers of the World. The problems were made worse in Australia due to the overlapping system of industrial courts that had evolved since Federation. Although federal arbitration was intended for industrial disputes that impacted upon multiple states or federal employees, courts had through several judgments greatly expanded the potential jurisdiction of federal arbitration, and the system had developed into a duality with both state and federal tribunals weighing into a wide range of industrial disputes. This was exploited by both unions and employers, who pursued matters in the courts they felt most likely to be favourable and switched between different jurisdictions to arrive at the best combination of state and federal conditions. Protracted disputes arose as employers and employees pursued disputes in different courts or refused to recognise the rulings of one in favour of the other. Billy Hughes and several of his predecessors had sought resolution to the problem through greater Commonwealth powers, but all referendums to expand Commonwealth industrial powers had failed at the ballot box.|$|E
