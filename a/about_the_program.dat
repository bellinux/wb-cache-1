5|$|Parseghian {{quickly turned}} things around in 1964, re-establishing {{a sense of}} {{confidence}} and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized {{with the help of}} a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> and addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested as others replaced them.|$|E

The reader now discovers that the author of Sweet Tooth is in fact Haley, despite its being written from Serena's first-person perspective. As the novel ends, Haley asks Serena {{in a letter to}} marry him.|$|E

25|$|Gary Eitel, a pilot, {{aviation}} {{consultant and}} aircraft broker, found out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> and contacted the Forest Service in 1991 {{to try to}} obtain C-130s for his clients, {{who had not been}} in on the initial deal. He was told by the agency that there were no more aircraft available, and that only three planes had been involved. Suspecting that he was not being told the truth, Eitel began his own investigation, obtaining documentation on the program through the Freedom of Information Act. Eitel took on the role of whistleblower, and reported his findings in testimony before several congressional subcommittee hearings.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, British comedian Justin Lee Collins went {{searching for}} all the stars of Dallas to bring them {{together}} for a special reunion party. The show was broadcast at 9 p.m. Sunday, May 27, 2007, on UK television network Channel 4 {{as part of the}} Bring Back... series. After hunting down most of the main cast by any means necessary (e.g., climbing over security fences and ambushing hotels), Collins interviewed them and gained more knowledge about some of the decisions made throughout the show's seasons. The participants amongst the cast were Larry Hagman, Linda Gray, Patrick Duffy, Ken Kercheval, Charlene Tilton, Susan Howard and Mary Crosby. He held his own Oil Baron's Ball, where none of the main cast turned up. However, the actor who played baby Christopher (Eric Farlow) attended. Charlene Tilton spoke in an interview in 2011 <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> which she said was one of her and the cast's worst experiences ever.|$|E

25|$|While {{the public}} image of SWAT first became known through the LAPD, {{perhaps because of}} its {{proximity}} to the mass media and the size and professionalism of the Department itself, the first actual SWAT-type operations were conducted north of Los Angeles in the farming community of Delano, California {{on the border between}} Kern and Tulare Counties in the San Joaquin Valley. At the time, the United Farm Workers union led by César Chavez was staging numerous protests in Delano, in a strike that would last over five years. Though the strike never turned violent, the Delano Police Department responded by forming ad-hoc SWAT-type units involving crowd and riot control, sniper skills and surveillance. Television news stations and print media carried live and delayed reportage of these events across the United States. Personnel from the LAPD, having seen these broadcasts, contacted Delano and inquired <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> One officer then obtained permission to observe the Delano Police Department's special weapons and tactics units in action, and afterwards, he took what he had learned back to Los Angeles, where his knowledge was used and expanded on to form the LAPD's own first SWAT unit.|$|E
25|$|Pitt played {{its home}} games in 2000 at Three Rivers Stadium. Behind an {{increasing}} number of talented players, led by Biletnikoff Award winner Antonio Bryant, Pitt was back to a winning record in 2000 and played Iowa State in the 2000 Insight.com Bowl. In the second game of the 2000 season, Pitt defeated rival Penn State 12–0 which was the last game played between these two teams for 16 years. In 2001, Pitt began playing its home games at Heinz Field. Additional bowl games and national rankings followed over the next four seasons. Overall Harris led the Panthers to a bowl game in six of his eight seasons, including five consecutive bowl games from 2000 through 2004, with bowl victories in the 2001 Tangerine Bowl over North Carolina State in 2001 and, led by Biletnikoff and Walter Camp Award winner Larry Fitzgerald, over Oregon State in the 2002 Insight Bowl. Harris also led Pittsburgh to a share of the Big East Conference championship in 2004 and Pitt received the conference's automatic Bowl Championship Series (BCS) bowl bid, playing Utah in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl. Harris was named the Big East Conference Coach of the Year in 1997 and 2004, and he was the AFCA Region I Coach of the Year in 2002. Over his eight years at Pitt, from 1997–2004, Harris compiled an overall record of 52–44. However, alumni and fans were growing restless with perceived recruiting deficiencies and an inability to return the program to the highest level. When disparaging remarks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> were made by his agent, Harris' contract negotiations with the school stalled. This led to an announcement prior to the Fiesta Bowl in 2004 that Harris was leaving Pitt to become head coach at Stanford.|$|E
500|$|In 1950, Stafford {{began working}} for Voice of America (VOA), the U.S. {{government}} broadcaster transmitting programmes overseas {{to undermine the}} influence of communism. She presented a weekly show that aired in Eastern Europe, and Collier's magazine published an article <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> in its April 21, 1951 issue that discussed her worldwide popularity, including in countries behind the Iron Curtain. The article, titled [...] "Jo Stafford: Her Songs Upset Joe Stalin", earned her {{the wrath of the}} U.S. Communist Daily Worker newspaper, which published a column critical of Stafford and VOA.|$|E

Viewer interaction via a second screen is becoming increasingly popular.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to cancelling Compassionate IND, Mason made controversial comments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> arguing, among other things, {{that people with}} AIDS who used cannabis [...] "might {{be less likely to}} practice safe... sexual behavior." [...] ACT UP/DC asked Mason to resign his post if he failed to meet their demands to restore access to cannabis. Brownies were served at the protest in honor of Rathbun, who had been arrested the month before and was now facing felony possession charges for distributing cannabis brownies to AIDS patients. [...] Outside the Department of Health and Human Services, Rathbun invited Mason to [...] "follow me around for two days as I visit my kids in the wards, and then see where he stands on this".|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1995, it is claimed by Williams that the Comanche had been facing {{complete}} cancellation as {{a choice between}} which defense development programs were to be scrapped. During mid-1999, the Comanche was subject to substantial governmental scrutiny; the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that it had [...] "serious doubts" [...] <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> and noted that the Comanche would [...] "consume almost {{two thirds of the}} whole Aviation budget by Fiscal Year 2008". In addition, wartime experiences, such as from the Kosovo War, had led to some senior figures within the Army to place a greater emphasis on the use of unmanned platforms for conducting many of the same roles for which the Comanche was being developed to perform. By 2000, Williams postulates that the primary reason for retaining the program was out of concern for the state of the helicopter industry—Sikorsky's production and employment figures were at their lowest for decades and the contract was considered critical.|$|E

On 1 June 2000, {{it was announced}} that the program had entered its $3.1 billion engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase. However, during 2002, the Comanche program underwent heavy restructuring; the number of Comanches that were to be purchased was cut to 650. At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. As early as the late 1990s, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) had reported that it had [...] "serious doubts" [...] <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> observing that the Comanche would [...] "consume almost two thirds of the whole Aviation budget by Fiscal Year 2008". Multiple government agencies had acted to cut the number of Comanches on order, but, {{as a consequence of the}} heavy reductions to the numbers to be procured, the unit costs soared.|$|E
