25|$|As a rule, {{cabinets}} of the 15th {{century were}} rectangular in plan. In Germany and Austria {{the lower part}} was often enclosed, {{as well as the}} upper; the top, middle and lower rails being carved with geometrical design or with bands of foliage (Museum, Vienna). But it was also the custom to make these cupboards with the corners cut off, thus giving five sides to the piece of furniture. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> instance, which is greatly enhanced by the metal work of the lock plates and hinges, is in the Muse Cluny, and there are other good specimens with the lower part open in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.|$|E
25|$|Interior doorways {{were often}} {{decorated}} with a broken pediment more or less ornate, and a swag of foliage commonly depended from either side over a background of scroll work. The outside porches so often seen in Queen Anne houses were of a character peculiar to the 18th century. A small platform or curved roof was supported by two large and heavy brackets carved with acanthus scroll work. The staircases were as a rule exceedingly good. Carved and pierced brackets were fixed to the open strings (i.e. {{the sides of the}} steps), giving <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> effect to the graceful balustrade of turned and twisted columns.|$|E

500|$|Kerr's {{first film}} role {{was in the}} British {{production}} Contraband in 1940, but her scenes were left on the cutting room floor. With her next two British films—Major Barbara and Love on the Dole (both 1941)—her screen future seemed assured and her performance, said James Agate of Love on the Dole, [...] "is not {{within a mile of}} Wendy Hiller's in the theatre, but it is a charming piece of work by <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> and promising beginner, so pretty and so promising that there is the usual yapping about a new star". She went on to make Hatter's Castle (1942), in which she starred opposite Robert Newton and James Mason, and then played a Norwegian resistance fighter in The Day Will Dawn (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: British exhibitors voted her the most popular local female star at the box office.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Adam Mitchell was first conceived, along with Henry van Statten, during Russell T Davies' 2003 pitch to the BBC, {{in a story}} heavily based on Robert Shearman's audio play Jubilee, which would later form the base for the episode [...] "Dalek". It was always {{the intention of the}} production team for Adam to join the TARDIS after Rose developed a liking for him. To play this role Langley was chosen, mostly because of his role on Coronation Street as Todd Grimshaw. He had auditioned for the role on the same day as doing publicity for his leaving storyline in Coronation Street. Reacting to his casting Langley, remarked that [...] "I couldn't have asked for a better next role because Doctor Who is another great institution." [...] Langley describes Adam as [...] "a bit nerdy" [...] and states of his character's attraction to Rose that [...] "she's <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> girl and Adam hasn't seen any girls for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Johar first wrote a story, {{which was}} a love {{triangle}} between a tomboy, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> girl and a slightly insensitive boy, but he shelved the idea {{because he was not}} very satisfied with it. Then he wrote another plot about a widower and his child, which he shelved as well. Eventually he decided to merge the two stories into one. He explained in an interview with Rediff.com: [...] "It was about the trauma of a widower and his little child. How the child really wants a mother and how she brings her mother into her father's life. Then I thought: Why not bring a youth aspect to the story? Why not a flashback? That's how the story got made." [...] The story also includes a [...] "personal desires vs. parental loyalties" [...] theme, and has some [...] "East meets West" [...] themes, but instead of the characters going abroad, it creates a virtual West inside India.|$|E

60|$|The {{settling}} of {{this dispute}} {{was the first}} act of King Richard's reign.

500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not on my list, mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

She still pursued her studies and especially her sewing, under the surveillance of her aunt." ...|$|E

2500|$|Forced {{seduction}} is a theme found {{frequently in}} romance novels and soap operas wherein man-on-woman rape {{turns into a}} genuine love affair. It is a common theme in Thai soap operas where it was long taken for granted, until in 2014 the {{rape and murder of}} a thirteen-year-old girl led to a national outcry. The theme was summarized thus:Once upon a time there was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> girl. She was raped. The boy begged for forgiveness, and they lived happily ever after.

2500|$|The {{growth of}} the {{institution}} required a proper church, and school leaders decided to spend $1500 to construct a new edifice. Work began on May 25, 1848, and the structure was dedicated on November 12 of the following year. The solemn consecration took place a year later, on November 11, 1849, with Bishop of Vincennes, Maurice de St. Palais presiding. Father Sorin describes the first church: [...] "The style is Greek, with rounded arches. There are three vaults and six columns which produce <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> effect. The tribune, which has been built {{for the use of}} the Sisters, is elliptical like the sanctuary. It is already enriched with an organ of Mr. H. Erben, and, though a little weak for the church, is one of its most precious ornaments." ...|$|E
2500|$|The design {{began in}} Paris but became known in Britain. It was {{described}} in an 1868 fashion article in The Guardian reprinted from the French fashion magazine Le Follet: [...] "There is also the 'Eugenie' in honour of the Empress, in very fine leghorn, with a broad edge inclining over the eyes, trimmed {{with a bunch of}} white feathers, an aigrette of roses, an orchid or moss and field flowers. The chapeau 'Eugenie' is not very becoming to all faces: it requires to be worn by <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> and stylish lady". Eugenie's fashion choices appeared in influential US publications such as Godey's Lady's Book and it seems likely images of the hat may have been circulated to an American audience. The Metropolitan Museum of Art collection includes a straw hat of 1860 of a similar neat style to the Eugénie hat.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the summers}} of 1880, 1881, and 1882, he {{accompanied}} Nadezhda von Meck, the wealthy patroness of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, as she travelled {{with her family}} in Europe. The young composer's many musical activities during these vacations included playing four-hand pieces with von Meck at the piano, giving music lessons to her children, and performing in private concerts with some of her musician friends. Despite von Meck's closeness to Tchaikovsky, the Russian master appears to have had minimal effect on Debussy. In September 1880 she sent his Danse bohémienne for Tchaikovsky's perusal; a month later Tchaikovsky wrote back to her: [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> piece, but it is much too short. Not a single idea is expressed fully, the form is terribly shriveled, and it lacks unity." [...] Debussy did not publish the piece, and the manuscript remained in the von Meck family; it was eventually sold to B. Schott's Sohne in Mainz, and published by them in 1932.|$|E
2500|$|After {{performing}} Camelot for six months, in July 1961, Burton met producer Walter Wanger {{who asked}} him to replace Stephen Boyd as Mark Antony in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's magnum opus Cleopatra. Burton was paid $250,000 for four months work in the film. The gigantic scale of the film's troubled production, Taylor's bouts of illness and fluctuating weight, Burton's off-screen relationship with the actress, (which he gave the sardonic nickname [...] "Le Scandale") all generated enormous publicity; Life magazine proclaimed it the [...] "Most Talked About Movie Ever Made". Fox's future appeared to hinge on what became the most expensive movie ever made until then, with costs reaching almost $40million. During filming, Burton met {{and fell in love}} with Elizabeth Taylor, who was then married to Eddie Fisher. According to Alpert, at their first meeting on the set while posing for their publicity photographs, Burton said, [...] "Has anyone ever told you that you're <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>pretty</b> girl?" [...] Taylor later recalled, [...] "I said to myself, Oy gevalt, here's the great lover, the great wit, the great intellectual of Wales, and he comes out with a line like that." [...] Bragg contradicts Alpert by pointing out that Burton could not stand Taylor at first, calling her [...] "Miss Tits" [...] and opined to Mankiewicz, [...] "I expect she shaves"; he saw her simply as another celebrity with no acting talent. All that changed when, in their first scene together, Burton was shaky and forgot his lines, and she soothed and helped him; it was at this instance, according to Taylor, that she fell for him. Soon the affair began in earnest; both Fisher and Sybil were unable to bear it. While Fisher fled the sets for Gstaad, Sybil went first for Céligny and then headed off to London. Olivier, shocked by Burton's affair with Taylor, cabled him: [...] "Make up your mind, dear heart. Do you want to be a great actor or a household word?". Burton replied [...] "Both".|$|E
