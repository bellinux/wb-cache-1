5|$|As in {{previous}} generations, Nintendo provided {{strong support for}} its new console with popular first-party franchises like Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and Pokémon, among others.

5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate their <b>activities</b> <b>with</b> one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are {{holometabolous}} insects, {{going through}} the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal triggers the maturation of the ovaries in females and {{the dissolution of the}} testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their <b>activities</b> <b>with</b> their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.|$|E

In addition, the image of the grandparent has been largely nonexistent in advertising.|$|E

When the Jurchens, once Liao vassals, rose up to overthrow their masters and established the Jin dynasty, they continued Liao's wall-building <b>activities</b> <b>with</b> extensive work begun before 1138.

5|$|The summit {{was held}} in the Olympic Sports Centre, Riga. Roads in the center of Riga were closed down and parking was not allowed at the airport or at several roads, out of fear for car bombs. About 9000 Latvian police {{officers}} and soldiers took care of the Summit's security, while more than 450 other airmen from seven European NATO countries were called upon to ensure a no-fly zone above the summit in an operation called Operation Peaceful Summit. This enhanced ongoing Baltic Air Policing <b>activities</b> <b>with</b> additional aircraft, communications and maintenance support.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers.

5|$|After the {{completion}} of the H-41 design, Hitler issued a request for a larger battleship and placed no restrictions on gun caliber or displacement. The only requirements were a speed of , horizontal and underwater protection sufficiently strong enough to protect the vessel from all attacks, and a main battery properly balanced with the size of the ship. The results were purely study projects intended to determine the size of a ship with strong enough armor to counter the rapidly increasing power of bombs deployed by the Allies during the war. The Commission did not discuss its <b>activities</b> <b>with</b> Raeder or his successor, Admiral Karl Dönitz, or with other branches in the OKM. As the designs for the H-42, H-43, and H-44 battleships were purely conjectural, no actual work was begun. The German navy did not seriously consider construction on any of the designs, which were so large that they could not have been built in a traditional slipway. Indeed, the Construction Office of the OKM sought to disassociate itself from the projects, which they found to be of doubtful merit and unnecessary for German victory.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a triazole ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different <b>activities</b> <b>with</b> regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Orton, a butcher's son born on 20 March 1834 in Wapping, {{had gone}} to sea as a boy and had been in Chile in the early 1850s.

His employment by Foster at Gippsland terminated around 1857 with a dispute over wages.

Most of Orton's family failed to recognise the Claimant as their long-lost kinsman, although it was later revealed that he had paid them money.
