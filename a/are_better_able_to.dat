5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as {{an adaptive}} skill. It {{has been shown}} that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> complete their assigned activities. To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|Gaze {{becomes more}} complex {{with age and}} practice. As gaze {{increases}} in complexity, individuals <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> discriminate what others are referring to. Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn. Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.|$|E
5|$|When animals choose mates, traits such as {{signalling}} {{are subject}} to evolutionary pressure. For example, the male gray tree frog, Hyla versicolor, produces a call to attract females. Once a female chooses a mate, this selects for a specific style of male calling, thus propagating a specific signalling ability. The signal can be the call itself, the intensity of a call, its variation style, its repetition rate, and so on. Various hypotheses seek to explain why females would select for one call over the other. The sensory exploitation hypothesis proposes that pre-existing preferences in female receivers can drive the evolution of signal innovation in male senders, {{in a similar way}} to the hidden preference hypothesis which proposes that successful calls <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> match some 'hidden preference' in the female. Signallers have sometimes evolved multiple sexual ornaments, and receivers have sometimes evolved multiple trait preferences.|$|E

25|$|Alkenyl- and alkynylaluminates {{are most}} {{commonly}} generated through {{the addition of}} n-butyllithium to the alkenylalane. The alkenyl and alkynyl groups, which <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> stabilize negative charge, are transferred in preference to the alkyl group.

25|$|At 6 months, infants {{are also}} able {{to make use of}} {{prosodic}} features of the ambient language to break the speech stream they are exposed to into meaningful units, e.g., they <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> distinguish sounds that occur in stressed vs. unstressed syllables. This means that at 6 months infants have some knowledge of the stress patterns in the speech they are exposed and they have learned that these patterns are meaningful.|$|E
25|$|One {{consequence}} of the fires in 2003 has been the increased density of invasive and non-native plant species that have quickly colonized burned areas, especially those {{that had already been}} burned in the previous 15 years. Because shrubs in these communities are adapted to a particular historical fire regime, altered fire regimes may change the selective pressures on plants and favor invasive and non-native species that <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> exploit the novel post-fire conditions.|$|E
25|$|Scholars and {{agencies}} have suggested various strategies to help street children, {{many of which}} focus {{on the use of}} NGOs. A.B. Bose of UNICEF and Sarah Thomas de Benitez of the Consortium for Street Children suggest that the main responsibility of assistance should be given to NGOs, which should be backed financially by the government. Because NGOs have the ability to be more flexible than the government, they <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> meet the needs of street children in varied circumstances.|$|E
50|$|CHFS is a {{groundbreaking}} project that collects micro-level financial information about Chinese households {{all over the}} country. This includes information about housing and financial assets; liabilities and credit restraints; income and expenditures; social security and insurance; intergenerational transfer payments; demographic characteristics; employment status and payment habits; and many others. The resulting data provides domestic and foreign researchers with a valuable information resource. By collecting and analyzing this information, China <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> understand itself and the world <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> understand China.|$|R
50|$|Researchers Ap Dijksterhuis, Maarten W. Bos, Loran F.

The studies supported the deliberation-without-attention effect: conscious thinkers <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make normatively more desirable choices between simple products, but unconscious thinkers <b>were</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> choose between complex products. Furthermore, after making a complex decision, conscious thinkers {{were less likely to be}} satisfied with their choice than unconscious thinkers.|$|R

25|$|After {{the arrival}} of the Bantu, the Khoisan and their {{pastoral}} or hunter-gatherer ways of life remained predominant west of the Fish River in South Africa and in deserts throughout their region, where the drier climate precluded the growth of Bantu crops suited for warmer and wetter climates. During the colonial era, the Khoisan survived in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. Today many of the San live in parts of the Kalahari Desert where they <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> preserve much of their culture and lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|The final {{government}} regulation towards increased demand is recycled product labeling. When producers {{are required to}} label their packaging with amount of recycled material in the product (including the packaging), consumers <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make educated choices. Consumers with sufficient buying power can then choose more environmentally conscious options, prompt producers {{to increase the amount}} of recycled material in their products, and indirectly increase demand. Standardized recycling labeling can also have a positive effect on supply of recyclates if the labeling includes information on how and where the product can be recycled.|$|E

In terms of who migrates, circular migrant workers {{are more likely to}} be male, have primary education, and come from more rural and less developed areas. Education, gender, age, and the reasons for return from the first migration all affect the choice of migration form. In addition, circular migration rates are high among the poor.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} said that {{transmitters}} with vacuum tubes <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> survive lightning strikes than transistor transmitters do. While it was commonly believed that at RF power levels above approximately 20 kilowatts, vacuum tubes were more efficient than solid-state circuits, this is no longer the case, especially in medium wave (AM broadcast) service where solid-state transmitters at nearly all power levels have measurably higher efficiency. FM broadcast transmitters with solid-state power amplifiers up to approximately 15kW also show better overall power efficiency than tube-based power amplifiers.|$|E
25|$|The free Zafimaniry {{class is}} {{expected}} to marry other Zafimaniry in order to form social alliances that will provide them with access to new land for cultivation. Since the descendants of slaves could not marry free Zafimaniry to access land, they often choose a spouse from former slave castes in the areas where they migrate for seasonal wage labor. Consequently the descendants of slaves have more relatives outside of Zafimaniry country and <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{send their children to}} live with relatives to attend higher quality schools outside Zafimaniry country; the descendants of Zafimaniry slaves are therefore better educated on average than the free Zafimaniry.|$|E
25|$|As {{the global}} {{temperature}} of the Earth warms each year, many butterfly species are forced to shift northward {{in order to keep}} living in their preferred climates. Scientists have found that migratory species, such as monarch butterflies, <b>are</b> <b>better</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> adapt to the rising temperatures than sedentary species, such as Glanville fritillaries. Glanville fritillaries will migrate around the Åland Islands to different habitat patches, but they will not embark on great transcontinental seasonal migrations like other butterflies do. Because of this they are very susceptible to climate change, which is something to keep in mind when considering plans to aid in the conservation of this species.|$|E
