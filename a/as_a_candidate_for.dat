Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing to appear in court.|$|E

5|$|The {{shoreline}} {{was still}} at a higher altitude than today, with the Sisimiut valley east of the Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay, partially under sea. Many artifacts and graves from the several centuries of permanent settlement remain scattered in the region. Rich in fauna, the coastal region from Sisimiut to Kangaamiut was particularly attractive for migrants, and due to {{a large number of}} historical artifacts it is currently listed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the UNESCO World Heritage Site, with the application received in 2003.|$|E

5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics. He allowed his name to be put forth <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the United States House of Representatives in the December 1788 election, but lost to Fisher Ames, apparently because Ames was a stronger supporter of the Constitution, a more popular position. Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|E
5|$|After {{his service}} in the House, Brown took a break from politics, but re-entered the {{political}} arena <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> governor of Kentucky in 1891. He secured the Democratic nomination in a four-way primary election, then convincingly won the general election over his Republican challenger, Andrew T. Wood. Brown's administration, and the state Democratic Party, were split between gold standard supporters (including Brown) and supporters of the free coinage of silver. Brown's {{was also the first}} administration to operate under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, and most of the legislature's time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to the new constitution. Consequently, little of significance was accomplished during Brown's term.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} as governor, Brown again {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing to Republican Walter Evans. He would later claim that he had only run {{in order to improve}} Democratic voter turnout for William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential bid. Prior to the 1899 Democratic nominating convention, Brown was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial nominee, but he declined to become a candidate. When the convention began, he was mentioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> convention chairman, but he also refused to serve in this capacity.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the Illinois {{state senate}} in 1996, Obama {{had said that}} he favored legalizing {{same-sex}} marriage. By {{the time of his}} Senate run in 2004, he said that he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, but he opposed same-sex marriages for strategic reasons. On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.|$|E
5|$|At the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Democrats {{nominated}} William Jennings Bryan {{for president}} and adopted a platform calling for the free coinage of silver.

At the new party's state convention in Louisville, Buckner's name was proposed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> vice president.

5|$|Calhoun {{began his}} {{political}} career in the House of Representatives. As a prominent leader of the war hawk faction, Calhoun strongly supported the War of 1812 to defend American honor against British infractions of American independence and neutrality during the Napoleonic Wars. He then served as Secretary of War under President James Monroe, and in this position reorganized and modernized the War Department. Calhoun was {{a candidate for the}} presidency in the 1824 election. After failing to gain support, he let his name be put forth <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> vice president. The Electoral College elected Calhoun for vice president by an overwhelming majority. He served under John Quincy Adams and continued under Andrew Jackson, who defeated Adams in the election of 1828.|$|E
5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he {{took control of the}} country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Bradley's {{name was}} again put before the General Assembly <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the U.S. Senate, {{but he was}} {{defeated}} by James B.

Upon the unsolicited recommendation of Senator Beck, President Benjamin Harrison nominated Bradley as Minister to Korea in 1889, but Bradley declined the nomination, opting to remain in Kentucky and pursue future political opportunities there. He was elected to the Republican National Committee three times between 1890 and 1896. In 1896, he was the Kentucky delegation's choice for Presidential nominee.|$|E
