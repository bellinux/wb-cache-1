5|$|Russia's western borders needed support, and fortresses existed or {{were being}} built in Latvia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The concept of {{building}} <b>a</b> <b>fortress</b> in Lithuania was discussed without result in 1796, but became a critical concern after the French invasion of Russia in 1812 led by Napoleon. The Grande Armée managed to cross the Nemunas near Kaunas on its drive towards Moscow without major difficulties. An increasingly unified Germany troubled the Empire {{during the second half}} of the century. <b>A</b> <b>fortress</b> in Kaunas would present an obstacle to attacks from the west, preventing further incursions towards Riga and Vilnius. In order to control the region, attackers would need to first neutralize Kaunas. Facing this possibility and evaluating the natural advantages of the city, Russian officials decided to construct <b>a</b> <b>fortress</b> there. After several delays, on July 7, 1879 Tsar Alexander II issued an edict ordering its construction.|$|E

His regime carries out brutal torture and grips the city in fear. He is later tormented by thunder strikes and magical, ghostly appearances of previously tortured subjects. As the black population revolts against his rule, he finds himself alone and deserted. In this state he commits suicide by shooting himself. His body is taken {{to be buried in}} <b>a</b> <b>fortress</b> on a mountain and this becomes his mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|On April 1 Army Group B {{found itself}} {{completely}} surrounded in the Ruhr by the U.S. First and Ninth Armies.

He further ordered that its physical economic infrastructure – the heart of Germany's industrial power – be destroyed by Army Group B to prevent it falling into Allied hands.

5|$|The Patriarchal Cathedral of the Holy Ascension of God {{is located}} {{on top of the}} Tsarevets hill, {{overlooking}} the modern city of Veliko Tarnovo.

5|$|The castle was {{embedded}} within an ornamental landscape, with two gardens laid {{out at the}} same time as the castle was founded and a third created later. Wressle was intended as a high-status residence rather than <b>a</b> <b>fortress</b> and was never besieged. However, it was held by Parliament during the English Civil War and demolished in 1646–50. Nearly 150 years later, it was further damaged by fire and all that remains above ground of the building is the south range.|$|E

5|$|The city of Vijithapura, {{which the}} Mahavamsa {{refers to as}} Vijitha Nagara, had been founded nearly three hundred {{years ago by the}} brother in law of king Panduvasudeva.

5|$|The {{wealth of}} Fatimid {{architecture}} {{was found in}} the main cities of Mahdia (921–948), Al-Mansuriya (948–973) and Cairo (973–1169). The heartland of architectural activity and expression during Fatimid rule was at al-Qahira, the old city of Cairo, on {{the eastern side of the}} Nile, where many of the palaces, mosques and other buildings were built. Al-Aziz Billah (ruled 975–996) is generally considered to have been the most extensive of Fatimid builders, credited with at least thirteen major landmarks including the Golden Palace, the Cairo Mosque, <b>a</b> <b>fortress,</b> a belvedere, a bridge and public baths.|$|E
5|$|Under Spanish Crown rule, {{the town}} of Gibraltar fell into severe decline. The end of Muslim rule in Spain and the Christian capture of the {{southern}} ports considerably decreased the peninsula's strategic value. It derived some minor economic value from tuna-fishing and wine-producing industries but its usefulness as <b>a</b> <b>fortress</b> was now limited. It was effectively reduced {{to the status of}} an unremarkable stronghold on a rocky promontory and Marbella replaced it as the principal Spanish port in the region.|$|E

5|$|After the siege, Maltese {{military}} engineer Girolamo Cassar drew up {{plans to}} reduce Mdina's size by half {{and turning it}} into <b>a</b> <b>fortress,</b> but these were never implemented due to protests by the city's nobles. The city's main gate was reconstructed in the early 17th century, but the next major alterations were not made until the 1650s, when the large De Redin Bastion was built at {{the centre of the}} land front. Despite these modifications, by 1658 there were also proposals to abandon or demolish the entire fortress due to its state of disrepair, although these plans were opposed by the locals. In the late 17th century, some of Mdina's medieval double walls began to be encased in sloping ramparts.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the siege}} {{consumed}} {{a large part}} of the Caliphate's manpower and resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine frontier in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured <b>a</b> <b>fortress</b> near Melitene and in 718 Amr ibn Qais raided the frontier. On the Byzantine side, the numbers are unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (which might have been neglected following his deposition), the Byzantines could count on the assistance of the Bulgars, with whom Leo concluded a treaty that possibly included alliance against the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} revolutionary {{movement}} was uncertain whether {{to destroy the}} prison, to reoccupy it as <b>a</b> <b>fortress</b> {{with members of the}} volunteer guard militia, or to preserve it intact as a permanent revolutionary monument. The revolutionary leader Mirabeau eventually settled the matter by symbolically starting the destruction of the battlements himself, after which a panel of five experts was appointed by the Permanent Committee of the Hôtel de Ville to manage the demolition of the castle. One of these experts was Pierre-François Palloy, a bourgeois entrepreneur who claimed vainqueur status for his role during the taking of the Bastille, and he rapidly assumed control over the entire process. Palloy's team worked quickly and by November most of the fortress had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time Japan's 10th Army was {{storming}} Yuhuatai, a rugged plateau situated {{directly in front of}} Zhonghua Gate on Nanking's southern side. The 10th Army's progress was slow and casualties were heavy as Yuhuatai was built like <b>a</b> <b>fortress</b> of interlocking pillboxes and trenches manned by three Chinese divisions, including the German-trained 88th Division, though the Chinese were also apt to counterattack and some Japanese units were forced to spend more time defending than attacking. Close to every single man that the 88th Division had deployed on Yuhuatai was killed in action, including three of its four regimental commanders and both of its brigade commanders, but in the process the Japanese were made to suffer 2,240 casualties including 566 dead. Yuhuatai was finally overrun at noon on December 12.|$|E
