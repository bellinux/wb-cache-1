5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars {{without the need for}} naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would <b>always</b> <b>get</b> through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E

25|$|Piaget studied {{areas of}} {{intelligence}} like perception and memory {{that are not}} entirely logical. Logical concepts are described as being completely reversible because they can <b>always</b> <b>get</b> back to the starting point. The perceptual concepts Piaget studied could not be manipulated. To describe the figurative process, Piaget uses pictures as examples. Pictures can’t be separated because contours cannot {{be separated from the}} forms they outline. Memory is the same way. It is never completely reversible. During this last period of work, Piaget and his colleague Inhelder also published books on perception, memory, and other figurative processes such as learning.|$|E

25|$|The American command {{did not see}} {{the need}} for {{long-range}} fighters in 1942, and like Bomber Command in the early war period, believed the bomber would <b>always</b> <b>get</b> through. On that understanding, there was no rush to develop fighter aircraft of this type. The twin-engined mid-range Lockheed P-38 Lightning had been designed as a high-altitude interceptor and was adequate in the escort role. Production had not yet reached the output needed and losses in the Mediterranean had diverted the P-38 strength there. As an interim solution the Americans were given the British Spitfire, but it lacked the range to reach beyond the coastal areas of western Europe.|$|E
25|$|When {{two people}} look at two {{different}} detectors that scan entangled particles, both observers will enter an indefinite state, as with one observer. These results need not agree – the second observer's mind {{does not have to}} have results that correlate with the first's. When one observer tells the results to the second observer, their two minds cannot communicate and thus will only interact with the other's body, which is still indefinite. When the second observer responds, its body will respond with whatever result agrees with the first observer's mind. This means that both observer's minds will be in a state of the wavefunction that <b>always</b> <b>get</b> the expected results, but individually their results could be different.|$|E
25|$|The scheme {{relies on}} two {{properties}} of entanglement. First, the entangled states are perfectly correlated {{in the sense}} that if Alice and Bob both measure whether their particles have vertical or horizontal polarizations, they <b>always</b> <b>get</b> the same answer with 100% probability. The same is true if they both measure any other pair of complementary (orthogonal) polarizations. This necessitates that the two distant parties have exact directionality synchronization. However, the particular results are completely random; it is impossible for Alice to predict if she (and thus Bob) will get vertical polarization or horizontal polarization. Second, any attempt at eavesdropping by Eve destroys these correlations in a way that Alice and Bob can detect.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, {{air power}} theorists like Giulio Douhet and Billy Mitchell claimed that air forces could win wars, obviating {{the need for}} land and sea fighting. It was thought that bombers would <b>always</b> <b>get</b> through {{and could not be}} resisted, {{particularly}} at night. Industry, seats of government, factories and communications could be destroyed, depriving an opponent of the means to make war. Bombing civilians would cause a collapse of morale and a loss of production in the remaining factories. Democracies, where public opinion was allowed, were thought particularly vulnerable. The RAF and the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) adopted much of this apocalyptic thinking. The policy of RAF Bomber Command became an attempt to achieve victory through the destruction of civilian will, communications and industry.|$|E
25|$|Strategic bombing during World War I {{introduced}} {{air attacks}} intended to panic civilian targets and led in 1918 to the amalgamation of British army and navy air services into the Royal Air Force. Its first Chief of the Air Staff Hugh Trenchard {{was among the}} military strategists in the 1920s like Giulio Douhet who saw air warfare as {{a new way to}} overcome the stalemate of trench warfare. Interception was nearly impossible with fighter planes no faster than bombers. Their view (expressed vividly in 1932) was that the bomber will <b>always</b> <b>get</b> through, and the only defence was a deterrent bomber force capable of matching retaliation. Predictions were made that a bomber offensive would quickly cause thousands of deaths and civilian hysteria leading to capitulation, but widespread pacifism contributed to a reluctance to provide resources.|$|E
25|$|If a {{spaceship}} travels to a planet one light-year (as {{measured in the}} Earth's rest frame) away from Earth at high speed, the time taken to reach that planet could be {{less than one year}} as measured by the traveller's clock (although it will always be more than one year as measured by a clock on Earth). The value obtained by dividing the distance traveled, as determined in the Earth's frame, by the time taken, measured by the traveller's clock, is known as a proper speed or a proper velocity. There is no limit on the value of a proper speed as a proper speed does not represent a speed measured in a single inertial frame. A light signal that left the Earth {{at the same time as}} the traveller would <b>always</b> <b>get</b> to the destination before the traveller.|$|E

25|$|To {{illustrate}} the comparative performance of Alpha-based systems, some SPEC performance numbers (SPECint95, SPECfp95) are listed below. Note that the SPEC results claim {{to report the}} measured performance of a whole computer system (CPU, bus, memory, compiler optimizer), not just the CPU. Also note that the benchmark and scale changed from 1992 to 1995. However, the figures give a rough impression {{of the performance of}} the Alpha architecture (64-bit), compared with the contemporary HP (64-bit) and Intel-based offerings (32-bit). Perhaps the most obvious trend is that while Intel could <b>always</b> <b>get</b> reasonably close to Alpha in integer performance, in floating point performance the difference was considerable. On the other side, HP (PA-RISC) is also reasonably close to Alpha, but these CPUs are running at significantly lower clock rates (MHz). The tables lack two important values: the power consumption and the price of a CPU.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 25 November 1993, {{the second}} {{programme}} examines what happens during spring on Antarctica. The sea ice extends {{for hundreds of}} miles around the continent, {{but there are a}} few subantarctic islands that escape it. Such places are highly valued, for as the sea never freezes, animals can <b>always</b> <b>get</b> ashore. Elephant seals are the first creatures to return to the beaches. They form large breeding colonies, where the males fight fierce battles to gain and retain permanent access to a great number of females and mate with them as soon as they are receptive again. Millions of macaroni penguins occupy huge territories on the islands to breed, as do thousands of albatrosses. The Antarctic peninsula is one of the few regions of the continent inhabited by animals, even in summer. Gentoo penguins build their nests on bare rock and humpback whales seek krill along the coast, while Adelie penguins nest even further south. Crabeater seals, one of the most numerous mammals on Earth, live and reproduce in the pack ice zone around Antarctica. Snow petrels fly many miles into the island to find rock on which to lay their eggs.|$|E
