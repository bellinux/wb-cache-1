40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore how PV powered {{products}} have been designed in the past.

We will discuss how we learn from these experiences for the design <b>and</b> <b>styling</b> of future PV powered products. Because design <b>and</b> <b>styling</b> {{is considered one of the}} key features to a well-designed product, this study is relevant for the acceptability of PV products in nowadays consumer markets. Despite many studies on the technical functioning and energy performance of PV powered products, little attention has been paid to a constructive analysis of design <b>and</b> <b>styling.</b> Therefore with this study we make a start with identifying which design <b>and</b> <b>styling</b> factors can contribute to a higher appreciation for PV powered products...|$|R

Styles, James Storm, and Team 3D). The {{duration}} of the contest was 26 minutes and 45 seconds. A Lethal Lockdown match is fought under no disqualification rules, in which weapons are legal and one wrestler from each team starts the match in the cage. Afterwards, members from each team enter at time intervals until all wrestlers {{are involved in the}} bout so a pinfall or submission can occur. Cage <b>and</b> <b>Styles</b> started the match. Brother Ray, Rhino, Storm, Nash, Brother Devon, Morgan, Tomko, and Sting were the order of entrances for the contest. Shortly after Sting's entrance, a roof covered in weapons was lowered onto the cage. With Sting's participation all men were involved in the match, as such a pinfall or submission could now occur. During the encounter, Cage set up a table on top of the roof of the cage. Later, he <b>and</b> <b>Styles</b> were fighting on top of a ladder on top of the cage, when Storm pushed over the ladder causing them both to crash through the table.
