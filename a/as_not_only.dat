5|$|From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a {{great deal}} of his time and fortune on a series of {{projects}} trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He could see this <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel is well {{established}} early on <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a witness to events, but also as someone who makes observations and offers reflection. It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under French rule because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty of this world allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including his belief in the African gods.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War {{meant that}} {{construction}} {{work on the}} main college buildings could not begin until 21April 1949, when the foundation stone was laid; work on the warden's residence had begun in October 1948. Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road. There were further changes to Harrison's second design, <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings {{had to be made}} in the difficult post-war economic situation. A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was under way, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper flèche, or small spire.|$|E

5|$|With {{relation}} to the human characters, David was conceptualized <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a surrogate son for Peter Weyland, but {{as a replacement for}} Weyland's estranged daughter, Meredith Vickers. The actress who portrayed Vickers, Charlize Theron, detailed that Ridley Scott perceived Weyland's family and his company, the Weyland Corporation, as being male-dominated, with Vickers' shared DNA being the only attachment. This runs counter to David, who is a synthetic male created to supplant Vickers and uphold the family's patriarchy. Throughout the eight-month rewrite process leading directly into principal photography, Damon Lindelof focused on enhancing David's bondage to Weyland and the Prometheus- despite David being designed to be a surrogate son, he would actually be a proverbial captive to the master and his ship. With Weyland's death {{at the hands of the}} awakened Engineer, David's programming has run its course and every action he takes from thereon out is by his own volition, essentially freeing him. A philosophical element Scott raised about the David 8 model is that he exemplifies the dangers of making an android sentient- with him having the capacity for free will and the ability to create, he crosses a moral boundary that other androids stay within. The contrast between David and the others androids was developed further in , with the creation of the physically identical character Walter, who was made more robotic and unable to create on his own.|$|E

25|$|Highly acclaimed, it is {{the first}} in Attenborough's 'Life' series of {{programmes}} and was followed by The Living Planet (1984). It established Attenborough <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the foremost television naturalist, but also an iconic figure in British cultural life.|$|E
25|$|We profess Christian {{religion}} in the country, and that film that depicts some thoughts about this person called Jesus Christ that Christians adore <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> as a good man, but was himself God, and such a film basically undermines the very roots of Christianity in Solomon Islands.|$|E

25|$|In the 1830s and 1840s, {{prominent}} Protestant leaders, such as Lyman Beecher and Horace Bushnell, {{attacked the}} Catholic Church <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> theologically unsound but {{an enemy of}} republican values. Some scholars view the anti-Catholic rhetoric of Beecher and Bushnell as having contributed to anti-Irish and anti-Catholic pogroms.|$|E
25|$|Other {{television}} series appearances included a 1966 episode of Doctor Who called The Gunfighters (played by Laurence Payne), {{in which he}} is inaccurately depicted <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> present at the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, but as one of its casualties; and a 1999 episode of The Lost World (played by David Orth).|$|E
25|$|The goddess's {{reputation}} <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a protector but a huntress {{becomes much}} clearer in fourth-century statuary. Though the two Piraeus Artemises are portrayed in long dresses, {{it is perfectly}} clear from her bow and quiver {{that she is a}} huntress, while other statues of Artemis depict her in a short or double-belted dress and indicate a more active Artemis.|$|E

25|$|Co-operating with Conservative Democrats, {{he led the}} Conservative Coalition that {{opposed the}} New Deal. The Republican gains in the 1938 elections, {{combined}} {{with the creation of}} the Conservative Coalition, had stopped the expansion of the New Deal.

25|$|During the 1990s, musical acts {{including}} Toadies, Erykah Badu, and Old 97's {{began to}} gain prominence <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> local successes, but national stars. Once Deep Ellum had gained traction {{as the heart}} of music in Dallas, popular touring artists such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Radiohead, The Roots, The Notorious B.I.G., and Fugazi would book shows at venues including Trees Dallas and The Bomb Factory.|$|E
25|$|Arguments {{that slavery}} was {{undesirable}} {{for the nation}} had long existed, and early in U.S. history were made even by some prominent Southerners. After 1840, abolitionists denounced slavery <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> a social evil but a moral wrong. Activists in the new Republican Party, usually Northerners, had another view: they believed the Slave Power conspiracy was controlling the national government {{with the goal of}} extending slavery.|$|E

25|$|American {{newspaper}} The New York Sun {{reported that}} the documents described the Quds Force <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> cooperating with Shi'a death squads, but also with fighters related to al-Qaeda and Ansar al-Sunna. It said that the Quds Force had studied the Iraq situation {{in a similar manner}} to the U.S. Iraq Study Group, and had concluded that they must increase efforts with Sunni and Shiite groups in order to counter the influence of Sunni states.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the self}} {{manifested}} Deities established by Gopala Bhatta Goswami is called Radha Ramana, {{it is not surprising}} that Radha Ramana is seen <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> Krishna but also as Radha-Krishna. And worship in his temple, located in the centre of Vrindavana is a perpetual daily affair, involving several prescribed events throughout the day, with the goal of being theoretical and remote, but with aspiration of the possibility to attend and associate directly with Radha and Krishna.|$|E
25|$|The puna zone is {{composed}} of high, cold grasslands, suitable largely for pasture by camelids, the domesticated llama and alpaca, {{as well as the}} wild vicuña and guanaco. The former were used <b>as</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> as pack animals, but also for their meat and wool. Vicuñas and guanacos, though undomesticated, were used for their fine and much-prized wool. Little agriculture is performed in the puna, though in the Bolivian altiplano intensive agriculture was possible through the use of waru waru raised bed agriculture, which used specialized irrigation techniques to prevent frost from destroying crops.|$|E
