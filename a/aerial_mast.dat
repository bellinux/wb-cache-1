5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by {{the length of the}} anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the <b>aerial</b> <b>mast)</b> were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.|$|E
25|$|Between 11 and 20 April 1973, {{the ship}} {{broadcast}} for Radio Veronica while its ship, the Nordeney, was aground. Because {{of a law}} that allows pirates in distress to come ashore without arrest, the running aground had no consequences for the crew. During summer 1973, it broadcast separate stations in English and Dutch simultaneously, on 389 mtr – 773 and 252 mtr (announced as 259) 1187kHz. Two aerials and twin transmitters were used for about six weeks until the <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> failed. To accommodate the second aerial, a second short mast, {{just in front of}} the bridge, was employed as the other end for the main mast.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1980 Haringey council {{took over}} the {{trusteeship}} of Alexandra Palace from the GLC and decided to refurbish the building. But just six months later, during Capital Radio's Jazz Festival, a fire started under the organ and quickly spread. It destroyed half the building. Again the outer walls survived and the eastern parts, including the theatre and the BBC Television studios and <b>aerial</b> <b>mast,</b> were saved. Parts of the famous organ were destroyed, {{though it had been}} dismantled for repairs so some parts (including nearly all the pipework) were away from the building in store. Some of the damage to the palace was repaired immediately but Haringey council overspent on the restoration, creating a £30 million deficit. It was then reopened to the public in 1988 under a new management team headed by Louis Bizat. Later the council was heavily criticised for the overspend in a report by Project Management International.|$|E

5000|$|Constructed in 1974 [...] as {{an office}} building, Windsor House has a tall green {{elevator}} shaft and green side wall facade, as well as satellite and <b>aerial</b> <b>masts,</b> which stand a further seven metres in the air.|$|R
50|$|Near Nador is the {{transmission}} site for long- and short-wave Medi 1 Radio which broadcasts to all Maghreb countries. The <b>aerial</b> <b>masts</b> of Medi 1 Radio for long-wave are approximately 380 metres high and {{are among the}} tallest man-made structures in Africa.|$|R
500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the manufacturer's trials in April 1947, one aircraft was returned to the factory for extensive modifications as the 150M. The wing tips were angled downward 35° to reduce the lateral stability, the wing was redesigned to detach from the fuselage, and the aerodynamic balancing of the elevators was reduced from 24% to 20%. The fuel capacity was increased to , the cockpit was widened by [...] and fitted with an ejection seat. Fore and aft armor plates were fitted to protect the pilot and a new radio <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> was installed. All these changes added [...] of weight and increased drag which reduced the aircraft's top speed by , and slowed its time to [...] from 4.8 to 7.2 minutes in comparison to the unmodified aircraft. Given that a higher-performance design, the Aircraft 156, had already been submitted for state acceptance trials, Semyon Lavochkin decided not to continue the development of the 150M.|$|E
2500|$|WDAZ-TV {{broadcasts}} from a [...] high guy-wired <b>aerial</b> <b>mast,</b> {{making it}} the third tallest tower in North Dakota after the KVLY-TV tower and the KRDK-TV tower. The tower is located in Dahlen, North Dakota, roughly located between Grand Forks and Devils Lake. The tower was also used by KGFE of Grand Forks until an ice storm damaged equipment in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|At {{about the}} same time new VHF T/R Type 1133 radios started {{replacing}} the HF TR9 sets. The pilots enjoyed a much clearer reception, which was a big advantage with the adoption of Wing formations throughout the RAF in 1941. The new installation meant that the wire running between the <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> and rudder could be removed, as could the triangular [...] "prong" [...] on the mast.|$|E
50|$|The final {{approach}} from both directions is straightforward. There are {{high voltage electricity}} pylons less than 1 km south of runway 19 and several <b>aerial</b> <b>masts</b> 1345' AMSL to the 2 km NE of airfield. There are houses and trees close to threshold of runway 01 reducing the available landing distance on this runway.|$|R
50|$|On 6 November 1988 two new <b>aerial</b> <b>masts</b> {{were taken}} out to the Ross Revenge. On 4 January 1989 were taken aboard to give the ship as much {{stability}} as possible while erecting the new transmitter masts. On 12 February the front mast had been rebuilt bar one section, and the shortwave aerial had been restored. The work on the two new masts continued until May.|$|R
50|$|In 1919, two 450 ft <b>aerial</b> <b>masts</b> {{were added}} to the site. In 1920, a number of {{licences}} were issued by the General Post Office in accordance with the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1904, for the purpose of conducting experimental transmissions. The first occurred from New Street Works on 15 June 1920, featuring Dame Nellie Melba singing two arias and her famous trill, with the signal received throughout Europe and as far away as Newfoundland, Canada. The event today is commemorated by a blue plaque.|$|R
2500|$|In 1939, several {{changes were}} made to the Hurricane. The {{powerplant}} was changed to the Merlin III driving a de Havilland or Rotol constant speed metal propeller. Ejector exhaust stacks were fitted for added thrust. The fabric covered wings were replaced by re-stressed metal-covered wings. An armour-glass panel was incorporated {{on the front of the}} windscreen. The [...] "rod" [...] <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> was replaced by a streamlined, tapered design.|$|E
2500|$|The KWQC-TV Tower is a [...] high guy-wired <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> for the {{transmission}} of FM radio and television programs in Bettendorf, west of the Scott Community College campus. (Geographical coordinates: [...] ). It was built in 1982. In addition to the former KWQC analog signal, WHBF-TV and radio stations WOC, and WLLR-FM, both former sister stations of KWQC-TV (as WOC-TV), as well as religious WDLM-FM, and NPR member station WVIK, transmit their signals from this site.|$|E
2500|$|To help {{balance the}} new engine, the radio {{equipment}} was moved further {{back in the}} rear fuselage and the access hatch was moved from the left fuselage side to the right. Better VHF radio equipment allowed for the <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> to be removed and replaced by a [...] "whip" [...] aerial further aft on the fuselage spine. Because the longer nose and the increased slipstream of the big five-bladed propeller a new tail unit with a taller, broader fin and a rudder of increased area was adopted.|$|E
50|$|Two {{physical}} layout plans were used, either 'East Coast' or 'West Coast'. West Coast sites replaced the steel lattice towers with simpler guy-stayed masts, although they retained the same wooden towers for reception. East Coast sites had {{transmitter and receiver}} blocks protected with earth mounds and blast walls, along with separate reserve transmitter and receivers in small bunkers with attached 120 ft <b>aerial</b> <b>masts.</b> These reserves were {{in close proximity to}} the respective transmitter/receiver sites, often in a neighbouring field. West Coast sites relied on site dispersal for protection, duplicating the entire transmitter and receiver buildings.|$|R
50|$|The {{section of}} {{rainforest}} selected {{was typical of}} North Queensland and contained 70 different tree species of varying sizes. Four lanes centered on the tower were set up with instrumentation and one 200 foot wide lane was cleared of vegetation except for select trees to study the impact with varying distances from ground zero. Furthermore, approximately 17,000 trees were catalogued {{to determine the effects}} of the blast. Military equipment including light and heavy weapons, mortar pits, ammunition, trenches, <b>aerial</b> <b>masts,</b> wireless communication equipment and cables were also positioned around the blast site, complete with simulated troops.|$|R
5|$|Aside {{from the}} GCCS operations, the General Post Office (GPO) {{established}} a training school, and a women's {{teacher training college}} was opened in 1948. The Ministry of Aviation also opened the Navaid training school on part of the site. The GPO had blocks built in the south-east area of the site, and other blocks were adapted from their original conditions for new uses. The CTS division of GCHQ remained on the site within Blocks C and D until 1987. <b>Aerial</b> <b>masts</b> which had been erected by the division became unusable after the nearby train line was electrified, and were removed the year CTS left.|$|R
2500|$|The new {{structure}} was a frameless plexiglas moulding which ballooned outwards {{at the top}} and sides, increasing the headroom and allowing increased visibility to the sides and rear. Because the {{new structure}} slid backward on runners, it could be slid open in flight. The <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> behind the canopy was replaced by a [...] "whip" [...] aerial which was mounted further aft and offset to the right. Most British Mk IIIs were equipped with Malcolm hoods. Several American service groups [...] "acquired" [...] the necessary conversion kits and some American P-51B/P-51Cs appeared with the new canopy, although the majority continued to use the original framed canopies.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in September 1940, IFF {{equipment}} was installed. This weighed about 40lb (18kg) {{and could be}} identified by wire aerials strung between the tailplane tips and rear fuselage. Although the added weight and the aerials reduced maximum speed by about two mph (three km/h), it allowed the aircraft {{to be identified as}} [...] "friendly" [...] on radar: lack of such {{equipment was}} a factor leading to the Battle of Barking Creek. At about the same time new VHF T/R Type 1133 radios started replacing the HF TR9 sets. These had first been fitted to Spitfires of 54 and 66 Squadrons in May 1940, but ensuing production delays meant the bulk of Spitfires and Hurricanes were not fitted for another five months. The pilots enjoyed a much clearer reception which was a big advantage with the adoption of Wing formations throughout the RAF in 1941. The new installation meant that the wire running between the <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> and rudder could be removed, as could the triangular [...] "prong" [...] on the mast.|$|E
2500|$|A voltage {{regulator}} under a black, cylindrical cover was mounted {{low on the}} back of frame 11, directly behind the pilot's seat:starting in the N30xx series this was repositioned higher, appearing low in the rear transparency. From N32xx the regulator was mounted directly behind the pilot's headrest on frame 11. Other changes were made later in 1939 when a simplified design of pitot tube was introduced and the [...] "rod" [...] <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> was replaced by a streamlined, tapered design. To improve protection for the pilot and fuel tanks a thick laminated glass bulletproof plate was fitted to the curved, one piece windscreen and a 3mm thick cover of light alloy, capable of deflecting small calibre rounds, was fitted {{over the top of the}} two fuel tanks. From about mid-1940, 73 pounds (33kg) of armoured steel plating was provided in the form of head and back protection on the seat bulkhead and covering the forward face of the glycol header tank. In addition, the lower petrol tank was fitted with a fire-resistant covering called [...] "Linatex", which was later replaced with a layer of self-sealing rubber.|$|E
5|$|On 2 January 1941 Cunningham nearly added a third. The Germans {{attacked}} Cardiff in the city's heaviest raid of the war. Cunningham engaged an He 111 {{with an even}} {{spread of}} three <b>aerial</b> <b>masts</b> along its rear fuselage—indicative of a pathfinder. He expended all the Beaufighter's ammunition against it from the working cannons—one cannon jammed. It dived into clouds at 10,000 feet at an angle of 50 degrees. A 2./KGr 100 machine returned to France with a wounded gunner and Cunningham received credit for a probable victory. On 12 January he claimed a damaged He 111—his first with operator Jimmy Rawnsley. Cunningham was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 28 January 1941 for his achievements, including 25 night sorties.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} four {{different}} railcars on the line, {{all of which}} are Wickham trolleys, starting with Air Ministry No. 1 (works number 5864) arriving in 1951, in Air Force Blue livery; it was repainted into yellow and black (Civil Aviation Authority colours) in the 1960s and sold to Manx Electric Railway in 1977. It has since been sold to a private owner and shipped to the UK in June 2007 for restoration. The second car was CAA No. 2 (works number 7642) arriving in 1957 in Air Force Blue livery, again repainted into yellow and black in the 1960s. It was returned to Wickham Rail in 1991 as part exchange for No. 4 and possibly re-exported to Southern Africa. No. 3 (works number 10956) arrived in 1977 and is currently reserve vehicle for the final car, No. 4 (works number 11730) which arrived in 1991 and is currently in use by National Air Traffic Services (the successor of the Air Ministry and Civil Aviation Authority). The vehicles were used to maintain the <b>aerial</b> <b>masts</b> at the top of Snaefell mountain.|$|R
5000|$|Signals vehicle. Originally {{mounted on}} the QLC chassis/cab, special QLR chassis were soon put into production, which {{differed}} from the standard type in having special electrical equipment, radio suppression, fitment of a 660 W auxiliary generator driven by the transfer case power-take-off and, like the QLT, two 16 gallon petrol tanks instead of one behind the cab. The interior furniture, partitioning and radio equipment varied from the different functions. On vehicles installed for the wireless role, a tent could be erected at the rear. Between cab and man body were lockers for <b>aerial</b> <b>masts</b> and other equipment. Beneath the body were further lockers and racks for cable drums, batteries, tyre chains, 20 gallon drinking water tank, rectifier box, tools, fuel tank for the auxiliary engine, jerrycans and other items. The basic body shells were produced by Duple, Lagonda, Mulliner, Tickford and others. A revised body was introduced in during 1944 for the Command High and Low Power and Wireless High Power roles. This body had an improved [...] "L"-shaped tent which could be erected alongside the left-hand side and rear of the body.|$|R
2500|$|The Typhoon {{was first}} {{produced}} with forward-opening [...] "car door" [...] style cockpit doors (complete with wind-down windows), with a transparent [...] "roof" [...] hinged to {{open to the}} left. The first 162 Typhoons featured a built-up metal-skinned dorsal fairing behind the pilot's armoured headrest; the mast for the radio aerial protruded through the fairing. From mid- to late 1941 the solid metal aft dorsal fairing was replaced with a transparent structure (later nicknamed [...] "The Coffin Hood"), the pilot's head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape and the side cut-outs were fitted with armoured glass; the first production Typhoon to be fitted with this new structure was R7803. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified. From early 1942 a rear-view mirror was mounted in a perspex blister moulded into the later [...] "car-door" [...] canopy roofs. This modification was not very successful, because the mirror was subject to vibration. Despite the new canopy structure, the pilot's visibility was still restricted by the heavy frames and the clutter of equipment under the rear canopy; from August 1943, as an interim measure, pending {{the introduction of the}} new [...] "bubble" [...] canopy and cut-down dorsal fairing, the <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> and its associated bracing was removed and replaced with a whip aerial further back on the rear fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{performance}} {{increase was}} described by Jeffrey Quill as a [...] "quantum leap" [...] over that of the Mk VB and another Spitfire airframe, R6700 was modified to take the new engine. Although design work on the Mk VII and VIII series was under way, these would take over {{a year to get}} into production and a counter to the Fw 190 was urgently needed. The Air Ministry made the decision that Mk VC airframes should be converted to take the more powerful engine and, as a result, many of the early IXs were converted Mk VCs which did not have any of the refinements which later appeared. These could be identified by the Type C wing with the large double blisters over the inner cannon bays and the identification light on the fuselage spine, behind the <b>aerial</b> <b>mast.</b> The elevator horns were also smaller in size than that of most Mk IXs which had larger horn balances. The first IX was a modified VC AB505, which was tested by the Air Fighting Development Unit (AFDU) in April 1942. The report said;The performance of the Spitfire IX is outstandingly better than the Spitfire V especially at heights above 20,000 feet. On the level the Spitfire is considerably faster and climb is exceptionally good. It will climb easily to 38,000 feet and when levelled off there can be made to climb in stages to above 40,000 feet by building up speed on the level and a slight zoom. Its manoeuvrability is as good as a Spitfire V up to 30,000 feet and above is very much better. At 38,000 feet it is capable of a true speed of 368mph and is still able to manoeuvre well for fighting. Although the Mk IX's airframe did not have the aerodynamic and strength improvements, or the modified control surfaces of the Mk VII and VIII, the Mk IX still proved to be an effective counter to the Focke Wulf Fw 190.|$|E

50|$|The main VHF/FM {{transmitter}} {{moved to}} Holme Moss on 92.4 MHz, covering most of West Yorkshire. Unusually, this transmitter also transmits neighbouring services Radio Manchester and Radio Sheffield from separate directional <b>aerials</b> on the <b>mast.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first {{transmitter}}, {{built in}} 1939 during the Phoney War, used an <b>aerial</b> with four <b>masts</b> and a transmitter rated at 500 kilowatts. [...] It {{was destroyed in}} 1944 during the scorched earth retreat by German forces.|$|R
50|$|The Zeesen short-wave {{transmitter}} was a 70-metre-high shortwave radio transmission mast constructed at Zeesen in Germany in 1931. Consisting of a lattice tower of pitch pine timbers, {{it was one}} of Germany's first short-wave broadcasting transmitters. It was equipped with four transmitting arms, at 90-degree separation, surmounted by two omnidirectional aerials. In 1939, the wooden tower was replaced by a 70-metre high steel mast with a single omnidirectional <b>aerial.</b> This <b>mast</b> was dismantled, together with all the Zeesen transmitters, in 1945.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1960s this <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> was demounted and the current {{installation}} built. It consists of: ...|$|E
50|$|The KDLT {{tower is}} a 609.2 m high guy-wired <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> for the {{transmission}} of FM and TV programmes in Rowena, South Dakota, United States. The KDLT tower was completed in 1998 and is owned by Red River Broadcast Co., LLC.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: K9795, the 9th {{production}} Mk I, with 19 Squadron, {{showing the}} wooden, two-blade, fixed-pitch propeller, early [...] "unblown" [...] canopy and [...] "wraparound" [...] windscreen without the bulletproof glass plate. The original style of <b>aerial</b> <b>mast</b> is also fitted.|$|E
5000|$|The Erching {{transmitter}} [...] was a longwave broadcasting facility of the Voice of America, {{established in}} 1953 near Erching, Bavaria, Germany. The transmitter used a 256 metre high guyed-steel-framework <b>mast</b> <b>aerial,</b> {{at the time}} of its inauguration the most powerful radio station in the world with a transmitting power of 1000 kilowatts ...|$|R
50|$|The {{height of}} antennas differ by usage. For some {{non-directional}} beacons (NDBs) the height {{can be as}} low as 10 meters, while for more powerful navigation transmitters such as DECCA, masts with a height around 100 meters are used. T-antennas have a height between 50 and 200 meters, while <b>mast</b> <b>aerials</b> are usually taller than 150 meters.|$|R
50|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, Königs Wusterhausen {{was part}} of the Soviet {{occupation}} zone and several masts were taken down by order of the military government, though the station remained in use for broadcasting in East Germany. The Central Tower collapsed during the Cyclone Quimburga on 15 November 1972. At the date of German reunification in 1990, there was only one 210 m high mast with a longwave <b>aerial,</b> two <b>masts</b> for a T-aerial for medium wave and some small towers. The remaining transmitters for mediumwave, shortwave and longwave were shut down between 1992 and 1999 and the whole area was transformed into a museum, which is marked by the 210-metre-high mast.|$|R
