5|$|Specific <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> {{are related}} to the {{antiretroviral}} agent taken. Some relatively common <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> include: lipodystrophy syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, especially with protease inhibitors. Other common symptoms include diarrhea, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects. Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} {{metformin}} overdoses reported to poison control centers {{over a five-year}} period found serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were rare, though the elderly appeared to be at greater risk. A similar study in which cases were reported to Texas poison control centers between 2000 and 2006 found ingested doses of more than 5,000mg were more likely to involve serious medical outcomes in adults. Survival following intentional overdoses with up to 63,000mg (63g) of metformin have been reported. Fatalities following overdose are rare. In healthy children, unintentional doses of less than 1,700mg are unlikely to cause significant toxic effects.|$|E
50|$|In {{clinical}} trials, {{a distinction}} is made between an <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> {{and a serious}} <b>adverse</b> <b>event.</b> Generally, any event which causes death, permanent damage, birth defects, or requires hospitalization is considered a serious <b>adverse</b> <b>event.</b> The results of trials are often included in the labelling of the medication to provide information both for patients and the prescribing physicians.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{fundamental}} principles of <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> reporting is the determination of what constitutes an Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR). During the triage phase of a potential <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> report, {{it is important to}} determine if the [...] "four elements" [...] of a valid ICSR are present: (1) an identifiable patient, (2) an identifiable reporter, (3) a suspect drug, and (4) an <b>adverse</b> <b>event.</b>|$|R

5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E
25|$|When used on children, {{acupuncture}} {{is considered}} safe when administered by well-trained, licensed practitioners using sterile needles; however, a 2011 review found there was limited research to draw definite {{conclusions about the}} overall safety of pediatric acupuncture. The same review found 279 <b>adverse</b> <b>events,</b> 25 of them serious. The <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were mostly mild in nature (e.g. bruising or bleeding). The prevalence of mild <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> ranged from 10.1% to 13.5%, an estimated 168 incidences among 1,422 patients. On rare occasions <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were serious (e.g. cardiac rupture or hemoptysis); many {{might have been a}} result of substandard practice. The incidence of serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> was 5 per one million, which included children and adults.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the Canadian <b>Adverse</b> <b>Events</b> Study {{found that}} <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> {{occurred}} {{in more than}} 7% of hospital admissions, and estimated that 9,000 to 24,000 Canadians die annually after an avoidable medical error.|$|E

25|$|When {{used during}} pregnancy, the {{majority}} of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> caused by acupuncture were mild and transient, with few serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> The most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain, followed by bleeding. Although two deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death) were reported, {{there was a lack}} of acupuncture-associated maternal mortality. Limiting the evidence as certain, probable or possible in the causality evaluation, the estimated incidence of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> following acupuncture in pregnant women was 131 per 10,000.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} Chinese-language literature found numerous acupuncture-related <b>adverse</b> <b>events,</b> including pneumothorax, fainting, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and infection as the most frequent, and cardiovascular injuries, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pneumothorax, and recurrent cerebral hemorrhage as the most serious, {{most of which were}} due to improper technique. Between 1980 and 2009, the Chinese-language literature reported 479 <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> Prospective surveys show that mild, transient acupuncture-associated <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> ranged from 6.71% to 15%. In a study with 190,924 patients, the prevalence of serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> was roughly 0.024%. Another study showed a rate of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> requiring specific treatment of 2.2%, 4,963 incidences among 229,230 patients. Infections, mainly hepatitis, after acupuncture are reported often in English-language research, though are rarely reported in Chinese-language research, making it plausible that acupuncture-associated infections have been underreported in China. Infections were mostly caused by poor sterilization of acupuncture needles. Other <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> included spinal epidural hematoma (in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine), chylothorax, injuries of abdominal organs and tissues, injuries in the neck region, injuries to the eyes, including orbital hemorrhage, traumatic cataract, injury of the oculomotor nerve and retinal puncture, hemorrhage to the cheeks and the hypoglottis, peripheral motor-nerve injuries and subsequent motor dysfunction, local allergic reactions to metal needles, stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage after acupuncture.|$|E
25|$|A {{causal link}} between {{acupuncture}} and the <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> cardiac arrest, pyknolepsy, shock, fever, cough, thirst, aphonia, leg numbness, and sexual dysfunction remains uncertain. The same review concluded that acupuncture {{can be considered}} inherently safe when practiced by properly trained practitioners, but the review also stated {{there is a need}} to find effective strategies to minimize the health risks. Between 1999 and 2010, the Republic of Korean-literature contained reports of 1104 <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> Between the 1980s and 2002, the Japanese-language literature contained reports of 150 <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E

25|$|A 2012 review found {{a number}} of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were {{reported}} after acupuncture in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) but most (95%) were not severe, though miscategorization and under-reporting may alter the total figures. From January 2009 to December 2011, 468 safety incidents were recognized within the NHS organizations. The <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> recorded included retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse side effects (12%). Acupuncture practitioners should know, {{and be prepared to}} be responsible for, any substantial harm from treatments.

25|$|A 2013 {{systematic}} {{review of the}} English-language case reports found that serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> associated with acupuncture are rare, but that acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011 the English-language literature from 25 countries and regions reported 294 <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> The majority of the reported <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were relatively minor, and the incidences were low. For example, a prospective survey of 34,000 acupuncture treatments found no serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> and 43 minor ones, a rate of 1.3 per 1000 interventions. Another survey found there were 7.1% minor <b>adverse</b> <b>events,</b> of which 5 were serious, amid 97,733 acupuncture patients. The most common adverse effect observed was infection (e.g. mycobacterium), {{and the majority of}} infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site. Infection has also resulted from skin contact with unsterilized equipment or with dirty towels in an unhygienic clinical setting. Other adverse complications included five reported cases of spinal cord injuries (e.g. migrating broken needles or needling too deeply), four brain injuries, four peripheral nerve injuries, five heart injuries, seven other organ and tissue injuries, bilateral hand edema, epithelioid granuloma, pseudolymphoma, argyria, pustules, pancytopenia, and scarring due to hot-needle technique. Adverse reactions from acupuncture, which are unusual and uncommon in typical acupuncture practice, included syncope, galactorrhoea, bilateral nystagmus, pyoderma gangrenosum, hepatotoxicity, eruptive lichen planus, and spontaneous needle migration.|$|E
