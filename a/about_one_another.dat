5|$|Yui {{is a big}} fan and {{initially}} an assistant to Girls Dead Monster. She {{is known to be}} hyperactive and talks extremely fast. Hinata finds Yui annoying, which results in bouts {{between the two of them}} though in truth, they truly care <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> saying that had they met before they died, they would have fallen in love with one another. She wears a devil tail and shackle bracelets on her wrists, giving her an image of an imp or devil. She also has wings hidden by her hair on her back. After Iwasawa's departure, Yui becomes the new rhythm guitarist and vocalist of Girls Dead Monster, as well as its leader. Yui plays a Gibson SG Special electric guitar. She later becomes a part of the main SSS, following them along on missions, though she does not contribute much. In life, she was hit by a car and was paralyzed from a young age as a result. Her regret was not being able to do anything with her body. Otonashi helps fulfill most of her wishes that include many things she saw on TV when she was alive, although it is Hinata who fulfills her last desire to be married by proposing to her.|$|E

25|$|If Agnes is the fulcrum, then Tobias is {{the energy}} behind the fulcrum that works at keeping a balance in this {{dysfunctional}} family. He is constantly {{asking people to}} talk more kindly <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Or, in the least, it is Tobias who keeps silent while fury flares around him. It is also Tobias who serves everyone drinks, {{as if trying to}} soften the edges of their grievances with alcohol.|$|E

25|$|Recall that {{vertical}} coordinate {{lines in}} our chart represent the world {{lines of the}} dust particles, but despite their straight appearance in our chart, the congruence formed by these curves has nonzero vorticity, so the world lines are actually twisting about each other. The fact that the null geodesics spiral inwards in the manner shown above means that when our observer looks radially outwards, he sees nearby dust particles, not at their current locations, but at their earlier locations. This is just what we would expect if the dust particles are in fact rotating <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
25|$|Man Talk, Woman Talk is humorous, as quintessential comedies {{from the}} author can be. He makes use of wry humour to seek a level playing ground for {{resolution}} of the biases men and women nurse <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and which affect mutual co-existence of the two. The scene is a court though devoid of the usual technicalities of court rooms. Instead of legal jargon, there is humour, arguments and counter arguments. What the author arrives at is not to prove which gender is superior but to show the complementary roles of men and women. There {{is a great deal}} of wit in the work and the setting here is the university environment where the youthful contenders are idealistic.|$|E
25|$|One {{night after}} a party, Peggy decides {{to sleep with}} Charlie. He then flips out and reminds {{her that she had}} rebuffed him the weekend before and {{therefore}} believes she is playing games, then drives her home. Instead of going inside, she takes a walk and ends up at an all-night cafe. As she walks by, she sees Michael Fitzsimmons — the artsy loner in school she always wished she’d slept with - and goes in to talk to him. After finding out they have more in common than originally thought, they ride off on his motorcycle. In a field, they smoke weed and find out more <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> When he asks if she is going to marry Charlie, she responds that she already did that and will not do it again. After he recites some of his poetry for her, they have sex.|$|E

40|$|Many {{claims about}} {{political}} behavior {{are based on}} implicit assumptions about how people think. One such assumption, that political actors use identical conjectures when assessing others’ strategies, is nested within applications of widely-used game theoretic equilibrium concepts. When empirical research calls this assumption into question, the self-confirming equilibrium (SCE) concept is an alternate criterion for deriving theoretical claims. Using a series of examples, we examine opportunities and challenges inherent in applying the SCE concept. Our main example focuses on Feddersen and Pesendorfer’s (1998) claim that unanimity rules can lead juries to convict innocent defendants. Using SCE, we show that the claim depends {{on the assumption that}} jurors have identical beliefs <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another’s</b> strategies. When juror beliefs vary in ways that follow from empirical jury research, we show that fewer false convictions can occur in equilibrium. Generally, the SCE confers advantages when actors have different conjectures <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another’s</b> strategies. ...|$|R
500|$|Del Piero is {{also known}} for his sense of humour and is a popular guest at Italian comedy shows such as Paperissima and Striscia la notizia.

Midway through the film, Lucas intercuts between Anakin and Padmé by themselves, thinking <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> in the Jedi Temple and their apartment, respectively, during sunset. The sequence is without dialogue and complemented by a moody, synthesized soundtrack. Lucas' coverage of the exterior cityscapes, skylines and interior isolation in the so-called [...] "Ruminations" [...] sequence is similar to the cinematography and mise-en-scène of Rosemary's Baby, a film in which a husband makes a literal pact with the devil.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons are {{a family}} {{who live in a}} fictional [...] "Middle America" [...] town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety {{inspector}} at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The family owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in [...] "I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot".

60|$|It is a {{singular}} fascination that Rome exercises upon artists. There is clay elsewhere, and marble enough, and heads to model, and ideas {{may be made}} sensible objects at home as well as here. I {{think it is the}} peculiar mode of life that attracts, and its freedom from the inthralments of society, more than the artistic advantages which Rome offers; and, no doubt, though the artists care little <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another's</b> works, yet they keep each other warm by the presence of so many of them.|$|R

During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that {{he told her he}} was taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced they already know everything <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to find things about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim {{to find out what the}} secret is and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E

The state in which in this town is located is never specified, however they do have snow and {{sometimes}} wear sweaters in the fall. [...] It's a running joke in the show to be as vague and ambiguous as possible whenever hinting at which U.S. state the town of Springfield might be located in. [...] Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a stereotypical American housewife and mother.

Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons do not physically age and still appear just as they did {{at the end of the}} 1980s.

500|$|By {{spring of}} 1997, the real-life {{backstage}} conflict between Michaels and Hart were reaching its heights. Both men {{were going out}} on television and frequently making personal, true to heart remarks <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Michaels briefly left the WWF in June of that year after a real backstage fight with Hart, just hours before a Raw Is War show, which allegedly resulted from Michaels making an on-air remark, known as the [...] "Sunny Days" [...] comment, implying that Hart (who was married at the time) {{was having an affair}} with Tammy Sytch, a Diva who was signed to the WWF as Sunny. Michaels and Austin were still WWF Tag Team Champions at the time during an ongoing feud with the Hart Foundation and a tournament was made to decide new tag team champions. Michaels would eventually return that summer in July. At SummerSlam, Michaels officiated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between WWF Champion The Undertaker and Bret Hart. The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels hitting Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Hart after he spat in his face). Michaels was then forced to award the championship to his nemesis, Bret Hart. The next night on Raw Is War, signs of a heel turn started to show as Michaels told the WWF fans what happened at SummerSlam was an accident and that he would deal with the Undertaker when the time came. At WWF One Night Only, held in Birmingham, England in September, Michaels defeated The British Bulldog to capture the European Championship. The fans at the event were so appalled at the result of the match they booed Michaels out of the building to the extent that they littered the ring with garbage, cementing his second heel turn. With this win, Michaels became the first Grand Slam Champion. At , Michaels and Undertaker participated in the first Hell in a Cell match, during which Michaels fall off the side of the [...] high structure through a table and saw him as the winner in the match after the debuting Kane tombstoned his victory bound half-brother, The Undertaker. The match received a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer.|$|E
