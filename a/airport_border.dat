We do not present an account of how the airport ought to work; rather, we consider what ethical relations and subjectivities are constructed, encouraged and made (im) possible in the airport space. We argue that the <b>airport</b> <b>border</b> assembles a variety of commercial, security and spatial technologies in areas of both ‘flow’ and ‘dwell’ which generate and privilege a particular type of ethical subject – the temporarily suspended, atomised individual. We begin with an understanding of space as produced through plurality and movement, and analyse how atomisation is produced and sustained before reflecting on the potentially dangerous implications of such processes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Surveillance {{video and}} {{protocols}} are only {{as effective as}} the people who are doing the monitoring. Threats might be overlooked because they are rare. Our experiment tested in the security domain what others have found in the medical domain: that repeating a rare event to make it less rare will make it more likely to be remembered, and hence, {{to be able to be}} reported. Results of our experiment supported the hypothesis that repeating rare events will make them more likely to be detected. We also looked at the relationship between threat detection performance and age, perceived level of attention, and recording procedure time devoted to each threat. Our specific findings concerning these factors led us to suggest actionable protocols to improve security officers ’ threat detection performance in video and live surveillance. <b>Airport,</b> <b>border,</b> urban, and other types of security screeners might benefit from these recommendations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the use of machine {{readable}} passport systems for inbound <b>airport</b> <b>border</b> security screening, from the perspective of the travelling public. Traditional stamped passports are increasingly being replaced by electronic documents, or e-passports, and associated screening technology. This reality has been examined from the users&# 039; point-of-view. To investigate the use of e-passports, a survey was conducted on inbound international passengers arriving at Melbourne&# 039;s Tullamarine Airport. Use in terms of usage rate, usability, ease of use, time, and satisfaction were investigated. In terms of gender, there was no difference in the five categories. For age, there was a statistical significant difference in terms of usage rate and clearance times, between younger (16 to 44 year olds) and older (45 +) passengers. That is, 16 to 44 year olds were more likely to use the technology, and as a result, took less time to clear customs. The direct relationship between these is apparent, the fact that more 45 + passengers did not use the system resulted in their longer clearance times. More interesting is the fact that those 45 + passengers that utilised the system reported it was as easy to use as 16 to 44 year olds, and were equally satisfied when using the system...|$|E

The focus of the review is on technologies that enhance and improve the traveller authentication process {{as well as the}} screening of passengers and their luggage at the point of entry. The project was divided into three phases according to the three key questions (see Table 1). Phases I and II consisted of a review and summary of the available literature. Phase III involved a survey of technologies currently deployed in airports and those that may emerge in the next 5 - 10 years, and was divided into two main areas: identity verification (i. e. biometrics) and baggage/passenger screening. Literature and patent databases were searched for each question, and bibliographic records imported to text mining software for analysis.

40|$|For {{applications}} such as <b>airport</b> <b>border</b> control, biometric technologies that can process many capture subjects quickly, efficiently, with weak supervision, and with minimal discomfort are desirable. Facial recognition is particularly appealing because it is minimally invasive yet offers relatively good recognition performance. Unfortunately, the combination of weak supervision and minimal invasiveness makes even highly accurate facial recognition systems susceptible to spoofing via presentation attacks. Thus, there is great demand for an effective and low cost system capable of rejecting such attacks. To this end we introduce PARAPH [...] a novel hardware extension that exploits different measurements of light polarization to yield an image space in which presentation media are readily discernible from Bona Fide facial characteristics. The PARAPH system is inexpensive with an added cost of less than 10 US dollars. The system makes two polarization measurements in rapid succession, allowing them to be approximately pixel-aligned, with a frame rate limited by the camera, not the system. There are no moving parts above the molecular level, due to the efficient use of twisted nematic liquid crystals. We present evaluation images using three presentation attack media next to an actual face [...] high quality photos on glossy and matte paper and a video of the face on an LCD. In each case, the actual face in the image generated by PARAPH is structurally discernible from the presentations, which appear either as noise (print attacks) or saturated images (replay attacks).

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis {{involves}} the {{execution and implementation}} of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) treaty on Wild Fauna and Flora at German border posts. The aim of the dissertation is to delineate the legal separation between the duties of veterinarians and the duties of customs officials at these border posts (using Frankfurt/Main airport as representative sample). Also included is a chronological account of the historic evolution of CITES and its affect on international trade. The juridical background of CITES as well as its practical implementation are critically scrutinized in this paper. In addition, the development of German aviation in connection with todays globalisation is examined in context with the increasing threat to endangered species world-wide contrasting the role of the veterinarians in helping to preserve these endangered species. This aim is achieved by describing the historic evolution of CITES as well as its juridical implementation in European and German law. The multiple organizations of CITES are introduced along with the criteria necessary for acceptance into the appendices of the CITES treaty. A brief outline of the German history of aviation is given with emphasis on passenger numbers and their destinations. The border posts of the veterinary and customs authorities at Frankfurt/Main airport are visited. During the course of the visits the veterinary and customs clearance of live animals in the varying means of air travel have been observed. A number of violations against CITES including the corresponding sentences are documented in this thesis. Another crucial part of this study is the collection of currently unpublished data on legal and illegal imports of endangered animal species from the BfN archives in Bonn-Bad Godesberg. This information is completed by additional data from the Zollkriminalamt. The result shows a more or less satisfactory situation at the Frankfurt/Main <b>airport</b> <b>border</b> post. It can be proven that the workload at this German border post has increased dramatically because of the augmentation in air- and cargo traffic. Furthermore, it has been verified that the amplification of infringements of CITES corresponds to the choice of destination and to the increase in passenger numbers. For that reason, there has been a steady increase in CITES offences that have been reported up until the year 2001. Selected cases are documented in this thesis in tabular form. The current CITES appendices I, II and III are found in addendum I of this dissertation and the affected animal species are indicated. As expected, most of the invoked court cases were turned down or only a fine was imposed. The relevant BfN-data for all proceedings between 1975 - 2002 are gathered in a detailed table. The current legal position in Germany requires two separate clearances when importing live animals. The clearance involving animal health (disease prevention) and prevention of cruelty against animals (during transportation) through customs is conducted by veterinary authorities; whereas, CITES clearance is conducted through the customs authorities. This prolongs the travel time of living animals and increases stress levels of living animals as well as inducing higher mortality rates. All appropriate CITES-documents needed for the transportation of endangered species are found in appendix II of this dissertation along with the necessary aviation documents in appendix III. Part of this thesis dedicates itself to a search for alternative solutions to this problem. For example in Switzerland, CITES is enforced {{as an integral part of}} the custom animal clearance at the border posts conducted by veterinary authorities. In addition, the Swiss office for protection of plants conducts the clearance for CITES plants. This necessitates only one clearance procedure for live animals at the Swiss border. The duration of travelling time is thus shortened for live animals, benefiting their health as well as their welfare. In this instance, the education of veterinarians working at German border posts and the education of customs officials trained for CITES are introduced and compared. The findings showed, that the scientific/medical education of veterinarians already offers several connecting point with the skills needed to perform CITES inspections. The overall topic of this thesis offers therefore interesting possibilities for further discussions about potential reforms of the German Implementation of CITES...|$|E
