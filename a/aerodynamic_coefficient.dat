50|$|Interestingly, for an {{aerodynamic}} profile {{the reference}} length {{depends on the}} analysis. In fact, the profile chord is usually chosen as the reference length also for <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> for wing sections and thin profiles in which the primary target is to maximize the lift coefficient or the lift/drag ratio (i.e. as usual in thin airfoil theory, one would employ the chord Reynolds as the flow speed parameter for comparing different profiles). On the other hand, for fairings and struts the given parameter is usually the dimension of internal structure to be streamlined (let us think for simplicity it is a beam with circular section), and the main target is to minimize the drag coefficient or the drag/lift ratio. The main design parameter which becomes naturally also a reference length is therefore the profile thickness (the profile dimension or area perpendicular to the flow direction), rather than the profile chord.|$|E

The wind tunnel test technique developed for the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> measurement includes the design of oblique sectional models, {{the development of a}} test rig and a measurement system, and the analysis of test results. The effects of model end angle on the aerodynamic coefficients are investigated and found to be very small on lift, drag and pitching moment coefficients. The measured results are then fitted to obtain the six <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> curves as functions of both wind inclination and yaw angle, which will be used in a later comparison of buffeting response of the bridge between field measurement and analysis. The measurement results reveal that the drag, lift and pitching moment coefficients are much larger than the crosswind force, rolling moment and yawing moment coefficients. The variation of lift coefficient with wind yaw angle is small, but the value of drag coefficient decreases with increasing wind yaw angle and the value of pitching moment coefficient increases with increasing wind yaw angle. The obtained six <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>coefficient</b> curves are also used to examine the currently used cosine rule for buffeting analysis of a bridge under yaw winds.

Simulation of changes in time of the phase coordinates is based on the results of other flight tests phase coordinates and mathematical model aircraft. After processing the records modified aircraft movement on the proposed algorithm we obtain the value of <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>coefficients</b> as a function of time for small changes in the parameters of flight and as a function of angle, angular velocity and deviation of steering for changing flight parameters in large range. The method of identification of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>coefficients</b> can fairly well determine the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>coefficients</b> from flight test records: after identification increases the degree of real convergence of transient aircraft and its mathematical model.
