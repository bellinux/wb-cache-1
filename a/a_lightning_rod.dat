The tile roof and onion-dome tower mounted on a square base reflects the former, while wide, rounded arches for doors and windows reflect the latter. <b>A</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> extends from the onion dome. The H-shaped main building has two interior courtyards which held a water cistern, garden and play area. The entire building covers an area of 50,590 square feet (4,700 square meters). At three stories, the main building housed the central dining room, a kitchen, a study hall, a library, a reading room, a small museum, and a Lutheran church in which students and staff worshipped.|$|E

25|$|In a {{lightning}} protection system, <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> {{is a single}} component of the system. The lightning rod requires a connection to earth to perform its protective function. Lightning rods come in many different forms, including hollow, solid, pointed, rounded, flat strips or even bristle brush-like. The main attribute common to all lightning rods {{is that they are}} all made of conductive materials, such as copper and aluminum. Copper and its alloys are the most common materials used in lightning protection.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} early {{streamer}} emission proposes that if <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> has a mechanism producing ionization near its tip, then its lightning capture area is greatly increased. At first, small quantities of radioactive isotopes (radium-226 or americium-241) {{were used as}} sources of ionization between 1930 and 1980, later replaced with various electrical and electronic devices. According to an early patent, since most lightning protectors' ground potentials are elevated, the path distance from the source to the elevated ground point will be shorter, creating a stronger field (measured in volts per unit distance) and that structure will be more prone to ionization and breakdown.|$|E

Quill had been elected to the City Council in both the 1930s and 1940s as a candidate of the American Labor Party, but exerted even more influence after the war when he became head of the New York City's CIO City Council and a major figure in New York City politics. He was a key supporter of Robert F. Wagner, Jr.'s campaign for mayor of New York and became <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>rod,</b> based on his radical past, for Wagner's Republican opponent and unfavorable press attention.

40|$|The {{work done}} to create <b>a</b> laser <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> (LLR) is discussed. Some ongoing {{research}} {{which has the}} potential for achieving <b>an</b> operational laser <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> for use in the protection of missile launch sites, launch vehicles, and other property is discussed. Because of the ease with which a laser beam can be steered into any cloud overhead, an LLR could be used to ascertain if there exists enough charge in the clouds to discharge to the ground as triggered lightning. This leads to the possibility of using LLRs to test clouds prior to launching missiles through the clouds or prior to flying aircraft through the clouds. LLRs could also be used to probe and discharge clouds before or during any hazardous ground operations. Thus, an operational LLR may be able to both detect such sub-critical electrical fields and effectively neutralize them...|$|R
25|$|In the 19th century, the <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> became <b>a</b> {{decorative}} motif. <b>Lightning</b> <b>rods</b> were {{embellished with}} ornamental glass balls (now prized by collectors). The ornamental appeal of these glass balls {{has been used}} in weather vanes. The main purpose of these balls, however, is to provide evidence of <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> strike by shattering or falling off. If after a storm a ball is discovered missing or broken, the property owner should then check the building, rod, and grounding wire for damage.|$|R
25|$|President Aquino envisioned agrarian {{and land}} reform as the {{centerpiece}} of her administration's social legislative agenda. However, her family background and social class as a privileged daughter of a wealthy and landed clan became <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> of criticisms against her land reform agenda. On February 22, 1987, three weeks after the resounding ratification of the 1987 Constitution, agrarian workers and farmers marched to the historic Mendiola Street near the MalacaÃ±an Palace to demand genuine land reform from Aquino's administration. However, the march turned violent when Marine forces fired at farmers who tried to go beyond the designated demarcation line set by the police. As a result, at least 12 were killed and 51 protesters were injured in this incident now known as the Mendiola Massacre. This incident led some prominent members of the Aquino Cabinet to resign their government posts.|$|E
25|$|Greiner was {{the subject}} of a vote of no {{confidence}} in 2000. from the university's faculty senate, prompting discussion over whether he would resign his position. Student enrollment had declined, full-time faculty positions had decreased by 100 people, and funding was being more specifically directed to certain programs, such as athletics and information technology, rather than others. In particular was the concern that more than $10 million per year was going toward building UB's athletic programs, such monies being diverted away from academics. While college entrance Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores had increased, UB's status as a highly ranked research university in the United States had decreased since 1989 under the leadership of Steven Sample. This prompted the vote of no confidence in UB's leadership by the College of Arts and Sciences professors. Of the no confidence vote, in 2001 Greiner likened himself to <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> that, in his employment position, occasionally gets hit by lightning.|$|E

500|$|Because {{none of the}} {{witnesses}} can agree on the language the murderer spoke, Dupin concludes they were not hearing a human voice at all. He and the narrator examine the house thoroughly; the following day, Dupin dismisses the idea of both Le Bon's guilt and a robbery motive, citing {{the fact that the}} gold was not taken from the room. He also points out that the murderer would have had to have superhuman strength to force the daughter's body up the chimney. He formulates a method by which the murderer could have entered the room and killed both women, involving an agile climb up <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> and a leap to a set of open window shutters. Showing an unusual tuft of hair he recovered from the scene, and demonstrating the impossibility of the daughter being strangled by a human hand, Dupin concludes that an [...] "Ourang-Outang" [...] (orangutan) killed the women. He has placed an advertisement in the local newspaper asking if anyone has lost such an animal, and a sailor soon arrives looking for it.|$|E
500|$|Inevitably, the Manual became <b>a</b> <b>lightning</b> <b>rod</b> for controversy. [...] Some {{observers}} {{took issue}} with its perspective on Canada; most notably, The Cambridge Companion to Canadian Literature criticizes its [...] "condescending tone" [...] in describing Canada's resources. [...] Elements in the U.S. and Canadian governments may have been upset by the Manual. [...] According to journalist Lynn Coady, the FBI and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) attempted to wiretap the House of Anansi Press's offices. [...] In addition, Anansi co-founder Dave Godfrey is convinced a 10-day government audit of the press was generated by FBIâ€“RCMP concerns. [...] Many people {{did not want the}} Programme to encourage draft-eligible Americans to emigrate to Canada, and Satin routinely denied that the Manual encouraged emigration. [...] But few observers believed him, then or later. [...] The first sentence of an article in The New York Times from 1968 describes the Manual as [...] "a major bid to encourage Americans to evade military conscription". [...] Canadian essayist Robert Fulford remembers the Manual as offering an enthusiastic welcome to draft dodgers. [...] Even a House of Anansi Press anthology from 2007 concedes that the Manual is [...] "coyly titled".|$|E
