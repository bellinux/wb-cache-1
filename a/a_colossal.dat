5|$|Monument 99 is <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> head in potbelly style, {{dating to}} the Late Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> head at Tres Zapotes {{in the nineteenth}} century spurred the first archaeological investigations of Olmec culture by Matthew Stirling in 1938. Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán were re-carved from massive stone thrones. An additional monument, at Takalik Abaj in Guatemala, is a throne that may have been carved from <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> head. This is the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.|$|E
5|$|At Takalik Abaj the potbelly style monuments all {{date to the}} Late Preclassic. Stylistically, {{the monuments}} {{are very similar to}} those of Kaminaljuyu and Monte Alto. Seven monuments are potbelly sculptures (Monuments 2, 3, 19, 40, 69, 94 and 117), six of these {{represent}} complete figures. Three monuments are small potbelly sculptures (Monuments 100, 107 and 109) and one sculpture is <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> head in potbelly style (Monument 99).|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>Colossal</b> Boy or Leviathan, Gim Allon could {{increase}} his size to {{many times the}} height of a human, with proportionate increases in strength and mass. In the 2004 version of Legion of Super-Heroes, the character insists that his powers involve shrinking instead of growing, although the effect upon opponents appears to be the same.|$|R

25|$|Napoleon's last project, {{begun in}} 1810, was the {{construction}} of the Elephant of the Bastille, a fountain in the shape of <b>an</b> <b>colossal</b> bronze elephant, twenty-four meters high, which was intended for the center of the Place de la Bastille, but he did not have time to finish it. An enormous plaster mockup of the elephant stood in the square for many years after the emperor's final defeat and exile.|$|R
5|$|Construction of the Colosseum started under Vespasian {{in a low}} valley {{surrounded}} by the Caelian, Esquiline and Palatine hills. The site became available to Nero by the Great Fire of Rome in AD64 and redeveloped for his personal enjoyment {{with the construction of}} a huge artificial lake in the Domus Aurea, and <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> statue of himself.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj Monument23 {{dates to}} the Middle Preclassic period, and is found in Takalik Abaj, an {{important}} city {{in the foothills of}} the Guatemalan Pacific coast, in the modern department of Retalhuleu. It appears to be an Olmec-style colossal head re-carved into a niche figure sculpture. If originally <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> head then it would be the only known example from outside the Olmec heartland.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus, {{the ancient}} Greek historian, {{documented}} women carrying large phallic shaped monuments and ornaments {{the size of}} a human body in villages in ancient Dionysia. On the island of Delos a pillar supports <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. Phallus reliefs on buildings on such sites are also believed to have been apotropaic devices to ward off evil. The elaborate use of phallic architecture and sculpture in ancient Greek society can also be seen in sites such as Nea Nikomedeia in northern Greece. Archaeologists excavating the ancient town discovered clay sculptures of plump women with phallic heads and folded arms.|$|E

5|$|The nave was in poorest {{condition}} and the walls were substantially rebuilt and the porch wholly replaced {{in the first phase}} in 1868-9, with Thomas Williams of Cardiff the contractor. The font was restored at this time. Traces of painted decoration were found in the nave, including <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> St Christopher on the north wall opposite the entrance. Unfortunately this and other traces of fresco could not be saved; they were destroyed without a pictorial record of them having been made. The committee considered an oak roof for the nave, but rejected it as too costly.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Boston was {{the site}} of the National Peace Jubilee, a massive gala to honor {{veterans}} and to celebrate the return of peace. Conceived by composer Patrick Gilmore, who had served in an army band, the celebration was held in <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> arena in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood designed to hold 100,000 attendees and specifically built for the occasion. A new hymn was commissioned for the occasion, written by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and set to American Hymn by Matthais Keller. Spanning five days, the event featured a chorus of nearly 11,000 and an orchestra of more than 500 musicians. It was the largest musical gathering on the continent up to that time.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away {{both large and small}} flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> head but that the work was never completed.|$|E

5|$|Megatron sends Starscream, and {{his twin}} {{brothers}} Thundercracker and Skywarp to reactivate an Energon bridge which will feed the station with raw Energon, allowing the manufacturing of more Dark Energon. Once they succeed, Megatron then develops {{a plan to}} infect the core of Cybertron with Dark Energon, feeling that he can {{gain control of the}} planet once it is infected. He launches a full-scale assault on the Autobot capital city of Iacon, looking for an item called the Omega Key, which he will use to enter Cybertron's core and infect it. The Decepticons learn that Zeta Prime has placed the key under his personal guard. Megatron's forces enter the chambers of Zeta Prime and defeat him in battle. Zeta Prime tells Megatron that the Omega Key is not actually what unlocks access to the core, but is the means to activate the true key, <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> Transformer known as Omega Supreme. After hearing this, Megatron presumably kills Zeta Prime.|$|E
5|$|On the moon, {{the party}} meets the sage Fusoya, who {{explains}} that Cecil's {{father was a}} Lunarian. Fusoya also explains that a Lunarian named Zemus plans to destroy life on the Blue Planet so that the Lunarians can take over, using Golbez to summon the Giant of Babil, <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> robot. The party returns to Earth and {{the forces of the}} two worlds attack the Giant, including Palom and Porom, who have been revived. After the party breaks the robot, Golbez and Kain confront them, only to have Fusoya break Zemus' control over Golbez, in turn releasing Kain. Cecil learns that Golbez is his older brother. Golbez and Fusoya head to the core of the moon to defeat Zemus, and Cecil's party follows. In the moon's core, the party witnesses Golbez and Fusoya kill Zemus, but then quickly fall to his resurrected form, the spirit Zeromus, the embodiment of all of Zemus' hatred and rage. Back on Earth, the Elder of Mysidia commands all of Cecil's allies and friends to pray for the party, which gives Cecil and his allies the strength to fight and slay Zeromus. Following the battle, Fusoya and Golbez opt to leave Earth with the moon. Cecil, at last accepting the truth, acknowledges Golbez as his brother, and bids him farewell.|$|E
5|$|The New Kingdom pharaohs began a {{large-scale}} building {{campaign to promote}} the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built. The pharaoh Hatshepsut used such hyperbole and grandeur during her reign of almost twenty-two years. Her reign was very successful, marked by {{an extended period of}} peace and wealth-building, trading expeditions to Punt, restoration of foreign trade networks, and great building projects, including an elegant mortuary temple that rivaled the Greek architecture of a thousand years later, <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> pair of obelisks, and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, Amenhotep II, the heir to Hatshepsut's nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III, sought to erase her legacy {{near the end of his}} father's reign and throughout his, touting many of her accomplishments as his. He also tried to change many established traditions that had developed over the centuries, which some suggest was a futile attempt to prevent other women from becoming pharaoh and to curb their influence in the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} slowed during 1296, although debts {{continued to}} build up, and work dropped off further the following year, stopping entirely by 1300, by when around £11,000 had been spent. The halt was primarily {{the result of}} Edward's new wars in Scotland, which had begun to consume his attention and financial resources, but it left the castle only partially complete: the inner walls and towers were {{only a fraction of}} their proper height and the north and north-west sides lacked outer defences altogether. In 1306 Edward became concerned about a possible Scottish invasion of North Wales, but the unfinished castle had already fallen into a poor state of repair. Work recommenced on completing the outer defences, first under James' direction and then, after his death in 1309, Master Nicolas de Derneford. This work finally halted in 1330 with the castle still not built to its intended height; {{by the end of the}} project, £15,000 had been spent, <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> sum for the period. A royal survey in 1343 suggested that at least a further £684 would be needed to complete the castle, but this was never invested.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid {{was then}} {{neglected}} until October 1927, when Cecil Mallaby Firth and the architect Jean-Philippe Lauer started excavating there. During {{the first season}} of excavation, Firth and Lauer cleared {{the south side of}} the pyramid area, discovering Userkaf's mortuary temple and tombs of the much later Saite period. The following year, Firth and Lauer uncovered a limestone relief slab and <b>a</b> <b>colossal</b> red granite head of Userkaf, thus determining that he was the pyramid owner. After Firth's death in 1931 no excavations took place on site until they were resumed by Lauer in 1948. Lauer worked there until 1955, re-clearing and re-planning the mortuary temple and investigating the eastern side of the pyramid. Research on the north and west sides of the mortuary complex was conducted starting in 1976 by Ahmed el-Khouli who excavated and restored the pyramid entrance. The entrance was, however, buried under rubble in an earthquake in 1991.|$|E
