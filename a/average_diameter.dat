5|$|The largest Jupiter trojan is 624 Hektor, {{which has}} an <b>average</b> <b>diameter</b> of 203±3.6km. There are few large Jupiter trojans in {{comparison}} to the overall population. With decreasing size, the number of Jupiter trojans grows very quickly down to 84km, much more so than in the asteroid belt. A diameter of 84km corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 9.5, assuming an albedo of 0.04. Within the 4.4–40km range the Jupiter trojans' size distribution resembles that of the main-belt asteroids. Nothing is known about the masses of the smaller Jupiter trojans. The size distribution suggests that the smaller Trojans are the products of collisions by larger Jupiter trojans.|$|E

5|$|The {{process takes}} place in {{multiple}} stages. First, fat synthesized within the endoplasmic reticulum accumulates in droplets between {{the inner and outer}} phospholipid monolayers of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually pinch off. This leads to the surrounding of the droplet in a phospholipid monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the droplet and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat droplet in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The milk fat globule thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 μm in <b>average</b> <b>diameter,</b> is surrounded by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM.|$|E
5|$|Hyperion is Titan's nearest {{neighbor}} in the Saturn system. The two moons {{are locked in}} a 4:3 mean-motion resonance with each other, meaning that while Titan makes four revolutions around Saturn, Hyperion makes exactly three. With an <b>average</b> <b>diameter</b> of about 270km, Hyperion is smaller and lighter than Mimas. It has an extremely irregular shape, and a very odd, tan-colored icy surface resembling a sponge, though its interior may be partially porous as well. The average density of about 0.55g/cm3 indicates that the porosity exceeds 40% even assuming it has a purely icy composition. The surface of Hyperion is covered with numerous impact craters—those with diameters 2–10km are especially abundant. It is the only moon besides the small moons of Pluto known to have a chaotic rotation, which means Hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator. While on short timescales the satellite approximately rotates around its long axis {{at a rate of}} 72–75° per day, on longer timescales its axis of rotation (spin vector) wanders chaotically across the sky. This makes the rotational behavior of Hyperion essentially unpredictable.|$|E

As the molecular weight decreased, the nanofibers <b>average</b> <b>diameters</b> also decreased; however, critical number average and weight average molecular weights were necessary for electrospinning. As the amounts of carboxyl terminal groups (CTG) increased, the nanofibers <b>average</b> <b>diameters</b> decreased; however, above CTG's critical values of 8. 7 x 10 - 5 mol. g- 1 no electrospinning was possible.
