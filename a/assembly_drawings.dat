40|$|Although solid models play {{a central}} role in modern CAD systems, 2 D CAD systems are still {{commonly}} used for designing products without complex curved faces. Therefore, an important task is to convert 2 D drawings to solid models, and this is usually carried out manually even in present CAD systems. Many methods have been proposed to automatically convert orthographic part drawings of solid objects to solid models. Unfortunately, products are usually drawn as 2 D <b>assembly</b> <b>drawings,</b> and therefore, these methods cannot be applied. A further problem is the difficult and time-consuming task of decomposing 2 D <b>assembly</b> <b>drawings</b> into 2 D part drawings. In previous work, the authors proposed a method to automatically decompose 2 D <b>assembly</b> <b>drawings</b> into 3 D part drawings, from which 2 D part drawings can be easily generated. However, one problem with the proposed method was that the number of solutions could easily explode if the 2 D <b>assembly</b> <b>drawings</b> became complex. Building on this work, here we describe a new method to automatically convert 2 D <b>assembly</b> <b>drawings</b> to 3 D part drawings, generating a unique solution for designers regardless of the complexity of the original 2 D <b>assembly</b> <b>drawings.</b> The only requirement for the approach is that the <b>assembly</b> <b>drawings</b> consist of standard parts such as bars and plates. In 2 D <b>assembly</b> <b>drawings,</b> the dimensions, part numbers and parts lists are usually drawn, and the proposed method utilizes these to obtain a unique solution...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} and development project presents {{an overview of the}} work completed while attending a summer 2004 American Society of Engineering Education/National Aeronautics and Space Administration (ASEE/NASA) Faculty Fellowship. This fellowship was completed at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The scope of the project was to complete parts, <b>assemblies,</b> and <b>drawings</b> that could be used by Ground Support Equipment (GSE) personnel to simulate situations and scenarios commonplace to the space shuttle Orbiter/External Tank (ET) Mate (50004). This mate takes place in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB). These simulations could then be used by NASA engineers as decision-making tools. During the summer of 2004, parts were created that defined the Orbiter/ET structural interfaces. Emphasis was placed upon assemblies that included the Orbiter/ET forward attachment (EO- 1), aft left thrust strut (EO- 2), aft right tripod support structure (EO- 3), and crossbeam and aft feedline/umbilical supports. These assemblies are used to attach the Orbiter to the ET. The Orbiter/ET Mate assembly was then used to compare and analyze clearance distances using different Orbiter hang angles. It was found that a 30 -minute arc angle change in Orbiter hang angle affected distance at the bipod strut to Orbiter yoke fitting 8. 11 inches. A 3 -D solid model library was established {{as a result of this}} project. This library contains parts, <b>assemblies,</b> and <b>drawings</b> translated into several formats. This library contains a collection of the following files: sti for sterolithography, stp for neutral file work, shrinkwrap for compression. tiff for photoshop work, jpeg for Internet use, and prt and asm for Pro/Engineer use. This library was made available to NASA engineers so that they could access its contents to make angle, load, and clearance analysis studies. These decision-making tools may be used by Pro/Engineer users and non-users...|$|R
