5|$|Lambeosaurus was belatedly {{described}} in 1923 by William Parks, {{over twenty years}} after the first material was studied by Lawrence Lambe. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, in part because small-bodied crested hadrosaurids now recognized as juveniles were once thought to belong to their own genera and species. Currently, the various skulls assigned to the type species L. lambei are interpreted as showing <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> and sexual dimorphism. Lambeosaurus was closely related to the better known Corythosaurus, which is found in slightly older rocks, as well as the less well-known genera Hypacrosaurus and Olorotitan. All had unusual crests, which are now generally assumed to have served social functions like noisemaking and recognition.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{explored}} {{the effect of}} older partner’s <b>age</b> and <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> between partners on condomless sex among MSM. Methods: We analyzed data from the Sexual Acquisition Transmission of HIV Cooperative Agreement Program. We used modified Poisson regression to model {{the probability of a}} sexual encounter’s being condomless as function of HIV status, substance use, older partner’s <b>age,</b> <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> between partners, and race/ethnicity. Results: We found an interaction between older partner’s <b>age</b> and <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> (p< 0. 05). Condomless sex decreased with increasing <b>age</b> when <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> was 5 - 9 years (p= 0. 005) or ≥ 10 years (p= 0. 05), but not when the <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> was < 5 years (p= 0. 4). When the <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> is 5 - 9 years, 40 % of encounters are condomless if the older partner is 32 years old, but only 23 % are condomless if 54 years old. Conclusion: Both age and age discordance play important roles in the likelihood of a sexual encounter between MSM being condomless...|$|R
40|$|An aging {{population}} results in retirement ages {{going up and}} the <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> between subordinates and managers growing bigger. Despite an extensive literature review on trust within organizations, {{we have not been}} able to identify studies related to the influence of <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> between managers and their subordinates. The main purpose of this thesis is to gain a deeper understanding of the influence of <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> on trust in relationships between managers and subordinates, and more specifically how the <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> influences the trust in the relationship with their older subordinates. Our research question has been formulated as follows: How does <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> influence trust between young managers and their older subordinates? Despite studies on trust increasing in popularity over the last years, we identified a research gap since there is no previous studies addressing the influence of <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> on trust between managers and subordinates. Specifically, the influence of the <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> between young managers and older subordinates and the trust between them in their relationship. In order to fulfil the purpose of our thesis we have conducted a qualitative research, where we gathered qualitative data through the use of semi-structured interviews. These interviews were conducted in a Dutch multinational production company employing approximately 25. 000 employees. By analysing the data we gathered through our semi-structured interviews and relating it to the theoretical framework we built up from pre-existing literature, we were able to answer our research question. As a theoretical foundation, we have used the key theories on trust: trust, factors of perceived trustworthiness, antecedent of trustworthy behaviour and employee-organisation relationship. The findings demonstrate that the <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> has influence on an individual’s behaviour, employee expectations and factors of trust. We found an influence of the <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> on benevolence as well as for ability. Young managers are perceived to have different values than older subordinates, resulting in an influence on integrity. Factors related to the social exchange influence trust in other ways as interpersonal relationships have been found to influence the <b>age</b> <b>difference.</b> Finally, the <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> does influence individuals and relational factors due to the expectations of young managers being perceived as strengthening trust with their subordinates. Our thesis has contributed to the theory of trust by gaining a deeper knowledge of the influence of <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> on trust between managers and their subordinates. Also we have opened up new areas for research concerning the influence of <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> on trust in other industries or reversed situations. Our thesis has provided management scholars and managers with a deeper understanding of trust in manager-subordinate relationships, providing young managers with theories on how to improve their relationships with their older subordinates...|$|R

25|$|Emotional target cues {{have been}} shown to {{eliminate}} <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in prospective memory. For older participants, emotional prospective memory cues were better remembered than neutral cues. Whether the cues are positive or negative, strong emotional attachment makes the cue more self-relevant and easier to remember. For example, an aversive picture of a snake biting a person or a positive picture of a dog licking its owner are easier to remember because they evoke emotional responses, as opposed to a neutral picture of an animal that does not evoke an emotional response. It is speculated that the amygdala and hippocampus {{may play a role in}} this emotionally enhanced memory effect.|$|E

We performed this study to describe the HRA algorithm and evaluate the accuracy of an HRA program for 10 -yr mortality prediction in Korean men. We used data derived from periodic health examinations of 116, 927 male public officials and school personnel aged 20 or older. Risk <b>age</b> and the <b>difference</b> between risk <b>age</b> and calendar age were calculated. We obtained the hazard ratio (HR) of 10 -yr mortality according to the calculated <b>age</b> <b>difference.</b> Of the 116, 927 subjects, 1, 900 (1. 6 %) died during the 10 yr after the 1992 medical examinations. The HR of 10 -yr mortality increased significantly with <b>age</b> <b>difference.</b> Compared with the HR in the reference group (<b>age</b> <b>difference</b> below 2 yr), the HR in the group with a 2 - to 6 -yr <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> was 1. 20 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 05 to 1. 38) and HR in the group with more than 7 -yr <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> was 1. 35 (95 % CI: 1. 14 to 1. 75).

25|$|More recent {{research}} has extended established findings of age related decline in executive functioning, by examining related cognitive processes that underlie healthy older adults’ sequential performance. Sequential performance refers to the execution of a series steps needed to complete a routine, such as the steps required to make {{a cup of coffee}} or drive a car. An important part of healthy aging involves older adults’ use of memory and inhibitory processes to carry out daily activities in a fixed order without forgetting the sequence of steps that were just completed while remembering {{the next step in the}} sequence. A recent study examined how young and older adults differ in the underlying representation of a sequence of tasks and their efficiency at retrieving the information needed to complete their routine. Findings from this study revealed that when older and young adults had to remember a sequence of 8 animal images arranged in a fixed order, both age groups spontaneously used the organizational strategy of chunking to facilitate retrieval of information. However, older adults were slower at accessing each chunk compared to younger adults, and were better able to benefit from the use of memory aids, such as verbal rehearsal to remember the order of the fixed sequence. Results from this study suggest that there are <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> in memory and inhibitory processes that affect people’s sequence of actions and the use of memory aids could facilitate the retrieval of information in older age.|$|E
25|$|Elderspeak is a {{specialized}} speech style used by younger adults when addressing older adults. The speaker makes accommodations that include producing shorter, less complex sentences, using simpler vocabulary, filler words, fragmented sentences, lexical filters, and repetition. Elderspeak also includes using {{terms that are}} overly endearing, asking closed questions that prompt an answer, and using the collective “we”. Young people tend to speak at a slower rate and include more pauses when communicating with elders. This speech style is often patronizing in nature and resembles baby talk. Elderspeak stems from a reliance on stereotypes about cognitive abilities of older persons, and its use may {{be a result of}} or contribute to ageism, a form of discrimination based on <b>age</b> <b>differences.</b> Young people tend to believe that aging is associated with cognitive declines, including declines in language processing and production. However, this speech pattern is primarily based on stereotypes, as evidenced by its use in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. When conversing with older persons, younger people often accommodate their speech based on their personal evaluation of their conversation partner’s ability, rather than their actual ability. Working to overcome elderspeak through awareness and self-monitoring as well as through formal educational programs are strategies individuals and other care providers can use to promote successful aging for older clients. Therefore, although some aspects of elderspeak may be beneficial for some recipients, it is generally seen as inappropriate and can hinder intergenerational communication.|$|E
500|$|Henry was the {{youngest}} of William and Matilda's four sons. Physically he resembled his older brothers Robert Curthose, Richard and William Rufus, being, as historian David Carpenter describes, [...] "short, stocky and barrel-chested," [...] with black hair. As a result of their <b>age</b> <b>differences</b> and Richard's early death, Henry would have probably seen relatively little of his older brothers. He probably knew his sister, Adela, well, as the two were close in age. There is little documentary evidence for his early years; historians Warren Hollister and Kathleen Thompson suggest he was brought up predominantly in England, while Judith Green argues he was initially brought up in the Duchy. He was probably educated by the Church, possibly by Bishop Osmund, the King's chancellor, at Salisbury Cathedral; it is uncertain if this indicated an intent by his parents for Henry to {{become a member of the}} clergy. It is also uncertain how far Henry's education extended, but he was probably able to read Latin and had some background in the liberal arts. He was given military training by an instructor called Robert Achard, and Henry was knighted by his father on 24 May 1086.|$|E

500|$|Rajinikanth {{began his}} film career through the Tamil film Apoorva Raagangal (1975). Balachander gave Rajinikanth a {{relatively}} small role as the abusive husband of Srividya. The film was controversial upon release, as it explored relationships between people with wide <b>age</b> <b>differences.</b> It received wide critical acclaim as it {{went on to win}} three National Film Awards including the award for the Best Tamil Feature at the following year ceremony. A review from The Hindu noted that: [...] "Newcomer Rajinikanth is dignified and impressive". He followed that with Katha Sangama (January 1975), an experimental film made by Puttanna Kanagal in the new wave style. The film was a portmanteau of three short stories which had Rajinikanth playing a small character in the last segment where he appears as a village ruffian who rapes a blind woman in the absence of her husband. His next release was Anthuleni Katha, a Telugu film directed by Balachander. In a remake of his own Tamil film Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Balachander had Rajinikanth playing a pivotal role {{for the first time in}} his career. In subsequent films, he continued to perform a series of negative roles mostly as a womaniser. In Moondru Mudichu — the first film to feature him in a prominent role — he plays a character that [...] "blithely row away" [...] when his friend drowns accidentally in the lake only to fulfill his desire to marry the former's girlfriend.

In this paper, an i-vector speaker verifi-cation framework is used to evaluate {{the impact of}} long-term ageing on state-of-the-art speaker verification. Using the Trin-ity College Dublin Speaker Ageing (TCDSA) database, it is ob-served that the performance of the i-vector system, in terms of both discrimination and calibration, degrades progressively as the absolute <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> between training and testing sam-ples increases. In the case of male speakers, the equal error rate (EER) increases from 4. 61 % at an <b>ageing</b> <b>difference</b> of 0 – 1 years to 32. 74 % at an <b>age</b> <b>difference</b> of 51 – 60 years.
