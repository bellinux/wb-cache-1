The amount of flow and sediment discharge entering the intake as well as design of submerged vanes to control sediment depends on determination of dividing stream width. In this study, the experimental tests were carried out at a 30 degree water intake from a <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>section.</b> Three components of velocity data were obtained for different flow conditions. Then numerical SSIIM 2 model was calibrated and verified using tests data. More flow conditions such as the main channel with rectangular section were run using SSIIM 2 model to get enough hydraulic data.

Its shape and dimensions have special effects on the molten plastic’s pressure, hot loss, injection speed, etc. At present, trapezoidal runner is used widely for better fluidity and lower assembly precision relatively compared with the circular runner. This paper uses the Fminsearch function of MATLAB and constructs an objective function based on the minimum length of {{the perimeter of the}} trapezoidal runner to optimize the <b>trapezoidal</b> runner <b>section.</b> The conclusion of this paper is that the perimeter of the trapezoidal runner is the shortest one when a equals c (shown as Fig. 1), as well as the obtuse angle between a and c equals 120 º.

The value 2, for this ratio, is shown to draw some demarkation border between the two modes of fracture encountered in the tests.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} hydrodynamic {{knowledge on}} schematized open-channel confluences is {{largely based on}} laboratory experiments in channels with a rectangular cross-section. Since in practice man-made canals often have a nonrectangular cross-section, the question can be raised to which extent the knowledge on open-channel confluences still holds for confluences of that type of canals. Therefore, this paper examines the influence of three cross-sectional shapes on the flow patterns in an asymmetric 90 ° open-channel confluence with fixed concordant bed and subcritical flows throughout. Large-eddy simulations are performed for a rectangular, a chamfered rectangular and a <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>section.</b> The simulations for the non-rectangular sections show that the location of both the mixing layer between the incoming flows and the shear layer between the separation zone and the contracted section are altered {{in comparison to the}} rectangular section case.

40|$|In this study, the {{hydraulic}} jump formed in a gradually expanding stilling basin of <b>trapezoidal</b> cross <b>section</b> is investigated.

Experiments have been also done to study {{the hydraulic}} jumps for three different basin side slopes. Froude numbers considered ranged from 3 to 10. For a given side slope as the expansion angle increases, the jump within the stilling basin is stable particularly at larger Froude numbers. Divergence of the basin for a given side slope causes reductions in the sequent depth and jump length, and an increase of the energy loss in the jump relative to those observed in the jumps occurring in channels with unchanging rectangular or <b>trapezoidal</b> cross <b>sections.</b> It was also found that {{a decrease in the}} slope of the side walls for a given angle of expansion of the basin causes smaller sequent depth and larger jump length and energy loss than those in jumps in channels with the same angle of divergence but with vertical side wall...|$|R

The new technique models the transmission line non-idealities in a combined way with the current density in the signal and return current paths.

Cross section of outer shell of ballast tank {{is described as}} cylinder, one dimensional flow equations combined with screw compressor performance model are employed to describe compressor’s flow characteristic. Coupled effect between gas pressure in ballast tank and discharging performance of screw compressor is considered in the presenting model as gas leakage during compressing process is taken into account. Deballasting duration for one certain submarine model is calculated using the developed model, and the result agrees well with that obtained by using Chinese state code for submarine low pressure system design. For different cross section tank models as circular section model, parabolic <b>section</b> model and <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>section</b> model, dynamic performance of screw compressor deballasting system is studied using the validated model.

40|$|The {{rational}} regime formulation, {{which was}} used by White, Bettess and Paris to predict the stable geometry of wide, trapezoidal alluvial channels and in producing the Wallingford Tables for the Design of Stable Alluvial Channels (Hydraulics Research, Wallingford, 1981), is reviewed. This approach (the Wallingford rational regime theory) is known to provide useful results for moderate-scale natural channels but deviates more widely from observed behaviour for laboratory channels and very large rivers. To explore possible reasons for this, wide and narrow trapezoidal channels have been examined in terms of wetted perimeter, hydraulic radius and side slope, and have been compared with equal-area rectangular channels. The effect of the hydraulic radius, via the threshold of motion, on the sediment transport prediction was studied. It is shown that the hydraulic radius associated with selection of side slope has {{a significant effect on}} the sediment concentration prediction. The threshold of motion is also an issue. The original method was modified by approximating the channel cross-section as an equivalent area <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>section.</b> Based on the results, an adjustment to the method in terms of hydraulic radius and threshold of motion is proposed. Laboratory flume and field data are used to examine the improved predictions of the modified method...|$|R
