50|$|Schistocerca {{americana}} is {{a species}} of grasshopper in the family Acrididae known commonly as the American grasshopper and <b>American</b> <b>bird</b> <b>grasshopper.</b> It is native to North America, where it occurs in the eastern United States, Mexico, and the Bahamas. Occasional, localized outbreaks of this grasshopper occur, and it {{is often referred to}} as a locust, though it lacks the true swarming form of its congener, the desert locust (S. gregaria).|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric Polynesian {{habitation}} on Nihoa {{may have}} initially {{led to a}} decrease in the plant population of A. brownii. Major threats to the plant include invasive species, fire, and hybridization with other Amaranthus species. Inbreeding is a serious threat, as the small plant population must reproduce within its own circle resulting in genetic defects. A. brownii is also forced to compete with the non-native weed (Portulaca oleracea), the plant's main alien species threat. In 2002 and 2004, the invasive gray <b>bird</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Schistocerca nitens) presented an even larger threat to A. brownii. First recorded on the island in 1977, the increasing population density of gray <b>bird</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> led to massive defoliation on the island, leaving A. brownii at greater risk of predation. In 2004 alone, an estimated 400,000 gray <b>bird</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> destroyed almost 90% of the vegetation on Nihoa.|$|R

50|$|The African cuckoo-hawk mainly eats {{reptiles}} and insects, it hunts {{within the}} canopy by flying {{from tree to}} tree, searching from a perch before flying to pluck the prey item from the canopy or ground. The following food items have been recorded in its diet: flap-necked chameleon Chamaeleo dilepsis, the southern dwarf chameleon Brachypodion ventrale, lizards, snakes, frogs, fish, fruit bats, mice, <b>birds,</b> <b>grasshoppers</b> and locusts, stick insects, silverfish larvae, caterpillars, mantids and freshwater crabs.|$|R
50|$|The {{composition}} of Falconidae is disputed, and Polyborninae is not {{featured in the}} American Ornithologists' Union checklists for North and South <b>American</b> <b>birds</b> that are produced by its Classification Committees (NACC and SACC). The Check-list of North <b>American</b> <b>Birds</b> considers the laughing falcon a true falcon (Falconinae) and replaces Polyborinae with Caracarinae and Micrasturinae. On the other hand, the Check-list of South <b>American</b> <b>Birds</b> classifies all caracaras as true falcons and puts the laughing falcon and forest falcons into the subfamily Herpetotherinae.|$|R
