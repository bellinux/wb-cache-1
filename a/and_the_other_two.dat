5|$|A 2002 {{study by}} American botanists Austin Mast and Tom Givnish yielded a {{surprise}} when molecular analysis mapped out dolichostyla as a sister taxon to its geographical neighbour B.violacea, in a clade with B.laricina and B.incana. B.micrantha <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> varieties of B.sphaerocarpa form a separate clade nearby.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} six deaths in {{incidents}} related to Patricia were reported in the state. Two of these deaths occurred when a tree toppled over in the storm's powerful winds.

Two of the victims died in the wreckage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> died after being brought to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum {{closely resembles}} the other {{species in the}} A.pedatum complex (A.pedatum and A.aleuticum), and {{distinguishing}} the three {{in the field is}} difficult. Paris and Windham, in their study of the complex, noted that while each species, collectively, can be distinguished from the others, no single morphological character was absolutely distinctive among species. Sterile triploid hybrids between A.viridimontanum <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> species may occur, further complicating field identification.|$|E

5|$|Japan began {{considering}} airline deregulation in {{the late}} 1970s, with the government announcing the abandoning of the 45/47 system in 1985. In 1987 Japan Airlines was completely privatised, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> airlines in Japan, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan Air System (JAS), were permitted to compete with JAL on domestic and international routes. Increased competition resulted in changes to the airline's corporate structure, and it was reorganised into three divisions: international passenger service, domestic passenger service, and cargo (including mail) service.|$|E

50|$|For the All-Star Race, {{the format}} is {{different}} from the regular qualifying that occurs in the weekly events.

5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff waited on the runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for a miracle, members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E
5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a volley toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit and went down. Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed and waited until they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and volley, descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>two</b> were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded. Though short, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend had a lasting impact and influence {{on the rest of the}} war.|$|E
