40|$|Using time {{geographic}} {{theory for}} representation of population mixing, {{we set out}} to analyze the relative impact from precautionary behaviors on outbreaks of pandemic influenza in Europe and Asia. We extended an existing simulator environment with behavioral parameters from a population survey to model different behaviors. We found that precautionary behaviors even among a minority of the population can have a decisive effect on the probability of the outbreak to propagate. The results also display that assumptions strongly influences the outcome. Depending on the interpretation of how many “children” are kept from “school”, R 0 changes from a range where outbreak progression is possible to a range where it is improbable in both European (R 0 = 1. 77 / 1. 23) and <b>Asian</b> (<b>R</b> 0 = 1. 70 / 1. 05) conditions. We conclude that unprompted distancing can have a decisive effect on pandemic propagation. An important response strategy can be to promote voluntary precautionary behavior shown to reduce disease transmission...|$|E
40|$|Restriction {{endonuclease}} {{analysis has}} revealed extensive mtDNA polymorphism in {{two species of}} rats, Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus. Sequence divergence values for the eight detected R. norvegicus variants range from 0. 2 % to 1. 8 % and for the eight R. rattus variants, from 0. 2 % to 9. 6 %. Three of the most closely related R. norvegicus mtDNA's appear to differ by deletions/insertions of about 4 base pairs apiece. Restriction sites for seven enzymes have been mapped for 11 of these variants. The 31 intraspecific and 41 interspecific variant sites appear to be evenly distributed on the mtDNA molecule outside of the rRNA cistrons. The location of sites present in all the DNAs suggests that the rRNA genes and possibly the light strand origin of replication may be more highly evolutionarily conserved than {{other parts of the}} molecule. The sequence divergences among the mtDNAs of animals whose geographic origins are separated by major barriers, such as oceans, were significantly greater than those among animals found within large land masses, such as the continental United States. Dendrograms (phenograms), which have been constructed to depict the relationships among the various DNAs, indicate that East Asian members of the R. rattus species are more closely related to American rats of this species than to other <b>Asian</b> <b>R.</b> rattus animals from Sri Lanka. Moreover, it appears that R. norvegicus comprises a group taxonomically distinct from any of the R. rattus subspecies...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Retinal {{detachment}} (RD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common of ophthalmic emergencies in the UK. Our aim was to study trends over time and regional variation in rates of RD in England. METHODS: Hospital admission rates for RD were analysed using the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, Hospital Episode Statistics and the Oxford record linkage study between 1968 and 2011. Record linkage was used, when possible, to distinguish between episodes of care and individual people. RESULTS: Person-based rates from the 1960 s to mid- 1990 s (only available in the Oxford data) were broadly stable. From 1999, the annual person-based rate increased significantly, from 13. 4 in 1999 (13. 1 to 13. 8) to 15. 4 in 2011 (15. 1 to 15. 7). Most, if not all, of the increase was an increase in people with diabetes mellitus. RD rates, comparing local authority (LA) areas, ranged from 10. 3 (9. 0 to 11. 6) to 22. 4 per 100   000 (19. 9 to 25. 1) over the period 1999 - 2011. The rate of RD by LA showed almost no association with social deprivation (r(2) = 0. 01) or with the proportion of people in each LA who were Black (r= 0. 04), <b>Asian</b> (<b>r</b> =- 0. 03) or born outside the UK (r= 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Admission rates seem to have increased in recent years. This increase is probably attributable to an increase in the prevalence of diabetes, and so an increase in RD associated with diabetes. Understanding trends over time, and geographical variation, in RD will help match capacity in retinal surgery with need for treatment of RD...|$|E

40|$|Aim: A {{systematic}} review and a meta-analysis {{were conducted in}} order to investigate the potential association of Fc gamma receptor (Fc gamma R) polymorphisms with susceptibility to aggressive and chronic periodontal disease. Materials and Methods: A database search yielded a total of 17 studies involving 1685 cases and 1570 controls. Three polymorphisms {{were included in the}} meta-analysis: Fc gamma RIIA H 131 R (rs 1801274), Fc gamma RIIIA F 158 V (rs 396991) and Fc gamma RIIIB NA 1 /NA 2. Random-effect models were used in the analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) along with their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to compare the distribution of alleles and genotypes between cases and controls. Results and Conclusions: The Fc gamma RIIIB NA 1 /NA 2 polymorphism was associated with both aggressive (per-allele OR 2. 005, 95 % CI: 1. 044, 3. 851) and chronic periodontitis (recessive contrast NA 2 NA 2 versus NA 1 NA 1 +NA 1 NA 2 OR 1. 397, 95 % CI: 1. 039, 1. 878).
