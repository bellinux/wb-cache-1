5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth <b>and</b> <b>sweat,</b> and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in human blood under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon <b>and</b> <b>sweat</b> glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E

40|$|Harlequin {{syndrome}} is an autonomic syndrome of heat, emotion and exercise induced flushing <b>and</b> <b>sweating</b> {{limited to one}} side of the face in combination with impairment of <b>sweating</b> <b>and</b> flushing on the contralateral side. Facial flushing <b>and</b> <b>sweating</b> has been named the "Harlequin Sign". This rare feature, "Harlequin Sign", represents a local autonomic dysfunction due to a cervical sympathetic deficit located at the pre or postganglionic level on the non-flushing side. Harlequin syndrome overlaps with several other syndromes. Parry-Romberg {{syndrome is}} a rare clinical entity of an unknown etiology. It is also described as progressive hemifacial atrophy. We report a nine-years old Turkish boy with asymmetrical facial <b>sweating,</b> flushing <b>and</b> hemifacial atrophy on the right side of his face. Facial flushing <b>and</b> <b>sweating</b> are induced by exercise, thermal, and emotional stimuli...|$|R
5|$|These {{complexes}} {{were usually}} {{located in the}} site core, beside a principal plaza. Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a multiroom range structure. The term acropolis, in a Maya context, refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height. Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds. They generally extended horizontally {{as opposed to the}} towering Maya pyramids, and often had restricted access. Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported roof combs. Rooms often had stone benches, used for sleeping, and holes indicate where curtains once hung. Large palaces, such as at Palenque, could be fitted with a water supply, <b>and</b> <b>sweat</b> baths were often found within the complex, or nearby. During the Early Classic, rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex. Some rooms in palaces were true throne rooms; in the royal palace of Palenque {{there were a number of}} throne rooms that were used for important events, including the inauguration of new kings.|$|E

25|$|Potassium is {{eliminated}} from the body through the gastrointestinal tract, kidney <b>and</b> <b>sweat</b> glands. In the kidneys, elimination of potassium is passive (through the glomeruli), and reabsorption is active in the proximal tubule and the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. There is active excretion of potassium in the distal tubule and the collecting duct; both are controlled by aldosterone. In sweat glands potassium elimination is quite similar to the kidney, its excretion is also controlled by aldosterone.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said (by the present-day {{explorer}} Ranulph Fiennes amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates <b>and</b> <b>sweat</b> evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.|$|E

In the skin, SCNN1A is expressed in the keratinocytes in the epidermal layer, in the sebaceous sweat glands, and the smooth muscle cells mostly within the cytoplasm. In contrast, in the eccrine sweat glands ENaC is mostly located on the luminal surface of eccrine duct epithelia.|$|E
