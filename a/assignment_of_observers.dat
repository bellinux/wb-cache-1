40|$|Expert {{systems are}} {{computer}} programs that emulate the reasoning process {{of a human}} expert or perform in an expert manner in a domain for which no human expert exists. They typically reason with uncertain and imprecise information. In this paper, we present a fuzzy expert system for a airplane navigation fault diagnosis system making the use of fuzzy set theory to deal with uncertainty. The fault diagnosis/detection monitor is governed by engenstructure <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> <b>observer</b> and airplane dynamics is controlled via state feedback controller. A comparison of different methodologies for uncertainty representation in expert system such as Bayesian probability theory, certainty theory, and fuzzy logic theory is investigated and their corresponding reasoning mechanisms are discussed as well. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Expert System A major objective of expert system is a knowledgebased program that provides "expert quality" solutions to problems in a specific domain.

40|$|We {{say that}} two (or more) state {{assignments}} for {{one and the}} same quantum system are compatible if they could represent the <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> <b>observers</b> with differing information about the system. A criterion for compatibility was proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 65, 032315 (2002) ]; however, this leaves unanswered the question of whether there are degrees of compatibility which could be represented by some quantitative measure, and whether there is a straightforward procedure whereby the observers can pool their information to arrive at a unique joint state assignment. We argue that such measures are only sensible given some assumption about what kind of information was used in making the state assignments in the first place, and that in general state assignments do not represent all of the information possessed by the observers. However, we examine one particular measure, and show that it has a straightforward interpretation, assuming that the information was acquired from a particular type of measurement, and that in this case there is a natural rule for pooling information. We extend this measure to compatibility of states for k observers, and show that the value is the solution to a semidefinite program. Similar compatibility measures can be defined for alternative notions of state compatibility, including Post-Peierls (PP) and Equal Support (ES) compatibility.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple {{abstract}} formalisation {{of the act}} of observation, in which the system and the observer {{are assumed to be}} in a pure state and their interaction deterministically changes the states such that the outcome can be read from the state <b>of</b> the <b>observer</b> after the interaction. If the observer consistently realizes the outcome which maximizes the likelihood ratio that the outcome pertains to the system under study (and not to his own state), he will be called Bayes-optimal. We calculate the probability if for each trial of the experiment the observer is in a new state picked randomly from his set of states, and the system under investigation is taken from an ensemble of identical pure states. For classical statistical mixtures, the relative frequency resulting from the maximum likelihood principle is an unbiased estimator of the components of the mixture. For repeated Bayes-optimal observation in case the state space is complex Hilbert space, the relative frequency converges to the Born rule. Hence, the principle of Bayes-optimal observation can be regarded as an underlying mechanism for the Born rule. We show the outcome <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> the Bayes-optimal <b>observer</b> is invariant under unitary transformations and contextual, but the probability that results from repeated application is non-contextual. The proposal gives a concise interpretation for the meaning of the occurrence of a single outcome in a quantum experiment as the unique outcome that, relative to the state of the system, is least dependent {{on the state of the}} observe at the instant of measurement. ...|$|R
