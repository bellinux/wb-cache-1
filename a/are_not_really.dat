5|$|Occasionalism is {{the view}} espoused by Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects {{by an act of}} God's intervention on each specific occasion.|$|E

25|$|In geometry, the rhombicuboctahedron, {{or small}} rhombicuboctahedron, is an Archimedean solid with eight {{triangular}} and eighteen square faces. There are 24 identical vertices, with one triangle and three squares meeting at each. (Note that {{six of the}} squares only share vertices with the triangles while the other twelve share an edge.) The polyhedron has octahedral symmetry, like the cube and octahedron. Its dual is called the deltoidal icositetrahedron or trapezoidal icositetrahedron, although its faces <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> true trapezoids.|$|E
25|$|The {{use of the}} {{equals sign}} is an abuse of notation; those two groups <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> {{identical}} {{but there is a}} way of identifying them that is natural. It can be seen to be natural on the basis, firstly, that these are two alternative descriptions of the bilinear mappings from X × A to Y. That is, however, something particular to the case of tensor product. In category theory the 'naturality' of the bijection is subsumed in the concept of a natural isomorphism.|$|E

There <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> any other convenient places below the weight belt to add trim weights, so the most effective option is to carry the main weights as low as necessary, by using a suitable harness or integrated weight pocket buoyancy compensator which actually allows the weights to be placed correctly, so {{there is no need for}} longitudinal trimming.|$|E

25|$|Today, Pesach Sheni on the 14th of Iyar has {{the status}} of a very minor holiday (so much so that many of the Jewish people have never even heard of it, and it {{essentially}} does not exist outside of Orthodox and traditional Conservative Judaism). There <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> any special prayers or observances that are considered Jewish law. The only change in the liturgy is that in some communities Tachanun, a penitential prayer omitted on holidays, is not said. There is a custom, though not Jewish law, to eat just one piece of matzo on that night.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} such as Kulke and Tripathi {{have proposed}} tribal deities such as Stambhesveri or Kambhesvari to be a possible contributor to the Jagannath triad. However, according to Starza, these <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> tribal deities, but Shaiva deities adopted by tribes in eastern states of India. Yet another proposal for tribal origins is through the medieval era cult of Lakshmi-Narasimha. This hypothesis relies on the unusual flat head, curved mouth and large eyes of Jagannath, which may {{be an attempt to}} abstract an image of a lion's head ready to attack. While the tribal Narasimha theory is attractive states Starza, a weakness of this proposal is that the abstract Narasimha representation in the form does not appear similar to the images of Narasimha in nearby Konark and Kalinga temple artworks.|$|E
25|$|In his youth, Chomsky {{developed}} a dislike {{of capitalism and}} the selfish pursuit of material advancement. At the same time, he {{developed a}} disdain for the authoritarian attempts to establish a socialist society, as represented by the Marxist–Leninist policies of the Soviet Union. Rather than accepting the common view among American economists that a spectrum exists between total state ownership of the economy {{on the one hand}} and total private ownership on the other, he instead suggests that a spectrum should be understood between total democratic control of the economy {{on the one hand and}} total autocratic control (whether state or private) on the other. He argues that Western capitalist nations <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> democratic, because, in his view, a truly democratic society is one in which all persons have a say in public economic policy. He has stated his opposition to ruling elites, among them institutions like the IMF, World Bank, and GATT.|$|E

25|$|A {{drawback}} of SECAM {{for production}} is that, unlike PAL or NTSC, certain post-production operations of encoded SECAM signals <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> possible without a significant drop in quality. As an example, a simple {{fade to black}} is trivial in NTSC and PAL: you just reduce the signal level until it is zero. However, in SECAM the color difference signals, which are frequency modulated, need first to be decoded to e.g. RGB, then the fade-to-black is applied, and finally the resulting signal is re-encoded into SECAM. Because of this, much SECAM video editing was actually done using PAL equipment, then the resultant signal was converted to SECAM. Another drawback of SECAM is that comb filtering, allowing better color separation, is not possible in TV receivers. This was not, however, much of a drawback {{in the early days}} of SECAM as such filters did not become readily available in high-end TV sets before the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The Resurrection Stone {{allows the}} holder {{to bring back}} {{deceased}} loved ones, in a semi-physical form, and communicate with them. The form of Sirius Black generated by the stone tells Harry {{that he and the}} other forms created by the stone are part of him and invisible to others. This seems to suggest that these apparitions are conjured from memories and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> resurrected people. According to the fairy tale concerning the origin of the Deathly Hallows, using the Resurrection Stone drove the owner to kill himself because he brought his late fiancée back from the dead, and she was very unhappy in the real world for she did not belong there. By the time the stone was seen in Marvolo Gaunt's possession, it had been set into a ring that bore the symbol of the Deathly Hallows, which the ignorant Gaunt believed to be the Peverell coat of arms; he used the ring to boast about his ancestry and blood purity. Both Dumbledore and Grindelwald desired the stone, but for different reasons. While Dumbledore wanted it to communicate with his dead family, Grindelwald allegedly intended to use it to create an army of zombie-like Inferi. Harry said this is the Hallow he would desire most, as like Dumbledore he could name people he would like to communicate with again. Voldemort became aware of the ring's antiquity and eventually used the stone as a Horcrux, a container for part of his soul, being unaware of its additional magical properties.|$|E

500|$|Distortions of self-experience such as {{feeling as}} if one's {{thoughts}} or feelings <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> one's own to believing thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common. There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty, for example lack of responsiveness. Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia, as are symptoms of paranoia. Social isolation commonly occurs. Difficulties in working and long-term memory, attention, executive functioning, and speed of processing also commonly occur. In one uncommon subtype, the person may be largely mute, remain motionless in bizarre postures, or exhibit purposeless agitation, all signs of catatonia. People with schizophrenia often find facial emotion perception to be difficult. It is unclear if the phenomenon called [...] "thought blocking", where a talking person suddenly becomes silent {{for a few seconds}} to minutes, occurs in schizophrenia.|$|E
500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I would say the sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read.

[...] Ivan Claudio of IstoÉ Gente praised all of the cast, including the extras whose [...] "wandering like zombies in the courtyards of the asylum ... contribute to the realistic climate of the film." [...] He, however, highlighted Santoro, stating that the joint effort of the cast would be meaningless without his performance. Similar comments on the cast were woven by Veja magazine, which also commended [...] "the feeling of terror." [...] Santoro and Camilo, {{as well as the}} other patient actors, were praised by Marcelo Forlani of Omelete who said, [...] "It's hard to believe that the actors here <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> crazy."
