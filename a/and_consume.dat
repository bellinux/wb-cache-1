5|$|He {{argues that}} across the world, cannibals {{are viewed as}} {{non-human}} entities, committing acts that no human would ordinarily perpetrate. In this way they were akin to various non-human species of animal, and Arens notes that in some societies, cannibals are believed to physically transform into different species in order to kill <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> humans.|$|E
5|$|In {{anaerobic}} protozoa, such as Plagiopyla frontata, archaea reside {{inside the}} protozoa <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> hydrogen produced in their hydrogenosomes. Archaea also associate with larger organisms. For example, the marine archaean Cenarchaeum symbiosum lives within (is an endosymbiont of) the sponge Axinella mexicana.|$|E

5|$|Predators such as foxes {{and cats}} prey on quolls and compete {{with them for}} food. For example, both quolls and foxes catch <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> rabbits. Since the {{introduction}} of foxes, quoll populations have dropped dramatically. Foxes have been eradicated {{from many of the}} islands off the coast of Australia in an effort to protect quolls.|$|E
5|$|Solar energy {{may be used}} in a water {{stabilization}} pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity. A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, although algae may produce toxic chemicals that make the water unusable.|$|E
5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> more bone, leading to tooth breakage. Compared to modern wolves, the high frequency of tooth fracture in Beringian wolves indicates higher carcass consumption due to higher carnivore density and increased competition.|$|E

In tests against a control, Sprague-Dawley rats given free access to less-preferred rat chow and trained to operate a lever repeatedly to obtain preferred rat chow performed additional work when given methylphenidate, d-amphetamine, and phenylpiracetam. Rats given 1 mg/kg amphetamine performed an average of 150% as much work <b>and</b> <b>consumed</b> 50% as much non-preferred rat chow than control rats; rats given 10 mg/kg Methylphenidate performed 170% as much work <b>and</b> <b>consumed</b> similarly; <b>and</b> rats given 100 mg/kg Phenylpiracetam performed an average of 375% as much work, <b>and</b> <b>consumed</b> little non-preferred rat chow.|$|R
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{have been}} documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means {{they are among the}} first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill <b>and</b> <b>consume.</b> This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds are more likely to gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{are able}} to exploit a wide {{diversity}} of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. Ground beetles and rove beetles (Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> many other arthropods and small prey, such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.|$|E
5|$|Its {{popularity}} has spread throughout Eastern Europe {{and the former}} Russian Empire, and – by way of migration – to other continents. In North America, borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites, the groups who first brought it there from Europe. Today, several ethnic groups claim borscht, in its various local guises, as their own national dish <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> {{it as part of}} ritual meals within Eastern Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Roman Catholic, and Jewish religious traditions.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bears are}} {{opportunistic}} omnivores <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and berries to insects, carrion, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted {{to such a}} diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in Taiwan consume large numbers of acorns when these are most common, and switch to ungulates at other times of the year.|$|E
5|$|Not all slaves had {{the same}} social status. Some slaves of wealthy {{families}} lived better than commoners since {{they were allowed to}} wear luxurious clothes <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> quality food and wine. Slaves of high officials could even be feared and respected. The slaves of regent Huo Guang (d. 68 BCE) sometimes came armed to the marketplace and fought commoners, forced the Imperial Secretary to kowtow and apologize (after a scuffle with his slaves over the right-of-way on the street), and were provided services by some officials who sought a promotion through Huo Guang's influence.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of Megaselia scalaris (Phoridae) {{are almost}} {{omnivorous}} <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> such substances as paint and shoe polish. The larvae of the shore flies (Ephydridae) and some Chironomidae survive in extreme environments including glaciers (Diamesa sp., Chironomidae), hot springs, geysers, saline pools, sulphur pools, septic tanks and even crude oil (Helaeomyia petrolei). Adult hoverflies (Syrphidae) {{are well known}} for their mimicry and the larvae adopt diverse lifestyles including being inquiline scavengers inside the nests of social insects. Some brachycerans are agricultural pests, some bite animals and humans and suck their blood, and some transmit diseases.|$|E

50|$|The {{authentic}} traditional Indonesian {{home cooking}} is freshly made <b>and</b> <b>consumed</b> daily with minimal or no processed, canned or preserved foods, which {{means there is}} a minimal amount of preservatives and sodium. Most ingredients are bought fresh {{very early in the}} morning from local traditional markets, cooked around the late morning <b>and</b> <b>consumed</b> mainly for lunch. The leftovers are stored in the cupboard or on the table covered with tudung saji (weaved bamboo food cover to protect the food from insects or other animals), all in room temperature to be heated <b>and</b> <b>consumed</b> again for dinner. Traditionally, Indonesian dishes are rarely stored for long periods of time, thus most of these dishes are cooked <b>and</b> <b>consumed</b> in the same day. Some exceptions apply to dried, salted, and processed food. For example, dry rendang may still be safe to consume for several days. Modern refrigeration technology is available in most households.|$|R
5|$|The southwestern United States {{is one of}} the world's best {{areas for}} insolation, and the Mojave Desert {{receives}} up to twice the sunlight received in other regions of the country. This abundance of solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> no fuel other than sunlight. Some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation, or rooftop solar.|$|E
5|$|Waterfowl, rails, {{and some}} colonial nesting birds are preyed upon by otters in various areas. Susceptibility {{of these species}} is {{greatest}} during the summer (when waterfowl broods are vulnerable) and autumn. The otters have also been known to catch <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> moulting American wigeon (Mareca americana) and green-winged teal (Anas crecca). Other species of birds found within their diets include: northern pintail (Anas acuta); mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); canvasback (Aythya valisineria); ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis); and the American coot (Fulica americana).|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} are apex predators <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed {{mostly on}} invertebrates. They {{play an important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, American alligators bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male American alligators use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|E

5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Captive crickets are omnivorous; when {{deprived}} of their natural diet, they accept {{a wide range of}} organic foodstuffs. Some species are completely herbivorous, feeding on flowers, fruit, and leaves, with ground-based species consuming seedlings, grasses, pieces of leaf, and the shoots of young plants. Others are more predatory and include in their diet invertebrate eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting insects, scale insects, and aphids. Many are scavengers <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> various organic remains, decaying plants, seedlings, and fungi. In captivity, many species have been successfully reared on a diet of ground, commercial dry dog food, supplemented with lettuce and aphids.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are {{versatile}} feeders <b>and</b> <b>consume</b> a {{range of}} mainly vegetable food items. Seeds form {{a large part of}} the diet of all species; these are opened with their large and powerful bills. The galahs, corellas and some of the black cockatoos feed primarily on the ground; others feed mostly in trees. The ground-feeding species tend to forage in flocks, which form tight, squabbling groups where seeds are concentrated and dispersed lines where food is more sparsely distributed; they also prefer open areas where visibility is good. The western and long-billed corellas have elongated bills to excavate tubers and roots and the Major Mitchell's cockatoo walks in a circle around the doublegree (Emex australis) to twist out and remove the underground parts.|$|E
