We decompose total <b>accruals</b> into working capital <b>accruals,</b> long-term investment and non-transaction <b>accruals</b> to test whether the investment can explain the <b>accruals</b> anomalies and behavior in operating and investment cycle. We use the financial information of 135 firms listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) from 2005 to 2011 through OLS approach and find that long-term investment and non-transaction <b>accruals</b> are able to predict subsequent net income and free cash flow.

To predict subsequent ROA, the persistence of total <b>accruals,</b> Long-term investment and external financing decrease in longer operating cycle. Total <b>accruals</b> are more persistent and non-transaction <b>accruals</b> and external financing are less persistent in the longer investment cycle. Total <b>accruals</b> and external financing are inversely related to subsequent returns, implying that <b>accruals</b> anomalies as well as external financing anomalies exist in our sample. To predict future returns, the persistence of total <b>accruals</b> and working capital <b>accruals</b> decrease, however, the persistence of external financing and non-transaction <b>accruals</b> and long-term investment increase in longer operating cycle.

5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the <b>accrual</b> of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible.

40|$|ON THE PRICING EFFECT OF EARNINGS QUALITY PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine the interplay between {{earnings}} quality, information risk and cost of equity capital. Total <b>accruals</b> quality metric which is a numerical estimation based on a firm’s residual <b>accruals</b> is used to depict earnings quality in this thesis. Total <b>accruals</b> quality is further decomposed into innate <b>accruals</b> quality and discretionary <b>accruals</b> quality in order to examine their pricing implications separately. The thesis contributes to the ongoing discussion of whether firm-specific information risk is a priced risk factor, and what is the mechanism through which information risk affects expected returns. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The thesis employs an extensive sample of data drawn from the US market in 1970 – 2006. The earnings quality proxies used in the study rely solely on accounting data, which are retrieved from Compustat North America Annual file. These proxies are used to construct factor mimicking portfolios, whose returns represent the exposure to that particular risk factor. The monthly firm returns data are retrieved from CRSP Monthly Stock file and the other return items are retrieved from Wharton Research Data Services (wrds). Asset-pricing methodology is then applied to study the effect of total <b>accruals</b> quality, innate <b>accruals</b> quality and discretionary <b>accruals</b> quality on expected returns. RESULTS The results provide consistent evidence that total <b>accruals</b> quality is a priced risk factor. The main results from two-stage cross-sectional regressions do not have implications as regards the magnitude of the <b>accruals</b> quality risk premium, but the average positive coefficients indicate that poor <b>accruals</b> quality increase expected returns. The results for innate <b>accruals</b> quality are similar to that of total <b>accruals</b> quality, except that the risk premium implied by the average positive coefficient estimates appears actually larger. This suggests that the pricing effect of total <b>accruals</b> quality may be attributable to the innate components of <b>accruals</b> quality. The results on discretionary <b>accruals</b> quality are somewhat mixed, and the hypothesis that discretionary <b>accruals</b> are just noise in earnings cannot be rejected.

25|$|By {{the timing}} of collection, VAT (as well as {{accounting}} in general) can be either <b>accrual</b> or cash based. Cash basis accounting is a very simple form of accounting. When a payment is received {{for the sale of}} goods or services, a deposit is made, and the revenue is recorded as of the date of the receipt of funds—no matter when the sale had been made. Cheques are written when funds are available to pay bills, and the expense is recorded as of the cheque date—regardless of when the expense had been incurred. The primary focus is on the amount of cash in the bank, and the secondary focus is on making sure all bills are paid. Little effort is made to match revenues to the time period in which they are earned, or to match expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. <b>Accrual</b> basis accounting matches revenues to the time period in which they are earned and matches expenses to the time period in which they are incurred. While it is more complex than cash basis accounting, it provides much more information about your business. The <b>accrual</b> basis allows you to track receivables (amounts due from customers on credit sales) and payables (amounts due to vendors on credit purchases). The <b>accrual</b> basis allows you to match revenues to the expenses incurred in earning them, giving you more meaningful financial reports.|$|E

As in our first regression function, we control for potential firm-specific incentives or firm-specific activities that might influence <b>accruals.</b> However, predictions regarding total <b>accruals</b> differ from predictions regarding discretionary <b>accruals</b> because total <b>accruals</b> are not completely driven by earnings management. For example, we assume that larger firms—where size is measured as the natural logarithm of total assets—have greater total <b>accruals</b> since positive <b>accruals</b> represent assets. Therefore, a firm with more positive <b>accruals</b> also owns larger assets and vice versa.|$|R

We find that TAQ is significantly larger than CAQ, indicating that non-current <b>accruals</b> are of lower quality than current <b>accruals.</b> Correlation tests show that CAQ serves as a reliable instrument for TAQ, insofar as we document economically large and statistically positive correlations between the two variables. These correlations vary across industries, and are stronger when total <b>accruals</b> are relatively smaller in absolute value.

25|$|Living in {{one spot}} would have more easily {{permitted}} the <b>accrual</b> of personal possessions and an attachment to certain areas of land. From such a position, it is argued, prehistoric people were able to stockpile food to survive lean times and trade unwanted surpluses with others. Once trade and a secure food supply were established, populations could grow, and society would have diversified into food producers and artisans, who could afford to develop their trade {{by virtue of the}} free time they enjoyed because of a surplus of food. The artisans, in turn, were able to develop technology such as metal weapons. Such relative complexity would have required some form of social organisation to work efficiently, so it is likely that populations that had such organisation, perhaps such as that provided by religion, were better prepared and more successful. In addition, the denser populations could form and support legions of professional soldiers. Also, during this time property ownership became increasingly important to all people. Ultimately, Childe argued that this growing social complexity, all rooted in the original decision to settle, led to a second Urban Revolution in which the first cities were built.|$|E
25|$|Among PEF's major {{political}} initiatives {{at this time}} were a cost-of-living increase for worker pensions. Benson also said he would seek improvements to job security; <b>accrual</b> (rather than use-or-lose) for overtime, sick leave, and vacation; eliminate tiers in the pension plan; seek an end to penalties for early retirement; new workplace safety protections; {{an increase in the}} size of the state workforce; and new restrictions on contracting out. The state replied that it would seek a four-year wage freeze. Angered by the state's response in a time of budget surpluses, Benson led PEF workers in an extensive lobbying effort. He also said PEF would seek a three-year rather than four-year contract, and 5 percent per year wage increases. Benson also replaced the union's top negotiator in order to adopt a more aggressive stand with the state. The state countered with a 3 percent per year salary increase over four years, coupled with new restrictions on time off for union business, higher health care costs, and new worktime reporting requirements (all of which PEF rejected). At a rally at the state capital on January 5, 2000, some 5,000 (state estimate) to 25,000 (PEF estimate) workers peacefully confronted 25 Albany police and 300 New York State troopers. PEF revised its wage offer to 12 percent over three years. Benson accused the state in March 2000 of dragging out the negotiations, and began a statewide radio advertising campaign against the governor. In April, PEF accepted a contract with the New York State Canal Corporation with a 3 percent per year salary hike. Days later, after another state union accepted a contract containing a 13.6 percent raise over four years, about 2,000 PEF members held a noisy rally outside the governor's offices demanding faster negotiations. Two weeks afterward, PEF agreed to end its advertising campaign and rallies as a spur to negotiations. A week later, Governor George Pataki agreed to wage and pension COLAs. A tentative agreement reached on June 10, 2000, incorporated a 13 percent wage hike over four years, rejected the new working time data collection methods, and imposed slight increases in member health care payments. Union members approved the contract by a vote of 33,899 to 2,876.|$|E
40|$|If {{the market}} anticipates the {{reversing}} nature of abnormal working capital <b>accruals,</b> then the reported magnitude of earnings surprises that contain abnormal <b>accruals</b> will {{differ from the}} underlying magnitude that is priced by the market.

Consistent with our hypotheses, we find higher ERCs when abnormal <b>accruals</b> suppress the magnitude of earnings surprises, and lower ERCs when abnormal <b>accruals</b> exaggerate the magnitude of earnings surprises. We also find results consistent with analysts predictably considering the reversing implications of abnormal <b>accruals</b> in revising future earnings forecasts.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} earnings management on the value-relevance of earnings and book value. Two different sources of earnings management are investigated: short-term discretionary <b>accruals</b> and long-term discretionary <b>accruals.</b> A contribution {{of this paper is}} the development of models to estimate short-term and long-term discretionary <b>accruals.</b> The effect of earnings management on the relative value-relevance of earnings and book value depends on the source of earnings management.

Examination of both measures simultaneously reveals the differential impact of short-term versus long-term discretionary <b>accruals.</b> Earnings management via short-term discretionary <b>accruals</b> has no impact, whereas earnings management via long-term discretionary <b>accruals</b> reduces the valuerelevance of earnings and increases the value-relevance of book value.
