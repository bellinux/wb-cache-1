5|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of dams on the Missouri, pallid sturgeon migrated hundreds of miles upstream to spawn, and sought out rocky or hard surfaces to deposit hundreds of thousands of eggs. One female pallid sturgeon caught in the upper Missouri River was estimated to be carrying 170,000 eggs, representing over 11 percent of its total body weight. After fertilization, pallid sturgeon eggs hatch in 5 to 8 days, after which the larvae drift back downstream for several weeks. As the larvae develop tails, they seek out slower-moving waterways and slowly mature over a period of <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>years.</b> The rate of survival to maturity for pallid sturgeon larvae is extremely low, and of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} eggs spawned, only a few live to adulthood.|$|E
5|$|Sure, it's not a Sepultura reunion, {{but having}} Max and Igor {{performing}} on {{record for the}} first time in <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>years</b> is as close as we'll ever get, and not only does Cavalera Conspiracy's Inflikted revisit the post-thrash sounds of 1993's Chaos A.D., but it manages to outshine anything Sepultura has put out in the last dozen years. Rounded out by Soulfly lead guitarist Marc Rizzo and, most impressively, Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier on bass and rhythm guitar, the band is as solid a metal supergroup as you'll ever come across, and the album's eleven tracks benefit hugely from the chemistry between the four musicians.|$|E

He was replaced by two-time European champion and former Chelsea boss José Mourinho on 27 May 2016. Mourinho became United's fourth manager (including Giggs) in as many years since Ferguson's retirement.|$|E
