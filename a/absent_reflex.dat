40|$|Fifteen {{women with}} {{intractable}} chronic idiopathic constipation dating from adolescence were investigated by anorectal manometry, neurophysiological {{evaluation of the}} conus medullaris and external anal sphincter. Comparison was made with 25 asymptomatic female control subjects. Urological disturbances were common amongst the constipated, in five of whom incidental lumbosacral spinal dysraphism was found. No differences in sphincter pressures or the rectosphincteric reflex were demonstrable between the two groups. Rectal defecatory sensation was blunted and the compliance was increased in the constipated group. The latency of the pudendo-anal reflex was significantly prolonged in idiopathic constipation, two women having an <b>absent</b> <b>reflex</b> (greater than 100 ms). Mean motor unit potential duration of the external anal sphincter was not significantly prolonged in the eight constipated women tested. A central neurogenic deficit is postulated in some women with this disorder...|$|E

40|$|The {{final version}} of record is {{available}} at [URL] with eumenorrhoeic women, exercise-trained women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (ExFHA) exhibit low heart rates (HRs) and <b>absent</b> <b>reflex</b> renin-angiotensin-system activation and augmentation of their muscle sympathetic nerve response to orthostatic stress. To test the hypothesis that their autonomic HR modulation is altered concurrently, three age-matched (pooled mean, 24 ± 1 years; mean ± S. E. M.) groups of women were studied: active with either FHA (ExFHA; n= 11) or eumenorrhoeic cycles (ExOv; n= 17) and sedentary with eumenorrhoeic cycles (SedOv; n= 17). Blood pressure (BP), HR and HR variability (HRV) in the frequency domain were determined during both supine rest and graded lower body negative pressure (LBNP; - 10, - 20 and - 40 mmHg). Very low (VLF), low (LF) and high (HF) frequency power spectra (ms(2)) were determined and, owing to skewness, log 10 -transformed. LF/HF ratio and total power (VLF + LF + HF) were calculated. At baseline, HR and systolic BP (SBP) were lower (P 0. 05). At each stage, HR correlated inversely (P< 0. 05) with HF. In conclusion, ExFHA women demonstrate augmented vagal yet unchanged sympathetic HR modulation, both at rest and during orthostatic stress. Although the role of oestrogen deficiency is unclear, these findings are in contrast with studies reporting decreased HRV in hypoestrogenic post-menopausal women...|$|E
40|$|The {{failure of}} plasma {{norepinephrine}} to rise during upright posture is {{accepted as a}} diagnostic sign of autonomic nervous failure in patients with postural hypotension. Our clinical experience has been that this test is misleading, {{with an increase in}} plasma norepinephrine commonly occurring. To test whether this might result from <b>absent</b> <b>reflex</b> postural venous constriction lowering cardiac output and plasma norepinephrine clearance, we measured norepinephrine plasma kinetics during recumbency and 30 ° head-up tilting in six patients with pure autonomic failure and eight healthy subjects. Mean arterial pressure fell by 54 ± 8 mm Hg with head-up tilt in the patients with pure autonomic failure. The plasma norepinephrine concentration (arterial sampling) increased 73 ± 29 pg/ml (mean difference±SED, p< 0. 02), solely because of a 36 % reduction in the clearance of norepinephrine from plasma (0. 78 ± 0. 09 1 /min, p< 0. 0001). In normal subjects, plasma norepinephrine concentration rose by 112 ± 20 pg/ml (p< 0. 001), largely because of a 24 % increase in norepinephrine spillover to plasma (190 ± 20 ng/min, p< 0. 005). When the postural fall in blood pressure and cardiac output in the pure autonomic failure patients was prevented by the selective venoconstrictor dihydroergotamine (10 /tg/kg i. v.), no fall in plasma clearance or rise in plasma concentration of norepi-nephrine occurred. Measurement of the change in plasma norepinephrine with postural stimulation in patients with orthostatic hypotension is not a reliable diagnostic test for autonomic failure because elevation...|$|E
40|$|Dying brain Editor—Ancillary tests used {{to confirm}} {{clinically}} diagnosed brain death may substantially influence {{the time of}} diagnosis, as in the following case. A 48 -yr-old woman was shot to the head and {{was admitted to the}} hospital at 01 : 00 a. m. with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 1 (eye), 5 (motor), 1 (verbal); brain tissue oxygen tension measured with an intraparenchymal catheter was 12 mm Hg (normal range 15 – 35 mm Hg), and the intracranial pressure was 25 mm Hg. At 07 : 00 a. m., GCS score was 3 with absent brainstem reflexes. Brain CT revealed massive cerebral oedema, the brain tissue oxygen tension was zero, and the intracranial pressure was 81 mm Hg with a cerebral perfusion pressure of zero. EEG showed a persistent low amplitude theta activity at the vertex and transcranial Doppler (TCD) a persistent cerebral blood flow in middle cerebral arteries (systolic flow velocity: 30 cm s– 1) (Fig. 1 A). At 09 : 00 a. m. of the next day, EEG was flat, and the 6 h observation period required by the Italian law to declare brain death was started; however, a TCD still showed a very low systolic flow velocity and a residual diastolic flow velocity (Fig. 1 B). At 03 : 00 p. m., deep coma, <b>absent</b> <b>reflex</b> motor response and brainstem reflexes, and flat EEG persisted. Brain death was declared. TCD showed a reverberating flow indicating cerebral circulatory arrest (Fig. 1 C). There is widespread acceptance of the concept of brain death in the Western hemisphere, 1 and a fairly uniform agreement in Europe regarding the clinical criteria. 2 There is, however, considerable variation in the use of additional confirmatory tests. 1 2 These include flat EEG and determination of cerebral circulatory arrest by means of cerebral angiography, brain CT or MRI angiography, TCD, or cerebral scintigraphy. In the UK, 1 only clinical criteria are used and brain death is defined as the complete, irreversible loss of brainstem function. In Sweden, 1 cerebral angiography is the facultative ancillary test to confirm brain death; in Italy, EEG is mandatory, while cerebral angiography, brain CT angiography, TCD, or cerebral scintigraphy are all permitted methods to document cerebral circulatory arrest in children of, 1 yr of age, or if a complete and reliable clinical evaluation is not possible...|$|E

50|$|Polyneuropathy in {{dogs and}} cats is a {{collection}} of peripheral nerve disorders that often are breed-related in these animals. Polyneuropathy indicates that multiple nerves are involved, unlike mononeuropathy. Polyneuropathy usually involves motor nerve dysfunction, also known as lower motor neuron disease. Symptoms include decreased or <b>absent</b> <b>reflexes</b> and muscle tone, weakness, or paralysis. It often occurs in the rear legs and is bilateral. Most are chronic problems with a slow onset of symptoms, but some occur suddenly.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{diagnose}} Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, ataxia and ophthalmoplegia must be present.

50|$|Hyporeflexia {{refers to}} below normal or <b>absent</b> <b>reflexes</b> (areflexia). It can be {{detected}} {{through the use of}} a reflex hammer. It is the opposite of hyperreflexia.Hyporeflexia is generally associated with a lower motor neuron deficit (at the alpha motor neurons from spinal cord to muscle), whereas hyperreflexia is often attributed to upper motor neuron lesions (along the long, motor tracts from the brain). The upper motor neurons are thought to inhibit the reflex arc, which is formed by sensory neurons from intrafusal fibers of muscles, lower motor neurons (including alpha and gamma motor fibers) and appurtenant interneurons. Therefore, damage to lower motor neurons will subsequently result in hyporeflexia and/or areflexia.|$|R

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome depends on findings such as rapid development of muscle paralysis, <b>absent</b> <b>reflexes,</b> absence of fever, and a likely cause.

30|$|Assessment of {{peripheral}} neuropathy {{was done by}} neuropathy disability score (NDS) and nerve conduction studies. The NDS was established by bilateral examination of the pin–prick sensation, temperature sensation, vibration test, and Achilles tendon reflex. The sensory modalities were scored as either present[*]=[*] 0 or absent/reduced[*]=[*] 1, whereas the scoring for the ankle jerks was as follows: present[*]=[*] 0, present with reinforcement[*]=[*] 1, absent[*]=[*] 2, so the maximum abnormal score is 10 which indicates a complete loss of sensation to all sensory modalities and <b>absent</b> <b>reflexes.</b> A score of 0 – 2 implies no neuropathy, 3 – 5 is an indicator of mild neuropathy, 6 – 8 is moderate, and 9 – 10 is consistent with severe neuropathy [14].|$|R
50|$|In {{the absence}} of a pathology, a loud sound (generally greater than 70 dB above threshold) causes the stapedius muscle to contract, {{reducing}} the admittance of the middle ear and softening the perceived loudness of the sound. If the mobility of the stapes is reduced due to otosclerosis, then stapedius muscle contraction does not significantly decrease the admittance. When acoustic reflex testing is conducted, the acoustic reflex thresholds (ART) cannot be determined when attempting to measure on the affected side. Also, a conductive pathology will attenuate the test stimuli, resulting in either elevated <b>reflex</b> thresholds or <b>absent</b> <b>reflexes</b> when the stimulus is presented in the affected ear and measured in the other ear.|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{the relationship of}} gag and cough reflexes to Glasgow coma score (GCS) in Chinese adults requiring critical care. Method: Prospective observational study of adult patients requiring treatment in the trauma or resuscitation rooms of the Emergency Department, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. A long cotton bud to stimulate the posterior pharyngeal wall (gag reflex) and a soft tracheal suction catheter were introduced through the mouth to stimulate the laryngopharynx and elicit the cough reflex. Reflexes were classified as normal, attenuated or absent. Results: A total of 208 patients were recruited. Reduced gag and cough reflexes {{were found to be}} significantly related to reduced GCS (p= 0. 014 and 0. 002, respectively). Of 33 patients with a GCS ≤ 8, 12 (36. 4 %) had normal gag reflexes and 8 (24. 2 %) had normal cough reflexes. 23 / 62 (37. 1 %) patients with a GCS of 9 - 14 had <b>absent</b> gag <b>reflexes,</b> and 27 (43. 5 %) had <b>absent</b> cough <b>reflexes.</b> In patients with a normal GCS, 22. 1 % (25 / 113) had <b>absent</b> gag <b>reflexes</b> and 25. 7 % (29) had <b>absent</b> cough <b>reflexes.</b> Conclusions: Our study has shown that in a Chinese population {{with a wide range of}} critical illness (but little trauma or intoxication), reduced GCS is significantly related to gag and cough reflexes. However, a considerable proportion of patients with a GCS ≤ 8 have intact airway reflexes and may be capable of maintaining their own airway, whilst many patients with a GCS > 8 have impaired airway reflexes and may be at risk of aspiration. This has important implications for airway management decisions. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
