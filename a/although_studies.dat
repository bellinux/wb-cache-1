5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, <b>although</b> <b>studies</b> appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E

In 2001 both were elevated to species status, {{a decision that}} was later supported by genetic research. Three subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, which had been published decades earlier, were also recognized as variegata, editorum, and subcincta, <b>although</b> <b>studies</b> have not been entirely conclusive.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, <b>although</b> <b>studies</b> show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E

5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more weaned calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows. However, the benefits of hybrid vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. <b>Although</b> <b>studies</b> acknowledge that the major production benefits of hybrid vigour occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, and {{ingestion}} {{may lead}} to acute lead poisoning, as is applicable for all soluble lead compounds. All inorganic lead compounds are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as probably carcinogenic to humans (Category2A). They {{have been linked to}} renal cancer and glioma in experimental animals and to renal cancer, brain cancer and lung cancer in humans, <b>although</b> <b>studies</b> of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to arsenic. Lead is known to substitute for zinc in a number of enzymes, including δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (porphobilinogen synthase) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase, important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie {{is found}} in the Trans-Fly region of {{southern}} New Guinea, between the Oriomo River and the Princess Mariane Strait, and across most of Australia, bar the tip of Cape York, the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts, and southwest of Tasmania. Birds taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria were introduced into New Zealand by local Acclimatisation Societies of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s, with the Wellington Acclimatisation Society releasing 260 birds in 1874. White-backed forms are spread on both the North and eastern South Island, while black-backed forms are found in the Hawke's Bay region. Magpies were introduced into New Zealand to control agricultural pests, and were therefore a protected species until 1951. They are thought to affect native New Zealand bird populations such as the tui and kererū, sometimes raiding nests for eggs and nestlings, <b>although</b> <b>studies</b> by Waikato University have cast doubt on this, and much blame on the magpie as a predator in the past has been anecdotal only. Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Sri Lanka, although the species has failed to become established. It has become established in western Taveuni in Fiji, however.|$|E

25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>studies</b> {{carried out}} before the {{renovation}} work began showed most of the raft foundation was still in good condition, water from the adjacent Singapore River had seeped slowly {{into some of the}} foundation's cells over the years, flooding parts of the old basement. As a result, a new precast concrete platform was built over the cells, and waterproofing added. Pillars supporting the entire building now rest on the platform. The engineering team installed a new set of five drainage pumps to counteract the slow seepage of river water. As the building sits on solid rock foundation, no additional piling was required.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Miller–Urey experiment, {{scientific}} consensus was that the early Earth had a reducing atmosphere with compounds relatively rich in hydrogen and poor in oxygen (e.g., CH4 and NH3 as opposed to CO2 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)). However, current scientific consensus describes the primitive atmosphere as either weakly reducing or neutral (see also Oxygen Catastrophe). Such an atmosphere would diminish both the amount and variety of amino acids that could be produced, <b>although</b> <b>studies</b> that include iron and carbonate minerals (thought present in early oceans) in the experimental conditions have again produced a diverse array of amino acids. Other scientific research has focused on two other potential reducing environments: outer space and deep-sea thermal vents.|$|E
25|$|The {{canonical}} Wnt Pathway {{involves the}} accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which activates transcription factors. Casein kinase 1 epsilon, and related casein kinase 1 delta, is dephosphorylated in this pathway. Dephospho rylation of casein kinase 1 epsilon is likely achieved by Protein Phosphatase 2(PP2A), which increases both the enzymes' kinase activity in vivo. Casein kinase 1 epsilon and casein kinase 1 delta have been implicated in increasing β-catenin's stability in the cytoplasm, <b>although</b> <b>studies</b> of the mechanism for this stabilization are inconclusive. The current theory for how casein kinase 1 epsilon and/or casein kinase 1 delta function in this pathway is that both casein kinases either directly stabilize β-catenin though positive regulation, or that they indirectly stabilizes β-catenin through negative regulation of the β-catenin degradation complex (protease).|$|E

25|$|Experimental method: This {{method is}} an {{experimental}} paradigm {{used to study}} human experiences involved in the studies of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms <b>although</b> <b>studies</b> are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or emotional disorders. Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific experiences have any common factors. This method is used to seek clarity of the experience and remove any biases to help understand the meaning behind the experience {{to see if it}} can be generalized.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that it is very}} {{difficult}} to eliminate the optimistic bias; however, some people believe that trying to reduce the optimistic bias will encourage people to adapt to health-protective behaviors. Some researchers suggest that the optimistic bias cannot be reduced, and that by trying to reduce the optimistic bias the end result was generally even more optimistically biased. In a study of four different tests to reduce the optimistic bias, researchers found that regardless of the attempts to reduce the bias, through lists of risk factors, participants perceiving themselves as inferior to others, participants asked to think of high-risk individuals, and giving attributes of why they were at risk, all increased the bias rather than decreased it. <b>Although</b> <b>studies</b> have tried to reduce the optimistic bias through reducing distance, overall, the optimistic bias still remains.|$|E
25|$|The {{atmospheric}} composition {{in the stratosphere}} is 98.4% nitrogen—the only dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere in the Solar System aside from Earth's—with the remaining 1.6% composed of mostly of methane (1.4%) and hydrogen (0.1–0.2%). Because methane condenses out of Titan's atmosphere at high altitudes, its abundance increases as one descends below the tropopause {{at an altitude of}} 32km, leveling off at a value of 4.9% between 8km and the surface. There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene and propane, and of other gases, such as cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, argon and helium. The orange color as seen from space must be produced by other more complex chemicals in small quantities, possibly tholins, tar-like organic precipitates. The hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan's upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun's ultraviolet light, producing a thick orange smog. Titan has no magnetic field, <b>although</b> <b>studies</b> in 2008 showed that Titan retains remnants of Saturn's magnetic field on the brief occasions when it passes outside Saturn's magnetosphere and is directly exposed to the solar wind.
