5|$|Nescopeck Creek {{is in the}} {{geological}} region known as the Ridge and Valley region. This region is characterized by fertile valleys and steep ridges. However, the eastern reaches of the Nescopeck Creek watershed <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> border of the Appalachian Plateau region.|$|E
5|$|Point Loma is {{recognized}} as a National Landmark of Soaring of the National Soaring Museum because of the many record flights that took place along the promontory. Two plaques honoring these accomplishments <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> entrance to the Cabrillo National Monument.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rogue Valley near Medford {{is partly}} urban, the average {{population}} {{density of the}} Rogue watershed is only about 32 people per square mile (12 per km2). Several historic bridges cross the river near the more populated areas. Many public parks, hiking trails, and campgrounds <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> river, which flows largely through forests, including national forests. Biodiversity {{in many parts of}} the basin is high; the Klamath-Siskiyou temperate coniferous forests, which extend into the southwestern Rogue basin, are among the four most diverse of this kind in the world.|$|E

5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the effects}} of the cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe. Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> unique center of an explosion.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma was the 21st-largest {{recipient}} of medical {{funding from the}} federal government in 2005, with health-related federal expenditures in the state totaling $75,801,364; immunizations, bioterrorism preparedness, and health education were the top three most funded medical items. Instances of major diseases <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> national average in Oklahoma, and the state ranks at or slightly above {{the rest of the country}} in percentage of people with asthma, diabetes, cancer, and hypertension.|$|E

Due to its position of being <b>near</b> <b>the</b> University Belt, the station is also close to educational institutions of the University Belt.|$|R
50|$|Sougé is {{a village}} in the {{department}} of Loir-et-Cher, there is 437 inhabitants.The village of Sougé <b>is</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> village of Couture-sur-Loir (the village of Pierre de Ronsard). The village of Sougé <b>is</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> town of Montoire-sur-le-Loir.|$|R
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{threatened}} by humans indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur seals and brown fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> top of food chains and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.|$|E
5|$|Scotch Run {{flows through}} the Scotch Valley. The stream flows over the lowest point between Nescopeck Mountain and McCauley Mountain. Scotch Valley is {{relatively}} narrow, but becomes somewhat wider downstream of Mifflin Cross Roads. A pond or small lake {{is located at the}} stream's headwaters. A few patches of wetland on the National Wetlands Inventory <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> stream. It is flanked by a 100 year floodplain throughout its entire length.|$|E
5|$|The AV-8B Harrier II is a subsonic attack {{aircraft}} {{of metal}} and composite construction that retains the basic layout of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, with horizontal stabilizers and shoulder-mounted wings featuring prominent anhedral (downward slope). The aircraft {{is powered by a}} single Rolls-Royce Pegasus turbofan engine, which has two intakes and four synchronized vectorable nozzles close to its turbine. Two of these nozzles are located near the forward, cold end of the engine and two <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> rear, hot end of the engine. This arrangement contrasts with most fixed-wing aircraft, which have engine nozzles only at the rear. The Harrier II also has smaller valve-controlled nozzles in the nose, tail, and wingtips to provide control at low airspeeds.|$|E
50|$|Stebbing Green is a hamlet in the Uttlesford District, in {{the county}} of Essex. It <b>is</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> village of Stebbing; its post town is Dunmow. It <b>is</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> B1256 road (Dunmow Road) and the main A120 road.|$|R
50|$|An example gear {{application}} {{would be}} a device that winds thread onto a conical bobbin on a spinning machine. The bobbin would need to wind faster when <b>the</b> thread <b>is</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> apex than when it <b>is</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> base.|$|R

5|$|The National Mall is a large, open park in {{downtown}} Washington between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol. Given its prominence, the mall {{is often the}} location of political protests, concerts, festivals, and presidential inaugurations. The Washington Monument and the Jefferson Pier <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> center of the mall, south of the White House. Also on the mall are the National World War II Memorial at {{the east end of}} the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.|$|E
5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and rollers, {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames. The one-piece horizontal tailplane {{is attached to the}} load-bearing frame at two mounting points.|$|E
5|$|The most {{apparent}} lava flows at a seamount are the eruptive flows that cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in {{the forms of}} dikes and sills, are also {{an important part of}} seamount growth. The most common type of flow is pillow lava, named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are glassy and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are the products of the explosive activity of seamounts that <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> water's surface, and can also form from mechanical wear of existing volcanic rock.|$|E

5|$|The {{most recent}} {{volcanic}} {{activity at the}} Mount Edziza volcanic complex have been hot springs, several of which are found on the volcano's western flank, including Elwyn springs (36°C or 97°F), Taweh springs (46°C or 115°F), and inactive springs near Mess Lake. The springs <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> youngest lava fields of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex and are most likely associated with the most recent eruptive activity. These hot springs were highly important to the adjacent Tahltan people.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain is}} level enough, and the ridge broad enough, {{to allow for}} a 500-foot (150 m) parking lot along the south side of Highway 82 at the height of land. The pass is split evenly between Pitkin and Lake counties, as well as White River and San Isabel {{national}} forests. Boundaries of the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness and the Mount Massive Wilderness <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> pass on the south and north respectively. The Hunter–Fryingpan Wilderness is also nearby.|$|E
5|$|Certain weapons can be dual-wielded, {{allowing}} the player to trade accuracy, {{the use of}} grenades and melee attacks for raw firepower. The player can carry two weapons at a time (or three if dual-wielding; one weapon remains holstered), with each weapon having advantages and disadvantages in different combat situations. For example, most Covenant weapons eschew disposable ammo clips for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced if depleted. However, these weapons can overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading, but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire. The player can carry a total of eight grenades (four human grenades, four Covenant) to dislodge and disrupt enemies. New in Halo 2 {{is the ability to}} board enemy vehicles that <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> player and traveling at low speeds. The player or AI latches onto the vehicle and forcibly ejects the other driver from the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|Flowers change sex {{in their}} development, so the stamens release their pollen before {{the stigma of}} the same flower is receptive. The {{arrangement}} is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at {{the outer edge of}} the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.|$|E
5|$|The {{city itself}} is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, {{the city is}} said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but {{typically}} include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park, Broadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst, Hawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas <b>are</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result {{of two of the}} many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) {{at the mouth of the}} city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill, View Ridge/Wedgwood/Bryant, Maple Leaf, Phinney Ridge, Mt. Baker Ridge, and Highlands/Carkeek/Bitterlake.|$|E
