50|$|The dead <b>code</b> <b>elimination</b> {{technique}} {{is in the}} same class of optimizations as unreachable <b>code</b> <b>elimination</b> and redundant <b>code</b> <b>elimination.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{programming}} languages, compilers {{and operating}} systems offer no or little more support than dynamic loading of libraries and late linking, therefore software utilizing dynamic dead <b>code</b> <b>elimination</b> {{is very rare}} with languages compiled ahead-of-time or written in assembly language. However, language implementations doing just-in-time compilation may dynamically optimize for dead <b>code</b> <b>elimination.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{common use}} of dead <b>code</b> <b>elimination</b> is as an {{alternative}} to optional code inclusion via a preprocessor. Consider the following code. int main(void) { int a = 5; int b = 6; int c; c = a * (b / 2); if (0) { /* DEBUG */ printf("%d\n", c); } return c; }Because the expression 0 will always evaluate to false, the code inside the if statement can never be executed, and dead <b>code</b> <b>elimination</b> would remove it entirely from the optimized program. This technique is common in debugging to optionally activate blocks of code; using an optimizer with dead <b>code</b> <b>elimination</b> eliminates the need for using a preprocessor to perform the same task.|$|R

50|$|In Microsoft's {{preliminary}} SunSpider benchmarks for {{the third}} 32-bit Internet Explorer 9 Platform Preview, it outperformed the Internet Explorer 8 engine {{by a factor of}} 10 and also outperformed the newest Firefox 4.0 pre-release. Microsoft provided information that its new javascript engine uses dead <b>code</b> <b>elimination</b> optimization for faster performance, which included a small section of code in the SunSpider test as dead code. Robert Sayre, a Mozilla developer investigated this further, showing that Internet Explorer 9's preview 3 dead <b>code</b> <b>elimination</b> had bugs, providing test cases exposing these bugs resulting in wrong compilation.|$|R

5000|$|In California and New York, {{because of}} the {{existence}} of both overlay <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> (where an <b>area</b> <b>code</b> must be dialed for every call) and non-overlay <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> (where an <b>area</b> <b>code</b> is dialed only for calls outside the subscriber's home <b>area</b> <b>code),</b> [...] "permissive home <b>area</b> <b>code</b> dialing" [...] of 1 + the <b>area</b> <b>code</b> within the same <b>area</b> <b>code,</b> even if no <b>area</b> <b>code</b> is required, has been permitted since the mid-2000s (decade). For example, in the 213 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> (a non-overlay <b>area</b> <b>code),</b> calls may be dialed as 7 digits (XXX-XXXX) or 1-213 + 7 digits. The manner in which a call is dialed does not affect the billing of the call. This [...] "permissive home <b>area</b> <b>code</b> dialing" [...] helps maintain uniformity and eliminates confusion given the different types of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> relief that has made California the nation's most [...] "area code" [...] intensive State. Unlike other states with overlay <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> (Texas, Maryland, Florida and Pennsylvania and others), the California Public Utilities Commission and the New York State Public Service Commission maintain two different dial plans: Landlines must dial 1 + <b>area</b> <b>code</b> whenever an <b>Area</b> <b>Code</b> is part of the dialed digits while cellphone users can omit the [...] "1" [...] and just dial 10 digits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 406 is the {{telephone}} <b>area</b> <b>code</b> covering {{the entire state}} of Montana. It has been Montana's <b>area</b> <b>code</b> since <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> were created in 1947.|$|R
50|$|<b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 334 is a NANPA <b>area</b> <b>code</b> serving southeastern Alabama.

5000|$|<b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 916 is a California {{telephone}} <b>area</b> <b>code</b> {{that was}} one of the first three original <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> established in California in October 1947. The largest city in this numbering plan area is Sacramento, the state capital. The <b>area</b> <b>code</b> has been split twice since it went into service, forming <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> 209 and 530. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 279 was approved as an overlay for <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 916 effective March 10, 2018.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{original}} 1947 plan, <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> containing [...] "0" [...] (zero) as a middle digit were only assigned to states that were entirely {{covered by a}} single <b>area</b> <b>code.</b> <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 507, along with <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 606 in Kentucky and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 607 in New York, were the first <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> with a middle digit of [...] "0" [...] to be assigned to states that were covered {{by more than one}} <b>area</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R
2500|$|To {{meet the}} {{increased}} demand for phone numbers, two overlay <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> were introduced in 2001. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 647 (supplementing the 416 <b>area</b> <b>code)</b> was introduced in March 2001 and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 289 (supplementing the 905 <b>area</b> <b>code)</b> was introduced in July 2001. Some individuals within the 905 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> region may have to dial long distance to reach each other; although residents of Mississauga and Hamilton share the same <b>area</b> <b>code</b> (905), an individual from Toronto, for example, would have to dial [...] "1" [...] to reach Hamilton, but not to reach Mississauga. Ten-digit telephone dialling, including the <b>area</b> <b>code</b> for local calls, is required throughout the GTA. In March 2013, two additional <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> {{were introduced to the}} GTA: <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 437 in Toronto and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 365 in the area served by 905 and 289.|$|R
50|$|After the {{standardization}} of American telephone <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> in 1947, {{almost all of}} Los Angeles County used the 213 <b>area</b> <b>code.</b> Because the population and phone usage of the Los Angeles metropolitan area greatly increased during the 1980s and 1990s, the 213 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> was split into several new <b>area</b> <b>codes,</b> including the 818 and 310 <b>area</b> <b>codes.</b> The 818 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> entered service on January 7, 1984. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 626 was split from it on June 14, 1997.|$|R
50|$|The Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control, in August 1999, {{proposed}} an <b>area</b> <b>code</b> overlay for the 203 <b>area</b> <b>code.</b> <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 475 {{went into effect}} on December 12, 2009. Even though <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 475 overlays only 203, all callers in Connecticut (including those in <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 860) had to dial all calls with ten digits, effective November 14, 2009; this is because when needed, an overlay of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 959 on <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 860 will be implemented.|$|R
50|$|<b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 902 and overlay <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 782 are the {{telephone}} <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The 902 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> {{is one of}} the 86 original <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> established in the North American Numbering Plan in October 1947.|$|R
50|$|Another {{major feature}} was the {{internal}} linker for Win32, Win64, and Windows CE, which greatly improveď linking time and memory use, {{and make the}} compile-link-run cycle in Lazarus much faster. The efficiency for smart-linking, or dead <b>code</b> <b>elimination,</b> was also improved.|$|R
50|$|Programming Languages {{and their}} Compilers by John Cocke and Jacob T. Schwartz, {{published}} early in 1970, devoted more than 200 pages to optimization algorithms.

50|$|<b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 264 is the {{telephone}} <b>area</b> <b>code</b> of Anguilla in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). The <b>area</b> <b>code</b> {{was created in}} a split from the original <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 809 around March 1997. The <b>area</b> <b>code</b> is also represented on {{the telephone}} dial by the letter sequence ANG.|$|R
50|$|Lawrence {{is served}} by <b>Area</b> <b>codes</b> 978 and 351. Originally a part of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 617, it became part of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 508 in 1988 before that, too, was split, with 978 {{covering}} the northern half of the old <b>area</b> <b>code.</b> <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 351 is considered an overlay code.|$|R
50|$|Telephone <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 708 covers {{western and}} {{southern}} Cook County and {{eastern and southern}} Will County {{in the state of}} Illinois, USA. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 708 was split off from <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 312 on November 11, 1989, and once covered almost all of the suburbs of Chicago. In 1996, <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 847 and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 630 were broken off from 708. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 464 is being reserved as an overlay <b>area</b> <b>code</b> for 708 to provide additional numbering options for this area.|$|R
50|$|The new network design, {{completed}} in 1947, provided for 152 <b>area</b> <b>codes,</b> {{each with a}} capacity to serve 540 central offices. Originally only 86 <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> were assigned. New Jersey received the first <b>area</b> <b>code</b> in the new system, <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 201. The second <b>area</b> <b>code,</b> 202 {{was assigned to the}} District of Columbia. The allocation of <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> was readjusted as early as 1948 to account for inadequacies in some metropolitan areas. For example, Indiana <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 317 was split to provide a larger number pool in the Indiana suburbs of Chicago (<b>area</b> <b>code</b> 219).|$|R
50|$|<b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 312 is the {{telephone}} <b>area</b> <b>code</b> for downtown Chicago, {{which includes the}} Chicago Loop and its immediate environs. The plan area is completely surrounded by <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 773, which serves the rest of Chicago, along with overlay <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 872. 312 is an enclave <b>area</b> <b>code,</b> similar to <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 213 in Los Angeles, <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 514 in Montreal and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 210 in San Antonio. It is roughly bounded by North Avenue on the north, Western Avenue on the west, and 35th Street on the south, with Lake Michigan to the east.
