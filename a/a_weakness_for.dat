25|$|Green Lantern vol 3 #19 {{attempted}} to retcon Alan Scott's origin and power ring {{to accommodate the}} changes made by Crisis on Infinite Earths. In this story, Alan's ring originally belonged to a Green Lantern named Yalan Gur, who was so favored by the Guardians of the Universe that they removed the yellow impurity from his ring (which the Guardians deliberately placed in all the GL rings to limit their power and could be removed at their discretion). However, Yalan Gur abused his power and interfered with the inhabitants of ancient China. The Guardians then substituted <b>a</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>for</b> wood that allowed the local peasants to successfully attack and mortally wound Yalan with simple wooden clubs. Yalan flew into the sky and raged against the Guardians. His body burned in the atmosphere, becoming the green metallic meteorite that ultimately became Alan Scott's lantern. Yalan's spirit also possessed the metal, promising death in his rage and life when he realized his mistakes (the first two prophecies of the green metal, which were fulfilled). When Alan received the lantern, the spirit directed Alan to create the power ring and persona of Green Lantern, complete with the ring's weakness to wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} to and {{defeat of the}} agrarian law sponsored by Pompey {{was more than just}} {{opposition to}} Pompey. Nor was the law exclusively about allotting land for the settlement of Pompey's veterans. Pompey did want to allocate plots of land to his veterans. Soldiers had been expecting to be allocated land to farm after having fought in a war since Sulla had granted his soldiers land in 80 BC. Pompey wanted to fulfill this obligation. However, the law was framed {{in a way that the}} land would be distributed to the landless urban poor as well. This would help to relieve the problem of the mass of the landless unemployed or underemployed poor in Rome, which relied on the provision of a grain dole by the state to survive. It would also make Pompey popular among the plebeians. Populares politicians had been proposing this kind land reform since the introduction of the agrarian law of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC. These were always strongly opposed by the optimates. This issue had led to the murder of Tiberius Gracchus. Attempts to introduce such agrarian laws since then were defeated by the optimates. Thus, the opposition to the bill sponsored by Pompey came within this wider historical context of optimate resistance to reform as well as the optimates being suspicious of Pompey. A crucial element in the defeat of the bill sponsored by Pompey was the fact what the optimates had a strong consul in Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer who vehemently and successfully resisted its enactment, while the consul sponsored by Pompey, Lucius Afrianius was ineffective. He was of no assistance. The lack of effective consular assistance had been <b>a</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>for</b> Pompey. As already mentioned above, Plutarch wrote that the defeat of the bill forced Pompey to seek the support of plebeian tribunes, and thus of the populares. With the return of Caesar from his governorship in Hispania, Pompey found politician who would have the strength and clout to push the bill through if he became a consul.|$|E

Dinakaran praised Ganesan's performance, noting that he pulls it off with effortless ease. He however, criticised Nagesh and Manorama's comedy, finding it dry. In a review dated 12 September 1964, The Indian Express wrote about the film's central mystery, [...] "hen it is revealed after seven songs a lot of love-play and familiar kitchen comedy, it loses its suspense and does not amount to much." [...] The reviewer praised the performances of Ganesan and the supporting cast but criticised the comic subplot featuring Nagesh, the dialogue, lyrics, songs and make-up, and concluded, [...] "The photographer and the art director seem to have <b>a</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>for</b> the colour red, but otherwise have done a good job." ...|$|E
500|$|Developed by the Monotype {{drawing office}} team in Salfords, Surrey, led by Fritz Steltzer, the project veered {{away from a}} purely {{faithful}} revival towards a denser, more condensed design. This differentiated it from the other Janson revivals on the market. Nicholas commented [...] "I think it was Morison's take on Janson - made a little heavier and narrower to give improved legibility and economy." [...] Typesetting expert Yannis Haralambous wrote of being told by a Monotype manager that the typeface was designed particularly for sale in Germany [...] "to appeal {{to those who have}} <b>a</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>for</b> Fraktur" [...] (blackletter or 'Gothic' typefaces, still very popular in Germany in the 1930s). In its dense design it may be able to compliment blackletter well, and Morison in his article on Leipzig printing suggested that this might have been a motivation behind the original's design style. Ehrhardt's technical production followed Monotype's standard method of the period. The characters were drawn on paper in large plan diagrams by the highly experienced drawing office team, led and trained by Steltzer, who Monotype had recruited from the German printing industry. The drawing staff who executed the design was disproportionately female and in many cases recruited from the local area and the nearby Reigate art school. A wax-copy was made from these drawing, the wax-copy was used to produce a lead plate with the design. These plates were then used as a plan for machining metal punches to stamp matrices in the Benton-pantographs. It was Monotype's standard practice at the time to first engrave a limited number of characters and print proofs from them to test overall balance of colour on the page, before completing the remaining characters.|$|E
500|$|Other aspects {{grew out}} of basic {{concepts}} or ideas. For the episode [...] "Skin", writer Shiban felt that the shapeshifting villain had to change {{into one of the}} lead characters. The character chosen was Dean, and the writers decided not to clear his name of attempted murder {{at the end of the}} episode. Though they at first feared that having one of the main characters be a wanted man would later ruin the show, the writers eventually felt it was [...] "a great layer to add", opening up new potential storylines and characters. Dean's reputation is addressed again in [...] "The Benders", and catches up to him in the second and third seasons. Another element that would influence future episodes came about in [...] "Hook Man" [...] when writers Milbauer and Burton realized that shotguns shoot salt, <b>a</b> <b>weakness</b> <b>for</b> spirits. Kripke deemed it the [...] "perfect combination of occult element", as it brought together a [...] "folkloric repellent of evil" [...] with the [...] "blue-collar aspect of shotguns". The episode [...] "Asylum" [...] later established iron as another weapon against ghosts. [...] "Faith", on the other hand, stemmed from the question of whether it truly was wrong to heal good people of their illnesses at the cost of the lives of strangers. Kripke noted, [...] " [...] really a great girl and she deserves to live, and some stranger you don't even know will die... and maybe that's worth it." [...] Reapers were not in the original script of the episode, but were added later to give the writers a chance to create [...] "scary" [...] sequences and to explain the faith healer's ability. Because the writers found the traditional look of the Reaper—hooded and carrying a sickle—to be cheesy, they ultimately made him appear as [...] "the most shriveled old man you could ever imagine".|$|E
5000|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{described}} The Frisco Kid as [...] "harmless chaos": [...] "People {{keep coming}} and going and doing ferociously cute things, but never anything that could appeal to anyone except a close relative or someone with <b>a</b> built-in <b>weakness</b> <b>for</b> anything ethnic whatsoever."
