In Washington, {{she has a}} counseling session with a social worker, during which she shares her <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> investigation. After the session, Scully learns that someone from Minnesota had called for her. When she contacts Mulder, she learns that neither he nor Bocks made the call. Tracing a fingerprint to Pfaster from his arrest, Bocks and Mulder raid his apartment, finding one of the prostitute's fingers in his refrigerator. Meanwhile, after Scully arrives in Minneapolis, Pfaster forces her car off the road. He kidnaps Scully and takes her to his late mother's abandoned house. He ties and gags Scully, and keeps her in a dark closet.|$|E

One unmarked car with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale, and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street. At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home.

Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director, James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by another call and asked Forbes to call back in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes drove to the home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.|$|E

The U.S. Justice Department's General Intelligence Division, headed by J.

While they were in prison, Hoover wrote: [...] "Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman are, beyond doubt, two of the most dangerous anarchists in this country and if permitted to return to the community will result in undue harm." [...] Under the 1918 Anarchist Exclusion Act, the government deported Berkman, who had never applied for U.S. citizenship, along with Goldman and more than two hundred others, to Russia aboard the Buford.|$|E
500|$|The Age of Plastic is {{the debut}} studio album by the British new wave duo The Buggles, {{composed}} of Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes. The {{name of the}} record was conceived from the group's intention of being a [...] "plastic group".

The titular song, [...] "Living in the Plastic Age", views the experiences of watching {{media coverage of the}} Vietnam War, while [...] "Kid Dynamo" [...] follows a child overexposed to media and its resulting effects on him. Described by writers as the first technopop landmark, the record is an electropop new wave album that includes musical elements and influences of disco, punk, progressive rock and 1960s pop music. In a 1979 interview, Downes defined the album as [...] "science fiction music. It's like modern psychedelic music. It's very futuristic." ...|$|E
50|$|The poetic {{versions}} {{have been}} cited {{as an example of}} orientalism with the suggestion that it screens <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cultural identity of the English people. Kathryn Powell claims that {{at the time it was}} preserved in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, England was beset by <b>anxieties</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> acquisition and dissemination of knowledge, the stability of the kingdom and the efficacy of religious faith. She argues that by displacing ignorance, political instability and lack of faith onto the Eastern and pagan Chaldean people as represented by Saturn, English people were encouraged to identify with ideals and behaviours of the Christianised figure of Solomon. This is cited as an example of bolstering English Christian culture through degrading the east.|$|R

500|$|The Age of Plastic is a tragicomic concept {{album with}} lyrical themes of intense nostalgia and <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{possible}} effects of modern technology. The lyrics, which {{were written by}} Trevor Horn, were inspired by the works of J.G. Ballard. The Buggles claimed they were necessarily a [...] "plastic group" [...] {{to meet the needs}} of a plastic age, which was why their debut album was called The Age of Plastic. Downes said that the lyrics were [...] "trying to make cynical comments on a number of issues." [...] Eight tracks are included on The Age of Plastic: [...] "Living in the Plastic Age", [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star", [...] "Kid Dynamo", [...] "I Love You (Miss Robot)", [...] "Clean, Clean", [...] "Elstree", [...] "Astroboy (And the Proles on Parade)", and [...] "Johnny (on the Monorail)".

The three were reported missing in November. Lee Bo (sometimes, Paul Lee, also, Lee Po) had been informing the media of the disappearances of his other four colleagues when he himself vanished from Hong Kong on 30 December. Lee's disappearance, due to the improbability that Lee had gone to Shenzhen while his mainland travel permit was left at home, crystallised a great deal of <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pattern of bookshop disappearances and of the possibility of cross-border renditions.

500|$|By {{the time}} that Haggard began writing She, society had more <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> role of women. Debates {{regarding}} [...] "The Woman Question" [...] dominated Britain during the fin de siècle, as well as anxieties over the increasing position and independence of the [...] "New Woman". Alarm over social degeneration and societal decadence further fanned concerns over the woman's movement and female liberalisation, which challenged the traditional conception of Victorian womanhood. The role and rights of women had changed dramatically since {{the early part of}} the century, as they entered the workforce, received better education, and gained more political and legal independence. Writing in 1894, Haggard believed that marriage was the natural state for women: [...] "Notwithstanding the energetic repudiations of the fact that confront us at every turn, it may be taken for granted that in most cases it is the natural mission of women to marry; that – always in most cases – if they do not marry they become narrowed, live a half life only, and suffer in health of body and of mind." [...] He created the character of She-who-must-be-obeyed [...] "who provided a touchstone for many of the anxieties surrounding the New Woman in late-Victorian England".|$|E
500|$|Larkin's {{role in the}} {{creation}} of Hull University's new Brynmor Jones Library had been important and demanding. Soon after the completion of the second and larger phase of construction in 1969, he was able to redirect his energies. In October 1970 he started work on compiling a new anthology, The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse (1973). He was awarded a Visiting Fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, for two academic terms, allowing him to consult Oxford's Bodleian Library, a copyright library. While he was in Oxford he passed responsibility for the Library to his deputy, Brenda Moon. Larkin was a major contributor to the re-evaluation of the poetry of Thomas Hardy, which, in comparison to his novels, had been overlooked; in Larkin's [...] "idiosyncratic" [...] and [...] "controversial" [...] anthology, Hardy was the poet most generously represented. There were twenty-seven poems by Hardy, compared with only nine by T. S. Eliot (however, Eliot is most famous for long poems); the other poets most extensively represented were W. B. Yeats, W. H. Auden and Rudyard Kipling. Larkin included six of his own poems—the same number as for Rupert Brooke. In the process of compiling the volume he had been disappointed not to find more and better poems as evidence that the clamour over the Modernists had stifled the voices of traditionalists. The most favourable responses to the anthology were those of Auden and John Betjeman, while the most hostile was that of Donald Davie, who accused Larkin of [...] "positive cynicism" [...] and of encouraging [...] "the perverse triumph of philistinism, the cult of the amateur ... the weakest kind of Englishry". After an initial period of <b>anxiety</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> anthology's reception, Larkin enjoyed the clamour.|$|E
