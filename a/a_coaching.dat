40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine {{differences}} in motivational regulations and achievement goal orientations between Masters athletes who {{do and do}} not have <b>a</b> <b>coach.</b> Elite Masters athletes (N = 71) were surveyed at the Canadian and USA Masters Track and Field Championships. The Sport Motivation Scale (Pelletier et al., 1995) and Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (Duda 2 ̆ 6 Nicholls, 1992) assessed motivational regulations and achievement goals, respectively. For motivational regulations, multiple analyses of variance revealed that there was {{a significant main effect for}} having <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> (p 3 ̆c. 01) and for gender (p 3 ̆c. 05), as well as a significant interaction for having <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> by gender (p 3 ̆c. 01). Specifically, females who had <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> reported the highest levels of intrinsic motivation to accomplish and intrinsic motivation to know. Further, females who did not have <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> reported highest levels of amotivation for sport. For goal orientations, multiple analyses of variance also revealed a significant main effect for having <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> (p 3 ̆c. 05). Specifically, Masters athletes who did not train with <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> reported higher ego orientation than those who had <b>a</b> <b>coach.</b> Findings from this study suggest the existence of a positive relationship between training with <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> and having self-determined motives among Masters athletes, especially for females, as well as on placing less importance on normative comparisons of performance...|$|R
