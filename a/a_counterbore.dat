25|$|The cranks are {{pressed into}} place and {{prevented}} from squirming off via fretting by a bolt or nut installed into or onto the bottom bracket spindle.

25|$|A {{countersink}} is a conical hole {{cut into}} a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use {{is to allow}} {{the head of a}} bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or {{below the surface of the}} surrounding material. (By comparison, <b>a</b> <b>counterbore</b> makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.|$|E
25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form <b>a</b> <b>counterbore,</b> or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|E
50|$|In a {{preliminary}} investigation {{report of the}} engine failure of Qantas Flight QF32, released 3 December 2010, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau outlined safety actions taken already, including the issuing of a safety recommendation about potential engine problems with the Trent 900. The safety recommendation relates to a possible manufacturing issue with <b>a</b> misaligned <b>counterbore</b> in some pressured oil pipes, {{which could lead to}} fatigue cracking, oil leakage, oil fire, and engine failure.|$|R
25|$|In solid timber work it {{is common}} to <b>counterbore</b> <b>a</b> hole in the frame or carcase member to conceal the head of the screw. This also allows more of the body of the screw to {{penetrate}} the adjacent member for greater traction. After the screw has been driven into the joint, the counterbore can be filled with an appropriately sized piece of dowel or a wooden plug cut from an offcut of the same timber using a plug cutter.|$|R
5000|$|A {{spotface}} or {{spot face}} is a machined feature in which a certain region of the workpiece (a spot) is faced, providing a smooth, flat, accurately located surface. This is especially relevant on workpieces cast or forged, where the spotface's smooth, flat, accurately located surface stands in distinction to the surrounding surface whose roughness, flatness, and location are subject to wider tolerances and thus not assured with a machining level of precision. The most common application of spotfacing (spot facing) is facing the area around a bolt hole where the bolt's head will sit, which is often done by cutting <b>a</b> shallow <b>counterbore,</b> just deep enough [...] "to clean up"—that is, only enough material is removed to get down past any irregularity and thus make the surface flat. Other common applications of spotfacing involve facing a pad onto a boss, creating planar surfaces in known locations that can orient a casting or forging into position in the assembly; allow part marking such as stamping or nameplate riveting; or offer machine-finish visual appeal in spots, {{without the need for}} finishing all over (FAO).|$|R
500|$|Bushings are {{the major}} expense in fiber glass production. [...] The nozzle design is also critical. [...] The number of nozzles ranges from 200 to 4000 in {{multiples}} of 200.

[...] It was found that inserting <b>a</b> <b>counterbore</b> here reduced wetting. [...] Today, the nozzles are designed to have a minimum thickness at the exit. [...] As glass flows through the nozzle, it forms a drop which is suspended from the end. [...] As it falls, it leaves a thread attached by the meniscus to the nozzle as long as the viscosity is in the correct range for fiber formation. [...] The smaller the annular ring of the nozzle and the thinner the wall at exit, the faster the drop will form and fall away, and the lower its tendency to wet the vertical part of the nozzle. [...] The surface tension of the glass is what influences the formation of the meniscus. [...] For E-glass it should be around 400mN/m.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>counterbore</b> (symbol: ⌴) is a {{cylindrical}} flat-bottomed {{hole that}} enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool {{used to create}} that feature. <b>A</b> <b>counterbore</b> hole is typically used when a fastener, such as a socket head cap screw, is required to sit flush with or {{below the level of}} a workpiece's surface.|$|E

50|$|For a spotface, {{material}} {{is removed from}} a surface to make it flat and smooth, usually for a fastener or a bearing. Spotfacing is usually required on workpieces that are forged or cast.

40|$|Summary: The WasherLoc is a tibial {{fixation}} device for soft tissue {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) reconstruction that combines superior fixation properties (945 N strength, 507 N/mm stiffness, and high resistance to slippage) with a simple surgical technique. The WasherLoc is a washer with 13 short spikes that penetrate the soft tissue ACL graft in multiple locations and 4 long peripheral spikes that contain the graft beneath the washer. A cancellous screw is used to compress the WasherLoc against the soft tissue ACL graft and posterolateral wall of the tibial tunnel. The WasherLoc does not cause hardware symptoms because it is recessed in <b>a</b> <b>counterbore</b> drilled at the distal end of the tibial tunnel. A bone dowel harvested from the tibial tunnel {{is used as a}} joint-line {{fixation device}} in a series with the WasherLoc to improve fixation stiffness (58 N/mm) and increase the fit, which is known to enhance tendon graft-to-bone healing in the tibia. The bone dowel, which is driven {{to the level of the}} joint line anterior to the WasherLoc and soft tissue graft, prevents tunnel enlargement. Key Words: WasherLoc—Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction—Tibial fixation device—Soft tissue graft—Superior fixation properties—Reliable surgical technique...|$|E
