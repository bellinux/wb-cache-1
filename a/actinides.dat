5|$|Like the lanthanides, all <b>actinides</b> {{are highly}} {{reactive}} with halogens and chalcogens; however, the <b>actinides</b> react more easily. <b>Actinides,</b> {{especially those with}} {{a small number of}} 5f-electrons, are prone to hybridization. This is explained by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5f, 7s and 6d shells. Most <b>actinides</b> exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other <b>actinides.</b>|$|E
5|$|Actinide salts {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids. Nitrates, chlorides, sulfates and perchlorates of <b>actinides</b> are water-soluble. When crystallizing from aqueous solutions, these salts forming a hydrates, such as Th(NO3)4·6H2O, Th(SO4)2·9H2O and Pu2(SO4)3·7H2O. Salts of high-valence <b>actinides</b> easily hydrolyze. So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas Th(OH)2SO4 and Th(OH)3NO3. The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent <b>actinides</b> is like that of lanthanide salts. So phosphates, fluorides, oxalates, iodates and carbonates of <b>actinides</b> are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as hydrates, such as ThF4·3H2O and Th(CrO4)2·3H2O.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actinides</b> with {{oxidation}} state +6, {{except for the}} AnO22+-type cations, form 2−, 2− and other complex anions. For example, uranium, neptunium and plutonium form salts of the Na2UO4 (uranate) and (NH4)2U2O7 (diuranate) types. In comparison with lanthanides, <b>actinides</b> more easily form coordination compounds, and this ability increases with the actinide valence. Trivalent <b>actinides</b> do not form fluoride coordination compounds, whereas tetravalent thorium forms K2ThF6, KThF5, and even K5ThF9 complexes. Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates (for example Na2SO4·Th (SO4)2·5H2O), nitrates and thiocyanates. Salts with the general formula An2Th(NO3)6·nH2O are of coordination nature, with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12. Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent <b>actinides.</b> The most stable coordination compounds of <b>actinides</b> – tetravalent thorium and uranium – are obtained in reactions with diketones, e.g. acetylacetone.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{fundamental}} research on <b>actinide</b> materials {{has been carried}} out in order to {{contribute to the development of}} future nuclear fuel cycle and <b>actinide</b> science database. Among <b>actinide</b> materials, the R&D has been focused on Pu and minor <b>actinide</b> (MA; Np, Am, Cm) bearing compounds. The chemical forms of <b>actinide</b> compounds concerned include oxides, nitrides, chlorides and alloys, which are prepared, characterized and subjected to property measurements. In this paper those results on Pu and MA bearing oxides obtained in recent several years are summarized. In addition, the possible challenges of <b>actinide</b> materials research to the subjects of post severe accident of Fukushima-daiich nuclear power station are briefly discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The actinide-cyclooctatetraenyl bonding {{was shown}} by {{computational}} chemistry to be mainly due to mixing of <b>actinide</b> 6d orbitals into ligand π-orbitals and therefore donation of electronic charge to the <b>actinide,</b> {{with a smaller}} such interaction involving the <b>actinide</b> 5f orbitals.|$|R
5|$|Like the lanthanides, the <b>actinides</b> form {{a family}} of {{elements}} with similar properties. Within the <b>actinides,</b> there are two overlapping groups: transuranium elements, which follow uranium in the periodic table—and transplutonium elements, which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for promethium) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most <b>actinides</b> are rare. The majority {{of them do not}} even occur in nature, and of those that do, only thorium and uranium do so in more than trace quantities. The most abundant, or easily synthesized <b>actinides</b> are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and curium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actinides</b> {{have similar}} {{properties}} to lanthanides. The 6d and 7s electronic shells are filled in actinium and thorium, and the 5f shell is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4f shell is {{filled in the}} lanthanides. The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5f shell in <b>actinides</b> was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940. As in lanthanides (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of <b>actinides</b> monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).|$|E
5|$|All <b>actinides</b> are pyrophoric, {{especially}} when finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The melting point of <b>actinides</b> {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E
40|$|Using {{a variety}} of {{different}} techniques, this program attempts to provide relevant fundamental data that will reduce the number of surprises (related to <b>actinide</b> behavior) that occur during sludge washing and tank waste processing. This work builds upon the results of earlier fundamental studies of <b>actinide</b> chemistry in concentrated alkali (many conducted in Russia), on the analysis of tank wastes, and on earlier sludge-specific leaching experiments to gain an improved understanding of the relationship between sludge characteristics and <b>actinide</b> dissolution during proposed sludge washing procedures. A successful outcome for this research will be the generation of sufficient supporting information (both fundamental and empirical) that will enable more accurate prediction of the probability of <b>actinide</b> dissolution during the scrubbing of sludges from PUREX, REDOX, and BiPO 4 processes. We are studying the mobilization of tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexavalent <b>actinide</b> cations from sludge simulants; trying to identify mineral phases that might control <b>actinide</b> solubility in sludge simulants; learning about associations between <b>actinide</b> cations and non-radioactive sludge components; investigating the solution-phase chemistry of <b>actinide</b> cations in concentrated alkali; and evaluating the contribution of colloid transport to <b>actinide</b> mobility in sludge washes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop polymeric extractants for the selective complexation of uranyl ions (and subsequently other actinyl and <b>actinide</b> ions) from aqueous solutions (lakes, streams, waste tanks and body fluids). Selectivity for a specific <b>actinide</b> ion is obtained by providing polymers with cavities lined with complexing ligands so arranged as to match the charge, coordination number, coordination geometry, and size of the <b>actinide</b> metal ion. These cavity-containing polymers will be produced using a specific <b>actinide</b> ion (or surrogate) as a template around which monomeric complexing ligands will be polymerized. The polymers will provide useful sequestering agents for removing <b>actinide</b> ions from wastes and will form the basis for a variety of analytical techniques for <b>actinide</b> determinations. ...|$|R

This chapter introduces {{the basic principles of}} <b>actinide</b> catalysis and deals with the historic development of <b>actinide</b> complexes in catalytic processes. The application of organoactinides in homogeneous catalysis is exemplified in the hydroelementation reactions, such as the hydroamination, hydrosilylation, hydroalkoxylation and hydrothiolation of alkynes. Additionally, the use of <b>actinide</b> coordination complexes for the catalytic polymerization of α-olefins and the ring opening polymerization of cyclic esters is presented.

5|$|All <b>actinides</b> are {{radioactive}} {{and release}} energy upon radioactive decay; naturally occurring uranium and thorium, and synthetically produced plutonium {{are the most}} abundant <b>actinides</b> on Earth. These are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Uranium and thorium also have diverse current or historical uses, and americium {{is used in the}} ionization chambers of most modern smoke detectors.|$|E
5|$|Using <b>actinides</b> {{in nuclear}} fuel, sealed {{radioactive}} sources or advanced {{materials such as}} self-glowing crystals has many potential benefits. However, a serious concern is the extremely high radiotoxicity of <b>actinides</b> and their migration in the environment. Use of chemically unstable forms of <b>actinides</b> in MOX and sealed radioactive sources is not appropriate by modern safety standards. There {{is a challenge to}} develop stable and durable actinide-bearing materials, which provide safe storage, use and final disposal. A key need is application of actinide solid solutions in durable crystalline host phases.|$|E
5|$|While <b>actinides</b> {{have some}} {{established}} daily-life applications, {{such as in}} smoke detectors (americium) and gas mantles (thorium), they are mostly used in nuclear weapons and use as a fuel in nuclear reactors. The last two areas exploit the property of <b>actinides</b> to release enormous energy in nuclear reactions, which under certain conditions may become self-sustaining chain reaction.|$|E

Accordingly, they are of great interest, but are difficult to work with.

50|$|<b>Actinide</b> {{isolation}} by co-precipitation {{is frequently}} used for samples of relatively large volumes to concentrate analytes and remove interferences. <b>Actinide</b> carriers include iron hydroxides, lanthanide fluorides/hydroxides, manganese dioxide, {{and a few}} other species.|$|R
5|$|A few authors {{position}} all thirty lanthanides and <b>actinides</b> {{in the two}} positions below yttrium (usually via footnote markers).|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent <b>actinides</b> is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier <b>actinides</b> elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of all {{elements}} {{is based on}} properties of earlier <b>actinides,</b> which show a much wider variety of chemistry (for instance, in range of oxidation states) within their series than the lanthanides, and comparisons to scandium and yttrium are even less useful. However, these elements are destabilized, {{and if they were}} stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws, they would be similar to lanthanides as well. Also, the later <b>actinides</b> from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides, with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.|$|E
40|$|In K-edge {{densitometry}} (KED), a continuous-energy {{x-ray beam}} is transmitted through a liquid sample. The <b>actinide</b> {{content of the}} sample can be measured through analysis of the transmitted portion of the x-ray beam. Traditional methods for KED analysis allow the simultaneous calculation of, at most, two <b>actinide</b> concentrations. A generalized multi-edge KED analytical method is presented, allowing up to six <b>actinide</b> concentrations to be calculated simultaneously. Applications of this method for hybrid KED/x-ray fluorescence (HKED) systems are discussed. Current HKED systems require the operator to know the approximate <b>actinide</b> content of each sample, and manually select the proper analysis mode. The new multi-edge KED technique allows rapid identification of the major <b>actinide</b> components in a sample, independent of <b>actinide</b> content. The proper HKED analysis mode can be selected automatically, without requiring sample content information from the user. Automatic HKED analysis would be especially useful in an analytical laboratory setting, where samples with truly unknown characteristics are encountered. Because this technique requires no hardware modifications, several facilities that use HKED may eventually benefit from this approach...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} programme is to study the complexation behaviour of <b>actinide</b> ions with humic substances in natural aquifer systems and hence to quantify the effect of humic substances on the <b>actinide</b> migration. Aquatic humic substances commonly found in all groundwaters in different concentrations have a strong tendency towards complexation with <b>actinide</b> ions. This {{is one of the}} major geochemical reactions but hitherto least quantified. Therefore, the effect of humic substances on the <b>actinide</b> migration is poorly understood. In the present research programme the complexation of <b>actinide</b> ions with humic substances will be described thermodynamically. This description will be based on a model being as simple as possible to allow an easy introduction of the resulting constants into geochemical modelling of the <b>actinide</b> migration.

5|$|Like all <b>actinides,</b> {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other <b>actinides,</b> including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The {{actinide}} series derives {{its name from}} the first element in the series, actinium. The informal chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide. All but one of the <b>actinides</b> are f-block elements, with the exception being either actinium or lawrencium. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f electron shell, although actinium and thorium lack any f-electrons, and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the preceding element. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the <b>actinides</b> show much more variable valence. They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While actinium and the late <b>actinides</b> (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element of}} the <b>actinides,</b> {{actinium}} gave the group its name, much as lanthanum had done for the lanthanides.

5|$|The oxides and {{hydroxides}} of neptunium {{are closely}} related to its ions. In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the <b>actinides</b> before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion increases as the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus <b>actinides</b> higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E

All <b>actinides</b> form AnH3 hydrides of black color with salt-like properties. <b>Actinides</b> also produce carbides with the general formula of AnC or AnC2 (U2C3 for uranium) as well as sulfides An2S3 and AnS2.|$|E
5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of <b>actinides</b> is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} the procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other <b>actinides</b> (but contains cerium).

This spectral region revolutionised the approach to surface materials chemistry and physics nearly two decades ago. The <b>actinide</b> science community was unable to capitalise on these SR methodologies {{for the study of}} <b>actinide</b> materials until recently because of radiological safety concerns. The Advanced Light Source (ALS) at LBNL is a third-generation light source providing state-of-the-art performance in the VUV/soft X-ray region. Along with corresponding improvements in detector and vacuum technology, the ALS has rendered experiments with small amounts of <b>actinide</b> materials possible.

In contrast, the 5 f orbitals of plutonium appear localized and surprisingly insensitive to different bonding environments. We envisage that this report of using relative energy differences between the 5 fd/f and 5 fp*/ 5 fs* orbitals as a qualitative measure of overlap-driven actinyl bond covalency will spark activity, and extend to numerous applications of RIXS and HR-XANES to gain new insights into the electronic structures of the <b>actinide</b> elements...|$|R
