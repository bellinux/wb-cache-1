Participants {{of the study were}} 120 teachers from various districts and six different disciplines but 104 of them were evaluated. Qualitative research method was used. Five open-ended questions which were prepared from researchers were administrated to inservice teachers. Data gathered from open-ended questions <b>and</b> teachers <b>project</b> reports were analyzed to find out teachers’ knowledgeabout <b>project</b> <b>and</b> <b>project</b> based learning.

5|$|On 9June 2004, the {{day after}} the first of a 21st-century pair of Venus transits {{occurred}} as predicted by Horrocks, a commemorative street nameplate in memory of William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove, which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft. In December 2005, a commemorative plaque was unveiled a few yards away near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road, which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family {{at the time he was}} collaborating with Horrocks. The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6June 2012, and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website.

40|$|Purpose–To empirically {{demonstrate}} {{the nature of}} current project manager assignment practices {{and their impact on}} important performance variables, in the context of Botswana’s multi-project settings. Approach - the research design is composed of country and company layers. This paper reports on Fieldwork 1 of 3 stages, which involved questionnaires and interviews of 53 <b>project</b> managers <b>and</b> 20 <b>project</b> heads from 12 companies in the public and private sector. Findings–the results indicate compelling evidence to conclude that the current practices are informal, not objective, not comprehensive and lack a good match between <b>project</b> managers <b>and</b> <b>projects.</b> Significant correlations were found between the following variables (1) extent of formality <b>and</b> <b>project</b> manager rewards, (2) extent of objectivity <b>and</b> <b>project</b> manager performance, (3) extent of comprehensiveness <b>and</b> <b>project</b> success, (4) Correspondence level between <b>project</b> manager <b>and</b> <b>project</b> <b>and</b> the performance variables - project manager rewards, <b>project</b> manager performance <b>and</b> <b>project</b> success. Contributions - (1) empirical justification for problem existence that gives an indication of the state of practice in Botswana – currently unknown, (2) Data from a “new” country, industries <b>and</b> <b>project</b> types compared to existing empirical studies on this topic, (3) development of a conceptual model that adds to the theory behind matching project managers to projects in a multi-project setting...|$|R

5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume <b>and</b> <b>projected</b> the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E
