5|$|NorthLink WA is {{a project}} that will see both the {{northern}} section of Tonkin Highway upgraded, and the road extended northwards to bypass Great Northern Highway within Perth. These two component projects are separately funded, with both the state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> contributing to each project. Construction began in 2016, and {{is scheduled to be}} completed by 2019.|$|E

5|$|Between 2014 and 2016, the $1billion Gateway WA Perth Airport and Freight Access Project was {{undertaken}} {{to upgrade the}} road network around Perth Airport. At {{the time it was}} the largest project Main Roads Western Australia has ever undertaken, covering the upgrade of Tonkin and Leach highways, and the construction of four new interchanges. The project was jointly funded by state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments,</b> which are providing $317.5million and $686.4million respectively.|$|E
5|$|With Queensland's {{resources}} already strained by {{an ongoing}} severe drought, the Commonwealth Government of Australia agreed to evenly split {{the cost of}} restoring government assets damaged by Ada; this expenditure would normally fall to the state alone. By August 1970, the state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> had issued a combined $708,000 in grants for repairing flood damage in Bowen. The name Ada was later retired from the Australian tropical cyclone naming list due to the cyclone's severe impact.|$|E
5|$|Work resumed on Highway416 North {{following}} the review. It was opened from Century Road to Hunt Club Road on July16, 1996, and completed on July31, 1997, {{with the opening}} of the interchange with Highway 417. The cost of this section was C$196 million. On December8, 1995, in North Gower, the provincial <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> announced a financing deal to ensure Highway416 South was completed by 2000.|$|E

5|$|Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin {{had ordered}} all {{settlers}} to stay {{to the east}} of the Divide, as the state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> had not made peace with the Utes. Nevertheless, some defied the order, drawn by the prospect of mining fortunes. Settlers sometimes used Hunter Pass to get to Ashcroft, an early camp on Castle Creek above the Roaring Fork. However, they preferred to take the southern route over the slightly higher Cottonwood Pass through Taylor Park and then back over Taylor Pass to get there, even though this made for a 100-mile (160km) journey, 40 miles (64km) more than the direct route offered by Hunter Pass.|$|E
5|$|Netball gained Olympic {{recognition}} in 1995 after 20 years of lobbying. Although {{it has never}} been played at the Summer Olympics, politicians and administrators have been campaigning to have it included in the near future. Its absence from the Olympics has been seen by the netball community as a hindrance in the global growth of the game by limiting access to media attention and funding sources. Some funding sources became available with {{recognition in}} 1995, including the International Olympic Committee, national Olympic committees, national sport organisations, and state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of {{construction}} is being undertaken {{as part of the}} NorthLink WA project. Tonkin Highway's northern section will be grade separated, and a dual carriageway will be constructed from the Northern end of Tonkin Highway near Reid Highway, past Ellenbrook and through the Swan Valley to an interchange with Great Northern Highway and a new part of Brand Highway, with the extension continuing on as Great Northern Highway. The previously planned route of the bypass, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park. The project is funded by both the state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments.</b> Construction began in June 2017, and is scheduled to finish mid 2019.|$|E

5|$|United States v. Lanza {{was one of}} {{a series}} of cases {{involving}} Prohibition. Lanza committed acts allegedly in violation of both state and federal law, and was first convicted in Washington state court, then prosecuted in federal district court. He alleged the second prosecution in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Taft, for a unanimous court, allowed the second prosecution, holding that the state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> were dual sovereigns, each empowered to prosecute the conduct in question.|$|E
5|$|Many {{overlapping}} entities including city, county, state, <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> share jurisdiction {{for parts}} of the watershed. About 60percent of the basin is publicly owned and is managed by the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), assisted by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and other agencies in both states, is charged with controlling water pollution in the basin. United States National Forests and other forests cover about 83percent of the basin; another 6percent is grassland, 3percent shrub, and only 0.2percent wetland. Urban areas account for slightly less than 1percent and farms for about 6percent.|$|E
5|$|Netball is an Olympic {{recognised}} sport, {{a status}} attained in 1995 after a twenty-year period of lobbying. It {{has never been}} played at the Summer Olympics, but with recognition a formal requirement for inclusion is met. The absence at the Olympic Games was seen by the netball community as a hindrance to the global growth of the game, depriving it of media attention and funding. Inclusion is hampered, because it is mainly played by women, and mostly in Commonwealth countries. When the sport gained recognition, it opened up sources of funds that the global netball community {{had not been able}} to access before, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC), national Olympic committees and sports organisations, and state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} Grand Forks is not {{dominated}} by any one industry or sector. While agriculture {{continues to play}} a role in the area's economy, the city of Grand Forks now has a relatively diverse economy that includes public and private employers in sectors such as education, defense, health care, manufacturing, and food processing. The state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> are two of the largest employers in the Grand Forks area. The University of North Dakota, in the heart of the city, is the largest employer in the metropolitan area. Grand Forks Air Force Base, just west of the city, employs a large number of civilian workers in addition to its military personnel. Altru Health System is the largest private employer in Grand Forks.|$|E
5|$|The state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> {{also had}} {{conflicts}} {{on the economic}} front. UMNO leaders feared that the economic dominance of Singapore would inevitably shift political power away from Kuala Lumpur. Despite earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading {{with the rest of}} Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore refused to provide Sabah and Sarawak {{the full extent of the}} loans previously agreed to for the economic development of the two eastern states. The Bank of China branch of Singapore was closed by the Central Government in Kuala Lumpur as it was suspected of funding communists. The situation escalated to such an extent that talks between UMNO and the PAP broke down, and abusive speeches and writings became rife on both sides. UMNO extremists called for the arrest of Lee Kuan Yew.|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared for the Townsville area, making an initial $7,000 in emergency aid available for distribution among 84 individuals left homeless. Immediately after the storm, the Salvation Army began collecting and distributing donated clothing, while providing hot meals to hundreds of destitute storm victims. Australian Prime Minister William McMahon soon traveled to Townsville to assess the damage and authorise the distribution of emergency grants for affected residents. At the end of December, officials announced that the state <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> would jointly issue individual rebuilding grants, ranging from $1,000 to as high as $4,000 for pensioners; for the latter, higher allocations to cover {{the full cost of}} rebuilding homes were soon considered. The Townsville City Council received a special $25,000 grant with the goal of repairing schools {{for the start of the}} new academic year. By 27 December, $150,000 in private donations had arrived as organisations and radio stations throughout Queensland sought assistance for the disaster area. Western Australia provided $72,000 of relief funding, while Tasmania contributed $2,000. The Australian federal government reimbursed Queensland for an estimated $5.5–6 million spent by the state on recovery.|$|E
