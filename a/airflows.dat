25|$|The modern {{cleanroom}} {{was invented}} by American physicist Willis Whitfield. As employee of the Sandia National Laboratories, Whitfield created the initial plans for the cleanroom in 1960. Prior to Whitfield's invention, earlier cleanrooms often had problems with particles and unpredictable <b>airflows.</b> Whitfield designed his cleanroom with a constant, highly filtered air flow to flush out impurities.

25|$|This initial {{version of}} the CF6 has a {{single-stage}} fan with one core booster stage, driven by a 5-stage LP (low pressure) turbine, turbocharging a 16-stage HP (high pressure) axial compressor driven by a 2-stage HP turbine; the combustor is annular; separate exhaust nozzles are used for the fan and core <b>airflows.</b> The 86.4-in (2.19-m) diameter fan generates an airflow of 1,300lb/s (590kg/s), resulting in a relatively high bypass ratio of 5.72. The overall pressure ratio of the compression system is 24.3. At maximum take-off power, the engine develops a static thrust of 41,500lb (185.05kN).|$|E
25|$|The {{climate is}} classed as subpolar oceanic climate {{according}} to the Köppen climate classification: Cfc, with areas having a tundra climate, especially in the mountains, although some coastal or low-lying areas can have very mild-winter versions of a tundra climate. The overall character of the islands' climate {{is influenced by the}} strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the North Atlantic Current. This, together with the remoteness of any source of warm <b>airflows,</b> ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0nbsp&°C or 37 to 39nbsp&°F) while summers are cool (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5nbsp&°C or 49 to 51nbsp&°F).|$|E

40|$|Patients with fixed <b>airflow</b> {{limitation}} {{are often}} classified as {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), and some international guidelines recommend classifying asthma with fixed <b>airflow</b> limitation as COPD. Indeed, both COPD (induced by smoking or other noxious agents) and asthma {{may be associated}} with a decline of lung function that should cause fixed <b>airflow</b> limitation. In the presence of fixed <b>airflow</b> limitation, patients are often diagnosed COPD, even if the differential diagnosis between asthma and COPD in these patients may be important as the natural history as well as the response to treatment are different, depending on whether fixed <b>airflow</b> limitation is due to asthma or COPD. The assessment of patients presenting with fixed <b>airflow</b> limitation has recently hightlighted that airway inflammation is markedly different in asthma and COPD although characterized by the same degree of <b>airflow</b> limitation. Thus, asthma with fixed <b>airflow</b> limitation maintain the same pathological characteristics as asthma with completely reversible <b>airflow</b> limitation. In conclusion, subjects with asthma have distinct characteristics compared with subjects with COPD. Despite the presence of fixed <b>airflow</b> limitation both patients should be properly identified and treated...|$|R

25|$|The {{wind tunnel}} used by German {{scientists}} at Peenemünde {{prior to and}} during WWII is an interesting example of the difficulties associated with extending the useful range of large wind tunnels. It used some large natural caves which were increased in size by excavation and then sealed to store large volumes of air which could then be routed through the wind tunnels. This innovative approach allowed lab research in high-speed regimes and greatly accelerated the rate of advance of Germany's aeronautical engineering efforts. By {{the end of the}} war, Germany had at least three different supersonic wind tunnels, with one capable of Mach 4.4 (heated) <b>airflows.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Airflows</b> {{can be used}} to run {{wind turbines}}. Modern {{utility-scale}} wind turbines range from around 600kW to 5 MW of rated power, although turbines with rated output of 1.5–3 MW have become the most common for commercial use. The largest generator capacity of a single installed onshore wind turbine reached 7.5 MW in 2015. The power available from the wind {{is a function of the}} cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.|$|E
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various <b>airflows</b> (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E

Constrained by ECPs, the polluted <b>airflow</b> {{is transformed into a}} driven spiral <b>airflow</b> with axial, radial and tangential flow velocities (Mondal et al. 2004; Eldrainy et al. 2009). The dust particles are separated from the polluted <b>airflow</b> by the centrifugal force exerted by the tangential velocity of the driven spiral <b>airflow,</b> and the separated particles are captured by the water in the water sink. The wet <b>airflow</b> with the partly or fully separated dust cloud from the CDRS is dewatered by water baffles, and is then transformed into the purified <b>airflow</b> (‘F’ in Fig.  1).|$|R

Objectives: To examine prebronchodilator and post-bronchodilator spirometry in outpatients aged {{greater than or equal to}} 40 years with clinically documented ischemic heart disease who were current or former smokers. Methods: This multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted in 15 cardiovascular outpatient clinics in nine European countries. <b>Airflow</b> limitation was defined as post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC less than 0. 70. Measurements and Main Results: Among the 3, 103 patients with ischemic heart disease who were recruited, lung function was defined for 2, 730 patients. <b>Airflow</b> limitation was observed in 30. 5 % of patients with ischemic heart disease: 11. 3 % had mild <b>airflow</b> limitation, 15. 8 % moderate <b>airflow</b> limitation, 3. 3 % severe <b>airflow</b> limitation, and 0. 1 % very severe <b>airflow</b> limitation. Most patients with <b>airflow</b> limitation (70. 6 %) had no previous spirometry testing or diagnosed pulmonary disease. <b>Airflow</b> limitation was associated with greater respiratory symptomatology, impaired health status, and more frequent emergency room visits (P < 0. 05).
