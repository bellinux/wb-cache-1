The value of 615 ppm above the outdoor concentration indicates approximately 15 cubic feet per minute of outdoor air per adult occupant doing sedentary office work where outdoor air contains 385 ppm, the current global average atmospheric CO2 concentration. In classrooms, the requirements in the ASHRAE standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, would typically result in about 3 <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> depending on the occupant density. Of course the occupants aren't the only source of pollutants, so outdoor air ventilation may need to be higher when unusual or strong sources of pollution exist indoors. When outdoor air is polluted, then bringing in more outdoor air can actually worsen the overall quality of the indoor air and exacerbate some occupant symptoms related to outdoor air pollution. Generally, outdoor country air is better than indoor city air. Exhaust gas leakages can occur from furnace metal exhaust pipes that lead to the chimney when there are leaks in the pipe and the pipe gas flow area diameter has been reduced.|$|E

5000|$|In {{many smaller}} buildings, 'forced' or 'mechanical' {{ventilation}} {{is not used}} to introduce ventilation air. Instead, natural ventilation, via openable windows and other openings, exhaust fans, and infiltration are used to provide ventilation air. Typically, at least one-third <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> is considered the minimum. ASHRAE Standard 62.2 was adopted in 2004; it clarifies the ventilation air requirements for low-rise residences. The Standard specifies that forced ventilation is required in houses with infiltration less than 0.35 ACH. [...] This is typically accomplished with heat recovery ventilation or exhaust fans running constantly or periodically.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} component of natural ventilation is air change rate or air changes per hour: the hourly rate of ventilation divided by {{the volume of the}} space. For example, six <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> means an amount of new air, equal to the volume of the space, is added every ten minutes. For human comfort, a minimum of four <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> is typical, though warehouses might have only two. Too high of an air change rate may be uncomfortable, akin to a wind tunnel which have thousands of changes per hour. The highest air change rates are for crowded spaces, bars, night clubs, commercial kitchens at around 30 to 50 <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E

If the air in the space is either uniform or perfectly mixed, <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> {{is a measure of}} how many times the air within a defined space is replaced.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of the mechanical ventilation system in large spaces is proposed to be evaluated by macroscopic numbers describing the air flow. This includes the <b>air</b> <b>changes</b> rate <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> the <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rate <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> floor area, the momentum jet number, and the nominal time constants. To determine which number is the best choice, experimental studies in nine big waiting halls were performed. The indoor environment in the mechanical ventilated spaces can be assessed by the measured local mean air velocity, carbon dioxide level, and local age of air. Correlations of the measured mean values of local air velocity, carbon dioxide level, and local age of air with those macroscopic flow number are investigated. It is found that the relationships of the <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rate <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> the <b>air</b> <b>change</b> rate <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> <b>per</b> floor area and the nominal time constants with the mean air speed, the mean carbon dioxide concentration, and the mean local age of air were not clear.

The use of wing wall, one of the green features, is an alternative to create effective natural ventilation. Givoni conducted experiments in a wind tunnel to study the ventilation performance of wing walls. This paper presents a numerical study of the ventilation performance of wing walls using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations are compared with the results of the experiments of Givoni. The results indicate that wing wall can promote natural ventilation by increasing the <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> and the mean indoor air speed relative to wind speed at various wind speeds and wind directions. The best performance of wing wall is at the wind angle of around 45 °.

The radon level and radon emanation rate of SP were about 435 Bq/m 3 and 72. 48 Bq/m 2 /h respectively. Modelling results showed that, for the action level of 200 Bq/m 3 (according to WHO) and 150 Bq/m 3 (HKEPD), the outdoor air supply in SP should exceed 0. 61 ac/h and 0. 88 ac/h respectively. The average background infiltration in SP was 0. 36 ac/h and a window-type airconditioner can deliver 0. 74 ac/h.

5000|$|Air {{leaving the}} {{building}} {{when the heat}} pump's compressor is running is usually at around -1° in most versions, thus the unit is extracting heat from the air {{that needs to be}} changed (at around a half an <b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour)</b> [...] <b>Air</b> entering the house is of course generally warmer than the air processed through the unit so there is a net 'gain'.

Exhaust air heat pumps have minimum flow rates that when installed in a small flat the air flow chronically over ventilates the flat increasing the heat los by drawing in large amounts of unwanted outside air. For most exhaust air heat pumps there will be a low heat output to the hot water and heating of just around 1.2 Kw from the compressor / heat pump process but if that falls short of the building's requirements additional heat will be automatically triggered in the form of immersion heaters or an external gas boiler.

However, the indoor air pollutants from many investigated buildings {{are found to be}} with concentrations higher than several exposure criteria. We consider that the lack of including “effective ventilation factors ” in current Building Code can be in part explained as contributing to the above phenomenon. Therefore, a more comprehensive index to reflect the air exchange efficiency should be considered for inclusion in the Building Code. A trace-gas technique was used to measure the ventilation efficiency in field studies. The ACH (<b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour)</b> value, mean age of air, air exchange efficiency, and CO 2 concentrations were measured simultaneously. We also utilize the ACH values, air exchange efficiency, and CO 2 concentrations to construct the theory calculation. A simplified, predictive equation is established after the field data is compared with the values calculated from the above theoretical equation. The air exchange efficiency is shown to be the critical factor to build the EACH (Effective ACH) from ACH.

The effect of balconies on the interunit dispersion pattern is considered. The RNG k − ε model and the two-layer near-wall model are employed to establish the coupled indoor and outdoor airflow field, and the tracer gas technique is adopted to simulate pollutant dispersion. Reentry ratios from each unit to other units under prevailing wind directions are quantified and the possible interunit dispersion routes are then revealed. It is found that many reentry ratios appear to reach around 10. 0 %, suggesting that the interunit dispersion is an important pollutant transmission route. The interunit dispersion pattern is highly dependent on the incident wind direction and the fact whether the building has protrusive envelope features. On average, the strongest dispersion occurs on the windward wall of the buildings under oblique wind direction, owing to high ACH (<b>air</b> <b>change</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour)</b> values and unidirectional spread routes. Except under a normal incident wind, the presence of balconies intensifies the interunit dispersion by forming dispersion channels to increase the reentry ratios.

We report measurements of deposition rates of environmental tobacco smoke particles in a room-size chamber.
