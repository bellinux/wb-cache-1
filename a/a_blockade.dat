During the {{invasion}} of Korhal, Kilysa had her leviathans formed <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> and suppressed Dominion fleets reinforcement into the Korhal system.|$|E
5|$|After a lull, anti-shipping {{operations}} {{attacks were}} resumed by some Ju 87 units from 1 November 1940, {{as part of}} the new winter tactic of enforcing <b>a</b> <b>blockade.</b> Over the next 10 days, seven merchant ships were sunk or damaged, mainly in the Thames Estuary, for the loss of four Ju 87s. On 14 November 19 Stukas from III./St.G 1 with escort drawn from JG 26 and JG 51 went out against another convoy; as no targets were found over the estuary, the Stukas proceeded to attack Dover, their alternate target.|$|E
5|$|Although Warren {{departed}} soon afterwards leaving just a frigate squadron behind, {{the siege}} continued throughout August. French forces dominated Elba but {{were unable to}} make an impression {{on the walls of}} the fortress while Royal Navy forces controlled access to the island by sea, providing supplies for the defenders and denying them to the French. Halsted and Phoenix maintained <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> of the port of Piombino on the Italian mainland, ensuring the interception of French supplies.|$|E

5|$|Croatia {{established}} a company-sized special police unit in Bjelovar on 23 February 1991. Following {{the deterioration of}} the situation in western Slavonia, the 105th Brigade of the ZNG was raised in the city, largely equipped with small arms only, and plans for <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> of the routes {{in and out of the}} city were developed. A crisis headquarters was set up to coordinate the defence of the city and the manufacture of weapons in industrial plants which had been modified for their production.|$|E
5|$|France had {{threatened}} to invade the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo. In 1808, the Spanish Crown sent their Navy, {{under the command of}} Puerto Rican Captain Ramón Power y Giralt, to prevent the invasion of Santo Domingo by the French by enforcing <b>a</b> <b>blockade.</b> Col. Rafael Conti organized a military expedition with the intention of defending the Dominican Republic. They were successful and were proclaimed as heroes by the Spanish Government.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Port of Karachi {{housed the}} {{headquarters}} of the Pakistan Navy and almost its entire fleet was based in Karachi Harbour. Since Karachi was also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade, <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> would be disastrous for Pakistan’s economy. The security of Karachi Harbour was predominant to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any air or naval strikes. The port's airspace was secured by the strike aircraft based at airfields in the area.|$|E
50|$|She was {{anchored}} off {{the bar at}} Santiago 8 May 1846 {{during the}} Battle of Palo Alto. She then maintained <b>a</b> <b>blockading</b> station off {{the east coast of}} Mexico {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|R
50|$|Dalrymple also {{ignored the}} Royal Navy's concern about <b>a</b> <b>blockaded</b> Russian {{squadron}} in Lisbon. The squadron {{was allowed to}} sail to Portsmouth, and eventually to return to Russia, {{despite the fact that}} Britain and Russia were at war. This was also embarrassing.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> loose <b>blockade</b> is <b>a</b> close <b>blockade</b> {{where the}} blockading ships are {{withdrawn}} {{out of sight}} from the coast (behind the horizon) but no farther. The object of loose blockade is to lure the enemy into venturing out but to stay close enough to strike.|$|R
5|$|In 1971, the Port of Karachi {{housed the}} {{headquarters}} of the Pakistani Navy and almost the entire Pakistan Naval fleet was based at Karachi Harbour. It is also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade, meaning that <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> would be disastrous for Pakistan’s economy. The defence of Karachi harbour was therefore paramount to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any air or naval strikes, including cover from strike aircraft based at two airfields in the area.|$|E
5|$|Long {{directed}} the Navy's activities throughout the war, significantly increasing its {{size in the}} process. He ordered Dewey to neutralize the Spanish fleet in the Philippines, ordered the seizure of Spanish Guam, and worked to support <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> and offensive operations against Cuba. He also directed naval resources into threatening postures against mainland Spain to encourage the Spanish recall of a fleet destined for the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|The Rhind Papyrus {{illustrates}} some of Ahmose's {{military strategy}} when attacking the Delta. Entering Heliopolis in July, he {{moved down the}} eastern delta to take Tjaru, the major border fortification on the Horus Road, the road from Egypt to Canaan, in October, totally avoiding Avaris. In taking Tjaru he cut off all traffic between Canaan and Avaris. This indicates he was planning <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> of Avaris, isolating the Hyksos capital from help or supplies coming from Canaan.|$|E
50|$|Blockade {{running is}} the {{practice}} of delivering cargo (food, for example) to <b>a</b> <b>blockaded</b> area. It has mainly been done by ships (called blockade runners) across ports under naval blockade. Blockade runners were typically the fastest ships available and often lightly armed and armored.|$|R

5|$|The Turks agreed, but Prime Minister Deligiannis refused and {{dispatched}} 1400 {{troops to}} Crete {{under the command}} of Colonel Timoleon Vassos. While the Great Powers announced <b>a</b> <b>blockade,</b> Greek troops crossed the Macedonian border and Abdul Hamid II declared war. The announcement that Greece was finally at war with the Turks was greeted by delirious displays of patriotism and spontaneous parades in honor of the King in Athens. Volunteers by the thousands streamed north to join the forces {{under the command of}} Crown Prince Constantine.|$|E
5|$|The {{commanders of}} the crusader army decided to {{continue}} the invasion of Egypt, despite (according to Philip d'Aubigny) John's strong opposition. The crusaders approached Mansurah, but the Egyptians imposed <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> on their camp. Outnumbered, Pelagius agreed to an eight-year truce with Al-Kamil in exchange for Damietta on 28 August. John was among the crusade leaders held hostage by Al-Kamil until the crusader army withdrew from Damietta on 8 September.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} cause for {{a confrontation with}} the JNA in Split was <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> of the village of Kijevo, where Croatian authorities had established a new police station, imposed on 29 April. The village was surrounded by the JNA, commanded by Colonel Ratko Mladić, and the Serb insurgent forces, cutting access and preventing delivery of supplies. Tuđman called on the public to bring the siege to its end.|$|E

25|$|On 31 January 1863, Keystone State {{opened fire}} on a ship off Charleston. It {{returned}} fire, scoring hits on Keystone State, one of which struck her steam drum, rupturing it and scalding 20 men to death and injuring 20 others. After repairs, Keystone State took up <b>a</b> <b>blockading</b> station off St. Simons Sound, Georgia.|$|R
50|$|The {{war with}} Spain was only four months old when the Royal Navy sent <b>a</b> <b>blockading</b> {{force to the}} Spanish coast. The aims of the {{blockade}} were to block the dispatch of Spanish reinforcements to the Caribbean where Havana was under British siege, and to impede Spanish operations against Gibraltar or in the Mediterranean.|$|R
5|$|When World War II began, Friedrich Ihn was {{initially}} {{deployed in the}} Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sister ships in laying defensive minefields. She also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods in October. The ship was scheduled to conduct a minelaying operation off the British coast in early November, but it was cancelled {{when one of the}} other destroyers assigned to participate suffered machinery problems from contaminated fuel oil.|$|E
5|$|Winfield Scott, the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} U.S. Army {{at the beginning of}} the war, devised the Anaconda Plan to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Fort Sumter, Lincoln {{realized}} {{the importance of}} taking immediate executive control {{of the war and}} making an overall Union military strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending habeas corpus, arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.|$|E
50|$|There she was {{assigned}} <b>a</b> <b>blockading</b> {{station in the}} Gulf of Mexico west of the Florida coast {{as part of the}} East Gulf Blockading Squadron. In the next few months the ship was very active, tightening the noose of the blockade. She captured Fly 11 January, Florida 20 March, and Miriam 27 April 1864.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 December 1902 both Britain and Germany issued ultimatums to Venezuela, {{even though}} there was still {{disagreement}} about whether to impose <b>a</b> pacific <b>blockade</b> (as the Germans wanted) or <b>a</b> war <b>blockade</b> (as the British wanted). Germany ultimately agreed to <b>a</b> war <b>blockade,</b> and after receiving no reply to their ultimatums, <b>an</b> unofficial naval <b>blockade</b> was imposed on 9 December with SMS Panther, SMS Falke, SMS Gazelle and SMS Vineta as major Kaiserliche Marine warships in Caribbean sea. On 11 December Italy offered its own ultimatum, which Venezuela also rejected. Venezuela maintained that its national laws were final, and said that [...] "the so-called foreign debt ought not to be and never had been a matter of discussion beyond the legal guaranties found in the law of Venezuela on the public debt." ...|$|R

5|$|Again the defences were {{strengthened}} in September, {{in advance}} of a second siege which began on 16 October. By this stage only ten per cent of Edinburgh's inhabitants remained in the city. The besiegers under Regent Mar had only seven guns, and while they did manage to breach the Flodden Wall, the inner defences were too strong for an assault. By 21 October the siege was once again lifted. <b>A</b> <b>blockade</b> of the town was continued until July 1572 when a truce was agreed. Grange retreated into the castle and handed over the town to the Regent's party. The siege of Edinburgh Castle continued until May 1573, when it was finally reduced by a battery of guns shipped from England.|$|E
5|$|Boris {{was the son}} of Eufemia of Kiev, King Coloman of Hungary's second wife, {{whom the}} king {{expelled}} on the charge of adultery before Boris's birth. According to the chronicler Bishop Otto of Freising, Boris approached Conrad III of Germany to seek his assistance against Géza at the end of 1145. Upon the recommendation of Vladislav II of Bohemia, the German monarch authorized Boris to muster an army of mercenaries in Bavaria and Austria. Boris stormed Hungary and took the fortress of Pressburg (present-day Bratislava in Slovakia). The royal forces soon imposed <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> on the fortress and convinced Boris's mercenaries to surrender without resistance in exchange for compensation.|$|E
5|$|By October 6 the Egyptian naval {{task force}} was at Bab-el-Mandeb where they broke radio silence. When Operation Badr began at 14:00, Rear Admiral Fuad Abu Zikry {{authorized}} the fleet {{to proceed with}} the blockade via a codeword. Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab-el-Mandeb destined for Eilat, and all Israeli maritime navigation in the Red Sea ceased. The blockade was a strategic success for Egypt, while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting the blockade due to the long distance between Israel and Bab-el-Mandeb. Mines were laid {{at the entrance to the}} Gulf of Suez to prevent Israel from transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat. Historian Gammal Hammad claims that <b>a</b> <b>blockade</b> was also enforced in the Mediterranean, while other sources dispute this. News of the blockade was censored in Israel.|$|E
