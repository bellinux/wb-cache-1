5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E
500|$|Time {{described}} Scott's {{performance as}} [...] "...a performance of staggering impact....When {{his head is}} bowed, {{it is not in}} resignation but rather like that of a bull bloodied by the picador yet ready to charge again." [...] Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance came {{at a time when the}} Occupy Wall Street ongoings echoed the play while its actors could not afford the $120 ticket price. The March version of Loman presented him as <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a lunatic than other versions.|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Smith {{spoke to}} Q Radio {{about the new}} album. [...] "It's {{still going to be}} fairly electronic, I think, {{compared}} to our earlier records. So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I think we just need to, kind of, build on that..... with a nod to our past as well. It's our fourth record and we don't want to feel like we're doing the same thing again." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Goldfaden, {{by his own}} account, was {{familiar}} at this time with [...] "practically all of Russian literature", and also had plenty of exposure to Polish theater, and had even seen an African American tragedian, Ira Aldridge, performing Shakespeare, the performance at Grădina Pomul Verde was only <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a play than Grodner had participated in three years earlier. The songs were strung together {{with a bit of}} character and plot and a good bit of improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, Sokher Goldstein, and possibly as many as three other men went over well. The first performance was either Di bobe mitn einikl (Grandmother and Granddaughter) or Dos bintl holts (The Bundle of sticks); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden's own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as an old man in New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{competition}} between Kieswetter and Buttler for England's one-day wicket-keeping role also caused conflict at Somerset for the 2013 season: both players wanted to fulfil the {{role for the}} county. Kieswetter began the season as the wicket-keeper in the County Championship, but broke his thumb during the third match of the season, which {{kept him out of}} action for six weeks. Kieswetter had a particularly strong Twenty20 season, finishing as the leading run-scorer in the 2013 Friends Life t20 with , including five half-centuries. His teammate, Peter Trego, praised Kieswetter's ability to build big innings in Twenty20 cricket, and Kieswetter himself said that he [...] "tried to be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a responsible player, rather than just power blazing." [...] He scored a late-season century against Warwickshire in the County Championship, but in a season in which Somerset struggled against relegation, he scored a relatively modest 606 first-class runs at an average of 31.89. At the end of the season, Buttler, whose contract with Somerset had expired, announced that he was joining Lancashire, leaving Kieswetter as the clear first-choice wicket-keeper at Somerset.|$|E
500|$|In {{describing}} the character, Cooper said [...] "You don't {{know what he}} does {{in the depths of}} the evening, and he's gallivanting around." [...] He continued, [...] "I love dipping into ... some of that material of Howard Hughes, which I'm sure he's kind of been likened to", and described his biggest challenge in playing the character as [...] "keeping it very realistic, but at the same time, tongue-in-cheek as well", and not making Stark [...] "too broad". On Carter and Stark's relationship moving into the second season, Atwell said, [...] "there’s a new comfort level between Stark and Peggy ... they’re on <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an even level. She respects him hugely, but is also not afraid to comment on his lifestyle choices and how disgustingly misogynistic she finds him ... he does use women as a form of escapism for him and his Dionysian ways, but when it comes to Peggy, he doesn’t see her as big boobs and red lips. He sees her as someone he can actually have a proper conversation with. Which probably scares the hell out of him".|$|E

5000|$|Ben Bridwell {{described}} {{the sound of}} Cease to Begin, [...] "I guess the first record {{had some kind of}} country-ish leanings...I think there's maybe <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> that feeling on it, a little more down-home...not so much indie rock." ...|$|R

500|$|The Cherrytree Sessions was {{released}} on February 3, 2009, in the United States and was an import in European nations, including France. Mark Beech of Bloomberg L.P. gave The Cherrytree Sessions a positive review, awarding it {{three out of four}} stars. He praised Gaga's singing abilities and noting that the EP [...] "shows Lady Gaga isn't all combustible miniskirts and flame-throwing bras." [...] Simon Gage of the Daily Express gave the album three out of five stars, expressing surprise at Gaga's singing abilities. [...] "Often hidden under those dastardly catchy Eurobeats," [...] he noted, [...] "on these earlier, simpler versions of tracks such as Poker Face and Just Dance, her voice gets <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a chance to shine, as do the songs." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, awarding three stars out of five, who felt that the performances were [...] "effective showcases for Gaga’s charisma and songwriting." [...] Erlewine praised the music of [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)" [...] in particular, noting that its [...] "bare-bones mix" [...] was complementary to the release's aesthetic.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2003, a {{year after}} the {{character}} had returned, the BBC announced that they were axing the character of Ricky due to [...] "limited possibilities". Executive producer Louise Berridge said, [...] "one of our most enduringly successful characters. We will be very sorry to say goodbye to Sid, who {{has been one of the}} most amiable and popular of our cast members since his return to the show [...] the door is being left firmly open for his return in the future."

2500|$|Her songs {{have been}} {{described}} as [...] "some of the most deeply personal and emotionally naked ... of our times". In a 2003 interview, she said: [...] "My songs aren't about me at all. They're always about love, the pain and anguish of it. But the way I've always written is from observation. They're about what I see other people going through. If the songs were about me I'd be so embarrassed I don't think I'd be able to walk out the front door." [...] She went on to say: [...] "the optimistic songs reveal <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> me because that's how I feel. I'm definitely a 'glass is half full' kind of a person." [...] Many of her lyrics do not specify the gender of their subjects and she frequently uses the word [...] "you" [...] rather than a gender pronoun.|$|E

2500|$|Nobilo {{was born}} in Auckland, of Croatian and Italian descent, and is the great {{grandson}} of an Italian pirate. At birth, his right leg was shorter than his left, which has caused him some back problems throughout his life. He was educated at St Peter's College in Auckland where he was persuaded to play golf by schoolmates (Chris Treen and Mark Lewis). Nobilo preferred to play Rugby League for Glenora over Rugby Union for St Peter's, which was [...] "a bone of contention" [...] with the school. [...] "I got a bit of grief because I preferred league over rugby then and I was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a rebel. I used to catch the train {{to and from school}} and it took about 30–40 minutes. My mum said it drove her crazy because I missed it often and my parents were living in Glen Eden and I would end up in Henderson and they'd have to come and collect me".|$|E
2500|$|Winning the toss and batting, India reached 5/311 by stumps on {{the opening}} day. India were bowled out for 469 on the second day, after Ganguly scored his 16th and last Test century. Hayden was bowled for a third-ball duck, while Ponting was trapped lbw by a Sharma off cutter for five, as Australia {{collapsed}} to 5/58 and then 8/144 in their first innings reply. Shane Watson and Brett Lee combined for 73 eight wicket partnership, helping Australia reach a meagre 268. In the home-side's second innings, Ponting was criticised for using part-timers against the free-scoring Indian batsmen after he was informed that he was five overs behind the required over rate, which is penalisable by a fine, or in severe instances, a ban to the captain. This meant {{that he was not}} able to use pace spearhead Brett Lee significantly. A long discussion between Lee and Ponting prompted media allegations of a team rift, something Ponting denied. [...] "It seems like there are people trying to make <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> that than what it actually was," [...] Ponting said after his team's defeat. [...] "I made Brett aware he wasn't going to bowl first-thing in the morning. I let him know we were wanting to take pace off the ball." [...] Where it fell down a bit is I didn't communicate those reasons to Brett at 11am when he wanted to bowl. I made it clear to him from that moment on of those reasons." [...] After India declared on 3/314 with just over four sessions of play remaining, Australia were bowled out for 195 on the fifth morning, with Ponting's off stump knocked out of the ground by another Sharma off cutter for just 2, as India completed a 320 run victory.|$|E
2500|$|Early on, Hayashi {{said they}} {{attempted}} to move on from relying just on sex and violence: [...] "We’re {{trying to focus on}} the real women that surround us; the voice of a female, the mannerisms. We are being realistic about it. We want to show something that’s more high class, that adult males of our generation could look at a woman [...] and be impressed with her as a woman, not just as a pin-up," [...] as opposed to the previous concept of just [...] "make her breasts big and just make them jiggle." [...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what would you say to those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing. Their product received the ESRB rating of Mature 17+ (Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Violence).|$|E
