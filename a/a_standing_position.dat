5|$|To promote {{comfortable}} and accurate shooting from <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> match air pistols must have fast lock times, shoot practically recoilless and vibration free and exhibit minimal movement and balance shifts during discharge. The pistol {{must also be}} able to be tailored by adjustable user interfaces and various accessories to individual shooters personal preferences. Combined with appropriate match pellets the pistol has to produce a consistent 10 ring performance, so a non maximal result during the initial phase {{can be attributed to the}} participant.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>standing</b> handspring is {{one that}} begins from <b>a</b> {{stationary}} <b>standing</b> <b>position.</b> For example, <b>a</b> back handspring that begins with the performer in <b>a</b> stationary <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> is <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> back handspring.|$|R

5|$|Runners {{start the}} race from <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> along a curved {{starting}} line and {{after hearing the}} starter's pistol they head towards the innermost track to follow the quickest route to the finish. In 800m races athletes begin at a staggered starting point before the turn in the track and they must remain in their lanes for the first 100m of the race. This rule was introduced {{to reduce the amount}} of physical jostling between runners in the early stages of the race. Physiologically, these middle-distance events demand that athletes have good aerobic and anaerobic energy producing systems, and also that they have strong speed endurance.|$|E
5|$|Temple 3 (also {{known as}} Structure 3) is a pyramid-temple {{located on the}} east side of Plaza A, {{opposite}} Temple 2, and is similar in form to that building. The stairway climbs the west (plaza) side of the temple platform. In front of the stairway, at the level of the plaza, is a small rectangular platform. A large amount of ceramic remains were found associated with this building, these were pieces of large cylindrical incense-burners, of which more than twelve were used in the temple. One represented an elderly god emerging from the jaws of a serpent, another two show the same deity in <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position.</b> They may represent one of the patrion deities of the Kaqchikel, B'elehe-Toh or Hun-Tihax. The incense burners were found exactly where the Kaqchikels had left them when they abandoned Iximche. Some of these incense-burners bore a suspended solar disc with modelled rays. Fragments of an Early Postclassic plumbate ware vessel were recovered scattered around three sides of the temple that were probably the remains of a relic from within the temple itself. There is no evidence of such early occupation at Iximche and may have been plundered from Zaculeu, a city with a long occupational history that was conquered by the K'iche'-Kaqchikel alliance. A sacrificial flint knife was also recovered from Structure 3. Two low platforms stand in front of the temple, they were likely to have been used either as altars or as dance platforms.|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in a Last Man Standing match next. In a Last Man Standing match, {{there are}} no {{disqualifications}} or count outs, instead to win the match the competitor has to force their opponent to {{not be able to}} reach <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> by the count of 10. However, this match was only promoted as a Last Man Standing match, instead it was held under Texas Death match rules where a wrestler must pin or submit their opponent and then have them fail to respond to a count of 10. Styles got the first fall of the night, when he forced Angle to tap out to Angle's own signature submission maneuver the Ankle lock. Angle made it to his feet before the count concluded. Angle gained a pinfall later on in the match after slamming Styles off the top of a padded turnbuckle with a suplex. Before Styles could reach his feet to beat the count, Angle slammed Styles onto the mat back-first with his signature Olympic slam maneuver and gained another pinfall to start the count over. Styles beat that count as well, with Angle trying for the Olympic Slam again before Styles' countered it into his signature Styles' Clash maneuver and pinned Angle. After Angle reached his feet, Styles and Angle fought up a padded turnbuckle with Styles gaining the advantage. At this time, Styles grabbed Angle by the neck and fell backwards from the turnbuckle and drove Angle head-first into the mat. Angle failed to reach the 10 count afterwards, with Styles being declared the winner of the contest at 24 minutes and 50 seconds. Following the encounter, the referee called for medical attention for Angle who was scripted to appear as if he had suffered a neck injury. Styles then entered the ring once Angle reached his feet and lifted Angle up and dropped him on his head. As Styles walked up the ramp, he was attacked by Sting, who drove Styles' head into the ramp with his signature Scorpion Death Drop maneuver, as Kevin Nash looked on.|$|E
50|$|A take-down is {{a wrestling}} move {{used to go}} from <b>a</b> neutral <b>standing</b> <b>{{position}}</b> to <b>an</b> up position with your opponent in a down position and thus score two take-down points.|$|R
50|$|Many {{gymnastics}} flips are descriptively named, {{based on}} the direction of rotation and the body position that is assumed during execution. For example, a front flip performed with a tucked body form is called a front tuck. When initiated from <b>a</b> stationary, <b>standing</b> <b>position,</b> <b>a</b> front tuck is called <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> front tuck.|$|R
50|$|This {{refers to}} the bend in the knees and height {{relative}} to <b>a</b> normal <b>standing</b> <b>position.</b> Low stances are very powerful and assist delivery of power through the body to either the arms or the legs. High stances are more mobile and allow one to reposition rapidly.|$|R
25|$|Pump-action {{weapons are}} faster to cycle than lever actions, {{but are not}} well suited for firing from a {{supported}} position. Most pump-action designs are found in shotguns, which are typically fired from <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> where {{the movement of the}} arm to operate the action is not an issue.|$|E
25|$|In humans, this {{refers to}} the body in <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> with arms at the side and palms facing forward (thumbs out). While the {{universal}} vertebrate terminology used in veterinary medicine would work in human medicine, the human terms {{are thought to be}} too well established to be worth changing.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effects of}} congruent and incongruent gender stereotypical whole-body posture on perceptions of power, masculinity, and femininity. Two hundred and twenty college students (60 % women) {{were randomly assigned to}} view one of four photographs. Each picture depicted either a male/female in <b>a</b> gender consistent <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> or <b>a</b> male/female in <b>a</b> gender inconsistent <b>standing</b> <b>position.</b> Participants then completed measures of how powerful and how masculine/feminine they perceived the model to be. Results showed that the masculine <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> scored higher on perceived power and perceived masculinity. The feminine <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> scored higher on perceived femininity. Additionally, female parttctpants rated the male model as more powerful/masculine, and male participants rated the female model as more powerful/masculine...|$|R
50|$|A flashkick {{is a type}} of back flip that is {{performed}} in tricking. Usually performed with one leg extended and the other tucked. As with many other types of back flips, a flashkick may be started from <b>a</b> stationary <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> or immediately following another similar move, such as a roundoff.|$|R
50|$|The tan-tan {{is played}} in <b>a</b> sitting or <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> by one hand beating the drum head whilst {{the other hand}} taps the metal or wood body of the drum.|$|R
25|$|While it is {{uncommon}} in Western cultures {{for women to}} stand while urinating, this practice is becoming more common. Denise Decker, a nurse who advocates for this practice, surveyed 600 women to discover how interested they were in having female urinals which would be used in <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position,</b> {{and the majority of}} respondents indicated a desire to have such facilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{matter was}} taken before the Pope, who ordered Michelangelo {{to build a}} {{scaffold}} of his own. Michelangelo created a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from holes in the wall, high up {{near the top of}} the windows. Contrary to popular belief, he did not lie on this scaffolding while he painted, but painted from <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} Cross of Pulcheria {{lies at the}} catholicon's altar, {{which also}} houses cases of holy relics and a very important Byzantine mosaic icon. The icon is barely 0.15×0.07 m2 and depicts Christ in <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> in great detail. The icon {{is surrounded by a}} silver frame that depicts the apostles, while holy relics are embedded on its lower side.|$|E

50|$|A misericord (sometimes named mercy seat, {{like the}} Biblical object) {{is a small}} wooden {{structure}} formed {{on the underside of}} a folding seat in a church which, when the seat is folded up, is intended to act as a shelf to support a person in <b>a</b> partially <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> during long periods of prayer.|$|R
50|$|Parry, an {{advanced}} new addition, allow an open counter-attack after a successful parry block. A player can assume <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> defensive <b>position</b> and cause the attacker to temporarily freeze if the parry is successful, {{and from there}} either perform a special stunning technique or a 3-hit variant of a Special Move.|$|R
25|$|Archery: The most {{valuable}} archers were the crossbowmen. Their number in Matthias' service reached 4,000 in the 1470s. They used sabres as a secondary weapon (which was unusual for infantry in those ages). Their primary advantage was {{the ability to}} shoot heavy armour, while the disadvantages were that they required defense to protect them while moving slowly in <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common shots {{that use the}} above {{described}} setup are the set shot and the jump shot. The set shot is taken from <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position,</b> with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws, and in other circumstances while the jump shot is taken in mid-air, the ball released {{near the top of}} the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender. Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.|$|E
25|$|The {{different}} types of urinals, be it for single users or as trough designs for multiple users, are often intended to be utilized from <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> (rather than squatting or sitting), but designs exist which are intended {{to be used with}} other postures. The term may also apply to a small building or other structure containing such fixtures. It can also refer to a small container in which urine can be collected for medical analysis, or for use where access to toilet facilities is not possible, such as in small aircraft, during extended stakeouts, or for the bedridden.|$|E
25|$|Reversal (2 points): A {{defensive}} wrestler who {{is being}} controlled on the bottom is awarded two points for a reversal when he comes from the bottom/defensive position and gains control of the opponent either on the mat or in <b>a</b> rear <b>standing</b> <b>position.</b> Reversal points are awarded {{on the edge of}} the wrestling area if control is established while any part of either wrestler remains in bounds.|$|R
50|$|A powerbomb is a move {{in which}} an {{opponent}} is lifted {{into the air and}} then slammed down back-first to the mat. The standard powerbomb sees the opponent placed in <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> headscissors <b>position</b> (bent forward with their head placed between the wrestler's thighs), lifted on the wrestler's shoulders, and slammed back-first down to the mat. The move was innovated by Lou Thesz.|$|R
50|$|Acrobatic flips can {{be started}} from <b>a</b> stationary, <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> {{and they are}} also {{commonly}} executed immediately following another rotational move, such as a roundoff or handspring, so as {{to take advantage of}} the angular momentum developed in the preceding move. In general, the hands do not touch the floor during execution of a flip and performers typically strive to land on the feet in an upright position.|$|R
25|$|Play stops {{when the}} ball carrier's knee, elbow, or any other body part aside from the feet and hands, is forced to the ground (a tackle); when a forward pass is not caught on the fly (during a scrimmage); when a {{touchdown}} (see below) or a field goal is scored; {{when the ball}} leaves the playing area by any means (being carried, thrown, or fumbled out of bounds); or when the ball carrier is in <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> but can no longer move forwards (called forward progress). If no score has been made, the next play starts from scrimmage.|$|E
25|$|Waterless urinals {{are often}} {{installed}} alongside UDDTs {{for the convenience}} of male users. Urinals also reduce the risk that male users standing over the UDDT for urination (rather than sitting or squatting) inadvertently urinate into the feces vault or feces container. It is generally advisable that all UDDT users sit or squat to urinate. If urinals are provided, they can be used for those who prefer <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position.</b> Female urination devices are also available but they are not necessary for use with UDDTs as women normally sit or squat to urinate, a good posture which minimises urine from getting into the feces vault.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in <b>a</b> <b>standing</b> <b>position</b> on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E
5000|$|Escapes: In {{a general}} sense, an escape is {{accomplished}} by maneuvering out of danger or from an inferior position; for example when a grappler who is underneath side control moves to guard or gets back to <b>a</b> neutral <b>standing</b> <b>position,</b> or when <b>a</b> grappler is able to maneuver out of a submission attempt and back to {{a position where he}} is no longer in immediate danger of being submitted.|$|R
5000|$|Reversal (2 points): A {{defensive}} wrestler who {{is being}} controlled on the bottom is awarded two points for a reversal when he comes from the bottom/defensive position and gains control of the opponent either on the mat or in <b>a</b> rear <b>standing</b> <b>position.</b> Reversal points are awarded {{on the edge of}} the wrestling area if either wrestler's supporting point(s) or the feet of the scoring wrestler remain in bounds.|$|R
5|$|There {{are some}} {{restrictions}} on the pistol, {{and it must be}} operated by one hand only from <b>a</b> <b>standing,</b> unsupported <b>position.</b> The shooter decides his or her own tempo as long as the maximum time is not exceeded, but in the final round for the top shooters, separate commands are given for each shot so that the audience may follow the progress of the standings.|$|R
