5|$|A sequel, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, was {{released}} on March 28, 2013, directed by Jon Chu. In the film, the Joes are framed as traitors by Zartan, who is still impersonating the President of the United States, and Cobra Commander now has <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> leaders under Cobra's control, with their advanced warheads aimed at innocent populaces around the world. Outnumbered and out gunned, the Joes form a plan with the original G.I. Joe General Joseph Colton to overthrow the Cobra Commander and his allies Zartan, Storm Shadow, and Firefly.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo Lawn is {{so called}} {{because of the}} replica of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Silver Buffalo Award that was {{presented}} by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926.

Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park.

5|$|As with {{previous}} Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance {{takes place in}} a continuity and setting separate {{from the rest of the}} series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides. By the events of Path of Radiance, Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's Medallion, the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem. It is a bronze medallion said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> but Tellius to be engulfed by the sea. To prevent the dark god being freed, war must be prevented in Tellius.|$|E

It opened at International Center of Photography in New York in May 2010 and traveled to the DuSable Museum of African American History (Chicago), Smithsonian National Museum of American History (DC), National Civil Rights Museum (Memphis), Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture (Baltimore), Addison Gallery of American Art (Andover, MA) and other venues. For <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> to See was selected by the National Endowment for the Humanities as the twelfth NEH on the Road exhibition, an initiative that adapted the exhibition in a smaller, lower security version that will travel to up to 50 more venues, mostly smaller and mid-size institutions across the country over a ten-year period from 2012 to 2023.|$|E

25|$|If {{production}} and consumption of coal continue at the rate as in 2008, proven and economically recoverable world reserves of coal would last for about 150 years. This {{is much more than}} needed for an irreversible climate catastrophe. Coal is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the world. According to James Hansen the single most important action needed to tackle the climate crisis is to reduce CO2 emissions from coal. Indonesia and Australia exported together 57.1% of the world coal export in 2011. China, Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan had 65% share of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> coal import in 2011.|$|E

25|$|The {{name of the}} Globe {{supposedly}} {{alludes to}} the Latin tag totus mundus agit histrionem, in turn derived from quod fere totus mundus exerceat histrionem—"because <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is a playground"—from Petronius, which had wide circulation in England in the Burbages' time. Totus mundus agit histrionem was, according to this explanation, therefore adopted as the theatre's motto. Another allusion, familiar to the contemporary theatre-goer, {{would have been to}} Teatrum Mundi, a meditation by the twelfth-century classicist and philosopher John of Salisbury, in his Policraticus, book three. In either case, {{there would have been a}} familiar understanding of the classical derivation without the adoption of a formal motto.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} when Herod was king of Judea, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee to {{announce}} to a virgin named Mary, who was betrothed to a man named Joseph, that a child would be born {{to her and she}} was to name him Jesus, for he would be the son of God and rule over Israel forever. When the time of the birth drew near the Roman Emperor commanded a census of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and Joseph took Mary to Bethlehem, the city of David, as he was of the House of David. So it came to pass that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, and as there was no room in the town the infant was laid in a manger while angels announced his birth and shepherds worshiped him as Messiah and Lord.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of repercussion, {{the power of}} animal metamorphosis, or of sending out a familiar, real or spiritual, as a messenger, and the supernormal powers conferred by association with such a familiar, are also attributed to the magician, male and female, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> over; and witch superstitions are closely parallel to, if not identical with, lycanthropic beliefs, the occasional involuntary character of lycanthropy being almost the sole distinguishing feature. In another direction the {{phenomenon of}} repercussion is asserted to manifest itself {{in connection with the}} bush-soul of the West African and the nagual of Central America; but though there is no line of demarcation to be drawn on logical grounds, the assumed power of the magician and the intimate association of the bush-soul or the nagual with a human being are not termed lycanthropy. Nevertheless, it will be well to touch on both these beliefs here.|$|E
