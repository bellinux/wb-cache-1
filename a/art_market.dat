40|$|<b>Marketing</b> in the <b>arts</b> {{sector has}} evolved {{during the past}} decades from a {{functional}} tool to a business philosophy. At the same time, a relational view of art as experience has emerged in contemporary arts philosophy, highlighting the role of arts consumers in the creation and reception of arts. As a consequence, arts consumers have gained a central position within the artistic mission of arts organizations, posing new challenges {{to the role of}} <b>arts</b> <b>marketing</b> both as a practice and as an academic discipline. Against this background, financial figures and audience numbers are insufficient indicators of the contribution that <b>arts</b> <b>marketing</b> makes to the functioning of arts organizations. This article suggests evaluating the performance of <b>arts</b> <b>marketing</b> based on the contribution made to the achievement of the arts organization's artistic mission and proposes a model based on Kaplan and Norton's Balanced Scorecard to guide the artistic-mission-led evaluation of <b>arts</b> <b>marketing</b> performance. By paying attention to the new strategic role of <b>arts</b> <b>marketing</b> within the emerging relational view of the arts and by integrating recent literature on performance management in nonprofit organizations, we make a theoretical contribution to the body of knowledge on <b>arts</b> <b>marketing</b> performance evaluation...|$|R

However, his health deteriorated and he began to suffer badly from stomach pains. He died in Glasgow in the Claremont Nursing Home on 7 December 1931, aged 54. The cause of death was cardiac failure due to blood poisoning, following an unsuccessful gall bladder operation.

5|$|Just {{before her}} death, Oliver had been shortlisted for the 2006 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award.

The secondary <b>art</b> <b>market,</b> meanwhile, was returning six-figure sums for her works at auction; in 2007 a record for Oliver's work was set when Skein (2004) went under the hammer for $192,000. By 2010, Sydney Biennale chairman Luca Belgiorno-Nettis was reported to have paid $300,000 for one of Oliver's sculptures, titled Tracery. In 2011, Sydney's College of Fine Arts announced that its new sculpture studio would be named after Oliver.|$|E
5|$|Stelae {{have become}} {{threatened}} {{in modern times}} by plundering for sale on the international <b>art</b> <b>market.</b> Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact. Various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport, including power saws, chisels, acid and heat. When a monument is well preserved, the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport. Even when successful, this results in damage to inscriptions {{on the sides of}} the stela. At worst, this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale. Traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by American museums and private collectors in the past. When such monuments are removed from their original context, their historical meaning is lost. Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution, no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location. After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the New York <b>art</b> <b>market</b> due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen pre-Columbian sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date. In the early 1970s some museums, such as that of the University of Pennsylvania, responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history, including place of origin, previous owners and an export license. Harvard University also instituted a similar policy in the early 1970s.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{the arts}} are {{becoming}} more and more recognized as being an intrinsic part of everyday human life. The arts industry has recognized the importance of studying how to market effectively. As commercial marketing cannot be simply transplanted into an <b>arts</b> environment, <b>arts</b> <b>marketing</b> is a specific area. The marketing strategy of various arts organizations has become particularly significant in the increasingly competitive arts environment. The focus on <b>arts</b> <b>marketing</b> is being encouraged to ensure the arts organizations long-term viability, profitability and sustainability. This research will focus on arts festival organizations, as a particular type of arts organization, and will look closely at the approach in which they undertake <b>arts</b> <b>marketing</b> activities. This dissertation aims analyze the value of <b>marketing</b> tools in <b>arts</b> <b>marketing</b> and research whether the scientific marketing methods can reach broader range of consumers and improve the profits of arts organizations. It is necessary to understand the consumer behaviour and the process of how advertising affects arts audiences.

5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief {{that the purpose of}} art is to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint still lifes, beginning with Pheasant and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the <b>art</b> <b>market</b> declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E
