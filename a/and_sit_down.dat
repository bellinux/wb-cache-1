After his 2011 album Pull Up Some Dust <b>and</b> <b>Sit</b> <b>Down,</b> Cooder {{continued}} writing topical and storyline-inspired songs.

5|$|In 2011, Cooder {{recorded}} Pull Up Some Dust <b>and</b> <b>Sit</b> <b>Down</b> {{after being}} {{inspired by a}} headline about bankers and other affluent people profiting from bank bailouts and the resulting recession during the late-2000s. Released in August to critical acclaim, it showcased Cooder's return to his early work's musical style and told topical stories about political and social corruption, various economic victims, and an emerging class war. With the album finished, Cooder had developed a penchant for writing such songs and wanted to continue writing more storyline-inspired songs. A month after the album's release, Cooder had his first short-story collection, Los Angeles Stories, published by City Lights Bookstore. In June 2012, he joined Time political columnist Joe Klein on the latter's road trip across the United States, speaking out to people in towns {{about the state of}} the nation and its forthcoming presidential election in 2012.|$|E

500|$|Pull Up Some Dust <b>and</b> <b>Sit</b> <b>Down</b> {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 92, based on 14 reviews. It was {{called one of}} Cooder's best records by Uncut magazine's Nigel Williamson and Martin Chilton of The Daily Telegraph. AllMusic editor Thom Jurek deemed it Cooder's [...] "most overtly political album ... {{and one of his}} funniest, most musically compelling ones, too", while Daniel Paton from musicOMH said much of the record was [...] "highly satisfying satire (although also often sensitive and affecting), combining Cooder’s transparent love {{for a wide range of}} roots music with his engagement with politics." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent was impressed by how Cooder used similar characters throughout the songs in new ways, calling the album his best since 2005's Chávez Ravine. Cooder received comparisons to Woody Guthrie in reviews written by Phil Sutcliffe of Mojo, who found the lyrics sharply written, and Neil Spencer from The Observer, who called Cooder [...] "a Woody Guthrie for our times" [...] and the record [...] "a fierce state-of-the-nation album". In the opinion of PopMatters critic Philip Majorins, the record would not have a significant impact because of the public's predominantly commercial tastes and a [...] "cynical" [...] cultural climate, but concluded, [...] "Pull Up Some Dust <b>and</b> <b>Sit</b> <b>Down</b> could have tremendous cathartic power for [...] who are aware of history and its knack for repeating itself. For those who are willing, this is a good place to start an education." ...|$|E
500|$|The deeply {{political}} album expands on the socio-political musings of Pull Up Some Dust <b>and</b> <b>Sit</b> <b>Down.</b> Cooder's forthright lyrics exhibit satire, dark humor, and bitter, apprehensive {{feelings about}} current events, including Guantanamo Bay, the Occupy movement, {{the shooting of}} Trayvon Martin, Barack Obama's plight as US President, and the election of 2012. He addresses these topics through song-form vignettes, which express his anti-Republican party perspective. Cooder's songwriting also reappropriates lyrics from older musical sources, including protest songs, broadside ballads, and country blues. Nick Coleman of The Independent describes it as [...] "heartfelt and unencumbered with musicological pedantry", while the newspaper's Andy Gill comments that Cooder [...] "employs demotic" [...] language and [...] "variations of the blues... to carry his broadsides." [...] Jeff Schwager of PopMatters cites Robert Johnson and Woody Guthrie as influences on Cooder's songcraft for the album.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 40, Gangleri {{says that}} Valhalla {{must be an}} immense building, yet it must often be crowded around the doorways.

In chapter 41, Gangleri notes that there are very many people in Valhalla, and that Odin is a [...] "very great lord when he commands such a troop". Gangleri then asks what entertainment the einherjar have when they're not drinking. High responds that every day, the einherjar get dressed and [...] "put on war-gear and go out into the courtyard and fight each other and fall upon each other. This is their sport." [...] High says that when dinner time arrives, the einherjar ride back to Valhalla <b>and</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to drink. In reference, High quotes a stanza from Grímnismál.|$|E
