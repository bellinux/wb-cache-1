5|$|At only 21 Kydd was the {{youngest}} player on the tour of Jamaica and, while she toured with {{the remainder of the}} team, was overlooked for a Test position. She finally made her full début against South Africa not long afterwards, and managed to cement her position with a superb performance, managing an <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate</b> of 94% in the third Test. This performance, along with similar form in the national league, led to her selection in the starting squad for the 2003 Netball World Championships. She played every game in the world championships in July at the expense of ageing veteran Eloise Southby, a decision which was the cause of some controversy. She subsequently helped the Kestrels to the elimination final and, {{at the end of the}} season, was named as the team's new vice-captain, with predecessor Janine Ilitch assuming the captaincy. She also won the coveted Commonwealth Bank Trophy Player's Player Award, and tied for third in the Most Valuable Player count.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rico Department of the Family {{currently}} {{provides the}} benefits to each participating family through a debit card, which replaced the physical cheques in the early 2000s. The monthly benefit is deposited through an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system into a government-designated personal bank account, which can be accessed at any time with the debit card to withdraw cash or to make food purchases from authorized retailers. Since September 2001, 75% of each family’s monthly benefit has been designated exclusively for making direct food and grocery purchases, while the remaining 25% can be withdrawn as a cash benefit. The EBT debit card system has improved the program’s payment <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate</b> to 96.4% in 2003, 4 years ahead of its 2007 goal of 95% accuracy.|$|E

His second concern was whether couples who purchase the test might use the results for family balancing, which means the decision to utilize selective abortion to achieve a baby of the desired sex. Wapner said that one positive aspect of the Baby Gender Mentor test is the non-invasive nature of the test, which means there should be no risk of harm to the fetus.|$|E

25|$|Neurosarcoidosis (sometimes {{shortened}} to neurosarcoid) {{refers to}} sarcoidosis, {{a condition of}} unknown cause featuring granulomas in various tissues, involving {{the central nervous system}} (brain and spinal cord). It can have many manifestations, but abnormalities of the cranial nerves (a group of twelve nerves supplying the head and neck area) are the most common. It may develop acutely, subacutely, and chronically. Approximately 5-10% of people with sarcoidosis of other organs (e.g. lung) develop central nervous system involvement. Only 1% of people with sarcoidosis will have neurosarcoidosis alone without involvement of any other organs. Diagnosis can be difficult, with no test apart from biopsy achieving a high <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate.</b> Treatment is with immunosuppression. The first case of sarcoidosis involving the nervous system was reported in 1948.|$|E
25|$|The {{switch to}} a more {{deep-lying}} position reduced his number of assists and goals, {{as well as his}} shot per game count (1.2), although his game was no longer based on being a goal threat; in spite of this, he had the second highest count of key passes per game (2.06) in the team, as well as a very high pass <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate</b> (87%), with the highest passes per game count (62.5) in the team, the most long balls per game (5.6), the most successful dribbles (2.2), interceptions (2.5), and the highest tackle (1.9) count per game among others, high statistics which placed him amongst the top midfielders on of the Premier League. Already in the 2011–12 season statistically he was among top rated central and all-round midfielders across the top five leagues, alongside players like Xabi Alonso, Andrea Pirlo, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Xavi.|$|E
25|$|The scheme {{makes use}} of {{purpose-built}} automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, manufactured by PIPs Technology, to record vehicles entering and exiting the zone. Cameras can record number plates with a 90% <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate</b> through the technology. The majority of vehicles within the zone are captured on camera. The cameras take two still pictures in colour and {{black and white and}} use infrared technology to identify the number plates. The camera network and other roadside equipment is managed largely automatically by an instation system developed by Roke Manor Research Ltd, which delivers number plates to the billing system. These identified numbers are checked against the list of payers overnight by computer. In those cases when a number plate has not been recognised then they are checked manually. Those that have paid but have not been seen in the central zone are not refunded, and those that have not paid and are seen are fined. The registered keeper of such a vehicle is looked up in a database provided by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), based in Swansea.|$|E

25|$|On 26 May 2012, Adam, C-P and Jeffball of DC949 gave a {{presentation}} at the LayerOne hacker conference detailing how {{they were able to}} achieve an automated solution with an <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate</b> of 99.1%. Their tactic was to use techniques from machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, to analyse the audio version of reCAPTCHA which is available for the visually impaired. Google released a new version of reCAPTCHA just hours before their talk, making major changes to both the audio and visual versions of their service. In this release, the audio version was increased in length from 8 seconds to 30 seconds, and is much more difficult to understand, both for humans as well as bots. In response to this update and the following one, the members of DC949 released two more versions of Stiltwalker which beat reCAPTCHA with an accuracy of 60.95% and 59.4% respectively. After each successive break, Google updated reCAPTCHA within a few days. According to DC949, they often reverted to features that had been previously hacked.|$|E

2500|$|Despite criticisms, experimenters {{are still}} trying to gather data that may support the case that {{conscious}} [...] "will" [...] can be predicted from brain activity. fMRI machine learning of brain activity (multivariate pattern analysis) has been used to predict the user choice of a button (left/right) up to 7 seconds before their reported will of having done so. Brain regions successfully trained for prediction included the frontopolar cortex (anterior medial prefrontal cortex) and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (medial parietal cortex). In order to ensure report timing of conscious [...] "will" [...] to act, they showed the participant a series of frames with single letters (500ms apart), and upon pressing the chosen button (left or right) they were required to indicate which letter they had seen at the moment of decision. This study reported a statistically significant 60% <b>accuracy</b> <b>rate,</b> which may be limited by experimental setup; machine learning data limitations (time spent in fMRI) and instrument precision.|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} dynamic changes in {{cognition}} across the human menstrual cycle, twenty, healthy, naturally-cycling women undertook a lateralized spatial figural comparison task on twelve occasions at approximately 3 - 4 day intervals. Each session {{was conducted in}} laboratory conditions with response times, <b>accuracy</b> <b>rates,</b> eye movements, salivary estrogen and progesterone concentrations and Profile of Mood states questionnaire data collected on each occasion. The first two sessions of twelve for the response variables were discarded to avoid early effects of learning thereby providing 10 sessions spread across each participant's complete menstrual cycle. Salivary progesterone data for each participant was utilized to normalize each participant's data to a standard 28 day cycle. Data was analysed categorically by comparing peak progesterone (luteal phase) to low progesterone (follicular phase) to emulate two-session repeated measures typical studies. Neither {{a significant difference in}} reaction times or <b>accuracy</b> <b>rates</b> was found. Moreover no significant effect of lateral presentation was observed upon reaction times or <b>accuracy</b> <b>rates</b> although inter and intra individual variance was sizeable. Using a 'phase plane' plot, we demonstrated that hormone concentrations alone cannot be used to predict the response times or <b>accuracy</b> <b>rates.</b> In contrast, we constructed a standard linear model using salivary estrogen, salivary progesterone and their respective derivative values and found these inputs to be very accurate for predicting variance observed in the reaction times for all stimuli and <b>accuracy</b> <b>rates</b> for right visual field stimuli but not left visual field stimuli. The identification of sex-hormone derivatives as predictors of cognitive behaviours is of importance. The finding suggests that there is a fundamental difference between the up-surge and decline of hormonal concentrations where previous studies typically assume all points near the peak of a hormonal surge are the same.
