"It {{was indeed}} a temptation of Diabolus," [...] said that simple sage; [...] "for he is by his very name the divider who sets man against man, and tempts one to care only for oneself, and forget kin and country, and duty and queen. But you have {{resisted}} him, Captain Leigh, like a true-born Englishman, as you always are, and he has fled from you. But that {{is no reason why}} we should not flee from him too; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> sooner we are out of this place, and at work again, the better for all our souls." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{think what}} was cool {{is that he}} was pushing skateboarding in a {{direction}} that I wasn't ... and I was pushing towards bigger handrails, bigger [...] "hubbas", and, kind of, unconventional skate spots. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> two of us, kind of got psyched off each other, you know? next thing I know, he was hitting, grinding bigger handrails; I started frontside flipping over handrails, you know, like? ... And just as people, I think, like, he remains-I don't have to see the guy for ten years and we'll still be best friends ... You meet people over the years that you connect with and are inspired by, you know? And I think me and Tom were definitely a major part of coming together and helping progress skateboarding at the time ...|$|E
5000|$|Kevin Moore {{spoke to}} a Japanese {{interviewer}} regarding the meaning behind the song:"I was looking through a clothing catalog and saw {{a picture of a}} girl modeling this piece of clothing called a space-dye vest. And, so, I {{fell in love with her}} laughs for some strange reason and so the minute I did that, the minute I was just like obsessed with this person, I was like, 'why am I doing that?' and I noticed that I was doing it a lot lately. And I think the prime reason that I was doing that, and this is what I figured out at the time, was that I had just come out of a relationship where I'd gotten dumped, basically, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> situation was that I wasn't finished giving all that I was ready to give, so I was just, like, throwing it around, you know, just aiming it in different directions. It was a total case of projection. And this song is just trying to sort it out and just kind of admitting that I'm just kind of lost. So it's kind of a dark song. It was very cathartic though."Vocalist James LaBrie said [...] "Kevin Moore saw this photograph in a fashion magazine of a beautiful model wearing a space-dye vest and he fell in love with her," [...] "He carried that magazine around with him for ages, but he realized that the only way the innocence could be kept, so that he could retain that love for her, was if she stayed on the page. If he'd met her, all that would have been lost." [...] Portnoy recalled that when the rest of the band first heard the song [...] "we thought it was so very, very different we didn't think we even wanted to fuck with it." ...|$|E

60|$|Before we sailed I {{wrote to}} Sir Alexander telling him exactly how things stood, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> did his son, {{though he never}} showed me the letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it, my honest friend; the sweeter {{the more}} dangerous. Arsenic is sweeter than sugar. I {{know you are}} a very {{sensible}} young man, not to be taken in by an artful Ammonite, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had better convey your message to the girl forthwith." ...|$|R
30|$|I think we’re {{gradually}} getting most faculty {{on board}} with the way that these things should be done, and the current chair of the department certainly likes our teaching <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere and the dynamic within the department is to continue these things. Exactly who will do them is not exactly obvious… I’m not exactly sure how it would work out, but I think that the atmosphere and philosophy of the department has gone beyond some barrier, which I think could sustain this even in our absence.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't deny it, 'Tilda,' said Miss Squeers, impressively, 'because you have, and it's {{no use to}} go {{attempting}} to say you haven't. You mightn't have known it in your sleep, 'Tilda, but I haven't closed my eyes for a single wink, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>THINK</b> <b>I</b> am to be believed.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{reference is}} from the newspaper The Australasian of 17 July 1869 (page 17): “Cornstalk and gumsucker are both of colonial growth, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is… bullocky (a teamster)”.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Paul,' {{returned}} Mrs Chick, 'with {{your usual}} happy discrimination, which I am weak enough to envy you, every time I am in your company; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is Miss Tox.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we {{had better}} not," [...] said Lady Montfort to Myra. [...] "After all, {{there is nothing like}} 'my crust of bread <b>and</b> liberty,' <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{we had better}} stay at the Bristol." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of myself, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of {{all other}} human beings, as circles of thought and experience, each a little {{different}} from the others. Each human being I see as essentially a circle of thought between an internal and an external world.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let Pharaoh pardon me, but {{the counsel}} that I gave I still give; the assent that I refused I still refuse, because my heart {{tells me that}} so it is right to do, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> will Egypt be saved from many troubles." ...|$|R
60|$|Quest. But is {{not this}} the way to make Christ to loath us? You know when {{children}} fall down in the dirt, they do usually before they go home make their clothes as clean as they can, for fear their parents should chide them; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> should we.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{would be}} just as good a son as Augustus, only that he has turned out uncommonly badly. I have not the {{slightest}} feeling in the world as to his birth, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> showed pretty plainly. But nothing could stop him in his course, and therefore I told the truth, that's all." [...] In answer to this, Harry found it quite impossible to say a word, but got away to his bedroom and dressed for dinner as quickly as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that is odd, Maud. Both {{mother and}} myself were struck with the resemblance, this evening, {{and we were}} both delighted to see it. Papa is quite {{handsome}}, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is Bob. Mother {{says he is not}} quite as handsome as father was, at his age, but so like him, it is surprising!" ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{love him}} merely {{because he is}} MINE and is MASCULINE. There is no other reason, <b>I</b> suppose. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it is as I first said: {{that this kind of}} love is not a product of reasonings and statistics. It just COMES--none knows whence--and cannot explain itself. And doesn't need to.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I keep {{thinking}} about it. I {{want to do}} what Sue thinks is right, and to see it just in the light she does; and I've told her I would do exactly as she said about it; but now she won't say; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we've got to wait and hear from father. Don't you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In another {{interview}} with Terrorizer magazine, drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz stated {{his thoughts on}} the album saying: [...] "I think working with Erik again has definitely brought things up a little for us. I mean all the band {{were involved in the}} writing process of this album along with Rutan <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this one's a tad more individual than Kill." ...|$|R
6000|$|I humbly {{told you}} many moons ago [...] For high preferment {{you were all}} unfit. A clumsy bear makes but a sorry show [...] Climbing a pole. Let him, judicious, sit [...] With dignity at bottom of his pit, And none his awkwardness will ever know. Some beasts look better, and feel better, too, Seen from above; <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> would you.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{knew you}} would be,' {{continued}} Anita. 'But of course neither of us will want very much done for us if we live a cotter's life with these simple surroundings, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> one man will be quite enough to do for you all you will want done. But of course {{if you think it}} necessary to have two I shall not object.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Paris is {{no place}} for me. I will but {{continue}} to stumble into more and more serious pitfalls. The man-made restrictions are irksome. I feel always that I am a prisoner. I cannot endure it, my friend, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> shall go back to my own jungle, and lead the life that God intended that I should lead when He put me there." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{in another}} interview, Adams did clarify {{that he did}} not dislike Williams, stating [...] "I think Robin himself is compassion, {{generosity}} and funny. <b>I</b> like to <b>think</b> that that's who <b>I</b> am, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he was the only actor I wanted to play me, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he did a fabulous job." [...] Williams also had actively supported St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for several years.|$|R
6000|$|He {{examined}} it with much care, turning {{it up and}} down, {{and looking at the}} seal very attentively. 'All's right, I see; it has the private mark for haste and speed. I bless my Maker that I am no great man, or great man's fellow; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> no more of these passages than just to help them forward in the way of business. You are an utter stranger in these parts, I warrant?' ...|$|R
60|$|I said {{it without}} anger, without heat of any sort: a calm, cold {{statement}} of {{a step that}} it was necessary to take. It was a just measure, the only measure that could mend an unjust situation. <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> she too viewed it. For she did not start, or cry out in horror, or manifest the slightest surprise at my proposal. But she shook her head, and smiled very wistfully.|$|R
5000|$|In a December 2012 AfterElton.com interview, {{director}} Fall {{stated that}} he was very proud of the film, noting that [...] "it was kind of subversive, because it really was an entertaining comedy. But the politics are clear in the movie <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a lot of people watched it as sheer entertainment but there’s an explicit political agenda going on. It was a very clever way, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Kind of a spoonful of sugar thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to revenue," [...] said Rectus, {{just before}} we reached the hotel, [...] "I don't believe these people have much money to give {{for the support of}} a queen, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they ought to bring in provisions. The whole thing might be portioned out. She ought to have so many conchs a week, so many sticks of sugar-cane, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> many yams <b>and</b> other stuff. This might be fixed so that it wouldn't come hard on anybody." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{collaboration}} with SpaceX had ended by 2012. In a 2015 interview, former president Chuck Beames (2014–2016) explained, [...] "SpaceX was a partner, {{and like a}} lot of partnerships, it was just determined that it was best we went our separate ways – different ambitions. We were interested in their engines, but Elon and his team, they’re about going to Mars, and we’re just in a different place, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was a parting of the ways that was amicable".|$|R
60|$|In {{the reign}} of Stephen {{there was a certain}} Roger de Newburg, second Earl of Warwick, who appears to have been an {{exceedingly}} active and public-spirited character; and, besides conquering part of Wales, founded in this neighborhood various priories and hospitals, among which was the house of the Templars, and a hospital for lepers. He made several pilgrimages to Holy Land; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it as likely as most theories that he ought to have the credit of these cedars.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have, I hope, {{received}} full satisfaction by {{the last}} post {{in the matter of}} Marsillac [Marsilly], for my Ld. Arlington has sent to Mr. Montague [English ambassador at Paris] his history all the time he was here, by which you will see how little credit he had here, and that particularly my Lord Arlington was not in his good graces, because he did not receive that satisfaction, in his negotiation, he expected, and that was only in relation to the Swissers, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have said enough of this matter.' ...|$|R
30|$|It {{amazes me}} sometimes, when I sit in our {{collaboration}} {{meetings at the}} ideas that people come up with. And how they can gear their subject towards how other subjects are doing something. Like the migration project. You know how the science teacher was able to tie in the migration of things with the humanities part, and the social studies. And even Spanish. The ideas that come to the table. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> as the year has progressed {{and we got to}} know each other better, the planning has gotten better also.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That will do. You can go,' {{said the}} Emperor, abruptly. Then, when the {{secretary}} {{had left the}} room, he strode across with {{his hands behind his}} back, and he looked me up and down without a word. Though he was a small man himself, he was very fond of having fine-looking fellows about him, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that my appearance gave him pleasure. For my own part, I raised one hand to the salute and held the other upon the hilt of my sabre, looking straight ahead of me, as a soldier should.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{thought you}} meant Miss Graham. Mrs. Bowen is my contemporary, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> of her {{when you said}} young. I should have called her pretty rather than beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Rollo, {{turning back}} to his father, again, [...] "he lent it to me for the whole walk, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> he had any right {{to take it back}} again." ...|$|R
5000|$|Albert James Williams Myers, {{professor}} of Black Studies at the State University of New York at New Paltz remarks, [...] "I think that political officials in Albany and elsewhere within New York felt that since Pinkster was a gathering for Africans {{that perhaps it}} could lead to a revolt <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was really fear of the possibility that something like this could happen that we have to bring it to an end. So {{for all intents and purposes}} Pinkster is a memory, at least the way it was celebrated along the Hudson before 1811." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not unless ordered so to do, Captain. I like a bit {{of hunting}} well enough, but, with all three {{officers}} away, some one should mount guard over the stores <b>and</b> transport, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the dog Pharaoh and I had best stop behind." ...|$|R
