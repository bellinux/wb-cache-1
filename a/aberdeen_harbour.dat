Forty-four locomotives were still in service when the railway was nationalised in 1948, and the last two Great North locomotives to be withdrawn were two of the <b>Aberdeen</b> <b>harbour</b> tanks in 1960. No. 49, Gordon Highlander was restored to Great North green in 1958, although it had not previously carried the green livery as it appeared in Heywood's lined black. It was used on special trains before becoming a static exhibit at the Glasgow Transport Museum in 1965, and is currently on loan to the Scottish Railway Museum at Bo'ness.|$|E

40|$|The {{findings}} of this report {{were thought to be}} a useful contribution to the current knowledge of the quality of <b>Aberdeen</b> <b>Harbours</b> marine environment, and has resulted in a further round of scientific research into the effects of pollution on marine organisms. An integrative approach was used which combined chemical, biological and ecotoxicological indicators to provide evidence of pollution-induced degradation known as Sediment Quality Triad approach. The use of a Sediment Quality Triad approach to develop a single numerical index to describe the condition of the benthic ecosystem is a useful methodology in demonstrating spatial and temporal variability in marine sediment quality. The appropriate graphic representation of the Triad data can be effective in displaying relationships between patterns of toxicity, biology and chemistry. However the selection of the weighting tool for normalisation does effect the components and subsequently its use as a screening tool should be site or region specific, and not generic. There is a further need to be evaluating the use of sub-lethal toxicity tests and responses relative to changes the benthic community structure and sensitivity to contaminants, particularly in relation to interactions between multiple chemicals. These results show the value of using multi-component parameters for evaluating sediment quality. The combination of field and laboratory studies of sediment quality therefore can an important measure of the relationship between sediment and food-web magnification, and are therefore crucial signposts for hazard identification in marine sediments.

5000|$|Aberdeen {{is known}} as the [...] "Granite City" [...] and is renowned for its gothic architecture. It is a city of {{approximately}} 210,000 people and serves as the main administrative centre for the north-east of Scotland. With its large port and <b>harbour,</b> <b>Aberdeen</b> serves as the departure point for the many ferries that connect the Scottish mainland with the Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland. Aberdeen also has two universities, and a large student population.|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} project, co-ordinated by the University of Aberdeen and The Sea Watch Foundation, was to {{describe}} spatial and temporal trends in cetacean occurrence along the south Aberdeenshire coastline and to identify any environmental factors that may be influencing distribution. The most frequently sighted cetacean was the bottlenose dolphin and previous work confirmed that these animals {{are part of the}} population known to reside in the Moray Firth. The entrance to the River Dee (Aberdeen) is highlighted as an important feeding area for these dolphins. Bottlenose dolphins were frequently sighted in the coastal waters south of Aberdeen and these groups tended to be larger and of animals that were primarily travelling, as opposed to the foraging groups observed at <b>Aberdeen.</b> The <b>harbour</b> porpoise was the second most frequently cetacean during this study. They were sighted all along the coast in all months of the year, although notably, they were not recorded during the land-surveys at Aberdeen during the winter. Tidal height and sea depth appears to have a strong influence on where and when porpoises were sighted and it is thought this is a reflection of prey behaviour. The third species examined was the white-beaked dolphin. This is a seasonal visitor to the coastal waters around Aberdeen with all sightings occurring during the summer. Seabed depth and slope influence the distribution of this species within the study area and again, this was thought to related to prey distribution. Stomach content analysis highlighted haddock and whiting as being important in the diet of this species in Scottish water. Sea temperature was highlighted as influencing white-beaked dolphin group size, with smaller groups being recorded at higher temperatures. Analysis of the stranding database also suggested that higher sea temperature restricts the distribution of this species around the UK. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

25|$|<b>Aberdeen</b> <b>Harbour</b> is the harbour between Aberdeen (town) and Ap Lei Chau, {{and is one}} of {{the nine}} {{harbours}} in Hong Kong. It is known for its view and is a popular tourist spot. During the fishing moratorium and typhoon weather, the Aberdeen Typhoon Shelters have provided a parking spot for fishing vessels owned by local fishermen.|$|E
25|$|It {{was used}} for the {{carriage}} {{of a wide variety of}} cargo, and passenger services were also introduced. These proved popular, and two boats a day made the journey during the summer months, with one in the winter. They gradually faced competition from the adjacent turnpike road, which was quicker but more expensive. A connecting lock was built in 1834, to enable boats to enter <b>Aberdeen</b> <b>harbour,</b> which eased the problem of transhipping goods to larger vessels. The canal normally closed between December and March each year, due to icing.|$|E

Although producers also intended to establish a filming location {{in one of the}} many casinos in Macau, the Jumbo Floating Restaurant in Hong Kong's <b>Aberdeen</b> <b>Harbour</b> was used instead for the casino setting, as filming within the vicinity of a gambling establishment is prohibited by law. To move the equipment for the casino scenes to the on-the-water location, producers hired a number of locals to carry out the task, as they were accustomed to [...] "using sampans like trucks".

Scottish cathedrals now survived only if they were used as parish churches and as Elgin had been fully served by the Kirk of St Giles, its cathedral was abandoned. An act of parliament passed on 14 February 1567 authorised Regent Lord James Stewart's Privy Council to order {{the removal of the}} lead from the roofs of both Elgin and Aberdeen cathedrals, to be sold for the upkeep of his army, but the overladen ship that was intended to take the cargo to Holland capsized and sank in <b>Aberdeen</b> <b>harbour.</b> In 1615, John Taylor, the 'Water Poet', described Elgin Cathedral as [...] "a faire and beautiful church with three steeples, the walls of it and the steeples all yet standing; but the roofes, windowes and many marble monuments and tombes of honourable and worthie personages all broken and defaced".|$|E
500|$|William Pickersgill {{replaced}} Johnson in 1894, {{and between}} 1895 and 1898 twenty-six new locomotives were purchased from Neilsons.

A further order for ten was placed in 1899, but train mileage had been reduced and five were sold to the South Eastern & Chatham Railway. Pickersgill saw the works move from Kittybrewster to Inverurie before Thomas Heywood took over in 1914, {{three months before the}} outbreak of war. The railway took over the working of the <b>Aberdeen</b> <b>harbour</b> railway and in 1915 purchased four 0-4-2 tank locomotives from Manning Wardle. After the war, six more locomotives were built in 1920 by the North British Locomotive Company, and two locomotives the following year at Inverurie. Similar to the 1899 locomotives but with Robinson superheaters, these were given names. Heywood changed the livery during the war, and the traditional green being replaced by black lined with yellow and red.|$|E
500|$|The first {{locomotives}} were 2-4-0 tender engines, {{built by}} Wm Fairbairn in Manchester {{to the design}} of the locomotive superintendent Daniel Kinnear Clark. Twelve were ordered for the opening of the first line, seven passenger and five goods. They were all fitted with Clark's patent smoke preventing system that improved fuel economy and painted green with black borders, and red buffer beams. There was no protection for the driver or fireman and braking was by wooden blocks on the four wheels of the tender. The railway opened with only five locomotives, and within days one had been seriously damaged in the collision at [...] and a second had a mechanical fault. Two more locomotives had arrived by the end of 1854, and the order was complete by summer 1855. Four more passenger locomotives were ordered in 1857, weatherboards and sanding equipment had been fitted by 1860, and cabs added in the 1880s. John Folds Ruthven replaced Clark in 1855 and an order was placed with Beyer, Peacock & Co. for two 0-4-0 tank engines to bank trains on the line to Waterloo near <b>Aberdeen</b> <b>harbour.</b> After William Cowan became locomotive superintendent nine more locomotives arrived in 1859–61. These were followed by nine 4-4-0s, also built by R. Stephenson & Co., and delivered between 1862 and 1864. Six more powerful 4-4-0 locomotives arrived from Neilsons in 1866, and were fitted with a more modern bogie. Three passed to the London and North Eastern Railway after the 1923 Grouping, and No. 45 hauled a train at the Railway Centenary celebrations in 1925 before being scrapped.|$|E
