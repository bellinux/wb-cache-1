5|$|Concurrent {{programming}} languages, libraries, APIs, {{and parallel}} programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP {{are two of the}} most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API. One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where one part of <b>a</b> <b>program</b> promises to deliver a required datum to another part of <b>a</b> <b>program</b> at some future time.|$|E

5|$|Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain either <b>a</b> <b>program</b> {{instruction}} or data. In <b>a</b> <b>program</b> instruction, bits 0–12 represented the memory {{address of the}} operand to be used, and bits 13–15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16bits were unused. The SSEM's single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only {{the address of the}} data in memory.|$|E

50|$|In computing, <b>a</b> <b>programming</b> {{language}} specification (or standard or definition) is a documentation artifact {{that defines}} <b>a</b> <b>programming</b> language so that users and implementors {{can agree on}} what programs in that language mean. Specifications are typically detailed and formal, and primarily used by implementors, with users referring to them in case of ambiguity; the C++ specification is frequently cited by users, for instance, due to the complexity. Related documentation includes <b>a</b> <b>programming</b> language reference, which is intended expressly for users, and <b>a</b> <b>programming</b> language rationale, which explains why the specification is written as it is; these are typically more informal than a specification.|$|R
