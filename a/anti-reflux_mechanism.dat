40|$|EDITORIAL sYNoPsis Evidence has {{previously}} been advanced in favour of the <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism</b> at the cardia being a mechanical process analogous to the 'flutter valve ' and {{this study suggests that}} a similar mechanism is responsible for preserving anal continence. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a hypothesis about how we achieve anal continence, yet, given appropriate circumstances, can defaecate at will. The hypothesis arises directly out of a study of the <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism</b> at the cardia (Edwards, 1961, 1963), since similar problems and control mechan-isms seem to exist at both these exits from the abdomen. The mechanism of defaecation has been thought mainly to involve the contraction of the lower colon and the rectum, aided by an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Conversely, continence ha...|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain a}} new {{insight into the}} <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the ureterovesical {{junction}} by studying the topographical anatomy of the juxta- and intravesical ureter {{and its relationship to}} the surrounding bladder musculature. Fresh pig bladders were fixed, frozen and serially sectioned. Enzyme histochemistry was performed to demonstrate tissue acetyl- and butyryl- (non-specific) cholinesterase. Smooth muscle cells were identified by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal anti-alpha actin smooth muscle antibody. Three-dimensional computer reconstructions of the different muscle groups of the bladder and ureterovesical junction were generated. On the basis of expression patterns of the cholinesterase isozymes, five different groups of muscles were identified: the detrusor, the muscularis mucosae of the bladder, the muscle layer of the intravesical ureter and the separate inner and outer muscular layers of the pelvic ureter. No separate ureteric sheath was identified. There appeared to be few or no (muscular) connections between the ureter and the bladder musculature. The muscle layer of the ureter ended beneath the mucosa of the bladder, without extension into the trigone. The submucosal section of the ureter was very short, although its length was thought to be of importance in the <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Examination using enzyme histochemistry demonstrated a muscularis mucosae in the bladder which was absent from the trigon...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{vesicoureteral reflux}} (VUR) {{is a common}} {{pediatric}} condition due to a developmental defect in the ureterovesical junction. The prevalence of VUR among individuals with connective tissue disorders, {{as well as the}} importance of the ureter and bladder wall musculature for the <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism,</b> suggest that defects in the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the ureterovesical junction may result in VUR. This review will discuss the function of the smooth muscle and its supporting ECM microenvironment with respect to VUR, and explore the association of VUR with mutations in ECM-related genes...|$|E
40|$|Infant apnea is {{a common}} problem that conveys {{significant}} burden to families and physicians. Its temporal relationship with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is controversial. Aim: To establish whether infants with GER of different magnitude have {{a higher incidence of}} respiratory events than children without GER. Patients and Methods: 146 consecutive patients were evaluated with polisomnography (PSG) and with an esophageal pH probe. Those infants without GER episodes or with an esophageal pH below 4. 0 in less than 5 % of total sleep time were considered as physiologic GER (Group I), between 5 - 10 % as mild GER (Group II), and over 10 % as severe GER (Group III). These groups were evaluated for demographic and polysomnographic characteristics. Results: There were no differences in the demographic and global PSG characteristics neither in oxymetry, heart rate or electroencephalographic abnormalities. Group III infants had a higher percentage of active sleep compared to infants of Group I (p < 0. 05) and higher incidence of central pauses and apneas compared to infants of Group I (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: The presence of severe GER may modify the sleep pattern in infants, increasing the percentage of active sleep. The presence of central pauses and apneas in infants with severe GER suggest an association between the inmaturity of the respiratory centers and the adaptation of the <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (Rev Méd Chile 2003; 131 : 1143 - 50) ...|$|R

40|$|Concerning the ureterovesical {{junction}} – {{the region}} {{most important for}} the <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism</b> – {{there is still a}} lot of misunderstanding and misinterpretation with regard to normal fetal development. Data are scarce on possible causes of primary vesicoureteral reflux and on involved mechanisms of the so-called maturation process of refluxing ureteral endings. The ratio of the intravesical ureteral length to the ureteral diameter is obviously lower than assumed so far, as clearly revealed by some studies. Therefore it can be doubted that the length and course of the intravesical ureter is of sole importance in the prevention of reflux. Additionally refluxing intravesical ureteral endings present with dysplasia, atrophy, and architectural derangement of smooth muscle fibers. Besides, a pathologically increased matrix remodeling combined with deprivation of the intramural nerve supply has been confirmed. Consequently, symmetrical narrowing of the very distal ureteral smooth muscle coat creating the active valve mechanism to defend reflux is not achievable. It is apparent that primary congenital vesicoureteral reflux seems {{to be the result of}} an abnormality within the ureterovesical junction with an insufficient muscular wrap. Nature is believed to establish much more sophisticated mechanisms than the so-called passive <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Remodeling processes within the ureterovesical junction of refluxing ureteral endings support that maturation itself is nothing else than wound or defect healing and not a restitution of a morphological normal ureterovesical junction. Lacking the nerve supply a restoration of any muscular structure can not be achieved...|$|E
30|$|In 2005, we {{published}} {{our early}} results in 58 patients undergoing RC and OBS with the N-shaped ileal neobladder, {{with a mean}} follow-up of 38  months (Joniau et al. 2005). We now report a series of 119 consecutive patients and describe long-term experience with the Leuven N-pouch technique, creating an ileal pouch with an isoperistaltic afferent limb onto which both ureters are anastomosed in an end-to-end fashion. This technique combines features of the popular Hautmann and Studer neobladders, creating a good-capacity pouch with an active <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism</b> (Hautmann et al. 1988; Studer et al. 1989). The aim of this retrospective study was primarily to assess our long-term experience in terms of complication rates and continence.|$|E
40|$|Only 18 or 83 {{patients}} who had had a cardiomyotomy for achalasia could be induced to reflux barium. Mucosal herniation through the myotomy was shown in most by radiography. Perfusion manometry showed a higher pressure zone in the oesophagogastric junction region in 22 of 24 patients studied. This high pressure zone responded to an increment in abdominal pressure by a greater increment. The same response was seen in a patient with a small hiatal hernia and myotomy. We concluded that the persisting high pressure zone seen by perfusion manometry {{is likely to be}} caused by the hiatus, and that the hiatus rather than the sphincter is likely to be responsible for the incremental response of the high pressure zone to increased abdominal pressure. The <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism</b> after cardiomyotomy {{is more likely to be}} the hiatal mechanism than persisting sphincter fibres...|$|E
40|$|Some of the {{features}} of the syndrome, the mechanism of symptom production, and the role of radiology in diagnosis are defined. Current theories of the <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism</b> and recent concepts of the patho-logical changes involved are described. Definitions Hiatal herniation {{is the result of the}} capacity to herniate. In most people found to have a hiatal hernia by radiology or at operation, most of the time the stomach is not herniated into the chest. Herniation is intermittent and only occurs when the subject gets into certain positions or increases intra-abdominal pressure. This form will be missed at fluoroscopy unless the appropriate challenge is applied. Sometimes part of the stomach remains in the chest when the subject stands up, and more herniates when he lies down or bends over. This is continuous herniation which is infrequently missed at fluoroscopy. Reflux is the flow of gastric contents into the oesophagus and the capacity to reflux depends on the competency of the <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism</b> which may be intermittently or continuously incompetent. Intermittent incompetence means that, most of the time, the antireflux mechanism prevents reflux when challenged, but intermittently and momentarily the mechanism fails and reflux may then occur if cir-cumstances are right. We know that reflux occurs because we can taste gastric contents or we can de-tect it with a pH electrode in the oesophagus, but unless we happen to X-ray the subject at the precise moment that the antireflux mechanism becomes incompetent, we shall not see barium enter the oesophagus. Intermittent incompetence with reflux occurs when the subject is standing, sitting, or lying, and is not provoked by lying or rolling over or bending. When symptoms occur as a result of the reflux, they are particularly troublesome after fatty foods and for this reason I have called intermittent incompetence the 'Hot Fat Heartburn syndrome'. If the antireflux mechanism is continuously in-competent it will fail at any time if challenged, s...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Evaluate {{the initial}} {{experience}} of laparoscopic ureteral reimplant for ureteral stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to June 2008, 10 patients underwent 11 laparoscopic reconstruction surgeries for ureteral stenosis. Seven cases of stenosis of the distal ureter, {{two at the}} level of iliac vessels, a case of bilateral distal stenosis and one in the medium third. Eight ureteroneocystotomies were performed by extravesical technique with <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism,</b> two cases of vesical reimplant with Boari technique and one case using the psoas hitch technique. RESULTS: The average surgical time was 166 minutes (115 - 245 min), mean blood loss was 162 mL (100 - 210 mL) and the average hospital stay was 2. 9 days (2 - 4 days). There were two complications: a lesion of the sigmoid colon identified peroperatively and treated with laparoscopic sutures with good evolution, and a case of ureteral stone obstruction at the 30 th day postoperative, treated by laser ureterolitotripsy. All patients had resolution of the stenosis at an average follow-up period of 18 months (3 - 54 months). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery represents a feasible, safe and low morbidity technique for ureteral reimplant in ureteral stenosis...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori is {{the major}} cause of {{gastritis}} and duodenitis, and {{is responsible for the}} majority of gastric and duodenal ulcers. It is thought that H. pylori may have a benign influence in the prevention of reflux esophagitis and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is due to failure of the gastro-esophageal <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism,</b> thus allowing gastric acid to damage the esophageal mucosa, but the main abnormalities may also be found in the stomach and duodenum. The recently decreased prevalence of H. pylori has led to a lower incidence of duodenal ulcer and gastric carcinoma, but increasing acid secretion resulted in an increase in GERD. Eradication of H. pylori does not aggravate the symptoms of GERD and also does not induce the development of GERD in the normal population or in patients with duodenal ulcer. Pharmacological suppression of acid secretion is more effective in patients infected with H. pylori in comparison to non-infected individuals. The evidence on the efficacy of acid suppression therapy and its association with H. pylori infection is still contradictory. The sharply differing opinions regarding the role or association of H. pylori infection with GERD have not been reconciled and contradictory study results are still widespread...|$|E
40|$|Swallowing, voice disorders, throat {{discomfort}} and subjective neck discomfort are usually reported by {{patients with a}} known thyroid nodule and are correlated to nodular thyroid disease itself. Moreover, in endemic goitrous areas, total thyroidectomy (TT) is the most frequently performed surgical procedure. We are used to relate swallowing, voice and throat discomfort to the mechanical effects of nodular goiter or to thyroidectomy itself, but in both these cases the relationship between symptoms and the thyroid mass or its removal is not always clear or easily demonstrated. How can we explain the persistence of local neck symptoms after TT? And how can TT worsen the dysphagic or dysphonic disorders attributed to the goiter’s effect over the surrounding structures? During these years, many articles have analyzed {{the relationship between the}} thyroid disease and the laryngopharyngeal reflux, finding more and more evidences of their consensuality, leading to important new management considerations and notable medico-legal implications; if the reason of local neck symptoms is not the thyroid disease, we have to study and specially cure the reflux disease, with specific test and drugs. Therefore, the aim of our study, relying on the published literature, was to investigate how, in demonstrated presence of reflux laryngopharyngitis in patients with nodular goiter and local neck symptoms before and after uncomplicated TT, the surgery could influence our <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism</b> analyzing the anatomical connection as well as the functional coordination; can we play a part in the post-operative persistence of swallowing and voice alterations and throat discomfort...|$|E
40|$|Antenatal hydronephrosis and {{vesicoureteral reflux}} (VUR) are common renal tract birth defects. We {{recently}} showed that {{disruption of the}} Robo 2 gene is associated with VUR in humans and antenatal hydronephrosis in knockout mice. However, the natural history, causal relationship and developmental origins of these clinical conditions remain largely unclear. Although the hydronephrosis phenotype in Robo 2 knockout mice {{has been attributed to}} the coexistence of ureteral reflux and obstruction in the same mice, this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally. Here we used noninvasive high- resolution micro-ultrasonography and pathological analysis to follow the progression of antenatal hydronephrosis in individual Robo 2 -deficient mice from embryo to adulthood. We found that hydronephrosis progressed continuously after birth with no spontaneous resolution. With the use of a microbubble ultrasound contrast agent and ultrasound-guided percutaneous aspiration, we demonstrated that antenatal hydronephrosis in Robo 2 -deficient mice is caused by high-grade VUR resulting from a dilated and incompetent ureterovesical junction rather than ureteral obstruction. We further documented Robo 2 expression around the developing ureterovesical junction and identified early dilatation of ureteral orifice structures as a potential fetal origin of antenatal hydronephrosis and VUR. Our results thus demonstrate that Robo 2 is crucial for the formation of a normal ureteral orifice and for the maintenance of an effective <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This study also establishes a reproducible genetic mouse model of progressive antenatal hydronephrosis and primary high- grade VUR.

40|$|In the {{literature}} {{it is generally}} assumed that venous reflux within the radicular veins is prevented {{by the presence of}} bicuspid valves and narrowing of the transdural part of these vessels. Recently, we performed a human cadaver study of the internal vertebral venous plexus. Surprisingly, a large number of radicular and perimedullary veins appeared to be filled with Araldite CY 221 mixture, after injection of this material into the vertebral venous system, implicating reflux via the radicular veins and suggesting insufficiency of the presumed <b>anti-reflux</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Therefore, it was decided to study the radicular veins in order to determine and to investigate {{the presence or absence of}} anti-reflux mechanisms within this system. The vertebral venous systems of ten fresh human cadavers, between 64 and 93 years of age, were injected with Araldite CY 221 mixture. After polymerization, all cadavers were dissected and the spinal nerve sheaths, including nerve roots, radicular veins and epidural veins, were excised as a whole. After macroscopical examination, serial sections (40 microm) were cut on a freezing microtome and stained in Von Gieson medium. Every third section was stained immunohistochemically with smooth muscle antigen (SMA), to visualize smooth muscle cells. In all cadavers, a number of intradural radicular veins was filled with Araldite. Employing microscopical examination, no bicuspid valves were found. However, four structures were encountered that might serve as ananti-reflux-mechanism: 1) intravenous dural folds, 2) meandrous configuration, and 3) narrowing of the radicular veins at the point of penetration of the dura mater, and 4) varying numbers of smooth muscle fibers in the walls of the intradural and extradural parts of the radicular veins. Reflux via the radicular veins seems to be a physiological phenomenon. Structural valves have not been encountered during this study. Intravenous dural folds, meandrous configuration and narrowing of the transdural part of the radicular veins, and the presence of large numbers of smooth muscle cells in the radicular venous walls suggest the existence of a dynamic reflux-regulating system that has the ability to increase the intravascular resistance under conditions of venous hyperpression, in order to protect the spinal cord from venous pressure waves. Possibly, venous reflux via the radicular veins has a role in selective cooling of the spinal cord...|$|E
