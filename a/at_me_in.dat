500|$|I am a {{defeated}} {{and ruined}} war captive, that's it! The former emperor [...] treated me generously, but I betrayed him. In my present defeat, Heaven has vented its fury <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>In</b> the past I {{have heard that}} Han law stipulates that executions of men be {{carried out in the}} city marketplace. When we arrive in the capital, I request to Zhaling [...] to atone for my crimes to the former emperor. This is my sincere desire.|$|E
500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E

In a way, you could say that Jolson was my {{earliest}} influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped {{into the living room and}} announced to the adults, who were staring <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} with George Stephanopoulos, Obama said, [...] "I think {{that over the}} last {{two and a half years}} there's been an effort to go <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a way that is politically expedient in the short-term for Republicans, but creates, I think a problem for them when they want to actually run in a general election where most people feel pretty confident the President was born where he says he was, in Hawaii. He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. And so ... I think it presents a problem for them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Webb {{also stated}} that Deschanel's {{character}}, Summer, {{is based on a}} stock character type; [...] "Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase." [...] Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. [...] "I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. One of the things I love about 500 Days of Summer is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny".|$|E
2500|$|Judge left {{no record}} of the period before the {{founding}} of the Theosophical Society but some of his published statements reveal the character of his relationship with Blavatsky during this period. On the occasion of her death in 1891, he referred to their first meeting in her rooms in January 1875. He wrote:"It was her eye that attracted me, the eye of one whom I must have known in lives long passed away. She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> recognition for that first hour, and never since has that look changed. Not as a questioner of philosophies did I come before her, not as one groping in the dark for lights that schools and fanciful theories had obscured, but as one who, wandering through the corridors of life, was seeking the friends who could show where the designs for the work had been hidden. And, true to the call, she responded, revealing plans once again, and speaking no words to explain, simply pointed them out and went on with the task. It was as if but the evening before we had parted, leaving yet to be done some detail of a task taken up with one common end; it was teacher and pupil, elder brother and younger, both bent on the one single end, but she with the power and knowledge that belong but to lions and sages." ...|$|E

60|$|He sat {{for some}} time without looking <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> lost <b>in</b> his own thoughts. Then he rose on a sudden and took his hat.|$|R
60|$|I {{could see}} that if I took my eye off {{him for a moment}} he might spring <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> gas <b>in</b> hand, and {{throttle}} me.|$|R
