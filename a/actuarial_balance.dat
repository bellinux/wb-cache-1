As a result, many policymakers and budget analysts {{are concerned about the}} continued viability of entitlement programs such as Social Security. The Social Security trustees' economic growth projections receive considerable attention because many people believe that higher growth would significantly improve the program's <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> (that is, reduce its actuarial deficit). This belief is validated by Social Security trustees' calculations that show larger 75 -year actuarial balances under faster assumed real wage growth rates. Since 2003 the trustees have reported the program's <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> measured in perpetuity. But they do not provide sensitivity analysis that examines the impact of various assumptions on the infinite-term <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance.</b> This paper shows analytically that faster wage growth may reduce Social Security's infinite-term <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> if the ratio of workers to retirees continues to decline rapidly beyond the 75 th year. This result holds even if the decline in that ratio ceases after just two decades beyond the 75 th year. The paper reports stylized calculations of the impact of real wage growth and demographic changeincluding time-varying rates of change based on official projections for the U. S. economyon Social Security's <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> in a multi-period setting. Finally, the Social Security and Accounts Simulator (SSASIM) actuarial model of Social Security financing is used to estimate the degree to which increased wage growth could negatively affect the system's infinite-term <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance.</b> These results raise questions about the conventional wisdom that holds that improved wage growth would affect Social Security's financing, and how a widely used measure of Social Security's financing captures those effects...|$|E
40|$|Most of {{the recent}} claims that Social Security faces major {{financial}} challenges {{in the years ahead}} rely on the recognition that the US population is aging. Indeed, the coming wave of baby-boomer retirements plays a continuing role in calls for 'reform' of the program. However, the general aging of the population ensures that the problem will not go away even when that generation passes on. This paper focuses on the demographic trends facing the US (and world) —why is the population aging, and how fast? Will this lead to an intolerable burden on future generations of workers? While most of the public discussion focuses on Social Security's long-term finances, what really matters is whether the economy will be able to produce a sufficient quantity of real goods and services to provide for both workers and dependents in, say, the year 2080. If it cannot, then regardless of Social Security's finances, the real living standards of Americans in 2080 will have to be lower than they are today. Any reforms to Social Security made today should focus on increasing the economy's capacity to produce real goods and services, rather than on ensuring positive <b>actuarial</b> <b>balances.</b> It will be demonstrated that projected demographic changes are surprisingly modest, and can be accommodated at a measured pace with fairly small policy reforms. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{pay-as-you-go}} (PAYG) {{pension system}} requires {{a balance between}} the benefits paid to pensioners and the contributions made by active workers. The decline in fertility rates and the increase in longevity in China will lead to a substantial increase in the old-age dependency ratio, raising serious concerns about the long-term sustainability of the Chinese pension system. This thesis provides the first estimate of the sustainability of the Chinese PAYG pension system in urban areas and is based on two <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> methodologies. The first is the Swedish solvency ratio, which is based on verifiable facts. The second is the United States’ <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> indicator, which takes into account projected demographic and economic structures. Both methodologies show that the Chinese pension system, in its current form, is unsustainable. Two factors, namely the one-child policy and the urbanization process, that affect the sustainability of the Chinese pension system are analysed. Population projections under different demographic structures are provided using the cohort component method, and an automatic balancing mechanism is designed in order to restore the sustainability of this pension system. The main finding is that the one-child policy is harmful to the system’s sustainability. Furthermore, all scenarios studied show there is an urgent need to introduce mechanisms that will guarantee long-term sustainability of the system. The analysis of the urbanization process shows that demographic changes due to rural-urban migration will have an enormous impact on the Chinese PAYG pension system. Contrary to the current public hypothesis that a huge inflow of a working-age population will restore the demographic balance between contributors and pensioners, the rapid urbanization process will result in a higher old-age dependency ratio after 2050. Overall, urbanization worsens the long-term sustainability of the Chinese pension system...|$|E

The interaction of this distribution with the age distribution of taxes minus benefits determines the steady state financial consequences of mortality decline. Second, examination of past mortality trends in the United State and of international trends in low mortality populations, suggests that mortality will decline much faster than foreseen by the SSA's forecasts. Third, based on work on stochastic demographic forecasting, stochastic forecasts of the system's <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> are derived, indicating a broader range of demographic uncertainty than in the latest SSA forecasts, and a relatively greater contribution to uncertainty from fertility than mortality. ...|$|E

The study concludes that there no basis for expecting a consistent difference between the rate of consumer price inflation and that for the overall economy as measured by the GDP price deflator. However, because of differences in the methods of computing the two price indexes, the growth in the CPI-W can be expected to exceed the increase in the GDP deflator by about 0. 2 percent per year.

Some of these reforms would not achieve zero <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance.</b> This analysis also calculates for various age cohorts the amount of savings that would need to be accumulated in order to purchase a payout annuity (an insurance product that provides regular stream of income for life) that would compensate for the decrease in benefits from these alternatives, relative to current-law benefits. The Social Security reform options examined would cut benefits, more so for the young—Because various Social Security reform alternatives would phase in benefit reductions, the cuts for younger cohorts of workers would be larger than the cuts that middle-age or older workers would experience. For example, the benefit cuts for the 1962 cohort would range from a $ 300 decrease in annual benefits for beneficiaries with the smallest benefits to about $ 3, 000 for those with the highest benefits.

Many observers took the report's extension of the trust fund's solvency one year to 2042 to mean that Social Security's financial health had improved. In fact, Social Security's <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> declined and its cash flow deficits over the next 75 years increased to $ 25. 33 trillion (in 2003 dollars).

The {{publicly}} managed pension system in Turkey is currently {{run by the}} pay-asyou-go (PAYG) scheme, using contributions out of wage/salary incomes of currently active workers to finance pension benefits to retirees. The expenditure-revenue balances of a PAYG-based scheme {{are determined by the}} existing configuration of system parameters: the contribution rate which defines the rate at which a worker’s payroll/wage is contributed to the pension scheme; the replacement rate which defines the rate at which average income earned during the working phase of life cycle is replaced by the pension income, and the entitlement age which controls the relative sizes of workers and retirees covered. After the system began to generate huge losses starting from {{the first half of the}} 1990 s, the government was forced to introduce a parametric reform act in 1999 so as to curb pension deficits by adjusting the values of pension parameters. This thesis considers SSK, the largest pension fund in Turkey, and develops a numerical optimization framework in order to identify the configurations of pension parameters that i) will minimize the deterioration in the economic well-beings of the generations that will face reform parameters, relative to the economic well-being of generations that faced/will continue to face the pre-reform parameters and ii) maintain, at the same time, the <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> of the system over 1995 - 2060 period.

40|$|The President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security {{proposed}} three reform plans. Two, analyzed here, restore <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> in {{the absence}} of individual accounts. One achieves this balance solely through benefit reductions. The other uses new dedicated revenue to cover one-third of the actuarial deficit, reducing benefits to close the rest. Both plans cut disability and young survivor benefits in step with retirement benefits, while bolstering benefits for long-career low earners and surviving spouses with low benefits. The plans both include voluntary individual accounts that replace part of the scaled-back Social Security system. Payroll taxes are diverted to the accounts and one of the plans also requires a (subsidized) add-on contribution for those choosing accounts. Under both models, any payroll tax deposited in an individual account is also recorded in a 'liability account' for the worker. The liability account tracks the diverted payroll revenue (with interest) and is paid off by reducing traditional benefits. The individual accounts are subsidized through a sub-market interest rate on the liability accounts. This subsidy worsens the financial position of the Trust Fund. The accounts also create a cash-flow problem. Consequently, by themselves, the individual accounts make Social Security's solvency problems worse both in the short run and over the long run. To offset the adverse impact of the accounts, the plans call for large transfers of general revenues (despite substantial projected budget deficits). If all (two-thirds of) eligible workers opted for the accounts, the new revenues required over the next 75 years would amount to between 1. 2 and 1. 5 (0. 8 and 1. 1) percent of payroll. Holding the disabled harmless from the benefit reductions would raise the required transfers to between 1. 5 and 1. 7 (1. 1 and 1. 3) percent of payroll (compared to a projected actuarial deficit of 1. 9 percent of payroll under current law). Despite requiring this much general revenue relative to paying scheduled benefits, the plans would produce significant reductions in expected combined benefits. At the end of 75 years, however, assets in the accounts would amount to between 53 and 66 (35 and 44) percent of GDP, and the value to Social Security of the accumulated liabilities that reduce later benefits would amount to more than 20 (15) percent of GDP. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the financial}} impact of Social Security by age cohort under alternative assumptions concerning future financing of Social Security. It examines the Social Security Administration's intermediate IIB and various combinations of optimistic and pessimistic assumptions concerning fertility, mortality, and wage growth. Importantly, it examines {{the implications of}} alternative potential resolutions of the long-term financing deficit and scenarios concerning the planned systematic deviation from pay-as-you-go finance in the retirement and disability funds. The {{results suggest that the}} Social Security retirement program offers vastly different returns to households in different circumstances, and especially to different cohorts. Most important, if Social Security does not maintain the large retirement trust fund surplus currently projected for the next 30 years, alternative scenarios for return to pay-as-you-go finance differ dramatically in the taxes, benefits, transfers, and real rates of return that can be offered to different birth cohorts. The implications of cutting taxes, raising benefits or diverting the surplus to other purposes have dramatic impact on the overall financial status of the system, the time pattern of taxes, benefits and surpluses or deficits, and therefore, the treatment of different age cohorts. Under the intermediate assumptions, the OASDI surplus is projected to grow almost as large as a fraction of GNP as the current ratio of privately held national debt to GNP. For example, if the OASDI surplus is used to raise benefits, and they remained at higher levels thereafter {{during the height of the}} baby-boom generation's retirement, the long-run actuarial deficit will zoom from $ 500 billion to over $ 3 trillion. Correspondingly, if benefits increase, financed by the OASDI surplus over the next 30 years, the expected rate of return on lifetime contributions increases for those currently about 40 years old from 1. 9 % to 2. 7 %, about a 40 % increase. Correspondingly, if the surplus is dissipated and the subsequent long-run deficit is made up with a tax increase on a pay-as-you-go basis at the time of the projected deficit, the rate of return relative to the intermediate assumptions for those persons now being born will fall by about 158, and in this case, the overall system finances would move from a long-run actuarial deficit of slightly under one-half percent of taxable payroll to <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance.</b> Thus, as Social Security is projected to deviate systematically from pay-as-you-go finance, the potential alternative scenarios with respect to accruing the surplus and/or dissipating it in various ways have potentially large intergenerational redistribution effects. ...|$|E

Conclui-se que os entes previdenciÃrios deficitÃrios nÃo oferecem sistema de estrutura para o acÃmulo de recursos para o pagamento de compromissos definidos nos planos de benefÃcios. The Brazilian legal system, {{starting from}} 1998 {{revealed that the}} federative states and municipalities could migrate from the General Provident Fund Scheme (RGPS), headed by the INSS, for its Own Social Security System (RPPS) taking care to financial contributions necessary for the harmony of <b>actuarial</b> <b>balance</b> to ensure in the future payment of benefits to those eligible (work force included in pension schemes), so that the 5, 509 Brazilian municipalities, 1, 957 have instituted their RPPS and 55 towns in State of CearÃ, the existing 184. The main objective {{of this research was}} to determine the actuarial results of RPPS established in municipalities of CearÃ through a software built by the author and confront him with the actuarial results contained in the statements of income of the Actuarial Reviews - DRRA 's. According to the calculations the CearÃ municipal RPPS present actuarial deficit in the amount of R $ 3, 361, 632, 976. 77, while the value of actuarial results demonstrated in the present DRAA 's actuarial deficit of R $ 10, 344, 705, 187. 76.
