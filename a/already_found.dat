5|$|Longrich {{observed}} that another newly described genus, Tatankaceratops, displayed a strange mix of characteristics <b>already</b> <b>found</b> in adult and juvenile Triceratops. Rather than representing a distinct genus, Tatankaceratops could as easily represent a dwarf Triceratops or a Triceratops individual with a developmental disorder that {{caused it to}} stop growing prematurely.|$|E
5|$|MHL pares {{down the}} three TMDS {{channels}} {{in a standard}} HDMI connection to a single one running over any connector that provides at least five pins. This allows existing connectors that are <b>already</b> <b>found</b> in mobile devices – such as micro-USB – to be utilized, avoiding the need to add additional dedicated video output sockets. The USB port switches to MHL mode when it detects a compatible device is connected.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Detours had become the Who, they had <b>already</b> <b>found</b> regular gigs, {{including}} at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square. They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for Fontana Records. Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not {{speak to each other}} again for 14 years.|$|E

5|$|Rather {{than going}} to war, Helmichis, Rosamund and their {{followers}} escaped to Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine Italy, where they were received with full honours by the authorities. Once in Ravenna, Rosamund was persuaded by the Byzantine prefect Longinus to kill Helmichis {{in order to be}} free to marry him. Rosamund proceeded to poison Helmichis, but the latter, having understood what his wife had done to him, forced her to drink the cup too, so both of them died. After their deaths, Longinus dispatched Helmichis' forces to Constantinople, while the remaining Lombards had <b>already</b> <b>found</b> a new king in Cleph.|$|E
25|$|On his {{relationships}} with Cyrille Guimard and Bernard Hinault, Fignon {{said that with}} Bernard Hinault, Guimard <b>already</b> <b>found</b> a champion, whereas with himself, Guimard made him a champion. Therefore, his bond with Guimard was stronger than Hinault's bond with Guimard.|$|E
25|$|In July 1910, Blake married Avis Elizabeth Cecelia Lee (1881–1938), {{proposing to}} her in a chauffeur-driven car he hired. Blake and Lee met around 1895, when both {{attended}} Primary School No.2, at 200 East Street in Baltimore. In 1910, Blake brought his newlywed to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he had <b>already</b> <b>found</b> employment at the Boathouse nightclub.|$|E

25|$|Sir Andrew Clarke, {{just weeks}} after his arrival in Singapore, had <b>already</b> <b>found</b> {{evidence}} of the continuing disturbances in Perak and Selangor. Apart from his executive council, he talked to Tan Kim Ching. Clarke decided that both the Hai San and Ghee Hin {{should have access to}} Larut with neither side being excluded, a complete reversal of the policy of his predecessor, Sir Henry Ord. Tan Kim Ching agreed and wrote to the Ghee Hin at Penang to put this to them and advocate peace.|$|E

25|$|Ellwood Morris, the Assistant Engineer, {{suggested}} using cement {{instead of}} stone for the locks to cut cost. On September 25, 1938, Charles B Fisk, the chief engineer, {{wrote to the}} board recommending the use of composite locks, such as those <b>already</b> <b>found</b> on the Chenango Canal. Chief Engineer Charles Fisk {{was the one who}} prevailed {{on the board of directors}} to remove Lock 65. This resulted in the numbering of fractional locks 63⅓ and 64⅔, so that the numbering above Lock 65 (now eliminated) could be preserved.|$|E
25|$|Amarthiel's captain Mordrambor breaks free, killing many Rangers. Soon {{he leads}} an army out of Annúminas, to find Amarthiel's Ring, Narchuil. The player {{attempts}} to find Narchuil before Amarthiel can, searching the ancient ruins of the Trollshaws. After much searching, it turns out Narmeleth, Laerdan's daughter, who originally caused Amarthiel's fall in Fornost, has become possessed by her. But all searching seems in vain, when it is revealed Amarthiel has <b>already</b> <b>found</b> Narchuil. However, Elrond does not fall for her trickery again; he realizes Narchuil is still out there, and Laerdan knows where.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, a {{mechanical}} engineering student called Uri Goldstein attended one of Geller's shows, and subsequently sued the show's promoters for breach of contract. He complained that Geller had promised {{a demonstration of}} several psychic powers but had delivered only sleight-of-hand and stage tricks. The case came before the civil court in Beersheba. Geller was not present as the summons {{had been sent to}} the office of the promoter Miki Peled, who had ignored it as being trivial. Goldstein was awarded 27.5 lira (around $5) for breach of contract. Later, Goldstein admitted that he went to the show specifically with the intention of suing to get his money back, and he had <b>already</b> <b>found</b> a lawyer to represent him prior to attending the performance.|$|E

25|$|While {{staying at}} a hotel in Eagle Pass, Moss discovers the {{tracking}} device, but Chigurh has <b>already</b> <b>found</b> him. Their firefight spills onto the streets and both are wounded. Moss flees to Mexico, stashing the case of money in weeds along the Rio Grande. Severely injured, he asks for help from some musicians, who take him to a hospital. Carson Wells, another hired operative, fails to persuade him to accept protection in return for the money. Chigurh cleans and stitches his own wounds with stolen supplies and kills Wells at his hotel. Moss telephones the room and Chigurh answers. Chigurh tells Moss that he will kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money; he remarks that he will kill Moss regardless of whether he receives the money.|$|E
25|$|Terman had <b>already</b> <b>found</b> some bright {{children}} through his earlier research, {{and some of}} these were part of the sample in the Genetic Studies of Genius. He hired several assistants, including Florence Goodenough and Catharine Cox, to search the public schools of California for additionally gifted children. Terman initially hoped to find the 1,000 most intelligent children, but eventually found 1,444. However, Terman gradually added subjects to the study through 1928 until there were 1,528 (856 males and 672 females). Not all subjects were discovered with the Stanford–Binet. Some were selected for the study with the National Intelligence Tests and the Army Alpha. The study subjects were born between 1900 and 1925, all lived in California, were about 90% white, and the majority came from upper- or middle-class families.|$|E
25|$|Numerous popular stories {{throughout}} the world reflect a firmly-rooted belief in an intimate connection between {{a human being and}} a tree, plant or flower. Sometimes a man's life depends upon the tree and suffers when it withers or is injured, and we encounter the idea of the external soul, <b>already</b> <b>found</b> in the Ancient Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers from at least 3000 years ago. Here one of the brothers leaves his heart {{on the top of the}} flower of the acacia and falls dead when it is cut down. Sometimes, however, the tree is a mysterious token which shows its sympathy with an absent hero by weakening or dying, as the man becomes ill or loses his life. These two features very easily combine, and they agree in representing to us mysterious sympathy between tree and human life.|$|E
50|$|Although {{some people}} claim that Rüsselbach was <b>already</b> <b>founded</b> {{as early as}} in 742 a.c., which {{corresponds}} with {{the foundation of the}} diocese Eichstätt, to which Rüsselbach belonged in the beginning, the first proven reference in a document was only in 1010 a.c. in a deed of emperor Henry II.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to their racing team division, Murphy Prototypes also has an 'Alternative Powered Vehicles' division which specialise in designing cars based around alternative power sources such as electricity.

50|$|Lloyd Werft Bremerhaven GmbH is a {{dockyard}} in Bremerhaven. It {{was founded}} in 1863 by the shipping company Norddeutscher Lloyd, first mainly used as a repair workshop for the company’s own merchant fleet. This new yard was established in exchange and addition to the former small Lloyd-workshop in Bremen which was <b>already</b> <b>founded</b> in 1857.|$|R
25|$|The main storyline {{continues}} as the player repeatedly encounters the Baron Raymondo and the Marquis de la Montalbán. As the player defeats each, he gains {{a portion of}} a map leading to either a family member (imprisoned in a tiny cabin) or Montalbán's fortified hideout in the Caribbean. After each family member is found, the Baron begins providing portions of new maps for another family member until all are found — after which the Baron no longer appears and is no longer mentioned in gossip. After discovering Montalbán's hideout, the player attacks it in a fashion similar to sacking a town, with the defenders being a large band of Native American mercenaries. After successfully defeating the enemy army, the player encounters the Marquis and they duel. If the player is successful in the duel, the Marquis surrenders, swears servitude to the player, provides every specialist in the game (assuming all are not <b>already</b> <b>found),</b> and gives the player a large sum of gold. Finding family members and defeating the Marquis also provide significant fame boosts.|$|E
25|$|The {{array of}} {{problems}} encountered {{concentrated on the}} electrodynamics of moving bodies. Poincaré swiftly proposed {{the idea that it}} is the ether modifying itself, and not the bodies acquiring mass, which came to contradict the older theories (based on a perfectly immovable ether). Overall, Poincaré shed light on the Zeeman effect, caused by discontinuous emissions of electrons. The problem of discontinuous matter forced the formulation of a minimally-destabilizing model of the atom. In 1913, Niels Bohr presented his atomic model which was based on the concept of electron orbits, and which explained spectroscopy as well as the stability of the atom. But, in 1905, the problem with all attempts to define the behavior of the microscopic world was that no one then knew if they needed to consider a similar model to the one known for the macroscopic objects (the model of classical mechanics), or if they should try to develop an entirely new model to give account of new facts. The latter idea, which was followed with the quantum theory, also implied definitively abandoning the unity <b>already</b> <b>found</b> in prior theories of mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The National Hurricane Center(NHC) first {{noted the}} {{potential}} of the formation of a tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico during the mid-afternoon hours of June12. At the time, an upper-level trough was producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms over the northwestern Caribbean Sea, Belize, and the Yucatán Peninsula. However, the NHC assessed a low probability as atmospheric conditions were assessed to be unfavorable in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving northwestward, the system tracked over the Yucatán Peninsula, and development chances increased as forecasts showed a more favorable environment within the Gulf of Mexico. Early on June14, the trough began to interact with an upper-level low over the Gulf of Mexico, producing additional showers over portions of Central America. Later that day, Hurricane Hunters aircraft reconnaissance began investigating the system, and discovered an ill-defined but intact and broad low-pressure area over the south-central Gulf of Mexico. The system continued to possess an elongated circulation through June15, but on June16, reconnaissance aircraft indicated that the storm had become sufficiently organized to be considered a tropical cyclone. As winds were <b>already</b> <b>found</b> to have met the threshold for a tropical storm, the NHC began issuing advisories on Tropical Storm Bill at 03:00UTC that day, skipping the tropical depression classification.|$|E
