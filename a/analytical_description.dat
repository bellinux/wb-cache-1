40|$|Yield locus {{measurements}} and their <b>analytical</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{has been the}} bases for modeling metal processing. These <b>analytical</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{play a role in}} models to predict limit strains observed during determination of forming limit diagrams of flat metal stock as means to evaluate their fabrication performance. Some of these <b>analytical</b> <b>descriptions</b> use the isotropic or anisotropic plastic potentials that take into account the crystallographic texture of the material. The applicability of such potentials is validated by comparing their predictions to that of unidirectional tensile data. In the current work, this approach is reversed to examine whether the constitutive relations, which replicate the measured stress strain diagrams, can generate a two-dimensional section of the yield locus. The strategy is to sum the computed plastic work (PW) from unidirectional mechanical tests in two principal directions which also accommodates the biaxial interaction strains. The resulting yield function includes fq and f 4, the prescribed stress ratios and the texture parameters R 4 and Rq in their respective principal directions. The prescribed PW at an arbitrary strain during unidirectional tensile test is equated to the work sum from the biaxial stresses on the premise that the plastic flow-stress registers only the increasing density of obstacles it generates. The computed biaxial yield stresses showed good fits for AA 5154 and AA 5754 with only small modification due to latent work hardening. status: publishe...|$|R

This virtual state (sum of internal and external disturbances, usually denoted as a [...] "total disturbance") is estimated online with a state observer and used in the control signal in order to decouple the system from the actual perturbation acting on the plant. This disturbance rejection feature allows user to treat the considered system with a simpler model, since the negative effects of modeling uncertainty are compensated in real time. As a result, the operator does not need a precise <b>analytical</b> <b>description</b> of the system, as one can assume the unknown parts of dynamics as the internal disturbance in the plant. Robustness and the adaptive ability of this method makes it an interesting solution in scenarios where the full knowledge of the system is not available.|$|E
