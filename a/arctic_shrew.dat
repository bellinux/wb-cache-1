50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex arcticus), {{also known}} as the blackback shrew or saddlebacked shrew, is a {{medium-sized}} shrew found in Canada and the northern United States. Separate species status has been proposed for the maritime shrew (Sorex maritimensis) which is found in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia and had been considered to be a subspecies of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew.</b> The tundra shrew (Sorex tundrensis) was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Arctic</b> <b>shrews</b> are solitary animals. Adults are territorial. In one {{laboratory}} study, whenever two <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrews</b> {{were placed}} {{together in a}} cage, one was dead within several days, {{though there was no}} sign of injury to the dead shrew and the cause for this mortality is unclear, however the result of this forced interaction has been repeatedly observed. <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrews</b> are active during day and night, though there are contradicting reports on levels and cycles of activity throughout the day. One claim is that they are least active during mid-morning, while other reports describe alternating periods of activity and rest, with an average of fourteen periods of activity daily. <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrews</b> are very active and move quickly. Periods of inactivity are spent lying on the ground, either on one side or with the ventral side down, body rolled up, and head tucked under the body. Grooming consists of wiping the forefeet rapidly along the mouth.|$|R
50|$|<b>Arctic</b> <b>shrews</b> {{are native}} to North America, {{ranging from the}} Arctic Circle {{in the north and}} as far south as the {{northern}} United States, into North and South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. Their eastern limits are in eastern Quebec and the Atlantic Maritime provinces, and their western limits are the southern Yukon and Mackenzie valleys.|$|R
50|$|Small {{herds of}} Porcupine caribou (or Grant's caribou, Rangifer tarandus grantii) are {{frequently}} {{found on the}} island in summer. Muskox, and grizzly bears are occasionally seen, crossing to Herschel from the mainland. Lemmings, tundra voles and <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrews</b> are common. Red and Arctic foxes are also known to den on the island. Natal Arctic fox dens are found each year on the island, usually one or two, but occasionally more. Red foxes also reproduce on the island but natal red fox dens are not observed every year.|$|R
50|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} about the mating habits of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew,</b> however males of most shrew species mate with many females, and compete with other males for females, so {{the assumption is that}} Arctic shrews behave similarly. In Wisconsin, the breeding season lasts from February to August, and the breeding season is shorter in more northern areas, from April to August. <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew</b> females give birth to one or two litters each year, and these litters range in size from 4 to 10 offspring, with an average of 7 offspring per litter. The gestation period ranges between 13 and 21 days, so the young stay with their mother until 5 to 6.5 weeks after conception, and males make no contribution to parental care. When they are born, young Arctic shrews are helpless. Their mother cares for them {{until the end of the}} weaning period, 20 to 24 days after birth. Both female and male Arctic shrews reach sexual maturity after one year. As much as 50 percent of all juveniles die in the first month, but the average lifespan of an <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew</b> in the wild is around 18 months.|$|E
50|$|The tundra shrew (Sorex tundrensis) {{is a small}} shrew {{found in}} Alaska, the {{northern}} Yukon Territory, the MacKenzie Delta region of the Northwest Territories, extreme northwestern British Columbia and eastern Russia. At one time, this animal {{was considered to be}} a subspecies of the <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex arcticus).|$|E
50|$|Like all shrews, the <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew</b> has a {{voracious}} and insatiable appetite {{due to its}} quick metabolism. It eats insects, {{worms and}} small invertebrates, with {{a large proportion of}} its diet made up of larch sawflies, though Arctic shrews in captivity have been fed dead voles, fly pupae, and mealworms. The only known predators of Arctic shrews are owls.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== The {{forests of}} the reserve vary by {{elevation}} and by proximity to the reservoir. The mid-level forests are mostly taiga fir and pine, with some zones of larch forests. The mountain steppe regions grade out to even shrubs-steppe and grassland. Fluctuations in the water level due to operations of the dam can be dramatic (up to 40 meters). This leads to plant zones that contain species that reflect the influence of human actions, and are a primary focus of scientists in the reserve. In the upper regionsof the reservoir, the receding waters have produced broad floodplains. The most common mammals in the reserve {{are those that are}} widespread in Siberia: sable, squirrel, elk, wolf, wolverine, lynx and others. In the upper levels of the mountains there are typical <b>Arctic</b> species: <b>arctic</b> <b>shrews</b> and reindeer. In steppe region are more Mongolian-representative species: Siberian mountain goat, Pallas's cat, long-tailed hamster and the grey marmot. There a small number of snow leopards in the reserve. Over 100 species of birds are recorded. Those representative of the Siberian taiga include the Eurasian nuthatch, blue nightingale, nightingale whistler, nutcracker, Himalayan Cuckoo, and grouse. The bearded partridge is typical of the rocky steppe areas, and birds of prey such as ospreys, falcons and eagles are common throughout. Reptiles include copperhead snakes and adders; amphibians are represented by the moor frog and common toad.|$|R
50|$|Denali {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of North American birds and mammals, {{including}} grizzly bears and black bears. Herds of caribou roam throughout the park. Dall sheep are often seen on mountainsides, and Alaskan moose feed on the aquatic plants of the small lakes and swamps. Despite human impact on the area, Denali accommodates wolf dens, both historic and active. Smaller animals such as coyotes, hoary marmots, <b>shrews,</b> <b>Arctic</b> ground squirrels, beavers, pikas, and snowshoe hares are seen in abundance. Red foxes, martens, Canadian lynxes, wolverines also inhabit the park, but are more rarely seen due to their elusive natures.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew</b> is most {{distinctive}} in its tricolored fur. It is dark brown or black {{on its back}} from its head {{to the base of}} its tail, while its flanks are a lighter brown, and its underside is lighter still grayish brown. Even its tail is bi-colored, dark brown on the dorsal side, and gradually fading to a lighter brown on the ventral side. The fur is grayer in winter time, and its tricolor is most marked during the winter months from October to June, for the fur is thicker and brighter. Arctic shrews molt twice a year, and the tricolor bands in the fur are less prominent in younger shrews.|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} {{has also had}} {{a major influence on}} entertainment, most notably: the movie The Freshman, where Marlon Brando's character is a parody of Corleone; the Only Fools and Horses episode [...] "Miami Twice", where the primary antagonist is Don Vincenzo [...] "Vinny the Chain" [...] Ochetti, another parody of Corleone; the Disney animated film Zootopia, where the character of Mr. Big, an anthropomorphic <b>arctic</b> <b>shrew,</b> is a crime boss who shares mannerisms with Corleone; and the comic book mini-series, Batman: Year One and Batman: The Long Halloween, where the character Carmine Falcone is loosely based on Vito Corleone. Goodfeathers, a segment of the cartoon show Animaniacs, features a character called [...] "The Godpigeon", a parody of Vito Corleone.|$|E
50|$|Arctic shrews {{are found}} {{in a variety of}} {{habitats}} in highest density of 3 to 5 individuals per acre and each individual <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew</b> appears to limit its range to one tenth of an acre. Of their various habitats, they found in greatest quantity and density in areas near bodies of water, such as lakes, streams, marshes, wetlands, bogs, swamps, ditches or open areas near wetlands. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, they are found densely in spruce and tamarack swamps, in addition to other typical habitats. Arctic shrews have been found in clearings in boreal forests, and occasionally in mixed conifer swamps, dry or old fields, dense grasses near ditches, mixed grasses, in the undergrowth of forest clearings, alder thickets, and dry marsh with grasses, sedge hammocks, forbs, cattail, willow, and red-osier shrubs.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{morphological}} and cytological analyses {{have suggested}} that the <b>arctic</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex arcticus) as currently recognized may be two distinct species. Specifically, those studies demonstrated considerable differentiation between the putative subspecies S. a. maritimensis and {{one or both of the}} other two subspecies, S. a. arcticus and S. a. laricorum. Phylogenetic analysis of 546 base pairs of cytochrome b sequence data from 10 arctic shrews from across Canada indicates that maritimensis is the sister-group to arcticus + laricorum. Furthermore, there is considerable genetic divergence between maritimensis and the other two putative subspecies (similar to 8 - 9 %; Kimura's two-parameter distance). Given that maritimensis and arcticus + laricorum appear to be reciprocally monophyletic clades with considerable genetic divergence (i. e., greater than that between other recognized pairs of sister-species within the S. araneus-arcticus group), we propose that S. maritimensis be recognized as a distinct species. The proportion of third-position transversion substitutions between S. arcticus and S. maritimensis suggests that these two species shared a common ancestor approximately 2. 4 million years ago...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{distribution}} and ecology of 26 mammals, 6 birds, and 1 amphib-ian are described. Northern range extensions are recorded for the pygmy shrew, <b>arctic</b> <b>shrew,</b> muskrat, heather vole, {{northern bog lemming}} and wood frog. A southern range extension of the arctic ground squirrel is noted following its being observed {{for the first time}} in Manitoba. Observation of a great blue heron at Churchill, far from its usual range in southern Manitoba, is also recorded. The number of species of small mammals on two-hectare quadrats in marsh, prairie, shrub, and savanna along the grassland-coniferous forest transition in southern Mani-toba was 1. 8 to 3. 0 times greater than in beach-meadow, tundra, shrub, and open-forest quadrats along the coniferous forest-tundra transition of northern Manitoba, while the total population was 1. 8 to 3. 4 times greater.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{analysis}} of small mammal faunas from Kabazi II, Kabazi V, Starosele, Karabi Tamchin, Buran Kaya III, Chokurcha I and Siuren I Palaeolithic sites, we could distinguish the following principal features: 1. The cold-adapted species of small mammals (such as Siberian and collared lemming, East Siberian voles, <b>Arctic</b> <b>shrew</b> and others) were not distinguished in the cultural layers {{of all of the}} sites; 2. The open landscapes species are the dominant in the all of the faunas and include as well as mammals which are habituated in modern landscapes, so the animals which now are distributed far away eastward and northward from the Crimea (yellow steppe lemming, narrow-skull vole, bobac, thick-tailed three-toed jerboa, lesser five-toed jerboa and others) (Fig. 1). 3. The remnants of forest small mammals are rather scarce. They were found in the communities correlated with the Mikulino (=Eemian) Interglacial (Kabazi II, V, VI), in the faunas correlated with Hengelo Interstadial (Kabazi V, III/ 5; Starosele, 1, 2; Karabi Tamchin, III), Denekamp = Briansk Interstadial (Buran Kaya III, B; Siuren I, Ga; Kabazi V, II/ 4 a-II/ 7, III/ 1 and III/ 1 A) (Fig. 2). The presence of these mammals indicates the increasing of humidity during these intervals. However, the forest species undoubtedly didn’t disappear from the Crimean Mountains even during the stadial cooling and only decreased their ranges. 4. Some species of small mammals distinguished from Crimean sites now are distributed eastward: the yellow steppe lemming survived in the Zaisan Depression, Mongolia, China; the narrow skull vole distributed in open landscapes of northern-eastern part of Eastern Europe, in the Urals, in steppe and tundra zones of Siberia. The ranges of thick-tailed three-toed jerboa and lesser five-toed jerboa decreased and located now eastward from Crimea. The Russian mole rat range (the remains of this animal was found only in the Eemian layers of Kabazi II) now is absent in the Crimea fauna. Its modern range located in Eastern Europe northward from the Crimean Peninsula. The similar changes were happened with the position of bobac marmot range...|$|E
