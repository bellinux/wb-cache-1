5|$|A bike remains upright {{when it is}} steered so {{that the}} ground {{reaction}} forces exactly balance all the other internal and external forces it experiences, such as gravitational if leaning, inertial or centrifugal if in <b>a</b> <b>turn,</b> gyroscopic if being steered, and aerodynamic if in a crosswind.|$|E
5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} contact patch {{with the road}} surface that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in <b>a</b> <b>turn,</b> can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis normal to {{the plane of the}} contact patch.|$|E
5|$|At 00:16, Scott {{ordered his}} ships {{to turn to}} a heading of 330° {{in an attempt to}} pursue the fleeing Japanese ships. Scott's ships, however, quickly lost sight of Gotō's ships, and all firing ceased by 00:20. The American {{formation}} was beginning to scatter, so Scott ordered <b>a</b> <b>turn</b> to 205° to disengage.|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>turning</b> {{point is}} <b>a</b> {{point at which}} the {{derivative}} changes sign. <b>A</b> <b>turning</b> point may be either a relative maximum or a relative minimum (also known as local minimum and maximum). If the function is differentiable, then <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point is <b>a</b> stationary point; however not all stationary points are turning points. If the function is twice differentiable, the stationary points that are not turning points are horizontal inflection points. For example, the function [...] has a stationary point at x=0, which is also an inflection point, but is not <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> point.|$|R

5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating <b>a</b> <b>turn.</b> During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards the inside of <b>a</b> <b>turn.</b> Roberts tried the technique {{and found that it}} helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the cornering style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that, {{according}} to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) terminology, the above example illustrates <b>a</b> so-called <b>turning</b> flight stall, while the term accelerated is used to indicate <b>an</b> accelerated <b>turning</b> stall only, that is, <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> flight stall where the airspeed decreases at a given rate.|$|R

5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in <b>a</b> <b>turn,</b> improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed between the Cape Verde islands {{and the west}} coast of Africa on August18, although it was not classified as a tropical cyclone for another week. The depression tracked west-southwestward for three days, followed by <b>a</b> <b>turn</b> to the west and later west-northwest. Late on August24 it intensified into a tropical storm about 700mi (1100km) east-northeast of Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles. The next day, the Miami Weather Bureau Office initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Able after the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the presence of a poorly defined center. Continuing to the west-northwest, the storm passed north of Puerto Rico and attained hurricane status on August27.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} naval facility, Oxford Avenue {{continues}} northeast {{at the intersection}} with Robbins Street/Martins Mill Road. PA 232 runs north through the residential Lawncrest neighborhood and reaches an intersection with Cottman Avenue (PA 73) in the Burholme neighborhood. From this junction, the route passes a mix of urban residential and commercial establishments as {{it comes to a}} bridge over CSX’s Trenton Subdivision at the Bleigh Avenue intersection and continues into the Fox Chase neighborhood, crossing SEPTA’s Fox Chase Line south of the Fox Chase station. Upon reaching the Rhawn Street intersection in the downtown area of Fox Chase, the road makes <b>a</b> <b>turn</b> to the northwest.|$|E

5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of the}} colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird <b>a</b> <b>turn</b> on the inside and on the outside.|$|E
5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute <b>a</b> <b>turn</b> to the northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the road}} makes <b>a</b> <b>turn</b> to the {{southeast}} to enter the small hamlet of Kitchawan, located at NY134's junction with Pines Bridge Road (unsigned County Route1323 or CR1323). Pines Bridge Road was once NY135, and its junction with NY134 in Kitchawan was NY135's eastern terminus. From Pines Bridge Road, NY134 bends southward to run alongside a reservoir inlet connecting to Cornell Brook. After about , the route makes a final turn to the east to cross Cornell Brook and reach its east end at an intersection with NY100 (Saw Mill River Road).|$|E

5|$|Battles {{consist of}} both story-related boss fights and random {{encounters}} with standard enemies. Battles are turn-based, with the player characters and enemies moving around a small battle arena to perform actions. Once the player {{has laid out}} their strategy in the battle menu, the characters perform their assigned actions until the battle ends with victory for {{one side or the}} player pauses the action to change strategies. Instead of the grid-based battle system from the original Persona, party members and enemy units act in the same phase of <b>a</b> <b>turn,</b> rather than being restricted by their placement on the field.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie {{remained}} virtually stationary {{until the}} morning of September23 when it drifted very slowly to the west-southwest {{in response to the}} ridge. It also began to gradually weaken as the low-level center became exposed and the storm became poorly organized. Convection also diminished, and on the afternoon of September24, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical storm as it drifted over cooler waters. Bonnie continued to lose most of its deep convection during the day on September25 as it began to make <b>a</b> <b>turn</b> back around to the south. That evening, Bonnie was downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Both Frank Black and Teenager of the Year were {{critically}} well received, {{although they}} enjoyed limited commercial success. In 1995, Thompson left his long-time labels 4AD and Elektra. In 1996, he released The Cult of Ray on Rick Rubin's American Recordings; the album marked <b>a</b> <b>turn</b> {{away from the}} elaborate production of his first solo works and was recorded primarily live with few overdubs. His band for this album featured sole Teenager holdover Lyle Workman on lead guitar, along with bassist David McCaffrey and Scott Boutier on drums. Though the album was neither critically nor commercially successful, its stripped-down approach would increasingly define Thompson's working methods {{for the next several}} years.|$|E
