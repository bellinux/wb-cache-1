These principles have accelerated the performance gains of these processors over their predecessors. The <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> of CPUs is poised to continue this rapid acceleration of performance. In this paper we assert that the performance gains of the <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> are due to changes that are decidedly not RISC. We call this <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> of processors Post-RISC and, we describe the characteristics of Post-RISC processors. In addition, we survey six processors of the <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> that highlight the {{principles of}} Post-RISC...|$|R
40|$|Here, we {{show that}} quorum sensing (QS) modulates the <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> of the anode-respiring {{bacterium}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa because it controls the production of phenazines, which mediate the electron transfer to the anode. The <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> by a wildtype (WT) strain P. aeruginosa PA 14 and the GacS/GacA protein-regulatory mutant retS was investigated under different environmental conditions. The retS mutant generated significantly higher current (45 -fold) than the WT under anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> by the WT was 28 -fold higher with extraneously supplied lactones (a QS-signaling molecule). Compared to anaerobic conditions, the WT with some oxygen (microaerobic conditions) exhibited enhanced phenazine production (39 -fold) and current levels (48 -fold). Iron-rich medium and microaerobic conditions had {{a negative impact on}} <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> by retS. All these results were directly linked to QS activity in P. aeruginosa, thus, demonstrating the importance of this bacterial communication system for <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> in BESs. We also show that BESs represent a new tool for real-time investigation of phenazine-related QS activity...|$|R

In two studies, we test the prediction that <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> will only be assigned guilt for past atrocities when victim group members perceive high levels of cultural continuity between historical perpetrators and the <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> within the perpetrator group. Japanese participants were presented with information describing the <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> of Americans as either similar or dissimilar in personality to the Americans who were implicated in dropping the atomic bomb on Japan during World War II. The results of both studies revealed that victim group members assigned more guilt to current Americans when they perceived high (compared to low) outgroup continuity, and they did so relatively independently of the transgressor group 2 ̆ 7 s guilt expressions...|$|R

We characterize both continuous thin films and lithographically patterned nanoislands with constrained interaction area. The influence of size on energy generation parameters is reported, demonstrating that nanoislands can exhibit more effective <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> than continuous films. This quantitative finding suggests that further research into the impact of nanoscale patterning of piezoelectric thin films may yield an improved materials platform for integrated microscale energy scavenging systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{long-lived}} stock pollutants and the abatement and technology measures supposed {{to address them}} link <b>current</b> and future <b>generations</b> together. Altruism towards successor generations {{is a prerequisite for}} resolving the resulting intergenerational equity issues. Preference asymmetry and typical imperfections of altruism, however, introduce the possibility of important strategic conficts between generations. We develop a simple model highlighting the presence and nature of strategic distortions in addressing intergenerational environmental problems. The <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> decides on a combination of abatement and technology- enabling investment leading to an imperfect backstop technology. The future generation decides whether to use the backstop or not. We identify three possible outcomes: (1) Technology denial, in which the <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> deliberately rejects the imperfect backstop in anticipation that the future generation will use the technology in an undesired way. (2) Underabatement, in which the <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> provides the backstop to the future generation but reduces abatement activities; and (3) Overabatement, in which the <b>current</b> <b>generation</b> provides the backstop to the future generation but reduces abatement activities. The outcome depends non-trivially on the environmental preferences of the future generation. Uncertainty over future preferences renders technology denial more likely...|$|R

40|$|We {{employed}} the Generational Accounting model in estimating the generation-specific lifetime (both {{past and the}} future) benefits/burdens and income and evaluating their values as of 2010, thus estimating the lifetime net burden ratio (= lifetime net burden/lifetime income). As a result, the following points were elucidated: 1) Among the <b>current</b> living <b>generations,</b> the lifetime net burden ratio of the 0 -year-old generation is about 25 percentage points {{higher than that of}} the current 90 -year-old generation; 2) The lifetime net burden ratio of the future generations is about 31 percentage points higher than that of the 0 -year-old generation; 3) The net burden of the <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> would have to be increased in order to narrow the generational gap between the <b>current</b> <b>generations</b> and the future generations, which would inevitably lead to an expansion of the intragenerational gap of the current generations; and 4) In order to prevent conflict of interest between the <b>current</b> <b>generations,</b> in particular the younger generations and future generations, and at the same time, narrow the intergenerational gap, it is desirable to increase the income of the <b>current</b> <b>generations,</b> in particular that of the younger generations, by achieving a high economic growth rate and implementing macroeconomic policy management that would inhibit increase in the risk premium included in the interest rate...|$|R

[...] The growth of tangible monetary capital is not always linear due to the shocks of business cycles. During the period of prosperity, monetary capital grows at relatively higher rate while during the period of recession and depression, there is deceleration of monetary capital.
