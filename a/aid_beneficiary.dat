40|$|Humanitarian aid, while {{useful in}} the short run, {{sometimes}} {{has the effect of}} contributing to poverty and poor economic conditions in the long run. This occurs when recipients of relief aid lose their initiative to fend for themselves and become reliant on external aid. The purpose of this mixed method study was to evaluate the degree to which dependency on long term aid has contributed to chronic poverty in the Moroto district of Uganda. This study was grounded on Harvey 2 ̆ 6 Lind 2 ̆ 7 s conceptualization of the dependency syndrome. The research questions addressed the relationship between household production and investment pattern with number of year as <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiary,</b> while exploring the beneficiaries 2 ̆ 7 perceptions on the roles of relief aid in their livelihood. Survey data were acquired from 75 participants from five sampled villages in Moroto District; qualitative data were acquired from the same villages involving five focus group discussions with 15 key informants per village. Quantitative data were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis and resulted in a finding of a statistically significant negative relationship between household production and investment with number of years spent as <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiary.</b> Qualitative data were inductively coded, and then organized around key themes. These findings suggest that many rural Ugandans believe that if aid were to cease, they would either migrate to an area where aid was available, or die of starvation. Implications for positive social change are connected to a recommendation to organizations offering humanitarian aid to package relief aid with other programs that support the recipients 2 ̆ 7 resilience building capacity in order to save lives and reduce chronic poverty that is common in disaster-prone areas around the world...|$|E
40|$|Health care {{utilization}} has progressively increased, {{especially among}} Medical <b>Aid</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in South Korea. The Medical <b>Aid</b> classifies <b>beneficiaries</b> into two categories, type 1 and 2, {{on the basis}} of being incapable (those under 18 or over 65 years of age, or disabled) or capable of working, respectively. Medical Aid has a high possibility for health care utilization due to high coverage level. In South Korea, the national health insurance (NHI) achieved very short time to establish coverage for the entire Korean population. However there there remaine a number of problems to be solved. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the differences in health care utilization between Medical <b>Aid</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and Health Insurance beneficiaries. Data were collected from the Korean Welfare Panel Study from 2008 to 2012 using propensity score matching. Of the 2, 316 research subjects, 579 had Medical Aid and 1, 737 had health insurance. We also analyzed three dependent variables: days spent in the hospital, number of outpatient visits, and hospitalizations per year. Analysis of variance and longitudinal data analysis were used. The number of outpatient visits was 1. 431 times higher (p< 0. 0001) in Medical <b>Aid</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> the number of hospitalizations per year was 1. 604 times higher (p< 0. 0001) in Medical <b>Aid</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> and the number of days spent in the hospital per year was 1. 282 times higher (p< 0. 268) for Medical <b>Aid</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> than in individuals with Health Insurance. Medical Aid patients had a 0. 874 times lower frequency of having an unmet needs due to economic barrier (95 % confidence interval: 0. 662 - 1. 156). Health insurance coverage has an impact on health care utilization.

40|$|Abstract Background Medical {{spending}} on psychiatric hospitalization {{has been reported}} to impose a tremendous socio-economic burden on many developed countries with public health insurance programmes. However, there has been no in-depth study of the factors affecting psychiatric inpatient medical expenditures and differentiated these factors across different types of public health insurance programmes. In view of this, this study attempted to explore factors affecting medical expenditures for psychiatric inpatients between two public health insurance programmes covering the entire South Korean population: National Health Insurance (NHI) and National Medical Care Aid (AID). Methods This retrospective, cross-sectional study used a nationwide, population-based reimbursement claims dataset consisting of 1, 131, 346 claims of all 160, 465 citizens institutionalized due to psychiatric diagnosis between January 2005 and June 2006 in South Korea. To adjust for possible correlation of patients characteristics within the same medical institution and a non-linearity structure, a Box-Cox transformed, multilevel regression analysis was performed. Results Compared with inpatients 19 years old or younger, the medical expenditures of inpatients between 50 and 64 years old were 10 % higher among NHI beneficiaries but 40 % higher among <b>AID</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Males showed higher medical expenditures than did females. Expenditures on inpatients with schizophrenia as compared to expenditures on those with neurotic disorders were 120 % higher among NHI beneficiaries but 83 % higher among <b>AID</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> Expenditures on inpatients of psychiatric hospitals were greater on average than expenditures on inpatients of general hospitals. Among <b>AID</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> institutions owned by private groups treated inpatients with 32 % higher costs than did government institutions. Among NHI beneficiaries, inpatients medical expenditures were positively associated with the proportion of patients diagnosed into dementia or schizophrenia categories. However, for <b>AID</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> inpatient medical expenditures were positively associated with the proportion of all patients with a psychiatric diagnosis that were <b>AID</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in a medical institution. Conclusions This study provides evidence that patient and institutional factors are associated with psychiatric inpatient medical expenditures, and that they may have different effects for beneficiaries of different public health insurance programmes. Policy efforts to reduce psychiatric inpatient medical expenditures should be made differently across the different types of public health insurance programmes. </p...|$|R

40|$|This text is {{an attempt}} to analyze a particular, {{normative}} aspect of the media narrative about refugees during the recent migration crisis in Europe. It looks at the substantive semantic distance between the ‘good’ or ‘real’ refugees presented in some media outlets and the definition of a refugee under international law. This difference is later explained by a particular kind of exposure to the events of the refugee crisis – a ‘mediated experience’, and by the existence of a normative ‘refugee archetype’. I look at images representing refugees through the lenses of John B. Thompson’s (1995) concept of opposition between lived and mediated experience – the figures of ‘bad’ and ‘good’ refugees are seen as belonging to the order of mediated experience, therefore, as argued by Thomson, impersonal and dispersed in time and space. Finally, I refer to the Malkki’s (1996) concept of a refugee as a ‘universal humanitarian subject’ – an apolitical and de-historicized figure, reduced to the role of <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiary</b> which serves me to explain the ambiguity of representations of refugees and their dependence on political interests...|$|E
40|$|More than 1. 3 billion people, that is, one {{in every}} five on earth, survive on less than a $ 1 a day (UNDP, 2004). International {{development}} institutions and government of foreign aid donors have tried ways to alleviate poverty. Despite of decades, of development aid targeted at increasing economic growth of <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiary</b> countries; the number of poor in sub-Saharan Africa has increased. With the failure of traditional form of aid and development policies, the focus is now on grassroots development targeted type. Microfinance {{is one of these}} types of development idea targeted directly at the poor. It is a small scale credit scheme targeted at the poor who have been rejected from the traditional financial institutions. This dissertation investigates the impact of microfinance on communities' welfare or quality of life in sub-Saharan Africa focusing on the case of Djibouti. The study begins by reviewing the background information on Djibouti, followed by the literature review on microfinance. A questionnaire survey of the clients of the microfinance program at the SFD agency in Djibouti has been conducted. The study found that the microfinance program has had a positive impact on its client's welfare and quality of life at both the individual and household levels. It appears that the majority for the clients experienced an income, asset and saving increases and also an improvement of their nutrition. A couple of implications follow from the results of the study. From the housing repairs indicator used for the study it appears that housing repairs are expensive and that clients wait for couple of years before they apply any repairs. Therefore, a housing scheme similar to the microfinance scheme is suggested. Also, it seems that the microfinance program benefits more the clients as the stay longer in the program because they receive incremental loan sizes. Therefore, it is suggested {{to increase the number of}} categories in the program, accompanied by an increase of the loan size for the higher categories. This will allow clients to expand faster their activities; to employ other people for their activities and pay a wage to themselves as well...|$|E

40|$|Background: Tete Province, Mozambique has {{experienced}} chronic food insecurity and a dramatic fall in livestock numbers {{due to the}} cyclic problems characterized by the floods in 2000 and severe droughts in 2002 and 2003. The Province has been a beneficiary of emergency relief programs, which have assisted > 22 % of the population. However, these programs were not based on sound epidemiological data, {{and they have not}} established baseline data against which {{to assess the impact of}} the programs. Objective: The objective of this study was to document mortality rates, causes of death, the prevalence of malnutrition, and the prevalence of lost pregnancies after 2. 5 years of humanitarian response to the crisis. Methods: A two-stage, 30 -cluster household survey was conducted in the Cahora Bassa and Changara districts from 22 October to 08 November 2004. A total of 838 households were surveyed, with a population size of 4, 688 people. Results: Anthropometric data were collected among children 6 - 59 months of age. In addition, crude mortality rates (CMRs), under five mortality rates (U 5 MRs), causes of deaths, and prevalence of lost pregnancies were determined among the sample population. The prevalence of malnutrition was 8. 0 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 6. 2 - 9. 8 %) for acute malnutrition, 26. 9 % (95 % CI= 24. 0 - 29. 9 %) for being underweight, and 37. 0 % (95 % CI= 33. 8 - 40. 2 %) for chronic malnutrition. Boys were more likely to be underweight than were girls (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 34; 95 % CI= 1. 00, 1. 82; p< 0. 05) after controlling for age, household size, and food <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiary</b> status. Similarly, children 30 - 59 months of age were significantly less likely to suffer from acute malnutrition (OR= 0. 45; 95 % CI= 0. 26, 0. 79; p< 0. 01) and less likely to be underweight (OR= 0. 37; 95 % CI= 0. 27, 0. 51; p< 0. 01) than children 6 - 29 months of age, after adjusting for the other, aforementioned factors. The proportion of lost pregnancies was estimated at 7. 7 % (95 % CI= 4. 5 - 11. 0 %). A total of 215 deaths were reported during the year preceding the survey. Thirty-nine (18. 1 %) children < 5 years of age died. The CMR was 1. 23 / 10 000 /day (95 % CI= 1. 08 - 1. 38), and an U 5 MR was 1. 03 / 10 000 /day (95 % CI= 0. 71 - 1. 35). Diarrheal diseases, malaria, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) accounted for more than two-thirds of all deaths. Conclusions: The observed CMR in Tete Province, Mozambique is three times higher than the baseline rate for sub-Saharan Africa and 1. 4 times higher than the CMR cut-off point used to define excess mortality in emergencies. The current humanitarian response in Tete Province would benefit from an improved alignment of food aid programming in conjunction with diarrheal disease control, HIV/AIDS, and malaria prevention and treatment programs. The impact of the food programs would be improved if mutually acceptable food aid programme objectives, verifiable indicators relevant to each objective, and beneficiary targets and selection criteria are developed. Periodic re-assessments and evaluations of the impact of the program and evidenced-based decision-making urgently are needed to avert a chronic dependency on food aid. <br /...|$|E
30|$|At the sector-level, stress {{reduces the}} {{effectiveness}} of aid workers and fundamentally hinders their ability to provide services to <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> (Webster and Walker 2009).

Donors and their ‘unrealistic expectations’ were a key stressor for aid workers and respondents suggested that donors were unaware of the effect they had on aid workers.

40|$|Purpose This {{research}} takes Nigeria and {{the healthcare}} prevention sector {{as a case}} study to describe {{the manner in which the}} non-profit sector is presently dealing with the challenge of communicating in a multilingual/multicultural environment. The intention is to identify the linguistic factors that affect the design of healthcare prevention interventions, indicate language strategies that are being used and potentially single out opportunities for improvement. Design/Methodology/Approach Two data sets were employed: the main one representing phone interviews with Communication for Development practitioners in the healthcare domain in Nigeria and a secondary one including online testimonials from the Here I Am campaign conducted by the Global Fund. The data collected was analysed following the Critical Discourse Analysis three-level framework. In addition to this, the micro level stage incorporated Grounded Theory Method to elicit thematic relations, and Semiotic Analysis and Discursive Analysis to determine the stance of the speakers. Findings Participants to this research perceived language and culture as two entwined concepts. Communication in the community’s local language was said to enhance message acceptance. The thematic analysis revealed that the strategy to be used, mainly translation or a combination of community interpreting and cultural mediation, depends largely on the level of literacy of the community. Of the proposed language strategies, training of bilingual individuals and a combination of community interpreting and cultural mediation appeared to be the two pivotal modes of interlingual message transposition. Pictorials are used in extreme situations. Despite the dissimilarity of the two data sets used in this research, the discursive analysis suggested the existence of an aid beneficiaries/non-profit staff binary. The way of expression of <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and individuals working at grassroots level exhibited traits of dependency on other players (in this case donors and non-profit staff). Similarly, the discursive analysis of the interviews put forward that the non-profit staff interviewed tended to distinguish between themselves and Others (in this case, the <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries).</b> This research found furthermore that translation and interpreting activities within the non-profit sphere are not always undertaken according to strict professional ethics and praxis...|$|R
40|$|This book {{is about}} the {{relationship}} between donors and aid recipients in bilateral development cooperation programmes. Using the example of the Dutch District Rural Development Programmes (DRDPs) in Bukoba, Tanzania, it examines the processes in which the <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> are engaged, so that they can appropriate opportunities that accrue from the donors' projects. Carried out from 1987 until 2004, the programmes have not been evaluated as successful. However, instead of being guided by the pessimism of a perspective of failures, this thesis focuses on the processes in which aid is made relevant by the recipients. Aid recipients engage in organizing practices, that is, manoeuvre in a power-charged relationship in order to access and make use of the opportunities in an aid fabric. The overall conclusion of the study is that even though donor-funded development projects may not have achieved the donors' objectives, the resources (material and financial) that have come along with the projects have proven useful to the beneficiaries through the use of organizing practices with respect to livelihoods promotion.

40|$|Development may {{be defined}} as a human enterprise, an {{interactive}} inter-cultural process which seeks to actualise the highest potentials of human life (Casmir, 1991; Korten, 1986). The failure of development assistance programs over the past fifty years to promote long term development has led to an increasing concern with the efficiency and effectiveness of aid delivery. Development literature refers to a range of dimensions which characterise the changing approach to the effective and efficient delivery of development assistance programs in the 1990 s. The most popular of these dimensions appear to be: sustainability, empowerment, participation, good governance, democracy and human rights. An historical review of development assistance over time and an analysis of each of these dimensions shows that there are some fundamental aspects of development assistance which have not changed over time: the need for effective communication; and equity, particularly gender equity. To improve the effectiveness and efficiency of aid delivery, it seems that development workers need to focus on the fundamental elements of the development relationship and be trained as competent cross-cultural and gender sensitive communicators who are able to establish synergistic and equitable relationships with <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> and use a range of communication channels and implementation methodologies to do so...|$|R

40|$|The European mining {{industry}} restructuring, initiated in 1990, {{had a negative}} impact on the demographic and socio-economic status in E. U. States. In Romania, the Government's decision, in 1997, of closing unprofitable mines was not accompanied by economical reconversion measures, thus leading to a poverty and depopulation phenomenon in the mining areas. This article aims to highlight the negative impact of mining cessation on demographic characteristics and socio-economic development in the mining area Altân Tepe, Stajaru village, Tulcea county, where the deposit with the highest concentrations of copper in Romania is located. The statistics show that the Government's decision to stop mining in 2003 caused an increase in the locals’ dependency to social aid and resulted in halving Altân Tepe’s inhabitant’s numbers between 2003 and 2014. The results were based on comparative analysis of three indicators: Evolution of the number of inhabitants in Altân Tepe between 1990 and 2003, Evolution of the number of inhabitants of Altân Tepe between 2003 and 2014, and Evolution of the number of social <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> between 2004 and 2014.

40|$|Background: Technique {{failure is}} an {{important}} issue for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. In this study, we aimed to analyze technique failure rate in detail and to determine the predictors for technique failure in Korea. Methods: We identified all patients who had started dialysis between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2008, in Korea, using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database. A total of 7, 614 PD patients were included, and the median follow-up was 24. 9  months. Results: The crude incidence rates of technique failure in PD patients were 54. 1 per 1, 000 patient-years. The cumulative 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -year technique failure rates of PD patients were 4. 9 %, 10. 3 %, and 15. 6 %, respectively. However, those technique failure rates by Kaplan–Meier analysis were overestimated compared with the values by competing risks analysis, and the differences increased with the follow-up period. In multivariate analyses, diabetes mellitus and Medical Aid as a crude reflection of low socioeconomic status were independent risk factors in both the Cox proportional hazard model and Fine and Gray subdistribution model. In addition, cancer was independently associated with a lower risk of technique failure in the Fine and Gray model.

40|$|Abstract The Zimbabwe food {{security}} situation has considerably worsened {{in view of}} the socio-economic and political climate at play in the country. It is argued in this research that food aid in the form of handouts, when administered to vulnerable groups, may temporarily insulate them from food insecurity problems. The study focused on the role and impact of food aid on the impoverished households of Gwanda District, in Matabeleland South Province {{in the southern part of}} Zimbabwe. An evaluation was needed to find out whether food aid has played a positive role on the livelihoods of the inhabitants of Gwanda District or otherwise. The study also wanted to ascertain whether government’s approach to ensuring {{food security}} had produced the intended results. A qualitative approach was adopted in this study and data was gathered through household interviews with food <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> in two wards of Gwanda District. Interviews were also conducted with the World Vision district management team as well as the community leadership. The study revealed that food aid, when timeously distributed, can improve the dietary status, nutrition, and consumption of many households in Gwanda District. It has saved the loss of many lives as well as led to long term development. On the other hand food aid has had a negative impact on food security is so far as it has changed people’s attitude towards self-reliance, and self-sustainability. It has creating a dependency syndrome and ushered a culture of negligence on the assumption that free food, will be administered even if one does not work in the fields, since the source of food it offers is easier to come by than by providing food oneself...|$|R
40|$|Both the European Commission’s {{decision-making}} and the EU case-law {{on state aid}} schemes are symptomatic of the uncertainty, and sometimes even contradiction, that is implicit in treatments of State aid, a discipline which form part of the Treaty’s rules on competition, in which, nonetheless the rights that undertakings enjoy are quite limited. This article examines the current position in the case-law on whether {{it is possible for}} undertakings (whether <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> or their competitors) to challenge the Commission’s decision on aid schemes, meaning state measures, often implemented in the form of legislation, that address a number of beneficiaries and that may fall under the prohibition set forth in Articles 107 et seq. TFEU. This is an area in which the Commission and the Community judicature are constantly doing battle. The Commission tends to view its decisions as purely general measures, and as such not open to challenge, the judicature has shown greater flexibility towards the undertakings that bring actions before it, frequently finding that these decisions affect applicants’ positions, and are thus subject to review. The article looks in particular at recent developments in the case-law that have applied Article 263 (4) TFEU, final limb, to State aid, finding that a decision on an aid scheme may in some cases constitute a regulatory act not entailing implementing measures. The aim is to show how in this field the case-law of the European courts, while complex and not always consistent, has nonetheless sought to listen to businesses’ concerns, gradually eroding the principle favoured by the Commission, that decisions on aid schemes are an exclusive matter between the Commission and the Member States...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991 resulted in a transition from centrally planned socialist systems to largely free-market systems for post-Soviet states. The health systems of Central Asian Post-Soviet (CAPS) countries (Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) have undergone a profound revolution. External development partners have been crucial to this reorientation through financial and technical support, though both relationships and outcomes have varied. This research provides a comparative review of the development assistance provided in the health systems of CAPS countries and proposes future policy options to improve the effectiveness of development. DESIGN: Extensive documentary review was conducted using Pubmed, Medline/Ovid, Scopus, and Google scholar search engines, local websites, donor reports, and grey literature. The review was supplemented by key informant interviews and participant observation. FINDINGS: The {{collapse of}} the Soviet dominance of the region brought many health system challenges. Donors have played {{an essential role in}} the reform of health systems. However, as new <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> neither CAPS countries' governments nor the donors had the experience of development collaboration in this context. The scale of development assistance for health in CAPS countries has been limited compared to other countries with similar income, partly due to their limited history with the donor community, lack of experience in managing donors, and a limited history of transparency in international dealings. Despite commonalities at the start, two distinctive trajectories formed in CAPS countries, due to their differing politics and governance context. CONCLUSIONS: The influence of donors, both financially and technically, remains crucial to health sector reform, despite their relatively small contribution to overall health budgets. Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Tajikistan have demonstrated more effective development cooperation and improved health outcomes; arguably, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have made slower progress in their health and socio-economic indices because of their resistance to open and accountable development relationships...|$|R

Humanitarian logistics activities occur across the disaster management cycle. Humanitarian logistics information systems not only improve logistics activities in each phase, but can improve the continuity of humanitarian operations by sharing information throughout the transition of different disaster management cycle phases. Through collaboration between organizations, humanitarian logistics information systems also have the potential to reduce corruption and the market distortion which can occur during humanitarian operations...|$|R
50|$|A {{good deal}} of {{criticism}} was levied against the halukkah. The Hebrew and Jewish press were almost unanimous in criticizing the method, principally for the reasons: (1) it promoted mendicancy and pauperism; (2) it encouraged idleness and thriftlessness; (3) it fostered divisions between the Sephardim and Ashkenazim; (4) it gave the controlling rabbis too much power to hamper and prevent modern schools for manual labor and secular knowledge; (5) the distributions were made unjustly, with many who do not need or deserve <b>aid</b> being <b>beneficiaries,</b> while others, like the Yemenite Jews and the extremely poor, were ignored. It was even claimed that the halukkah managers opposed the introduction of agriculture {{as a means of}} ameliorating the condition of the poor, and that they were hostile to the Zionist movement for fear it might interfere with them and end their power.|$|R
40|$|Over {{the course}} of the last decade there has been an {{increasing}} emphasis on recipient-country ownership, or the “effective exercise of a government’s authority over development policies and activities, including those that rely on external resources” (OECD 2007), within the international development community. This new emphasis is not only rhetorical but has resulted in a host of new aid programs promising increased ownership. Broadly speaking, these aid programs are supposed to change the institutional relationships between donors and recipient-country governments and allow <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> to have a say over the development policies that impact their daily lives. However, despite their prevalence, we know relatively little about how such aid programs affect donor-government relationships and the policy decision-making process in aid-dependent states. In the following dissertation project, I analyze four “ownership” aid programs in post-genocide Rwanda: the poverty reduction strategy program; budget support; the aid coordination, harmonization, and alignment framework; and the Rwandan Joint Governance Assessment. In each case study, I look for evidence that the aid program has resulted in the outcomes predicted by their proponents: increased government and citizen influence, and decreased donor influence. Data largely come from fieldwork I conducted in Rwanda during 2009 and 2010. My analysis suggests that key Rwandan government officials use the idea of ownership to seek influence over decision-making processes. However, the aforementioned aid programs have not resulted in the outcomes predicted by proponents of the ownership approach in two key ways. One, donors have not retreated nor given control over development policy to recipient countries. Rather they have sought alternative ways of influencing the policy process. Two, what we see emerging in Rwanda is not broad national ownership. Instead, donors work with an elite group of government policymakers. I call this type of aid relationship “centralized collaboration,” meaning that multilateral and bilateral donors work with a small group of domestic actors to design and implement socio-economic development strategies. I conclude by arguing that this outcome is largely the result of three things: donor preferences, the amount of leverage the GoR is able to exert over donors, and existing state-society relationships. These three factors provide a framework for assessing and analyzing donor-government relationships and ownership aid programs in other aid-dependent states...|$|R

Dutch and Flemish PIs active in The Gambia, Wet Africa, are examined {{on the basis of}} a critical analysis of the self-promotional material published on their websites. It is argued that PIs construct an image that exaggerates cultural and socio-economic differences between the European Self and the African Other, and that this needs to be understood in the context of the PIs' roots in tourism and other discourses of representing the Third World Other...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{issues related}} to aid in Ethiopia and provision of elder care in the US. The first essay assesses the targeting of two major aid interventions, public works and food aid. Both types of aid are primarily allocated through community-based targeting. The few studies that have analysed the accuracy of aid targeting in Ethiopia have shown biases along demography, geography and political affiliations lines. With the introduction in 2005 of the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP), a major social protection programme, several administrative guidelines were introduced aimed at improving targeting. This paper uses the last two rounds of the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey to investigate whether there were changes in both targeting determinants, and amount received for PSNP public works and food aid components from 2004 to 2009. Overall, the PSNP appears to be allocated {{on the basis of}} observable-poverty-related characteristics, and food aid on household demographics. In addition, results suggest for both PSNP and food <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> political connections are significant in determining receipt of the program in 2004, but no longer in 2009, indicating an improvement towards means-based targeting. The second essay investigates the long-term effectiveness of emergency aid in Ethiopia in pro- tecting child health from the negative effects of a severe drought that hit the country in 2011. Child malnutrition remains a critical issue in Ethiopia and the literature has shown that shocks can have long lasting effects on physical and cognitive development. Using the two rounds of the Ethiopian Rural Socioeconomic Survey (ERSS) collected in 2011 and 2013, I explore the impact of emergency aid on child height-for-age aged 0 - 36 months two years after the drought had occurred. Because aid was not randomly allocated, I use a matching estimator to account for selection into the programme. The results show that emergency aid was effective in protecting children that experienced the drought. In the last essay, I research the effects of kindergarten eligibility on the provision of elder care in the US. I am able to identify the trade-off between child care and elder care by exploiting age eligibility criterion for public kindergarten, in combination with state-level variation, in the provision of full-time kindergarten. Through a reduced form approach, I estimate the Intention to Treat (ITT) for the effect of eligibility to kindergarten on provision of elder care. The results show that having the youngest child aged 5 in states that offer full-time kindergarten increases the probability of providing elder care by around 9 percentage points, which corresponds to 63 percentage increase to the baseline. The effect is higher for females (9. 2) than for males (8. 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{displacement}} in Colombia is a country-wide {{phenomenon that}} has affected almost {{five percent of}} the country's population or 14 % of the country's rural population. Colombia's violent conflict has not reached yet a post-conflict stage since no peace agreement has been reached between the State and violent actors. This makes an analysis of the effects of displacement and of the state-led initiatives relating to it, such as the Familias en Accion para la poblacion desplazada, highly relevant to the current status of this humanitarian crisis. Using a unique data set from Colombia, the National Survey of Displaced Households (ENHD) performed in 2004, this thesis examines the educational situation of displaced children and studies the impact of various forces, including government policy, on the schooling of displaced children. The dissertation investigates the following questions: 1) What are the main factors determining the enrollment of internally displaced children at the destination municipalities? 2) What is the effect associated with the participation in the Familias en Accion for IDPs Program on enrollment? 3) What is the prevalence of school overage among internally displaced children and what are its main determinants? With respect to the first research question, the results show that children who are members of a female-headed household have a lower probability of being enrolled in school. Conversely, children whose head of household is literate have a higher probability of enrollment. The research is also able to examine the impact of how long families have been displaced. The results show that after a year, children's probability of enrollment increases significantly, bouncing upwards relative to the period immediately following displacement. Finally, the results show that higher household income is associated with greater enrollment, but in a nonlinear way: if a household belongs to the first three income quintiles the probability of enrollment does not increase significantly, but for the fourth and fifth income quintiles, the probability of enrollment increases by 10 and 12 percentage points evaluated at the mean. The second research question examines the effect of the Familias en Accion for IDPs Program on enrollment using a difference in differences (DID) model. The results obtained using the DID approach show that children whose families are <b>aid</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> {{are more likely to be}} enrolled in schools, holding other things constant. The third research question in the dissertation looks at the prevalence - and determinants - of school overage among internally displaced children. It is estimated that there are two years of overage after displacement which comes from the fact that this population is forced to leave their places of origin and resettle in other destinations, time during which children are not be able to enroll in school thus affecting their attainment...|$|R
