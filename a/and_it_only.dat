5|$|The {{adult male}} and female both are active in {{protecting}} and feeding the fledged chicks until they learn to forage on their own. The adult robin gives alarm calls and dives in a threatening manner towards creatures it considers potential predators, such as approaching cats, dogs and humans. The fledglings are able to fly short distances after leaving the nest. The wings of juvenile birds develop rapidly, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> takes {{a couple of weeks}} for them to become proficient at flying. The cryptically colored young birds perch in bushes or trees for protection from predators.|$|E
5|$|The arms contain tension sensors so the octopus {{knows whether}} its arms are {{stretched}} out, {{but this is}} not sufficient for the brain to determine the position of the octopus's body or arms. As a result, the octopus does not possess stereognosis; that is, it does not form a mental image of the overall shape of the object it is handling. It can detect local texture variations, but cannot integrate the information into a larger picture. The neurological autonomy of the arms means the octopus has great difficulty learning about the detailed effects of its motions. It has a poor proprioceptive sense, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> knows what exact motions were made by observing the arms visually.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years after}} the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for {{physicians}} to prescribe contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses). This second clinic, the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923. To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> provided services to married women. The existence of the clinic was finally announced {{to the public in}} December 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years of struggle, birth control had finally become widely accepted in the United States. The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Greek land was {{well suited for}} olive trees, which {{provided}} olive oil. The growing of olive trees dates back to early Greek history. Olive plantations are a long-term investment: {{it takes more than}} twenty years for the tree to provide fruit, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> fruits every other year. Grapes also do well in the rocky soil, but demand a lot of care. Grapes have been grown since the Bronze age.|$|E
25|$|Canada has {{the tenth}} largest coal {{reserves}} in the world, an enormous amount considering the sparse population of the country. However, {{the vast majority of}} those reserves are located hundreds or thousands of kilometres from the country's industrial centers and seaports, and the effect of high transportation costs is that they remain largely unexploited. As with other natural resources, regulation of coal production is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the provincial governments, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> enters federal jurisdiction when it is imported or exported from Canada.|$|E

25|$|In Estonia trams {{are used}} {{only in the}} capital, Tallinn. There has been a growing tram network in Tallinn since 1888, when traffic was started by horse-powered trams. The first line was {{electrified}} on 28 October 1925. Estonian-built electric trams were also used, with some gas-powered trams also used in the 1920s and 1930s. The {{last part of the}} system to be electrified was the spur to Kopli in 1951 (also converted to double track at the time) <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> was connected {{to the rest of the}} network in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Orion {{is located}} on the {{celestial}} equator, but it will not always be so located due to the effects of precession of the Earth's axis. Orion lies well south of the ecliptic, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> happens to lie on the celestial equator because the point on the ecliptic that corresponds to the June solstice is close to the border of Gemini and Taurus, to the north of Orion. Precession will eventually carry Orion further south, and by AD 14000 Orion will be far enough south that it will become invisible from the latitude of Great Britain.|$|E

25|$|Baxter {{is a new}} robot {{introduced}} in 2012 which learns by guidance. A worker could teach Baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having Baxter memorize them. Extra dials, buttons, and controls are available on Baxter's arm for more precision and features. Any regular worker could program Baxter <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> takes a matter of minutes, unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding {{in order to be}} used. This means Baxter needs no programming in order to operate. No software engineers are needed. This also means Baxter can be taught to perform multiple, more complicated tasks. Sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller, more precise tasks.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan's {{governance}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} conflicted in the region. The military rule and the unstable government in Pakistan has become a concern for the South Asian region. In Nepal, the governance has struggled to come in the side of democracy <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> showed signs in the recent past, basically in the 21st century, to support the democratic system. The political situation in Sri Lanka has been dominated by an increasingly assertive Sinhalese nationalism, and the emergence of a Tamil separatist movement under LTTE, which was suppressed in May 2009. Myanmar's politics is dominated by a military Junta, which has sidelined the democratic forces led by Aung San Suu Kyi.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 {{the team}} {{moved up to}} Group 6 with the LC1 Spyder, {{followed}} by the Group C LC2 coupé which featured a Ferrari powerplant in 1983. The LC2 was a match for the standard-setting Porsche 956 in terms of raw speed, securing 13 pole positions over its lifetime, however its results were hampered by poor reliability and fuel economy <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> managed to win three European and World Endurance Championship races. The team's inability to compete against the dominant Porsche 956 and 962 sports cars led it {{to drop out of}} sportscar racing at the end of 1986 in order to concentrate on rallying, although private teams continued to enter LC2s with declining results until the early 1990s.|$|E

PIA had also planned non-stop flights to New York, Chicago, Washington, and Houston {{but was not}} given permission by US authorities (unless the airline implemented a European stopover on the flight to American cities).
