40|$|Abstract. The wide {{availability}} of high bandwidth public wireless networks {{as well as}} the miniaturisation of medical sensors and network access hardware allow the development of advanced <b>ambulant</b> <b>patient</b> monitoring systems. The MobiHealth project developed a complete system and service that allows the continuous monitoring of vital signals and their transmission to the health care institutes in real time using GPRS and UMTS networks. The MobiHealth system is based on the concept of a Body Area Network allowing high personalization of the monitored signals and thus adaptation to different classes of patients. The system and service has been trialed in four European countries and for different patient cases. First results confirm the usefulness of the system and the advantages it offers to patients and medical personnel. ...|$|E

40|$|Neuromuscular {{disorders}} are characterised by progressive muscle weakness, which in time causes functional impairment. To quantify {{the extent of}} disease progression, muscle force and functional ability can be measured. Which of these parameters changes most depends on the disease stage. In a previous study, we reported normal values for muscle force obtained by handheld dynamometry in healthy children aged 4 - 16 years. In the present study, we report normal values for timed functional tests in healthy children aged 4 - 11 years. These normal values were compared with values obtained in 16 <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) aged 5 - 8 years to study the extent of functional impairment. In <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> with DMD, we found that muscle function assessed by timed functional tests (running 9 m and rising up from the floor) and muscle force assessed by hand-held dynamometry were severely impaired. However, a small reduction of muscle force {{was accompanied by a}} large reduction in functional ability. Therefore, in our group of <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> with DMD, timed functional testing was the most sensitive parameter {{to determine the extent of}} disease progression.

40|$|Background: Prednisone {{treatment}} {{is used to}} prolong ambulation in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, since severe adverse effects often accompany prednisone treatment, it is debatable whether the benefits of prednisone treatment outweigh its adverse effects. Objectives: To {{study the effects of}} prednisone on muscle function and {{to determine the extent of}} steroid-related adverse effects and their influence on the quality of life of <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> with DMD. Design: A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with 6 months of treatment: prednisone or placebo (0. 75 mg/kg daily) during the first 10 days of each month. After a washout period of 2 months, patients received the other regimen for an additional 6 months. Setting: University hospital and rehabilitation center in the Netherlands. Patients: Seventeen <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> with DMD aged 5 to 8 years. Main Outcome Measure: Change in muscle function assessed by timed functional testing: running 9 m, climbing 4 standard-sized stairs, and rising from the floor to a standing position. Results: The increase in time needed to run 9 m (P =. 005) and to climb 4 standard-sized stairs (P =. 02) was significantly lower during the prednisone period. Conclusions: Prednisone slowed deterioration of muscle function and muscle force in <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> with DMD.

40|$|SUMMARY A new {{technique}} for assessing implanted cardiac pacemaker {{function in the}} <b>ambulant</b> <b>patient</b> has been introduced and assessed. A modified portable electrocardiograph recorder is used to store 24 hours of electrocardiograms along with marker pulses indicating the timing of pacemaker impulses. The recorder detects this narrow impulse and records a wider marker pulse on a second channel. The false positive detection rate was estimated from recordings, each of 24 hours, taken from 10 patients. All of these patients were ambulant and none had a cardiac pacemaker. There was on average less than one false positive per 24 hours. When similar recordings were taken {{from a group of}} 15 patients with pacemakers, the average false positive rate in 13 of these patients was also less than one per 24 hours. In the two other recordings artefacts resulted in false positive rates of 28 and 960 per 24 hours. Failure to detect pacemaker pulses was confirmed in only one patient. In addition to determining the accuracy of pacemaker pulse detection, the clinical usefulness of this technique was assessed. Two patients had fixed-rate pacemakers and 13 had demand pacemakers. Of the latter, two patients had a total of three episodes of failure to sense, one patient frequently failed to capture, and six patients had episodes of inappropriate inhibition of th...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{infusion of}} drugs {{during the course}} of general anaesthesia is becoming more popular. This is because of the increasing number of suitable short-acting drugs, and the improve-ments and reduced cost of suitable delivery devices. The features of an ideal infusion device for use during general anaesthesia are that it should be: reliable, compact, easy to set up and use, battery powered; should use standard disposables (syringes/infusion sets); function independent of gravity; and should have a computer interface. The Graseby Medical MS 16 A pump (fig. 1) satisfies the majority of these requirements. It is a compact battery-operated syringe driver of the type used by diabetic patients. Its small size and light weight make it convenient to use in the <b>ambulant</b> <b>patient,</b> and it accommodates any size of syringe from 2 ml to 20 ml. The infusion rate (mm h" 1) of plunger travel is set by adjusting the two rotary dials {{on the front of the}} pump. Independent evaluation has found it to be reliable and accurate (Rithalia and Tinker, 1981; Health Equipment Information, 1982). Unfortunately, it lacks a facility for computer control, a feature important for the development of closed-loop administration systems, or for the automated delivery of multi-stage infusions of drugs. Commercial computer-controlled pumps are available, but are expensive. This paper describes a modification of the Graseby MS 16 A pump and an interface to allow its control by microcomputer. The interface was designed to be connected via the serial (RS 232) port that is found on most microcomputers. It could easily be modified to use a parallel port...|$|E

A seven-level scale of trunk control was used (1 : head control only; 7 : control of entire trunk while unsupported). Static, active and reactive posture control were evaluated in <b>ambulant</b> and non-ambulant <b>patients.</b> Inter-rater reliability for all assessments was evaluated by calculating the kappa coefficient.

40|$|Information on the {{mechanism}} of gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with reflux disease is limited largely to studies in resting recumbent subjects. Evidence exists that both posture and physical activity may influence reflux. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate reflux mechanisms in <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> with reflux oesophagitis. Concurrent ambulatory oesophageal manometry and pH monitoring were performed in 11 <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> with erosive oesophagitis. Lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure was monitored with a perfused sleeve sensor. Recordings were made for 90 min before and 180 min after a meal. At set times patients sat in a chair or walked. LOS pressure was < or = 2 mmHg at the time of reflux for 98 % of reflux episodes. Transient LOS relaxation was the most common pattern overall and the predominant pattern in seven patients, whilst persistently absent basal LOS pressure was the most common pattern in four patients. The pattern of LOS pressure was not altered by the presence of hiatus hernia or by walking. Straining occurred at the onset of 31 % of acid reflux episodes but often followed the development of an oesophageal common cavity. The occurrence of straining was not influenced by walking. In <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> with reflux oesophagitis: (1) LOS pressure is almost always absent at the time of reflux, usually because of transient LOS relaxation, (2) persistently absent basal LOS pressure is an important mechanism of reflux in a few patients, (3) straining may help to induce acid reflux in a variable proportion of occasions and may in some instances be a response to gas reflux, and (4) walking does not influence the occurrence of reflux or its mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Graduated {{compression}} {{devices are}} considered the standard care for management of venous and lymphatic disorders. Recently compression devices exerting a pressure over the calf higher than over the ankle have been {{proved to be more}} effective than traditional graduated devices in increasing the impaired ejection fraction (EF) from the lower leg in patients with venous disease. Aim of this work is presenting an overview of the new concept on progressive compression, its potential benefits and limits. In different series of tests, the EF from the lower leg was assessed in 70 patients with severe reflux in the great saphenous vein (GSV). EF was measured by strain gauge plethysmography, in baseline conditions and after applying graduated compression devices or the new inversely graduated or progressive compression (PC) devices. The interface pressure was recorded, simultaneously with the EF, both in the gaiter area (B 1 point) and at the calf (C point) in order to assess the compression pressure profile. EF, severely impaired in patients with GSV reflux, was increased by compression. So called PC devices (both PC elastic stocking and PC inelastic bandages) were significantly more effective than graduated compression in increasing the ejection fraction. The higher the pressure on the calf the higher the EF improvement. Maintaining the same strong pressure over the calf by means of two progressive stockings and increasing the pressure only over the calf to restore a graduated compression didn’t improve the EF. To improve venous pumping function in the <b>ambulant</b> <b>patient</b> stronger compression of the calf is more effective than graduated compression.

40|$|Background: The exact {{pre-operative}} {{diagnosis of}} a low invasive and complication-poor biopsy-method is often problematic. Often, the taken tissue-specimen is not sufficient impeded in order to investigate the exact histopathology of soft-tissue-tumors, which complicates an adequate operative therapy. Vacuum-assisted-biopsy is a new method whose valence histopathology diagnosis for the praeoperative of soft-tissue-tumors, has not yet examined scientifically. The feasibility and the exact pre-operative diagnosis became in this study, with patients with suspicion on a sarcoma in the comparison to the established incisional biopsy examines. Methods: From 2004 to 2006 116 patients with an unclear soft-tissue-lession received a preoperative vacuum-assisted-biopsies. The vacuum-assisted-biopsies were performed using ultrasound. Prospective histological results of the vaccum-assisted biopsies were correlated with the definitive histological findings. These results were compared to a previous control-group where the established incisional biopsy method was employed (110 patients). Results: The vacuum-assisted biopsy was successfully performed in 115 patients. There were technical problems in only one case. The histological diagnosis was correct in 72 out of 75 (95 percent) patients, with a sensitivity of 94 percent. The vacuum-assisted biopsy had an accuracy of 95 percent. The definitive histological findings had a kappa-test correlation of 0, 937. The incisional biopsy method was also correct in 67 out of 75 (89 percent) compared to 65 out of 74 patients (88 percent). The vacuum-assisted biopsy shows comparable results {{with those of the}} incisional biopsy, and better diagnostic results as the conventional biopsies. Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of soft-tissue-tumors, vacuum-assisted-biopsy is a viable alternative method to the incisional biopsy. The vacuum-assisted biopsy can be done in on <b>ambulant</b> <b>patient</b> setting. This technique provide a reliable histological diagnosis in patients with soft tissue tumors. It is easy to use, and can increase patient well being in comparison to established incisional methods.

40|$|Dejerine–Sottas {{syndrome}} (DSS) is {{an early}} onset demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathy with motor nerve conduction velocities below 12 m s− 1. The phenotype is genetically heterogeneous, and autosomal dominant (AD) as well as autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance is described. Nerve pathology is highly variable. It is generally presumed that clinical course is severe, leading to wheelchair dependency at an early age. In this study we documented the clinical and pathological features in 25 patients with a DSS and we evaluated the clinical course.

DESIGN: Prospective study in a selected group {{of men and women}} undergoing elective cardiac catheterisation, with next day physical inspection. SETTING: Inpatient study. SUBJECTS: Two hundred consecutive <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> submitted to diagnostic cardiac catheterisation through the femoral arterial route using 5 F catheters: a femoral right heart study was done {{at the same time in}} 40 patients (20 %). RESULTS: No patient had major complications during the study. Early ambulation was not allowed in two patients (1 %) because of haematoma formation immediately after sheath removal, and in seven (3 %) because of poor haemostasis or haematoma on inspection at 3 h. Early ambulation was interrupted in two patients (1 %) because of transient arterial hypotension on standing in one, and the patient's preference in the other. Of 189 patients who resumed full ambulation at 3 h, one (0. 5 %) had a groin haematoma on discharge the next morning. Overall, haematoma 12 h after cardiac catheterisation was present in seven of the 200 patients initially included in the study (3. 5 %). None of the 191 patients with attempted early mobilisation had signs or symptoms of vascular complications one month or later after discharge.

It is important that all orthopaedic interventions and the dates of these interventions, {{as well as the}} response, rehabilitation and functional response of the patient, be documented prior to transition. For <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients,</b> records of three-dimensional gait analysis, gait patterns and changes relevant to tone management, the use of orthoses and orthopaedic surgery contribute to clear communication. In our centre, <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> receive serial two-dimensional video recordings of gait from an early age and instrumented gait analysis (three-dimensional gait analysis) at intervals, including before selective dorsal rhizotomy, single-event multilevel surgery and at intervals thereafter [30]. When possible, we encourage a full three-dimensional gait analysis immediately prior to transition in order to advise the person with CP, their family and their future carers about functional status and expected future issues. In this “exit” or transition gait analysis, we describe fully the utilisation of assistive devices when appropriate, using the FMS [24]. In addition, we carefully compare gait parameters and function with and without orthoses, thereby providing adolescents and parents with the information—based on objective measurements—on just how much the current use of orthoses is helping gait and function. This approach provides additional information to the adolescent patient which he/she can base his/her personal choice for the ongoing utilisation of both assistive devices and orthoses. In this regard, serial examinations of composite gait indices including the Gait Profile Score are helpful [31]. At a glance, these scores all demonstrate whether gait function is static, improving or deteriorating [32].|$|R
40|$|International audiencePulse wave {{analysis}} (PWA) using applanation tonometry is a {{non-invasive technique}} for assessing cardiovascular function. It produces three important indices: ejection duration index (ED%), augmentation index adjusted for heart rate (AIX@ 75), and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR%). The {{aim of this}} study was to assess within- and between-observer repeatability of these measurements. After resting supine for 15 minutes, 20 <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients</b> (16 male) in sinus rhythm underwent four PWA measurements on a single occasion. Two nurses (A & B) independently and alternately undertook PWA measurements using the same equipment (Omron HEM- 757; SphygmoCor with Millar hand-held tonometer) blind to the other nurse's PWA measurements. Within- and between-observer differences were analysed using the Bland-Altman `limits of agreement' approach (mean difference ± 2 standard deviations, 2 SD). Mean age was 56 (blood pressure, BP 136 / 79; pulse rate 64). BP/PWA measurements remained stable during assessment. Based on the average of two PWA measurements the mean ± 2 SD between-observer difference in ED% was 0. 3 ± 2. 0; AIX@ 75 1. 0 ± 3. 9; and SEVR% 1. 7 ± 14. 2. Based on a single PWA measurement the between-observer difference was ED% 0. 3 ± 3. 3; AIX@ 75 1. 7 ± 6. 9; and SEVR% 0. 6 ± 22. 6. Within-observer differences for nurse-A were ED% 0. 0 ± 5. 4; AIX@ 75 1. 5 ± 7. 0; and SEVR% 1. 7 ± 39. 0 (nurse-B: 0. 1 ± 3. 8; 0. 1 ± 8. 0; and 0. 6 ± 23. 3, respectively). PWA demonstrates high levels of repeatability even when used by relatively inexperienced staff and has the potential to be included in the routine cardiovascular assessment of <b>ambulant</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R
