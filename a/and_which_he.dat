5|$|Hollis {{is a young}} Federal Bureau of Investigation {{special agent}} who becomes a protégée to {{offender}} profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) when he begins working in Virginia. She struggles to understand the criminal mind, as her sister was murdered by a man with no motive. She has an estranged half-sister, Tamra, who has become a heroin addict. Hollis also {{has to deal with}} her father's bout with an Alzheimer's-like illness, which has possibly been induced by the Millennium Group—a secretive organisation to which Black had previously belonged, <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> now believes to be responsible for bioterrorism. Group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) uses Hollis' father's illness as leverage to coerce her into cooperating with the Millennium Group.|$|E
5|$|However the Eleans, Messenians and Spartans {{remained}} passive throughout 210 BC, and Philip {{continued to}} make advances. He invested and took Echinus, using extensive siegeworks, having beaten back an attempt to relieve the town by the Aetolian strategos Dorimachus and the Roman fleet, now commanded by the proconsul Publius Sulpicius Galba. Moving west Philip probably also took Phalara {{the port city of}} Lamia, in the Maliac Gulf. Sulpicius and Dorimachus took Aegina, an island in the Saronic Gulf, which the Aetolians sold to Attalus, the Pergamene king, for thirty talents, <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> was to use as his base of operations against Macedon in the Aegean Sea.|$|E

Although his articles mostly focused on over-the-board play, a significant number featured correspondence chess. Some followed with enthusiasm the progress of promising youngsters, including Paul Morphy. Staunton produced over 1,400 weekly articles for The Illustrated London News.|$|E

5|$|Wilberforce {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session. However, in January 1788, he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, now thought to be ulcerative colitis. It was several months before {{he was able to}} resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> continued to use {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself with the work and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
5|$|In 1181 Bardulf was at {{the court}} of King Henry II of England, where he was steward, or dapifer, an office he held {{throughout}} Henry's reign <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> may have held throughout the next reign also. He held that office until Henry's death in 1189. From about 1185 until 1203, Bardulf was a royal justice almost annually, usually as a justice of eyre rather than sitting at Westminster. He performed the duties of sheriff for the following counties: Cornwall from 1184–1187, Wiltshire from 1187 to 1189, Somerset during 1188 and 1189 along with Dorset during the same period, the counties of Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Leicestershire during 1190 and 1191, Yorkshire from 1191 to 1194, Westmorland from 1191 to 1199, Northumberland from 1194 to 1198, Cumberland during 1198 and 1199, Cornwall again from 1199 to 1200 along with Devonshire, and Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire from 1200 to 1203. In 1194 Bardulf was mentioned on the escheat roll as responsible for the farm of lands held by Osbert de Bayeux, an archdeacon of York.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Stainer {{was offered}} the post of Inspector of Music in Schools and Colleges, a {{position}} he took with great seriousness <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> occupied for six years. He worked towards raising standards in music teaching and toured the country, visiting schools and colleges and examining candidates. He advocated the use of musical notation and tonic sol-fa rather than the learning-by-ear method previously used. He was by now treated with the greatest respect in musical circles, but his many activities diminished the time available for composition. The flow of new anthems and service music slowed down, but in 1883 he completed his oratorio Mary Magdalen. This was followed in 1887 by The Crucifixion, the work {{for which he is}} most remembered.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring {{tax cuts for the}} rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} Dover, Pistrucci had {{difficulty}} with Customs, possibly caused by Bonelli's malice. Once {{he was able}} to, he journeyed to London. He had letters of introduction to several people, and Charles Konig, Keeper of Minerals at the British Museum, proved a loyal friend. Through Konig, Pistrucci met the famous naturalist, Sir Joseph Banks, who commissioned the artist to do a portrait of him. While Banks was sitting for Pistrucci, the connoisseur Richard Payne Knight came by, anxious to show Sir Joseph a cameo fragment he had purchased, <b>and</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> dated to Ancient Greece. After Banks praised it highly, Pistrucci, on examining it, identified it as his own work, displaying the secret mark he had placed on it. The incident increased Pistrucci's reputation in London.|$|E
