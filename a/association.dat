40|$|Making <b>associations</b> between sensory stimuli is a {{critical}} aspect of behavior. Our laboratory previously showed that neurons in the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area of Macaca mulatta reflect learned <b>associations</b> between directions of moving visual stimuli. Individual LIP neurons might encode <b>associations</b> only for specific stimuli, such as motion directions; alternatively, they may encode more general <b>associations</b> whenever animals must decide between discrete alternatives. To test this, we asked whether LIP neurons encode learned <b>associations</b> between pairs of arbitrarily chosen static shapes and, in a separate task, whether the same neurons also encode <b>associations</b> between motion directions. The experimental design dissociated the visual <b>associations</b> from the movements used to report those <b>associations.</b> We found robust encoding of the learned pair <b>associations</b> between shapes, and shape-pair selective neurons tended to also be selective for direction <b>associations.</b> These findings suggest that representing generic categorical outcomes may be a fundamental role of parietal neurons.
