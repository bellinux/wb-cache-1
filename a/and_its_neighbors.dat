5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> {{had to be}} routed through departmental headquarters in Washington. After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{conflicts}} occurred between the Empire <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors.</b> Brazil experienced no serious conflicts {{with its neighbors}} {{to the north and}} west, due to the buffer of the nearly impenetrable and sparsely populated Amazonian rainforest. In the south, however, the colonial disputes inherited from Portugal and Spain over the control of the navigable rivers and plains which formed the frontiers continued after independence. The lack of mutually agreed borders in this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine War to the Paraguayan War.|$|E
5|$|From 1828 {{with the}} Treaty of Turkmenchay to the October Revolution in 1917, Eastern Armenia {{was part of}} the Russian Empire and partly {{confined}} to the borders of the Erivan Governorate. After the October Revolution, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin's government announced that minorities in the empire could pursue a course of self-determination. Following the collapse of the empire, in May 1918 Armenia, <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> Azerbaijan and Georgia, declared their independence from Russian rule and each established their respective republics. After the near-annihilation of the Armenians during the Armenian Genocide and the subsequent Turkish-Armenian War, the historic Armenian area in the Ottoman Empire was overrun with despair and devastation.|$|E

5|$|Not all {{relations}} between Egypt <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> were peaceful during Djedkare's reign. In particular, {{one of the}} earliest known depictions of a battle or city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the 21st nome of Upper Egypt, who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty. The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders. More generally, ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in Canaan during the later Old Kingdom period but did not attempt to establish a permanent dominion there.|$|E
5|$|The former British colonies include Trinidad and Tobago, whose calypso {{style is}} an {{especially}} potent part of {{the music of the}} other former British colonies, which also share traditions like the Big Drum dance. The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular zouk style and have also had extensive musical contact with the music of Haiti, itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The Dutch colonies of Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba share the combined rhythm popular style. The islands also share a passion for kaseko, a genre of Surinamese music; Suriname <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> Guyana and French Guiana share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music.|$|E
5|$|In 1654, {{only five}} years after its passage, the Act was repealed. Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants {{following}} the execution of King Charles I of England and {{the outbreak of the}} English Civil War. In the early stages of that conflict, the colonial assembly of Maryland <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King. Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies, and two of them, the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett, took control of the colonial government in St. Mary's City in 1652. In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen, Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion. Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony's Protestants, and in 1657 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly. This time, it would last more than thirty years, until 1692.|$|E

5|$|Olga was {{genuinely}} popular and was extensively involved in charity work. On arrival in Athens, her immediate patronages included the Amalieion orphanage {{founded by the}} previous queen consort Amalia of Oldenburg, and the Arsakeion school for girls located on University Boulevard. With her personal support {{and the support of}} wealthy donors, she built asylums for the terminally ill and for the elderly disabled, and a sanatorium for patients with consumption. She founded a society to help the poor, a kindergarten for the children of the poor, and a soup kitchen in Piraeus that doubled as a cooking school for poor girls that was later expanded into a weaving school for girls and elderly women in financial difficulty. She was patron of two military hospitals and endowed the Evangelismos (Annunciation) Hospital, Greece's largest, in downtown Athens. She built the Russian Hospital in Piraeus in memory of her daughter, Alexandra, who died in Moscow in 1891. Although aimed primarily at Russian sailors, the hospital was open to all seamen visiting Greece, with consultation fees set at the low rate of thirty lepta and medicines being free. Olga also supported the establishment and funding of hospitals during the conflicts between Greece <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors,</b> including the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and the First Balkan War (1912–13). For their work for the wounded, Olga and her daughter-in-law Crown Princess Sophia were awarded the Royal Red Cross by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom in December 1897.|$|E

25|$|The {{geographical}} {{references in}} the Odyssey to Ithaca <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> seem confused and have {{given rise to}} much scholarly argument, beginning in ancient times. Odysseus's Ithaca is usually identified with the island traditionally called Thiaki and now officially renamed Ithake, but some scholars have argued that Odysseus's Ithaca is actually Leucas, and others identify it with the whole or part of Cephalonia. Lately, Robert Bittlestone, in his book Odysseus Unbound, has identified the Paliki peninsula on Cephalonia with Homeric Ithaca.|$|E
25|$|Truly alpine terrain {{appears in}} the {{southern}} mountain ranges. Between the Black and Caspian seas, the Caucasus Mountains rise to impressive heights, forming a boundary between Europe and Asia. One of the peaks, Mount Elbrus, is the highest point in Europe, at 5,642 meters. The geological structure of the Caucasus extends to the northwest as the Crimean and Carpathian Mountains and southeastward into Central Asia as the Tian Shan and Pamirs. The Caucasus Mountains create an imposing natural barrier between Russia <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> to the southwest, Georgia and Azerbaijan.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, anti-Spanish sentiments {{in several}} South American {{countries}} (including Bolivia, Chile and Ecuador) increased. It {{was obvious to}} most observers that Spain {{had no intention of}} retaking its former colonies. However, Peru <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> still remained wary of any moves that might foreshadow an attempt to reestablish the Spanish Empire. Given the climate of suspicion, no one was surprised when the Spanish gunboat Vencedora stopped at a Chilean port for coal and President José Joaquín Pérez declared that coal was a war supply that could not be sold to a belligerent nation.|$|E
25|$|Using both {{written and}} archaeological data, some {{comparisons}} {{can be drawn}} between the food of ancient Israel <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors.</b> Although there is much information about the foods of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the inferences {{that can be made}} are limited due to differences in topography and climate; Israelite agriculture also depended on rainfall rather than the river-based irrigation of these two civilizations, resulting in the preference for different crops. Ugarit and Phoenicia were closer neighbors of ancient Israel, and shared a topography and climate similar to that of ancient Israel. Thus, conclusions about the food and drink in ancient Israel have been made with some confidence from this evidence.|$|E
25|$|Aberdeen {{was founded}} by Samuel Benn in 1884 and {{incorporated}} on May 12, 1890. Although it became the largest and best-known city in Grays Harbor, Aberdeen lagged behind nearby Hoquiam and Cosmopolis in the early years. When A.J. West built the town's first sawmill in 1894, the other two municipalities had been in business for several years. Aberdeen <b>and</b> <b>its</b> <b>neighbors</b> vied to be the terminus for Northern Pacific Railroad, but instead of ending {{at one of the}} established mill towns, the railroad skimmed through Cosmopolis and headed west for Ocosta. Hoquiam and Aberdeen citizens together built a spur; and in 1895, the line connected Northern Pacific tracks to Aberdeen.|$|E
