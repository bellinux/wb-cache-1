Among the largest employers of Arlington residents are the Boeing Everett Factory and Naval Station Everett. The {{expansion of the}} aerospace industry in the Seattle region led Arlington to develop its own municipal airport into an aerospace job center, which includes {{a high concentration of}} Boeing subcontractors. , the airport has 130 on-site businesses that employ 590 people, with a total output of $94.5 million annually.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being the}} capital city, Kota Kinabalu {{is also the}} main {{industrial}} and commercial centre for Sabah. The economy {{is dominated by the}} primary sector of industry. Historically, the secondary sector dominated the economy, but due to rapid urbanisation and economic development, this sector of the economy is slowly diminishing. More recently, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> a more tertiary-based industry has become more apparent, especially with regards to the boom in the tourism industry. Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies have their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role involved 'coolie' (slavery work) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.|$|E

5|$|In art, {{the first}} {{significant}} group {{to emerge in the}} 20th century were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s: John Duncan Fergusson (1874–1961), Francis Cadell (1883–1937), Samuel Peploe (1871–1935) and Leslie Hunter (1877–1931). Influenced by the Fauvists, they have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland. In the inter-war period, elements of modernism and the Scottish Renaissance, were incorporated into art by figures including Stanley Cursiter (1887–1976), who was influenced by Futurism, and William Johnstone (1897–1981), whose work marked <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> abstraction. Johnstone also played a part in developing the concept of a Scottish Renaissance with poet Hugh MacDiarmid, which attempted to introduce elements of modernism into Scottish cultural life and bring it into line with contemporary art elsewhere. James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–) were influenced by elements of surrealism.|$|E
5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked {{to stay on the}} beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} {{forestation}} in the area, sawmilling was an important and early industry, starting in the 1830s. In the early 20th century, there were around 20 sawmills in Meander and the surrounding localities. Due to <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> closer settlement—smaller land plots and resulting greater population density—demand for timber in Meander increased and new sawmills were built in Meander in the 1910s and 1920s. Some of these mills continued into the late 20th century. Sawmilling later declined, partly {{due to lack of}} timber. Timberworld is the only remaining sawmill, though this is not its only business. It opened in 1985 as a sawmill supplying local Australian blackwood, myrtle beach and Blackheart Sassafras, originally operating from the former Baptist Church building. From 1990 it was owned and run by Kerin Booth and Kim Booth and it relocated to the former site of the Cummings Bros sawmill. Kim Booth, leader of the Tasmanian Greens, later passed management of the company to his son, Bronte. At one time Timberworld employed 30 people. The company now focuses on supply of prefabricated homes.|$|E

5|$|From the 1980s {{there was}} a {{backlash}} against the statism and compressive nature of modernist architecture. Instead there was <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> a form of post-modernism that looked to a clash of styles with a renewed emphasis on visual aesthetics that invoked classicism. There was also {{a combination of the}} private and the public. This movement against modernism also included renewed influence by the Scots baronial and Mackintosh-inspired designs; these can be seen respectively in the Scandic Crown Hotel (1988–89) in the Old Town in Edinburgh and the National Library Causewayside Building (1985–87, extended 1993–94). The most significant figure in the development of architecture in Scotland from the 1980s was the academic Charles McKean. He was secretary and treasurer of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) from 1979 to 1995. He argued against motorway expansion and the production of grey, colourless monoliths. Early private works influenced by these ideas included the D. & D. Warehouse, Centre Street and the Bank of Pakistan in Sauchiehall Street, both in Glasgow. Public structures included the building to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow (1981) and the Glasgow Sheriff Court (1980–86).|$|E

25|$|By the 1950s, {{concerns}} {{about the level of}} care children were receiving in institutions led to the closing down of some larger orphanages and children's homes and <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>towards</b> group care in smaller cottage and foster homes.
