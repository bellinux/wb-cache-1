Jackson proposed to test if this were actually possible. Professor Christopher Ramsey, the director of the Oxford University Radiocarbon <b>Accelerator</b> <b>Unit,</b> took the theory seriously and agreed to collaborate with Jackson in testing a series of linen samples that could determine if the case for the Shroud's authenticity should be re-opened. He told the BBC that [...] "With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which we have about the Shroud, {{there does seem to be}} a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence."

[...] The parchment upon which the lower codex of the Sana'a manuscript is written has been radiocarbon dated with 99% accuracy to before 671 CE, with a 95.5% probability of being older than 661 CE and 75% probability from before 646 CE.

The Sana'a palimpsest {{is one of the}} most important manuscripts of the collection in the world. [...] This palimpsest has two layers of text, both of which are Quranic and written in the Hijazi script. While the upper text is almost identical with the modern Qurans in use (with the exception of spelling variants), the lower text contains significant diversions from the standard text. For example, in sura 2, verse 87, the lower text has wa-qaffaynā 'alā āthārihi whereas the standard text has wa-qaffaynā min ba'dihi. The Sana'a manuscript has the exact same verses and the same order of verses as the standard Qur'an. The order of the suras in the Sana'a codex is different from the order in the standard Qur'an. Such variants are similar to the ones reported for the Quran codices of Companions such as Ibn Masud and Ubay ibn Ka'b.

40|$|Radiotherapy is {{a common}} cancer {{treatment}} module, where {{a certain amount of}} dose will be delivered to the targeted organ.

The advent of multicore architectures is noteworthy in the HPC history, because it has brought the underlying concept of multiprocessing into common consideration and has changed the landscape of standard computing. At a larger scale, there is a keen desire to build or host frontline supercomputers. The yearly Top 500 ranking nicely illustrates and orchestrates this supercomputers saga.

40|$|Design {{of systems}} {{exceeding}} 1 Pflop/s and the push toward 1 Eflop/s, forced a dramatic shift in hardware design. Various physical and engineering constraints resulted in introduction of massive parallelism and functional hybridization {{with the use}} of <b>accelerator</b> <b>units.</b> This paradigm change brings about a serious challenge for application developers, as the management of multicore proliferation and heterogeneity rests on software. And it is reasonable to expect, that this situation will not change in the foreseeable future. This chapter presents a methodology of dealing with this issue in three common scenarios. In the context of shared-memory multicore installations, we show how high performance and scalability go hand in hand, when the well-known linear algebra algorithms are recast in terms of Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), which are then transparently scheduled at runtime inside the Parallel Linear Algebra Software for Multicore Architectures (PLASMA) project. Similarly, Matrix Algebra on GPU and Multicore Architectures (MAGMA) schedules DAG-driven computations on multicore processors and accelerators. Finally, Distributed PLASMA (DPLASMA), takes the approach to distributed-memory machines {{with the use of}} automatic dependence analysis and the Direct Acyclic Graph Engine (DAGuE) to deliver high performance at the scale of many thousands of cores...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of specialized application accel-erators is happening today. However, {{they do not}} share a common attach point, and have no common architecture or programing model. A framework that economically and efficiently enables specialized acceleration is highly desirable. In this work we propose a generic interface con-cept called ”ACCFS ” for integrating application accelerators into Linux-based platforms. The idea is to extend the programing model chosen by the Linux for Cell/B. E. team. On the Cell/B. E. multiple indepen-dent vector processors called Synergistic Processing Units (SPUs) are built around a 64 -bit PowerPC core (PPE). The programing model {{is to create a}} virtual file system (VFS) to export the functionality of the SPUs to the user space via a file interface, they called it ”SPUFS”. Against other solutions such as using character devices or introducing a new process space the VFS interface uses common file system calls and provides an economic and efficient access to the <b>accelerator</b> <b>units,</b> the SPUs. Together with this concept and the experiences from an intermediate step called ”RSPUFS ” we introduce the first approaches towards a common accelerator file system (ACCFS). ...|$|R

Following the selected method of Pahl &amp;amp; Beitz, a design specification was made including both a requirement list and a schematic layout for the supporting and alignment systems.

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, the {{attention}} to system-on-chip processors focused on customizability and specializing functional units for particular applications. Such processor extensions can increase performance in domains such as cryptography and DSP, without incurring the power cost of superscalar RISC processors and the complexity of entirely customized integrated circuits. Since it is extremely desirable that tools automate the design of <b>accelerator</b> <b>units</b> as much as possible, compilation takes on a new extended meaning in this context- the compiler's job {{is not only to}} produce optimized assembly code for a machine, but also to find the optimal machine for which to compile. The two different subproblems involved in this task are to automatically generate the best instruction-set extensions (ISEs), and to use them extensions, i. e. finding them in the user's applications. Therefore, most of the thesis deals with formalizing these combinatorial problems in general, characterizing them for particular architectures, reducing them whenever possible to well known graph optimization tasks, and solving them. Another wholly different part of compilation for extensible embedded processors is to understand and solve the unique challenges that are posed to a compiler that can actually shape its target machine. In particular, existing compilation techniques can be redesigned and returned to find even better instruction-set extensions - just like a general purpose compiler will transform the program to maximally exploit the target processor's machine language. Since this subject exposes many different facets, this thesis touches areas such as compilation, combinatorial optimization, and hardware design. Results presented include: complexity proofs for several algorithms and problems from existing literature; a framework for automated discovery of custom instructions, which is reused in different contexts and for different customization technologies; and techniques for analyzing the effect of compiler optimizations on ISE search. All contributions are prototyped in complete compilation and simulation environments...|$|R
