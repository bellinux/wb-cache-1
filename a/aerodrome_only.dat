25|$|With {{the full}} {{mobilization}} in September 1939, the Navy Air Service organized its 3rd Air Wing at Skattøra, with detachments at Hammerfest and Vadsø. The air wing was activated on 27 September, {{consisting of a}} single M.F.11. At the time the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>only</b> had a few buoys to anchor to. In October three Heinkel He 115 torpedo bombers were dispatched and were used to patrol the coast from Kirkenes to Helgeland.|$|E
25|$|As a {{reaction}} to this criticism units based at Celle voluntarily restrict themselves to circle the <b>aerodrome</b> <b>only</b> over the mostly uninhabited area {{to the south of}} the air base and to avoid training approaches over Westercelle as much as possible. Flight movements at lunch time are kept to a minimum. Approach as well as departure over densely populated areas is prohibited. These restrictions relieve the built-up areas surrounding the air base of noise pollution to a certain degree. They have, however, the effect that flight movements are now channelled along the remaining routes permitted leading to an increase of noise and of annoyance to the population affected. Since many retired soldiers and staff formerly working at the base still live in and around Celle there are not only critics of the air base but also supporters who voice their opinion in various forums and letters to the editor stressing the economic factor of the air base {{and the fact that the}} air base had existed since 1934 so that the opponents were in full knowledge of its existence when they bought property at reduced prices in its vicinity.|$|E

50|$|Surplus to RAF requirements, Holme was leased to Blackburn Aircraft Ltd {{for use as}} a test {{base from}} 1958. The {{location}} was convenient for Blackburn's main factory at Brough <b>Aerodrome,</b> <b>only</b> 16 mi away, where the runway was not long enough for use by the new aircraft Blackburn was then working on, most especially the Blackburn Buccaneer. The use of Holme passed through Blackburn's acquisition by Hawker Siddeley, and subsequently British Aerospace, until the latter ceased use of Holme in December 1983.|$|E

50|$|The Alexandra <b>Aerodrome</b> is Alexandra's <b>only</b> airport. SPANZ, NAC and Mount Cook Airlines were main {{users of}} the airport till the 1980s. It {{is home to the}} Central Otago Flying Club, and gliding.

50|$|The {{airfield}} {{was opened}} in the late 20th century. It was the only airport in the southwest of the nation until an airfield in Mosteiros opened. From 1992, it also served passengers from and to Brava and after the closure of that airport and later in Mosteiros, once again, it is the <b>only</b> <b>aerodrome</b> serving the southwest of the nation.|$|R
50|$|An {{airstrip}} {{is a small}} <b>aerodrome</b> {{that consists}} <b>only</b> of a runway with perhaps fueling equipment. They are generally in remote locations. Many airstrips (now mostly abandoned) were built on the hundreds of islands in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. A few airstrips grew to become full-fledged airbases as strategic or economic importance of a region increased over time.|$|R
50|$|Somersby Airfield (ICAO: YSMB) is an Australian {{airfield}} {{located in}} the town of Somersby, New South Wales. The airport is 12 km by road from the Central Business District of the nearby city of Gosford, {{and is one of the}} closest airports to it. Somersby airfield is also sometimes referred to as Gosford Airport. It is the <b>only</b> <b>aerodrome</b> in Somersby, and does not serve scheduled commercial traffic.|$|R
40|$|Fog is a {{significant}} factor affecting the Air Traffic Control (ATC). Significant limitations of the airport capacity are due to fog that causes {{the reduction of the}} visibility (Runway Visual Range, RVR). Today METAR (Meteorological Aviation Report) and forecasts TAF (Terminal <b>Aerodrome</b> Forecast) are <b>only</b> available to estimate the visibility variations, but not to estimate the RVR. Scope {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the performance of airport radar sensors to detect the fog...|$|R

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] paper discusses the machine vision element of a system designed to allow Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to perform automated taxiing around civil <b>aerodromes,</b> with <b>only</b> a monocular camera. The purpose of the computer vision system is to provide direct sensor data {{which can be used}} to validate vehicle position, in addition to detecting potential collision risks. In practice, untrained clustering is used to segment the visual feed before descriptors of each cluster (primarily colour and texture) are used to estimate the class. As the competency of each individual estimate can vary dependent on multiple factors (number of pixels, lighting conditions and even surface type). A Bayesian network is used to perform probabilistic data fusion, in order to improve the classification results. This result is shown to perform accurate image segmentation in real-world conditions, providing information viable for localisation and obstacle detection...|$|R
50|$|Officially {{organized}} on 15 November 1918, initially, the 41st, 138th and 638th Aero Squadrons (Pursuit) {{were assigned}} to the group, and were billeted in the village of Lay St. Remy, in the Toul Sector. The <b>Aerodrome</b> was located <b>only</b> about a dozen kilometers from the town. Within several weeks after the group's formation, barracks were completed near the field and the squadron's men were moved to the quarters. Many of the pilots of the group had seen service with the British Royal Flying Corps, and a few had been shot down over German-held territory and had been taken prisoner. Also, several of the pilots were instructors in the United States and were sent overseas late in the war, and had not seen combat. Also many of the men of the squadrons had been instructors at training fields both in the United States, as well as in England and Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|The Air Ministry {{came up with}} {{a scheme}} to pass on the {{knowledge}} gained at Orfordness to other pilots. A squadron titled [...] "No. 1 School of Aerial Navigation and Bomb Dropping" [...] was to be set up at Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain. On 5 December Briggs, a corporal and six men were the first to arrive to set up the school. They were quartered for the time being at an infantry camp nearby. At this stage it was an <b>aerodrome</b> in name <b>only,</b> there were [...] "no hangars, no nothing. At some time or other somebody has set up a bloody big heap of massive stones likely to prove obstructions {{on the edge of the}} drome". Four days later some Bessonneau hangars arrived for Briggs' team to erect. Another four days later (13 December) not one hangar was erected. Each morning they found the fierce winds of the plain had scattered the hangar they had erected the previous day across the aerodrome. On 17 December the remaining personnel for the school arrived and hangars started going up [...] "like the price of wine". Briggs was delighted that George Powell, Sammy Weller and Dit Montmorency turned up to be fellow instructors.|$|R
