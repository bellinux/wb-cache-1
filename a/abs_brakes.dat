The project faded quickly.Westinghouse and New York Air Brake began development of a replacement for the venerable [...] "K Brake" [...] in 1929. The Great Depression slowed, but did not stop, development of the new brake and, in April 1932, New York Air Brake began construction of a 200-car test track, the largest in the world. In 1934, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) voted to adopt the new composite <b>AB</b> <b>brake.</b> Despite the Depression, the company maintained employment for 300 workers, many on a part-time basis.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{we focus on the}} {{specification}} and assessment of Stochastic Petri net (SPN) models to evaluate the design of an embedded system for reliability and availability. The system provides dynamic driving regulation (DDR) to improve vehicle derivability (antiskid,-slip and steering assist). A functional SPN abstraction was developed for each of three subsystems that incorporate mechanics, failure modes/effects and model parameters. The models are solved in terms of the subsystem and overall system reliability and availability. Four sets of models were developed. The first three sets include subsystem representations for the TC (Traction Control), <b>AB</b> (Antilock <b>Braking)</b> and ESA (Electronic Steering Assistance) systems. The last set combines these systems into one large model. We summarize the general approach and provide sample Petri net graphs and reliability charts that were used to evaluate the design of the DDR in parts and as a whole. 1...|$|R
25|$|The GLi was {{the most}} basic model Falcon, selling well with fleets. Its {{features}} list was identical {{to that of the}} previous model, which included Ford's straight-six engine, with an option of upgrading to the Windsor V8. The slightly more equipped Futura features <b>ABS</b> <b>brakes,</b> front power windows, cruise control and a number of luxury features, like back seat headrests and an enhanced sound system. To distinguish it from the GLi, body-coloured components replaced the black plastic type. Regardless of the model chosen, an optional dual fuel tank could be fitted to run on both autogas and petrol, with the transmission limited to the four-speed automatic.|$|E
25|$|The new Corolla is {{available}} in 5 trim levels for the hatch (Ascent, Ascent sport, Conquest, Levin SX and Levin ZR) and 4 for the sedan (Ascent, Ascent sport, Conquest and Ultima - auto only), with the Corolla wagon discontinued in Australia. The Levin ZR and Ultima grade features HID xenon headlamps, rain sensing wipers, smart entry and start system and automatic climate control. Safety equipment levels has also been improved with <b>ABS</b> <b>brakes</b> and dual airbags standard across the range, whilst side, curtain, driver's knee airbag and stability and traction control is optional on Ascent and Levin SX models and standard on Conquest, Levin ZR and Ultima models from December 2008 production. Other changes from December 2008 production included a revised 6-speed manual transmission across all models except the auto only Ultima sedan that has improved gear ratios and the adoption of smart entry activation on front passenger and back door on Levin ZR model. Although the new hatch is badged Auris name in most world markets, the Corolla name was retained for the Australian market.|$|E
25|$|In {{the safety}} aspect the Statesman comes with Bosch Electronic Stability Control, {{traction}} control, <b>ABS</b> <b>brakes,</b> EBD, BAS and a tyre pressure monitoring system as standard Front, side and curtain airbags come as standard {{which is another}} incentive to improve the Caprice's safety equipment, this {{also contributed to the}} fact that the Caprice’s safety rating surpass that off its main rival, the LTD. Development commenced with the largest virtual crash modelling program Holden has ever undertaken. Emphasis was placed on considering the range of impact scenarios that occur in real world accident situations and differing occupant criteria. Safety technologies were benchmarked along with the world’s leading luxury brands and major engineering programs delivered a stiffer body structure and vastly increased usage of advanced strength steels. Multiple load corridor strategies for frontal, side and rear impacts improve passenger compartment integrity. They are complemented by an improved multi-point airbag sensing system and an adaptive restraint system which includes dual stage front airbags, thorax side impact airbags, curtain airbags and front seat active head restraints as standard equipment. Structurally optimised crush zones absorb crash energy and other occupant protection features include a steering column ride-down mechanism and breakaway brake pedal.|$|E
40|$|Rear-end {{collisions}} {{in which}} the leading vehicle was stationary prior to impact {{and at least one}} vehicle was towed from the crash site represent 18 % of all yearly crashes in the United States. Forward Collision Avoidance Systems (FCASs) are becoming increasingly available in production vehicles and have a great potential for preventing or mitigating rear-end collisions. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the effectiveness of five crash avoidance algorithms that are similar in design to systems found on production vehicles of model year 2011. To predict the effectiveness of each algorithm, this study simulated a representative sample of rear-end collisions as if the striking vehicle was equipped with each FCAS. In 2011, the ADAC (Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club e. V) published a test report comparing advanced emergency braking systems. The ADAC tested production vehicles of model year 2011 made by Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Volvo, and VW. The ADAC test results were used in conjunction with video evidence and owner’s manual information to develop mathematical models of five different FCASs. The systems had combinations of Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Assisted <b>Braking</b> (<b>AB),</b> and Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB). The effectiveness of each modeled system was measured by its ability to prevent collisions or reduce the collision severity of reconstructed crashes. In this study, 977 rear-end crashes that occurred from 1993 to 2008 were mathematically reconstructed. These crashes were investigate...|$|R
30|$|The PISa (Powered two wheeler Integrated Safety) project {{focused on}} the {{development}} and implementation of integrated safety systems for PTWs. The main outcomes were the development of Active <b>Braking</b> (<b>AB)</b> and Distance Support (DS) functions. The former performs an autonomous braking actions whenever an unavoidable collision is identified and no rider action is detected, to reduce impact speed and thus accident consequences. DS function supports the rider during normal riding conditions providing information on the safe distance from the leading vehicle. The HMI strategy used tactile interaction in both case although different information had to be provided: for AB function the rider received a warning, limited in time, about the oncoming braking action of the system. The tactile interaction was chosen as it allowed the rider to receive information without moving his/her sight from the road ahead (this aspect is particularly relevant when riders have to deal with an unavoidable accident). The HMI device associated with AB was a vibrating saddle activated to warn the rider before of the braking action, while for DS Support was developed a Haptic Throttle able to provide a torque feedback on the throttle handle. The Haptic Saddle consisted of a set of independent vibrating elements integrated in the saddle foam, and properly positioned to provide a tactile perception. The Haptic Throttle provided a torque feedback on the throttle handle to suggest a safe distance to the vehicle ahead. The system was designed to leave the full control to the rider since the torque can be overridden in case the rider decides to overtake the leading vehicle instead of following [12].|$|R
2500|$|To address {{handling}} {{concerns with}} the EF, improvements {{were made to}} the rear suspension and steering which would largely be attributed to Ford Australia's association with Tickford. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high speed steering.
