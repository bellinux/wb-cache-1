25|$|My mother <b>always</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that {{no matter}} how much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

Agnes, who became informally known as [...] "Mrs Jock", established and ran the Selukwe Women's Institute. Both won the MBE (at different times) for their services to the community.

[...] Raised on the frontier of the British Empire in the UK's youngest settler colony, Smith and his generation of white Rhodesians grew up with a reputation for being [...] "more British than the British", something in which they took great pride.|$|E

60|$|Percy's {{letters to}} me were <b>always</b> alike; he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that he did}} not care whether I had the fortune or not. That for my own sake he should of course have {{preferred}} that I should have had money, in order that in our Indian home we might be surrounded by more comforts and luxuries, but that for no other reason did he in the least care. That, of course, his pay as a cornet was next to nothing, but he expected that before many months he should get a step. He calculated that his lieutenant's pay in India, with the staff appointment--which he made sure, from his proficiency in the native languages, he should speedily obtain--together with the £300 a year his mother allowed him, would enable us to live in tolerable comfort.|$|R

An only child, James and his mother, a farm worker, migrated through Louisiana and East Texas with the cotton and sugarcane seasons, moving often and sometimes living in tents.

Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course we all know it was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going to be made that {{he was supposed to be}} engaged to Lana Cantrell. Well, the ratings went through the roof...|$|E
2500|$|Born Marilyn Ann Briggs in Providence, Rhode Island, Chambers {{was raised}} in Westport, Connecticut, in a middle-class household. It is often {{reported}} that {{she was born in}} Westport; however, in a 2007 interview Chambers confirmed she was born in Providence but grew up in Westport. Her father was in advertising and her mother was a nurse. She was the youngest of three children, including a brother, Martin Briggs (keyboardist for 1960s Boston band The Remains), and a sister, Jann Smith. Chambers attended Burr Farms Elementary School, Hillspoint Elementary School, Long Lots Junior High School, and Staples High School. Her father tried to discourage her from pursuing a modeling career, citing brutal competition. [...] "Ever since I was a little kid, I've always wanted to be an actress," [...] Chambers said in 1997. [...] "I was always a performer, a junior Olympic diver, a junior Olympic gymnast. My mother <b>always</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I was a show-off".|$|E

When asked if Smith ever revealed to him the identity of her daughter's father, Denk responded, [...] "She <b>always</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> she wanted to have her kids with me."

5000|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the massacre, the British tabloid press was filled with stories about Ryan's life. Press biographies all stated {{that he had a}} near-obsessive fascination with firearms. The majority claimed that Ryan had possessed magazines about survival skills and firearms, Soldier of Fortune being frequently named. Press reports claimed that he was obsessed with the film First Blood, which was erroneously described as featuring events similar to the Hungerford massacre, when in fact {{there was no evidence that}} Ryan even owned a video recorder, let alone that he had seen the film. Sylvester Stallone stated, [...] "I carry the can for every lunatic in the world who goes crazy with a gun - but it wasn't Rambo who sent Michael Ryan mad. In fact Rambo is the opposite of people like Ryan. He is always up against stronger opposition and never shoots first. Murderers are <b>always</b> saying, 'God <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to kill' or 'Jesus ordered me to kill' - so should the rest of us stop praying?
