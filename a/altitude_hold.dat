5|$|The Avianca Flight 52 {{aircraft}} was a Boeing 707-321B (registration number HK-2016). The {{aircraft was}} manufactured in June 1967 and {{was purchased by}} Avianca from Pan Am in 1977. By {{the time of the}} crash, the aircraft was 22 years old and had over 61,000 flight hours. The 707 was equipped with four JT3D-3B engines modified with a hush kit to reduce noise pollution. Avianca personnel reported that they factored in a five-percent fuel overburn into the performance calculations due to the hush kit along with an additional five-percent overburn due to the age of the aircraft.

In this paper, an auto-landing control scheme is presented. It can be regarded as one-step-further development for our quadrotor UAV systems which are capable of auto <b>altitude</b> <b>holding,</b> auto position holding and point-to-point auto-navigation in outdoor environments. Using the state measurements from 9 DOF IMU (inertial measurement unit), sonar/barometer, accelerometer and GPS, a set of linear P+D+DD controller for attitude control and translation control have been implemented in a control system configuration including an outer positioning loop and an inner attitude loop. Based on the reliable position hold control, the auto-landing is realized by descending the target altitude gradually using the altitude, vertical velocity and vertical acceleration feedback. Given the control strategy, the effectiveness of the landing control algorithm is validated by successful experimental outcomes...|$|R

40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis, a nonlinear {{mathematical model}} simulation and linear controller {{design for the}} U 1 -H 1 helicopter was achieved. This thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. In the first part, the nonlinear dynamic model is developed using the Matrix Laboratory Software and Heli-Dyn R Software, which is a modeling and simulation tool for rotorcraft developed by Dr. Ilkay Yavrucuk at Middle East Technical University. The non-linear model consists in a contribution of main rotor, tail rotor, fuselage, gravitational model, horizontal and vertical tail rotor. The U 1 -H 1 main rotor non-linear mathematical model was build by use of blade element momentum theory, inflow dynamics and flapping dynamics. The total forces and moments are used in 6 degrees of freedom equations of motion model and helicopter states are obtained for hover conditions and forward flight. Trim and linearization process was done by Heli-Dyn R Software. The second part consists in a stability augmentation systems (SAS) followed by a set of automatic flight control systems (AFCS) designed by use of PID controllers. The AFCS main objective is to ease the pilot by decreasing the workload. The stability augmentation systems was designed by use of optimal control, especially Linear Quadratic Tracking Controller (LQT) and Linear Quadratic Regulator Controller (LQR). The automatic flight control systems implemented are heading <b>hold,</b> attitude, <b>hold</b> <b>altitude</b> acquire and <b>hold</b> mode for hover condition and heading <b>hold,</b> attitude <b>hold,</b> <b>altitude</b> acquire and <b>hold</b> mode and airspeed hold for forward flight condition. Furthermore, in order to check the robustness of the controllers and directory modes, disturbances were added to the model.

Furthermore, the controllers and directory modes shown a successful dynamic behavior towards perturbations...|$|R
30|$|Longer {{time series}} of Swarm data {{are needed to}} test and extend the {{preliminary}} results reported here for the secular variation and secular acceleration in 2015. The relatively long timescales involved, even for rapid secular acceleration pulses, mean that long-term monitoring from space is essential if new hypotheses concerning the responsible core physics are to be properly tested. A lengthy Swarm mission, with the satellites gradually moving to lower <b>altitudes,</b> thus <b>holds</b> great promise. As the constellation configuration evolves, and the local time separation between the upper satellite and the lower pair increases, {{there will also be}} exciting opportunities to study secular variation on even shorter timescales.|$|R
50|$|The {{initial phase}} of the test program {{included}} objectives aimed at answering some questions about implementation of the B-1. Air Force objectives included exploration of its use in a tactical environment, and how airborne early warning and control (AWACS) would control supersonic aircraft. The Air Force portion was budgeted at US$4 million. The NASA tests would answer questions such as how engine inlet performance affected airframe and propulsion interaction, boundary layer noise, heat transfer under high Mach conditions, and <b>altitude</b> <b>hold</b> at supersonic speeds.

50|$|Multirotors (also {{known as}} drones) {{are subject to}} normal {{rotorcraft}} aerodynamics, including vortex ring state. Frame design, size and power {{have an impact on}} the likelihood of entering the state and recovering from it; generally, the smaller the multirotor the more likely it is to suffer from the effect. Multirotors that do not have <b>altitude</b> <b>hold</b> are also more likely to succumb to operator error, where the pilot drops the craft too fast and into its own propwash; those that are equipped with that feature, on the other hand, tend to control their descent automatically and can usually (but not always) escape the dangerous condition.|$|E
50|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{discovered that}} the autopilot had been inadvertently switched from <b>altitude</b> <b>hold</b> to control wheel steering (CWS) mode in pitch. In this mode, once the pilot releases pressure on the yoke (control column), the autopilot maintains the pitch attitude selected by the pilot until he moves the yoke again. Investigators believe the autopilot switched modes when the captain accidentally leaned against the yoke while turning {{to speak to the}} flight engineer, who was sitting behind and to the right of him. The slight forward pressure on the stick would have caused the aircraft to enter a slow descent, maintained by the CWS system.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the potential fuel burn benefits of altitude and speed optimization in the cruise phase of flight for domestic airlines in the United States. Airlines can achieve cost reductions and reduce environmental impact by making small {{modifications to the}} cruise phase operating condition. The efficiency of the National Airspace System can be improved with coordination between air traffic controllers, pilots, and airline dispatchers. This study builds off of prior {{work in this area}} to establish best-case benefits assuming full implementation of fuel-optimal cruise altitudes and speeds. In order to achieve these objectives, a cruise-phase fuel burn estimator was developed using publicly-available radar tracks and weather data. This estimator was used to examine 217, 000 flights from 2012. Maximum benefits from <b>altitude</b> optimization (<b>holding</b> speed constant) were found to be on the order 1. 96 %. The majority of potential altitude benefits can be achieved using step climb optimization, with only marginal gain from cruise climb implementation. The maximum benefits for speed optimization (<b>holding</b> <b>altitude</b> constant) were found to be 1. 94 % with an average flight time increase of 3. 5 minutes per flight. Simultaneous altitude and speed optimization yielded a potential cruise fuel burn reduction of 3. 71 %. In practice, operational considerations and barriers to implementation limit likely system fuel reduction to lower levels. High-benefit operations within the NAS are identified and potential implementation considerations are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} multivariable {{identification}} and controller {{design for the}} longitudinal channel of a Boeing 747 transport. The transfer function matrix {{of the system is}} identified using the prediction error (PE) identification method with multivariable ARX model. An ellipsoidal parametric uncertainty set is constructed from the covariance matrix of the identified parameters. It contains the parameters of actual system at a certain probability level. The identified models and the associated uncertainty sets are validated by measuring the worst-case ŒΩ-gap and then compared with the maximum value of the generalized stability margin. In automatic flight control system or autopilots, multiple specifications criteria are needed to be satisfied concurrently, such as good <b>holding</b> (small static <b>altitude</b> <b>holding</b> error), fast response, smooth transition (less oscillation, overshoot).
