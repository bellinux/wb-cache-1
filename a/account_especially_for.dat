When there are prominent line {{structures in the}} image, image resizing methods without explicitly taking these properties into account could produce line structure distortions in their results. Since the human visual system is very sensitive to line structures, such distortions often become noticeable and disturbing. Our method couples mesh deformations for image resizing with similarity transforms for line features. Mesh deformations are used to control content preservation while similarity transforms are analyzed in the Hough space to maintain line structure properties. Our method strikes a good balance between preserving content and maintaining line structure properties.

It then identifies a foundation for accounting for sustainable development in terms of critical scientific realism which is appropriate to the changed ontology.

A global water assessment model called “WaterGAP 2 ” is described, which consists of two main components—a Global Water Use model and a Global Hydrology model.

The Global Water Use model consists of (a) domestic and industry sectors which take into account the effect of structural and technological changes on water use, and (b) an agriculture sector which <b>accounts</b> <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> the effect of climate on irrigation water requirements. The Global Hydrology model calculates surface runoff and groundwater recharge based on the computation of daily water balances of the soil and canopy. A water balance is also performed for surface waters, and river flow is routed via a global flow routing scheme. The Global Hydrology model provides a testable method for taking into account the effects of climate and land cover on runoff.

This work, based on chemical and archaeometrical literature, summarizes both evidences of pigments discolouration and degradation in works of art, as well as investigations based on mock-ups and simulations. Also, results from a variety of analytical techniques are here considered, as the complexity of the topic requires. In fact, tracking and understanding the reactions causing discolouration of the studied pigments requires a different approach according to the problem: salt dissolution and formation (Ca, Cu and Pb-based pigments); reduction or oxidation reactions (Fe, Cu, Hg, Pb-containing pigments); ions leaching (ultramarine, smalt; Ca, Cu, Pb-pigments); polymorphism and structural modifications of the materials (Cu, As, Hg and Pb-pigments).

At a low pH, the coordinating moieties of the chelator can be protonated and therefore inactivated [1]. Focusing on gallium- 68, the pH must be in a range of 3.5 to 5.5 {{due to the fact that}} gallium starts to form insoluble colloids and hydroxides at a higher pH that are not available for complexation [2, 3]. Correspondingly, pH buffering systems are necessary for a successful product formation. Appropriate buffers for 68 Ga-labeling are supposed to be weak gallium-complexing agents that hinder hydrolysis to hydroxides and keep the metal in its active ionic state [4, 5]. Sodium acetate (NaOAc), sodium succinate, and 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl)- 1 -piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) were reported as the most favorable buffers for 68 Ga-labeling so far [6]. Nevertheless, the latter one was reported to result in better radiochemical yields for [68 Ga]Ga-DOTATOC than the first ones at low precursor amounts [7]. Hence, HEPES should be the buffer of choice for clinical routine productions and especially scientific labeling approaches. However, the drawback of using HEPES is that the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) defines HEPES as an impurity that has to be below a specified limit [8].|$|E
