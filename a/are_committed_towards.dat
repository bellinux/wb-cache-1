40|$|Exploitation of {{embryonic}} stem cells (ESC) for therapeutic use and biomedical applications is severely hampered by the risk of teratocarcinoma formation. Here, we performed a screen of selected epi-modulating compounds and demonstrate that a transient exposure of mouse ESC to MS- 275 (Entinostat), a class I histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDAC), modulates differentiation and prevents teratocarcinoma formation. Morphological and molecular data indicate that MS- 275 -primed ESCs <b>are</b> <b>committed</b> <b>towards</b> neural differentiation, which is supported by transcriptome analyses. Interestingly, in vitro withdrawal of MS- 275 reverses the primed cells to the pluripotent state. In vivo, MS 275 -primed ES cells injected into recipient mice give only rise to benign teratomas but not teratocarcinomas with prevalence of neural-derived structures. In agreement, MS- 275 -primed ESC are unable to colonize blastocysts. These findings provide evidence that a transient alteration of acetylation alters the ESC fate...|$|E

40|$|Agriculture {{provides}} the main support for Zambia’s rural economy, {{and because of}} this, growth in the agricultural sector is the clearest avenue through which poverty reduction can be achieved in Zambia. Yet despite widespread recognition of the strong connection between agricultural development and poverty reduction, there is continuing under-provision of public goods investments for over a decade. Zambia’s primary policy objective of achieving accelerated growth and competitiveness in the agricultural sector cannot be achieved unless adequate public resources <b>are</b> <b>committed</b> <b>towards</b> catalyzing the desired growth. Strong evidence from southern Africa as well as throughout the world indicates that long–term public investment in research and development, extension services, rural infrastructure, and food safety and quality systems have high pay-offs and {{are among the most}} important drivers of agricultural growth and competitiveness. Agricultural-led development has been identified by African Heads of State and Governments as key to restoration of food security and rural development on our continent. Under the African Union’s Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) framework, Zambia, like many other members of the union, has targeted to achieve a minimum of 6 % annual agricultural growth by making available 10 % of the national budget towards the sector. In Zambia, it is important not only to increase the resource allocation to the sector in accordance with the CAADP target of 10 %, but to allocate these resources productively so as to make the maximum contribution to sustainable growth within the shortest possible time. This paper examines trends in Zambia’s public budgeting for agriculture and the composition of the budget. This report does not cover tax expenditures by the government, private sector expenditures, and support from donors. Support from development partners channeled through government programs is included in the report.

40|$|The {{strategies}} to prevent accidents from occurring {{in a process}} industry, or to minimize the harm if an accident does take place, always revolve around forecasting the likely accidents and their impacts. Based on the likely frequency and severity of the accidents, resources <b>are</b> <b>committed</b> <b>towards</b> preventing the accidents. Nearly all techniques of ranking hazardous units, be it the hazard and operability studies, fault tree analysis, hazard indice, etc. - qualitative as well as quantitative - depend essentially on {{the assessment of the}} likely frequency and the likely harm accidents in different units may cause. This fact makes it exceedingly important that the forecasting the accidents and their likely impact is done as accurately as possible. In the present study we introduce a new approach to accident forecasting based on the discrete modeling paradigm of cellular automata. In this treatment an accident is modeled as a self-evolving phenomena, the impact of which is strongly influenced by the size, nature, and position of the environmental components which lie {{in the vicinity of the}} accident site. The outward propagation of the mass, energy and momentum from the accident epicenter is modeled as a fast diffusion process occurring in discrete space-time coordinates. The quantum of energy and material that would flow into each discrete space element (cell) due to the accidental release is evaluated and the degree of vulnerability posed to the receptors if present in the cell is measured at the end of each time element. This approach is able to effectively take into account the modifications in the flux of energy and material which occur as a result of the heterogeneous environment prevailing between the accident epicenter and the receptor. Consequently, more realistic accident scenarios are generated than possible with the prevailing techniques. The efficacy of the approach has been illustrated with case studies. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|If {{traditionally}} citizens’ {{influence in}} the design of strategic goals and policies was limited by the right to vote, the last few decades witnessed the emergence of a normative discourse and the implementation of different initiatives, challenging the representative democracy to offer a structure capable of enabling the dialogue between those elected and voters. By proposing a number of participatory alternatives empowering citizens, some of the democracies using those concepts <b>are</b> <b>committed</b> <b>towards</b> a culture of participatory governance. The two authors of this paper argue that learning and experimenting are crucial elements to find new forms and methods for participatory governance in order to strengthen democratic cultures, enhance the resonance capability to react to current societal challenges {{and to be able to}} jointly work on creating a sustainable future for today’s and tomorrow’s generations. The aim of this paper is to explore how different innovative experiments with participatory governance in different regional contexts, can learn and benefit from each other in a transdisciplinary setting. To do so, two case studies from Canada and Austria are presented, compared and analyzed: On the one hand, the British Columbia Citizens’ Assembly in Canada as an initiative designed to develop collaborations between governments and citizens regardless of their age, sex, ethnicity, cultural background or social statues and on the other hand the project “URB@Exp: Towards new forms of urban governance and city development: learning from urban experiments with living labs & city labs” in Leoben, Austria. The paper will analyze and compare the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of these two case studies and put the results of this comparison within a transdisciplinary, transatlantic framework. In this specific setting the practical perspective based on the Canadian case study meets the scientific perspective based on the Austrian case study, whereby a unique opportunity is created to be involved in a mutual scientific-societal learning process and develop new knowledge for innovative governance. The paper will present key findings of this learning process and reflect on how they can be used to generate democratic participation, assist public policy development, improve governance performance and strengthen society-science collaborations in order to initiate sustainable development processes...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} employee commitment to achieve the primary objective, which was to evaluate employee commitment towards product and process quality. Employees who are engaged in their work and committed to their organisations give companies crucial competitive advantages – including higher productivity, better quality products and lower employee turnover. A thorough literature study was conducted by using the views of different authors and combining them. The concept of quality was defined by making use of the five quality gurus; Deming, Juran, Feigenbaum, Crosby and Ishikawa. The fourteen principles of quality, developed by Deming, were presented in Table 2. 1. These principles had the goal of increased productivity, with less rework, less waste of manpower and material resources, resulting in a reduction of costs, to in turn give the organisation greater market share and ultimately better competitive position, by improving the overall quality of an organisation’s work processes. The concept of employee and organisational commitment was defined, and from this study it is evident that employee commitment towards the company is positive and therefore should have a positive effect on their operating environment. The product process flow for this manufacturing concern were discussed to give an overall view of the production processes used in this organisation. An empirical study was completed using a questionnaire survey to determine employee commitment at a manufacturing concern in Gauteng. The questionnaire used for this study was designed to focus on commitment towards internal quality only, to specifically evaluate employee perspective towards product quality, as well as the commitment towards the organisation. Analysis of the responses showed the questionnaire to be reliable and valid. Respondents indicated that they <b>are</b> <b>committed</b> <b>towards</b> the organisation in general across all constructs, but a lack in management trust was a predominant sentiment. The quantitative analysis showed that after a factor analysis was done on the two sections of the questionnaire, four factors for each section were considered as meaningful. These factors were: Affinity, quality awareness, autonomy and corporate image (employee commitment - section B) and employee commitment, task performance, job satisfaction and contextual performance (company relationship – section C). This indicated strong employee commitment towards the organisation. The qualitative results had four areas that all respondents felt needed some attention, and loaded negative towards the organisation. These were HR (trust in management, competency, communication and company culture), skills development, employee development and BBBEE. Thus, drawing conclusions from quantitative results alone could give a company a false sense of employee commitment towards the company and therefore overlook the importance of the roles that employees play in executing strategic plans. Conclusions regarding the findings of the research study were presented and recommendations for this organisation were made. These recommendations are merely a guideline that correlates directly to the empirical analysis made. The research study was evaluated against the primary and secondary objectives with the conclusion that both were achieved. Master...|$|E

A process of deliberation and change was started—aimed at achieving ‘transitions’—using a model of transition management. This paper examines how the new arrangements of governance for energy transition deal with six problems of steering: ambivalence about goals, uncertainty about cause–effect relations, distributed power of control, political myopia, determination of short-term steps for long-term change and the danger of lock-in to new systems. The Dutch experience shows that transition management is applied in ways different from the original model (established players play a too great role) but it appears a useful model of reflexive governance, combining advantages of incremental politics with those of planning. It helps to orientate innovation policy and sectoral policies to sustainable development goals and to exploit business interests in system innovations in a prudent manner...|$|R
