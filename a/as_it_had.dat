5|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{been two}} decades since much silver was {{regularly}} deposited for striking into coins, {{the fact that}} the United States had been on a bimetallic standard since 1792 was often forgotten.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> in {{the third}} quarter, Stanford's offense scored quickly. In only three plays, the Cardinal {{advanced}} 72yards. A 34-yard run by Stepfan Taylor was followed by one stopped for no gain, then Luck completed a 38-yard throw to Fleener for Stanford's second touchdown of the quarter. The score and extra point improved Stanford's lead to 40–12 with 6:05 remaining in the game. Tech's subsequent drive went three-and-out after Tyrod Taylor was sacked twice, and Stanford got the ball again at its 46-yard line.|$|E
