50|$|Memory {{dependence}} {{prediction is}} a technique, employed by high-performance out-of-order execution microprocessors that execute memory access operations (loads <b>and</b> <b>stores)</b> out of program order, to predict true dependencies between loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> at instruction execution time. With the predicted dependence information, the processor can then decide to speculatively execute certain loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> out of order, while preventing other loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> from executing out-of-order (keeping them in-order). Later in the pipeline, memory disambiguation techniques {{are used to}} determine if the loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> were correctly executed and, if not, to recover.|$|R

5|$|Altogether, around fifty Christian {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns and religious paintings.

Nine barrels {{have been found}} to contain bones of cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> as ship's rations.

5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> in granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E

5|$|Defence from thermal {{weapons and}} fire attacks was usually water or other liquids such as urine; hides were soaked and draped over {{vulnerable}} wooden hoardings and siege engines, and vats and barrels of liquid were collected <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> by defenders and attackers. Hides were hung in an overlapping manner {{so that any}} water would run down the whole structure to extinguish flames.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two primary}} methods of telemedicine, which are {{real-time}} <b>and</b> <b>store</b> <b>and</b> forward.|$|R
5000|$|The first option, making loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> go in-order, avoids RAW dependences {{because there}} is no {{possibility}} of a load executing before its producer <b>store</b> <b>and</b> obtaining incorrect data. Another possibility is to effectively break loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> into two operations: address generation and cache access. With these two separate but linked operations, the CPU can allow loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> to access the memory system only once all previous loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> have had their address generated and buffered in the LSQ. After address generation, there are no longer any ambiguous dependencies since all addresses are known, and so dependent loads will not be executed until their corresponding stores complete. This scheme still allows for some [...] "out-of-orderness"—the address generation operations for any in-flight loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> can execute out-of-order, and once addresses have been generated, the cache accesses for each load or store can happen in any order that respects the (now known) true dependences.|$|R
30|$|The forward {{distribution}} system is usually characterized by its sources (=dispatching locations), destinations (=points of reception) and associated links. To understand {{distribution system}}s within OC retailing, {{we need to}} consider the different types of sources (e.g., DCs <b>and</b> <b>stores)</b> <b>and</b> destinations (e.g., <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> customers) in the physical distribution structure, as well as possible delivery processes and modes, i.e., shipments to customers <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> (e.g., Fernie <b>and</b> Sparks 2009; Hübner et al. 2013 a).|$|R

5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of {{insanity}} and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> on his studio roof.|$|E
