In the Phenomenology of Perception Merleau-Ponty wrote: “Insofar as I have hands, feet; a body, I sustain around me intentions which are not dependent on my decisions and which affect my surroundings in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not choose” (1962, p.440).|$|E

500|$|I wanted {{somebody}} with a tremendous {{understanding of how to}} make a pop video, because my biggest challenge working with directors is that I am the director and I write the treatments and I get the fashion and I decide what it's about and it's very hard to find directors that will relinquish any sort of input from the artist. ...

500|$|Although {{the novel}} is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the {{striking}} thing about the work is [...] "how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events." [...] Jackson Benson believes that Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general. For example, Benson says that Hemingway drew out his experiences with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, {{what would happen if}} I were sent back to the front?" [...] Hemingway believed that the writer could describe one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface—an approach he called the iceberg theory, or the theory of omission.|$|E

500|$|In April 1890, {{during the}} run of The Gondoliers, however, Gilbert {{challenged}} Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged {{the cost of a}} new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that [...] "I left him with the remark that {{it was a mistake to}} kick down the ladder by which he had risen". Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte [...] "in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial."

500|$|The {{telecast}} {{also received}} unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures.

[...] Likewise, President of the National Organization for Women's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony's feminist tribute as [...] "one of the most hypocritical, patronizing things I saw in my whole life." [...] In response, Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating, [...] "The theme developed and raised consciousness in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think is positive, {{not only for the}} individual in general but for individual women specifically."

500|$|The composers {{started their}} writing separately, Cornell in his {{apartment}} in Paris, and Arnold in his house in London. Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing: [...] "It is difficult, I think, to write lyrics for a character, so really I just kind of wandered around {{for about a month}} not thinking about it too much, until I sort of formulated some idea of <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could approach it, where I'm kind of relating to what's in the character in the movie. And because this particular Bond is very edgy, but also has a lot of emotional depth, it's a lot easier." [...] Later the two musicians met and showed each other's ideas, and according to Arnold [...] "it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song." [...] Cornell wrote lyrics, to which Arnold added some lines and later music. Some of Arnold's ideas included the song's title, the heavy introduction, and [...] "having the same genetic material as the Bond theme, but in a different order and in a different shape".|$|E

The first release with a movie quote was [...] "Immortal", where Cudi sampled Adam Sandler in his 1995 film Billy Madison: [...] "That’s {{one of my}} favorite movies, man. From my childhood, straight up. I love Adam Sandler. Throughout the album I wanted to include clips from some of my favorite movies to kind of narrate the album a bit and liven it up and give it some personality." [...] He declared that throughout the album, people will hear scenes from several different movies: [...] "Yeah, different actors will pop up periodically. That’s how I felt when I finished the song. 'Oh my God. It's so good!' [...] So there had to be <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could express myself. So I had to find some of my favorite quotes from my favorite movies.

He’s so amazing. I just wanted to pay homage through song and let him know, like, 'You’re the shit!'" ...|$|E
500|$|After the reveal of the film's full cast, many {{outlets and}} fans began {{referring}} to the film as [...] "Avengers 2.5", given the variety and ensemble nature of the cast, usually reserved for the Avengers films, {{and the fact that}} the film no longer felt like a Captain America-centric one, as with The Winter Soldier. In response to this, Feige said, [...] "What's fun about Civil War though is, as you know from the comics, it's a very simple story. And it really has to be, to accommodate that many players. It's very much a Captain America movie and it's very much a sequel to the Winter Soldier in ways I don't think people .... It's a very simple structure that allows you to have these amazing character interactions in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't think becomes overwhelming." [...] Feige also revealed that Hope van Dyne / Wasp was in an original draft of the film, after receiving the Wasp costume at the end of Ant-Man, but was cut because [...] "there are so many characters in Civil War that we didn't want to do her a disservice," [...] saying Marvel was [...] "saving" [...] the character for a better environment to reveal van Dyne in the Wasp costume for the first time and see [...] "her dynamic with Scott [...] in a way it could play out".|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have the purpose that John had".|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Smile" [...] is a bubbly, mid-tempo {{tune with}} [...] "a barroom piano lick", subdued horns and a reggae beat, {{singing in a}} light falsetto, while the organ riff {{contains}} a sample of Jackie Mittoo playing keyboards on the 1960s rocksteady song [...] "Free Soul" [...] by The Soul Brothers, also written by Mittoo. He and Clement Dodd received credit on the song as co-writers. It was described to have a [...] "cod-reggae groove that smoulders like a barbecue", as a guitar and piano {{were used for the}} background music, following the notes Gm—F as its basic chord progression. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a metronome of 96 beats per minute, and is played in the key of F major. Lyrically, the song describes Allen's satisfaction in her former lover's suffering, being in a vengeful mood: [...] "At worst / I feel bad for a while, / But then I just smile / I go ahead and smile," [...] thus creating a contrast between [...] "the peppy melody and brassy lyrics". The inspiration for the song came from a real life experience, when Allen broke up with her then boyfriend, Lester Lloyd, resulting in a drug overdose and hospitalization for her depression. The singer claimed [...] "I started to get depressed and anyone who suffers from depression knows that it can soon get so bad that you can't get out of bed. It was then that I checked into the Priory. That was really tough as I was an emotional mess. [...] The lyrics are definitely bitter-sweet". Allen said she later regretted the direct approach of her lyrics: I'm now less inclined to do that, because everything that I do say gets repeated in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> haven't said it, or taken out of context and spun in some negative way — and it makes me really sad. I'm not, like, a negative person. I'm actually quite positive, but this industry has really made me feel angry and negative recently. I'm not enjoying it at the moment.|$|E
