Polyculture of tilapia with other more commercially valuable species is an opportunity to substantially improve the economic yields of rural producers. The economic viability of implementing a Nile tilapia with <b>Australian</b> redclaw <b>crayfish</b> polyculture was analyzed using profitability indicators such as internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value of the investment (NPV). A bioeconomic model was developed to simulate three production densities (33 / 0, 33 / 20, tilapia and crayfish, respectively), accounting for investment recuperation in time horizons of 5, 10 and 15 years. The model includes a biological sub-model describing the growth of both organisms, a management sub-model that influences organism development and an economic sub-model describing the main input and output variables of the economic setting of tilapia producers in the state of Yucatan. The biological sub-model was parameterized using published experimental polyculture data from Israel. A thermal correction function was integrated into Von Bertalanffy’s growth model to include the effect of temperature of Yucatan on growth in both organisms. The simulations showed a notable improvement in profitability when farms adopt the polyculture strategy, particularly over the 5 -year horizon.

40|$|Recent {{conservation}} assessments {{rank the}} world's freshwater crayfish {{in the five}} most endangered animal groups, and the Australian fauna as the most endangered of all the world's crayfish. In this paper, we introduce the 135 described species of freshwater crayfish in Australia, and {{provide an overview of}} this fauna and their current IUCN Red List conservation status. The <b>Australian</b> <b>crayfish</b> fauna is almost entirely endemic, and displays enormous variation in biology, distribution and ecology. Some Australian species are the world's fastest growing, most highly fecund and widely distributed crayfishes, and are tolerant of extreme variation in environmental conditions. Conversely, Australia is also home to many crayfish that are remarkably slow growing, late maturing and poorly fecund. Many species have highly restricted distributions and require specific environmental conditions that restrict them to particular areas and habitat types. These crayfish face a wide range of existing and emerging threats, and we discuss the research imperatives, practical actions, legislative changes and collaboration required to facilitate the recovery of crayfish populations.

40|$|Abstract. -The native <b>Australian</b> <b>crayfish</b> Cherax quadricarinatus (or Redclaw) is a large, highly fecund {{and fast}} growing species {{that has been}} widely {{translocated}} both interstate and internationally. This paper describes a translocated population of the species in Lake Ainsworth, an acidic coastal window lake in New South Wales. This population now represents the southern-most extent of its translocated range within Australia, and coincides with two native crayfishes, Cherax cuspidatus and a highly imperilled species of Tenuibranchiurus. Consistently high trap catches and collection of berried females indicates that the population in Lake Ainsworth is large, well established and self sustaining. The probable pathway of introduction to the lake was by human action (deliberate or accidental), rather than natural dispersal from previous sites of introduction. Native crayfish were not captured in the lake, but their presence was confirmed in ephemerally connected habitats ~ 2 - 3 km away. There are serious concerns about the further spread of the highly invasive C. quadricarinatus and its potential to displace native species. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Freshwater {{species in}} general (and {{crayfish}} specifically) often have limited ranges with high species endemism within, and species turnover between, catchments. Freshwater species also face ever-increasing threats, and genetic diversity (both at {{and below the}} species level) is being lost {{as a result of}} these threats. Molecular taxonomy provides a tool by which this diversity can be rapidly (and relatively cheaply) uncovered before it is lost. Identifying previously unrealised diversity within crayfish via molecular techniques can act as a stimulus to further taxonomic investigations and conservation efforts. Specific examples are given from <b>Australian</b> <b>crayfish,</b> where molecular data have highlighted significant genetic diversity, which may correspond to previously overlooked morphological variation. We hope these examples can promote the undertaking of wide scale molecular revisions of as many crayfish taxa as possible, looking for any previously unrecognised lineages within currently described species (akin to ESUs) that warrant further revision. Beyond this, we advocate that these lineages should be afforded conservation consideration in order to buy time for more thorough reviews to be completed.

40|$|In our {{preceding}} {{paper we}} established that Euastacus {{is the largest}} of the <b>Australian</b> <b>crayfish</b> genera and includes some of the largest, and some of the rarest, species in the World. Species generally share a common suite of biological traits of slow growth, late maturation, and long lifespans (> 30 years in some species). The distribution of the genus extends along most of the east coast of continental Australia, and from sea level to over 1500 m above sea level. Consequently, Euastacus inhabit most climatic zones in Australia, and are found {{in a wide range of}} habitats. In this paper we calculate distributions of the individual species, review threats, and assess the conservation status of all species against current IUCN Red List Criteria. Species' distributions range from highly restricted (2. 5 km 2) to widespread (> 150 000 km 2). Threats include: land use practices, pollution, recreational fishing, exotic species, and the known and anticipated effects of climate change. On these bases Euastacus separates into six conservation groups, with 80 % (39 species) evaluated as belonging in IUCN threat categories, the majority of these Endangered or Critically Endangered: a bleak assessment.

40|$|The Australian redclaw {{crayfish}} (Cherax quadricarinatus) {{has recently}} received attention as an emerging candidate for sustainable aquaculture production in Australia and worldwide.

In order {{to better understand the}} key reproduction and development regulating mechanisms in decapod crustaceans, the molecular toolkit available for model organisms such as C. quadricarinatus must be expanded. However, there has been no study undertaken to establish the C. quadricarinatus neuropeptidome.

40|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>crayfish</b> Cherax quadricarinatus is a gonochoristic decapod {{species in}} which the {{androgenic}} gland (AG), an organ unique to male crustaceans, regulates sex differentiation, sexual secondary characteristics, and behavior. It is thought that the AG exerts its effects through androgenic gland hormone(s), not yet identified in decapods, whose synthesis and secretion are mediated by AG uniquely expressed genes. In order to identify such genes, a subtractive cDNA library of C. quadricarinatus AGs was constructed using cDNA from AGs as the “tester” and cDNA from other peripheral glands as the subtractive reference. cDNA products of the subtractive library were cloned, sequenced and an automated BLAST-X search suggested similarity to other known proteins in different organisms. So far, 200 sequences were analyzed and assembled into 49 putative genes, part {{of them could be}} assigned to metabolic pathways and a few were putatively identified as structural proteins. The majority of the putative genes showed no significant similarity to any known proteins in the Swiss-Prot database.

40|$|Of the 10 <b>Australian</b> <b>crayfish</b> genera, Euastacus is {{the largest}} with 49 species described, {{including}} some of the largest, and some of the rarest, species in the World. Many species are slow growing, late maturing, and the lifespan of some exceeds 30 years. The distribution of the genus encompasses most of the east coast of Continental Australia, a latitudinal range of approximately 23 ? (a distance of over 2500 km). Euastacus also has the widest altitudinal range of all Australian genera, occurring from sea level to over 1500 m above sea level. Due to these broad geographical and altitudinal ranges, Euastacus inhabit most of the climatic zones in Australia, and are found {{in a wide range of}} habitats including large temperate lowland rivers, high altitude rainforest gullies and Alpine streams. We review the distribution, habitat, population data, and biology for these crayfish, and their current conservation status where available. Sixteen species were listed on the IUCN Red List in 1996, and there have been increasing concerns regarding the conservation status of the genus since then.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although it is {{possible}} to recover the complete mitogenome directly from shotgun sequencing data, currently reported methods and pipelines are still relatively time consuming and costly. Using a sample of the Australian freshwater crayfish Engaeus lengana, we demonstrate that it {{is possible}} to achieve three-day turnaround time (four hours hands-on time) from tissue sample to NCBI-ready submission file through the integration of MiSeq sequencing platform, Nextera sample preparation protocol, MITObim assembly algorithm and MITOS annotation pipeline. RESULTS: The complete mitochondrial genome of the parastacid freshwater crayfish, Engaeus lengana, was recovered by modest shotgun sequencing (1. 2 giga bases) using the Illumina MiSeq benchtop sequencing platform. Genome assembly using the MITObim mitogenome assembler recovered the mitochondrial genome as a single contig with a 97 -fold mean coverage (min. = 17; max. = 138). The mitogenome consists of 15, 934 base pairs and contains the typical 37 mitochondrial genes and a non-coding AT-rich region. The genome arrangement is similar to the only other published parastacid mitogenome from the Australian genus Cherax. CONCLUSIONS: We infer that the gene order arrangement found in Cherax destructor is common to <b>Australian</b> <b>crayfish</b> and may be a derived feature of the southern hemisphere family Parastacidae. Further, we report to our knowledge, the simplest and fastest protocol for the recovery and assembly of complete mitochondrial genomes using the MiSeq benchtop sequencer...|$|E
40|$|In small rhythmic active {{networks}} {{timing of}} individual neurons {{is crucial for}} generating different spatial-temporal motor patterns. Switching of one neuron between different rhythms can cause transition between behavioral modes. In {{order to understand the}} dynamics of rhythmically active neurons we analyzed the oscillatory membranpotential of a pacemaker neuron and used different neural network models to predict dynamics of its time series. In a first step we have trained conventional RBF networks and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) using gaussian kernels with intracellulary recordings of the pyloric dilatator neuron in the <b>Australian</b> <b>crayfish,</b> Cherax destructor albidus. As a rule SVMs were able to learn the nonlinear dynamics of pyloric neurons faster (e. g. 15 s) than RBF networks (e. g. 309 s) under the same hardware conditions. After training SVMs performed a better iterated one-step-ahead prediction of time series in the pyloric dilatator neuron with regard to test error and error sum. The test error decreased with increasing number of support vectors. The best SVM used 196 support vectors and produced a test error of 0. 04622 as opposed to the best RBF with 0. 07295 using 26 RBF-neurons. In pacemaker neuron PD the timepoint at which the membranpotential will cross threshold for generation of its oscillatory peak is most important for determination of the test error. Interestingly SVMs are especially better in predicting this important part of the membranpotential which is superimposed by various synaptic inputs, which drive the membranpotential to its threshold...|$|E
40|$|Variation {{in ambient}} pH {{is known to}} exert {{profound}} effects on ionoregulation and acid–base balance in decapod crustaceans, yet there is relatively little information on either metabolism or O 2 transport. Consideration of the respiratory {{as well as the}} ionic and acid–base responses to extreme pH environments is pertinent, since branchial ionoregulatory mechanisms also affect gas exchange via acid–base balance (Na+/H+, Cl 2 /HCO 32 or OH 2) (Wheatly and McMahon, 1981). The effect of extreme pH on the acid–base and ion physiology of the <b>Australian</b> <b>crayfish</b> Cherax destructor has been investigated (Ellis and Morris, 1995). The investigation reported here considers the effects of extreme pH on oxygen uptake and metabolic status. It has been proposed that acid and alkaline environments may increase energy expenditure for maintenance of homeostasis, which could subsequently reduce energy available for growth and reproduction (e. g. Spaargaren, 1975; Neville, 1985; Mangum, 1986; Hargeby, 1990). In addition, low levels of calcium in the water may further increase the energy expenditure required for homeostasis (Wood and Rogano, 1986). Exposure of trout to pH 4. 0 soft water, although impairing O 2 transport, does not limit resting O 2 consumption but reduces the scope for activity (Ye et al. 1991). More extreme acid conditions do impair resting O 2 uptake, suggesting that an acidosis may actually reduce O 2 consumption by direct action on metabolism at the tissue level. The objectives of this study were, first, to determine the consequences of extreme environmental pH for the haemolymph O 2 transport and delivery to the tissues in Cherax destructor and the requirement for anaerobiosis, thereby assessing to what extent acid or alkaline toxicity represents an energetically ‘expensive ’ environment for this species.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{rate at which}} complete mitogenomes are being sequenced and their increasing use for phylogenetic studies {{have resulted in a}} bioinformatic bottleneck in preparing and utilising such data for phylogenetic analysis. Hence, we present MitoPhAST, an automated tool that (1) identifies annotated protein-coding gene features and generates a standardised, concatenated and partitioned amino acid alignment directly from complete/partial GenBank/EMBL-format mitogenome flat files, (2) generates a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree using optimised protein models and (3) reports various mitochondrial genes and sequence information in a table format. To demonstrate the capacity of MitoPhAST in handling a large dataset, we used 81 publicly available decapod mitogenomes, together with eight new complete mitogenomes of <b>Australian</b> freshwater <b>crayfishes,</b> including the first for the genus Gramastacus, to undertake an updated test of the monophyly of the major groups of the order Decapoda and their phylogenetic relationships. The recovered phylogenetic trees using both Bayesian and ML methods support the results of studies using fragments of mtDNA and nuclear markers and other smaller-scale studies using whole mitogenomes. In comparison to the fragment-based phylogenies, nodal support values are generally higher despite reduced taxon sampling suggesting there is value in utilising more fully mitogenomic data. Additionally, the simple table output from MitoPhAST provides an efficient summary and statistical overview of the mitogenomes under study at the gene level, allowing the identification of missing or duplicated genes and gene rearrangements. The finding of new mtDNA gene rearrangements in several genera of <b>Australian</b> freshwater <b>crayfishes</b> indicates that this group has undergone an unusually high rate of evolutionary change for this organelle compared to other major families of decapod crustaceans. As a result, freshwater crayfishes are likely to be a useful model for studies designed to understand the evolution of mtDNA rearrangements. We anticipate that our bioinformatics pipeline will substantially help mitogenome-based studies increase the speed, accuracy and efficiency of phylogenetic studies utilising mitogenome information.

The ‘duplication/random loss’ mechanism is a plausible model for the observed translocations, while ‘intramitochondrial recombination’ may account for the gene inversions.
