2500|$|The {{controversy}} over Sierra's suspension {{and the subsequent}} trial drew local, national and international media attention. Initial reaction to Sierra's actions from the local media was unsympathetic. This was later attributed by Sierra's lawyers and Dan Radmacher – editor of the Charleston Gazette – to Principal Mann's repetition in his comments to the Gazette of Jacob Reed's statements concerning Sierra's message. [...] Sierra claims that callers to local radio stations [...] "wanted to shoot me in the head. They wanted to send me to another country." [...] The Charleston Daily Mail praised Mann's decision, calling Sierra's [...] "thoroughly egocentric exercise" [...] of her constitutional rights [...] "tiresome". The Daily Mail expanded on its position in a July 15, 2002 editorial; while noting Justice Lewis Powell's declaration that full constitutional rights did not apply equally in school as in criminal justice, the paper commented that [...] "students do have rights {{as long as they}} are not disrupting the education of others", and that while [...] Sierra's request to form an anarchist club [...] "may have seemed bizarre and even oxymoronic", Principal Mann ought to have permitted it [...] "since it would not harm or impinge upon the rights of others". It went on to praise the jury's decision that Sierra had no constitutional right to wear her T-shirts to class or to disobey the authority of Mann but that she did have the right to express her opinions <b>after</b> <b>class,</b> calling it [...] "the essence of Americanism … a great system that makes anarchy look silly".|$|E
