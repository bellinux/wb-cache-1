Hematological and biochemical parameters were evaluated as well as serum and tissue (kidney, liver and/or duodenum) protein and/or gene expression of mediators of erythropoiesis, iron metabolism and tissue hypoxia, inflammation, and fibrosis. Long-term treatment with a high rHuEPO dose is associated with development of resistance to therapy as a result of <b>antibodies</b> <b>formation.</b> In this condition, serum EPO levels are not deficient and iron availability is recovered by increased duodenal absorption. However, erythropoiesis is not stimulated, and the resistance to endogenous EPO effect and to rHuEPO therapy results from the development of a hypoxic, inflammatory and fibrotic milieu in the kidney tissue. This study provides new insights that could be important to ameliorate the current therapeutic strategies used to treat patients with CKD-associated anemia, in particular those that become resistant to rHuEPO therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of the five classes of immunoglobulins represents the highest grade of the various system of defence the man puts in act against the microbial attack. So bacteria fight in several levels across the different stages of human antibodies synthesis processes and action, trying for cancelling the effect. Therefore, a more exact definition of the mechanisms of bacterial actions against human immunoglobulins would permit us to intervene in a more efficacious way in favour of defence powers of the human organism. In this way we could improve {{the knowledge of the}} bacterial damage process, increase the means of human immunization, and our therapy attempts. We analyzed therefore in this study the different defence mechanisms that bacteria use against human immunoglobulins. Bacteria can avoid "a priori" or divert <b>antibodies</b> <b>formation,</b> by synthesis of surface structural identical to components of the host. Bacteria can stop or hinder transmission of antigenic message working against the phagocytosis mechanisms. Bacteria can stop or lessen antibodies synthesis process.

Transient HIV antigenemia appearing generally 6 - 8 weeks prior to HIV antibody (HIV-Ab) seroconversion and lasting 3 - 4 months is generally seen in acute infection.

However, HIV-Ag seroconversion may appear at any time after HIV-Ab seroconversion. Progression to AIDS is strongly associated with declining or absent levels of IgG antibodies to p 24.

This review discusses advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy, principally focusing on work published in the past 5 years.

40|$|Growth {{factors and}} {{transforming}} proteins that activate tyrosine phosphorylation {{have been shown}} to cause an increased labeling of 3 -phosphate-containing phosphatidylinositols. Turnover correlates with the formation of a complex between phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, the activated protein-tyrosine kinase, and other proteins thought to participate in transmembrane signaling. When human platelets are treated with thrombin, labeling of 3 -phosphate-containing phosphatidylinositols is stimulated with a time course and concentration dependence consistent with a role for these lipids in platelet activation. We now report that when human platelets are stimulated with thrombin, a complex forms between phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, a protein-serine/threonine kinase, and an uncharacterized platelet membrane protein. The complex is immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates of thrombinstimulated platelets by a rabbit antiserum prepared against a peptide from the cytoplasmic domain of the mouse platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor. The antigen is not the PDGF receptor, since complex formation is not stimulated by PDGF and thrombin-induced complexes are not precipitated by another rabbit antiserum against the same peptide or by monoclonal anti-human PDGF receptor <b>antibodies.</b> <b>Formation</b> of the complex is rapid (within 30 sec) and occurs at thrombin concentrations that stimulate platelet aggregation and secretion (50 % of maximal complex formation at 0. 03 unit of thrombin per ml).

Transient HIV antigenemia appearing generally 6 - 8 wk prior to HIV antibody (HIV-Ab) seroconversion and lasting 3 - 4 mth is generally seen in acute infection.

IgG 2 and IgG 4 antibodies to HIV, which are mainly directed to p 24, disappear most dramatically. Titers of antibodies to HIV p 24 below 64 are strongly associated with the presence of HIV antigen and a poor clinical outcome.
