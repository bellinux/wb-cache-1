5|$|After humans {{migrated}} out {{of their}} ancestral environment of eastern Africa, they were exposed to new climates <b>and</b> <b>challenges.</b> Thus, Wade argues, human evolution did not end with behavioural modernity, but continued to be shaped by the different environments and lifestyles of each continent. While many adaptations happened in parallel across human populations, Wade believes that genetic isolation – either because of geography or hostile tribalism – also facilitated a degree of independent evolution, leading to genetic and cultural differentiation from the ancestral population and giving rise to different human races and languages.|$|E
