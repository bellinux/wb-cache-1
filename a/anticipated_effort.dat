30|$|Following each memory, {{participants}} completed the AI. The AI was originally developed by Mauro et al. (1992) to investigate cross-cultural differences in appraisals. It consists of 28 questions around ten appraisal dimensions (pleasantness, attentional activity, certainty, coping ability, perceived control, responsibility, <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort,</b> goal/need conduciveness, legitimacy and norm/self-compatibility) related to specified events. Participants scored responses {{in relation to the}} positive and trauma memory on seven-point scales from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much).|$|E
30|$|Study 2 again {{found that}} the {{cultural}} influences on appraisals tended to extend to trauma memories. Specifically, Asian trauma survivors {{reported higher levels of}} pleasantness and legitimacy appraisals and lower levels of <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort,</b> goal/need conduciveness and attentional activity than the British group. This supports previous research that suggests Western cultures generally emphasize appraisals of <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort</b> and Asian cultures tend to appraise situations to be more legitimate when compared to Western cultures (Mauro et al. 1992; Mesquita and Walker 2003). Given the role of appraisals in PTSD, Study 2 was also interested in appraisals that differentiated between those with and without PTSD. Those with and without PTSD did not differ in their appraisals of attentional activity, certainty and coping associated with the negative memory. However, for the trauma memory those with PTSD reported fewer appraisals of attentional activity, certainty and coping than those without PTSD. Furthermore, those without PTSD appraised less personal responsibility for the trauma event. These differences between those with and without PTSD were evident regardless of one’s cultural background suggesting cultural similarities in the dysfunction appraisals of those with PTSD. The only appraisal type that differed cross-culturally was control; appraisals of control only differentiated between British trauma survivors with and without PTSD for the trauma memory. This aligns with Western cultures valuing control and violations of cultural expectations resulting in psychological distress (e.g. Jobson and O’Kearney 2009; Mesquita and Walker 2003).|$|E
30|$|Despite these {{cultural}} differences in appraisals, the findings overall {{also suggest that}} the relationships between cognitive appraisals and PTSD symptoms are predominately culturally similar. Those with and without PTSD, regardless of their cultural background, were found to appraise events differently; those with PTSD appraised their memories to be less pleasant with greater <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort</b> than those without PTSD. Additionally, those with PTSD were found to appraise the trauma memory uniquely. While those with and without PTSD tended to appraise the negative event similarly, those with PTSD appraised {{that they could not}} cope as well in the trauma event, perceived the trauma event to be less predictable, certain and understandable, and appraised that they had less motivation to attend closely to the event than trauma survivors who did not develop PTSD. Furthermore, those with PTSD felt they were personally responsible for the trauma event.|$|E

40|$|With a between-subjects {{experimental}} design, {{the present}} study examined effects of incidental emotions on cognitive processing in a subsequent decision-making task. Rather than taking a purely valence-based approach, this study investigated different aspects of emotional experience {{and its effects on}} cognitive processing. Findings suggested that aspects other than incidental valence are indeed important. As predicted, incidental arousal was negatively related to analytic processing and positively related to intuitive processing. Both perceived and physiological arousal were significant in explaining cognitive processing, whereas perceived valence was insignificant in all models. Findings also indicated a significant effect of certainty appraisals on analytic processing, but in opposite directions than predicted. A nearly significant interaction effect between physiological arousal and <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort</b> appraisals was also observed for analytic processing. Overall, findings imply that studies may benefit from going beyond valence when investigating emotion and its effects on cognitive processing.

40|$|The action {{abilities}} {{of an individual}} observer modulate his or her perception of spatial properties {{of the environment and}} of objects. The present study investigated how joint action abilities shape perception. Four experiments examined how the intention to lift an object with another individual affects perceived weight. In Experiments 1, 2 a, and 2 b, participants judged the perceived weight of boxes while expecting to lift them either alone or with a co-actor. In Experiment 3, the co-actor was healthy or injured. Participants intending to lift a box with a co-actor perceived the box as lighter than participants intending to lift the same box alone, provided that the co-actor appeared healthy and therefore capable of helping. These findings suggest that <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort</b> modulates the perception of object properties in the context of joint action.

40|$|A {{large number}} of studies have shown that effort {{influences}} the visual perception of reaching distance. These studies have mainly focused on the effects of reach-relevant properties of the body and of the objects that people intend to reach. However, any influence of the reach-relevant properties of the surrounding environment remains still speculative. We investigated this topic in terms of the role of obstacle width in perceiving distances. Participants had to estimate the straight-line distance to a cylinder located just behind a transparent barrier of varying width. The results showed that participants perceived the straight-line distance to the cylinder as being longer when they intended to grasp the cylinder by reaching around a wide transparent barrier rather than by reaching around narrower ones. Interestingly, this effect might be due to the <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort</b> involved in reaching. Together, our results show that reach-relevant properties of the surrounding environment influence perceived distances, thereby supporting an embodied view of the visual perception of space...|$|E

40|$|Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) {{packages}} {{have transformed}} the way organisations go {{about the process}} of providing Information Systems. Instead of crafting each new Information System locally, organisations are able to install well-integrated, internationally sourced packages that seek to provide best practice from IT systems world-wide. These packages also provide very rich choice in features and functions so that the adopting organisation can tailor the package implementation to meet their very specific needs. However, the enormous growth rate in ERP adoption has slowed.

The model proposes Task-Technology Fit (TTF), User Satisfaction, and ERP Utilisation as meaningful indicators of ERP success.

40|$|Sensorimotor {{mechanisms}} can unify explanations at cognitive, {{social, and}} cultural levels. As an example, we review how anticipated motor effort {{is used by}} individuals and groups to judge distance: the greater the <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort</b> the greater the perceived distance.

People with interdependent self- construals interact almost exclusively with in-group members, and hence there is little opportunity to tune their sensorimotor systems for interaction with out-group members. The result is that interactions with out-group members are expected to be difficult and out-group members are perceived as literally more distant. In two experiments we show (a) interdependent Americans, compared to independent Americans, see American confederates (in-group) as closer; (b) interdependent Arabs, compared to independent Arabs, perceive Arab confederates (in- group) as closer, whereas interdependent Americans perceive Arab confederates (out-group) as farther. These results demonstrate how the same embodied mechanism can seamlessly contribute to explanations at the cognitive, social, and cultural levels...|$|E

40|$|Using data {{provided}} by an empirical exploratory study with mathematics undergraduates, this paper discusses some key variables in the interaction between affective and cognitive dimensions in the perplexity state in problem solving.

Fuzzy sets were introduced as a tool to capture and accurately reflect the diversity and subjectivity in the interplay between cognition and emotion. The descriptive analysis of the responses to a fuzzy rating scale-based questionnaire shows the interaction between variables linked to the dimensions of control and certainty and students’ ability to cope with perplexity in performance in mathematics. The study also adds novel considerations related to the function and interaction of mathematics cognitive processes that are linked to appraisal processes, namely, the perception of goal-path obstacle, attentional activity and mental flexibility that contributes to the ability to solve simpler problem components involved in mathematical performance...|$|E

30|$|These {{theoretical}} propositions {{are supported}} by considerable research. Research has demonstrated Western cultures report more appraisals of perceived control, responsibility and <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort</b> than Asian cultures (e.g., Matsumoto et al. 1988; Mauro et al. 1992; Mesquita and Markus 2004; Scherer 1997) as Western cultures attach more value to agency, personal responsibility, and a personal sense of control (Fiske et al. 1998 Markus and Kitayama 1991 Nisbett et al. 2001). In contrast, personal agency and control has less applicability in Asian cultures rather interdependence of an individual and their environment is stressed (Mesquita and Walker 2003). Culture also influences how people react to different cognitive appraisals so that reactions generally correspond and reinforce cultural norms (e.g. Kim 2002; Kitayama et al. 2006; Leu et al. 2010; Mesquita and Markus 2004; Mesquita and Walker 2003). Appraisals of personal responsibility, autonomy and perceived control {{have been found to}} predict positive affect in Western cultural groups but less so for those from Asian cultures (Mesquita and Karasawa 2002; Mesquita and Walker 2003). Sato (2001) suggests that diminished levels of personal agency and perceived personal control can result in depression and anxiety in those holding a strong independent self-construal. In contrast, alienation and isolation may be more associated with depression and anxiety in those holding an interdependent self-construal.|$|E
30|$|Study 1 {{found that}} {{pleasant}} and trauma memories are appraised differently. Despite this, the British group, regardless of memory type, {{reported higher levels}} of <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort,</b> attentional activity and norm-self compatibility appraisals and lower levels of pleasantness appraisals than Asian participants. This aligns with previous cross-cultural research and reflects British participants valuing agency, assuming their reactions are typical and being less concerned about discrepancies with the reactions of others (Markus and Kitayama 2010; Mesquita and Walker 2003). The trauma memory was only unique in terms of legitimacy and responsibility appraisals. The Asian group reported the trauma memory was more legitimate than the British group. This may reflect Asian cultures having greater acceptance of situation outcomes and fate (Mesquita and Walker 2003). The British group, as in previous research, had significantly higher levels of appraisals of responsibility than the Asian group for the pleasant memory. However, for the trauma memory the British group did not differ from the Asian group and had reduced their appraisals of responsibility to a level equivalent to the Asian group. Given the importance of responsibility in Western cultures, participants from British cultures may not want to feel responsible for trauma events, which may challenge and threaten the independent self.|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic {{hemiplegia}} is {{a common}} long-term consequence of stroke, and subsequent motor recovery is often incomplete. Neurophysiological {{studies have focused on}} motor execution deficits in relatively high functioning patients. Much less is known about the influence exerted by processes related to motor preparation, particularly in patients with poor motor recovery. Methodology/Principal Findings: The current study investigates motor preparation using a modified response-priming experiment in a large sample of patients (n = 50) with moderate-to-severe chronic hemiparesis. The behavioural results revealed that hemiparetic patients had an increased response-priming effect compared to controls, but that their response times were markedly slower for both hands. Patients also demonstrated significantly enhanced midline late contingent negative variation (CNV) during paretic hand preparation, despite the absence of overall group differences when compared to controls. Furthermore, increased amplitude of the midline CNV correlated with a greater response-priming effect. We propose that these changes might reflect greater <b>anticipated</b> <b>effort</b> to respond in patients, and consequently that advance cueing of motor responses may be of benefit in these individuals. We further observed significantly reduced CNV amplitudes over the lesioned hemisphere in hemiparetic patients compared to controls during non-paretic hand preparation, preparation of both hands and no hand preparation. Two potential explanations for these CNV reductions ar...|$|E

But the applications of nanomaterials in industries have been hampered by the difficulty in controlling their size and morphology in a bulk amount. This impedes the commercial application of nanoparticles across the global industries than the micro particles. Various techniques have been adopted to synthesize the nanoparticles such as ultra sonication, pretreatment steps in electro less plating, electrostatic assemble method, and bi-functional composite method. The uncontrolled flow of chemicals by the above conventional methods leads to the aggregation as well as nonhomogeneous nature of the nanoparticles and even sometimes it leads to the formation of micro particles too.
