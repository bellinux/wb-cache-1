5|$|Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who was {{building}} a reputation for signing unwanted foreign veterans such as N'Gotty, Djorkaeff and Iván Campo, predicted that a win would help him sign more players in the summer.

5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> to inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|Erythromycin {{and other}} {{macrolides}} or clindamycin are recommended {{for people with}} severe penicillin allergies. First-generation cephalosporins {{may be used in}} those with less severe allergies and some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to penicillin. Streptococcal infections may <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Long-standing {{elevated}} {{uric acid}} levels (hyperuricemia) {{may result in}} other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of uric acid may <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> to crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{could be}} exploited industrially and commercially, and research {{that could lead}} to such applications is under way. A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E
5|$|The chronically low oxygen {{levels in}} the blood <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> to {{increased}} release of erythropoietin and the activation of erythropoeisis, the production of red blood cells. This results in polycythemia, abnormally increased numbers of circulating red blood cells and an elevated hematocrit.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} C. graminis {{is likely to}} be due to habitat loss {{resulting}} from land improvement and arable conversion, over-grazing, development, drainage and lowering of water-tables due to over-abstraction. Neglect may <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> to loss or degradation of habitat such as through over-shading or competition of food-plants with invasive species such as Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera). Flood-bank works may deplete or destroy local sub-populations.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica dust and fiberglass dust exposure can <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> to COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis. The negative effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E
5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team {{thought that it}} would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E
