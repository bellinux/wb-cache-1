In 1784, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in North America, at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Shelikhov envisioned <b>a</b> <b>continual</b> extension of the Russian maritime fur trade, with trading posts being set up farther and farther along the coast all the way to California. He sought exclusive control of the trade, and in 1788 Empress CatherineII decided to grant his company a monopoly only over the area it already occupied. Other traders were free to compete elsewhere. Catherine's decision was issued as the imperial ukase (proclamation) of September 28, 1788.|$|E

He is also considered <b>a</b> <b>continual</b> attacking threat, and has been noted by analysts for his exceptional stamina and pace, which allow for his constant, buccaneering runs up the wing; he has also drawn praise from pundits for rarely conceding careless fouls. Conversely, he has been criticised for giving too much room to opposition attackers, taking up poor positioning and lacking in defensive discipline, while other analysts have criticised his concentration.|$|E

5|$|In 1864, Rodin {{began to}} live with a young {{seamstress}} named Rose Beuret (born in June 1844), with whom he would stay– with ranging commitment– {{for the rest of his}} life. The couple had a son, Auguste-Eugène Beuret (1866–1934). That year, Rodin offered his first sculpture for exhibition, and entered the studio of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, a successful mass producer of objets d'art. Rodin worked as Carrier-Belleuse' chief assistant until 1870, designing roof decorations and staircase and doorway embellishments. With the arrival of the Franco-Prussian War, Rodin was called to serve in the National Guard, but his service was brief due to his near-sightedness. Decorators' work had dwindled because of the war, yet Rodin needed to support his family; poverty was <b>a</b> <b>continual</b> difficulty for Rodin until about the age of 30. Carrier-Belleuse soon asked Rodin to join him in Belgium, where they would work on ornamentation for the Brussels Stock Exchange.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the Icelandic airline Loftleidir {{was granted}} the {{concession}} to fly from Keflavík Airport outside Reykjavík to New York and Chicago in the United States, and to Oslo, Copenhagen and London.

This aircraft was sold to Loftleidir the following year. In 1956, another DC-4, LN-SUP, was bought, and used for charter and by Loftleidir. In 1959 and 1960, Loftleidir received two new Douglas DC-6B aircraft, with a five-year mechanical agreement with Braathens SAFE. In 1960, the two companies agreed to terminate the cooperation from 1 January 1961.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{increased}} its naval {{presence in the}} Black Sea significantly following the Russian invasion, with ships docking in Georgian ports, {{and according to the}} US Navy, delivering humanitarian aid.

Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn reminded NATO of the limit on the number of vessels allowed in the Black Sea under the 1936 Montreux convention. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance, alleging the delivery of military material. According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, the US maintained <b>a</b> <b>continual</b> presence in the Black Sea.

40|$|<b>As</b> <b>continual</b> {{research}} is being {{conducted in the}} area of computer vision, one of the most practical applications under vigorous development is in the construction of a robust face detection system. While the problem of detecting faces under various variations remains largely unsolved, a demonstration system as proof of concept that such systems are now becoming practical have been developed. A system capable of reliable detection, with reduced constraints in regards to the position and orientation of the face and the illumination and background of the image, has been implemented. Those face detection system is based upon “eigenfaces”, which has been separated into three major modules – pre-processing, construction of face space and face localization. A completely robust real-time face detectionsystem is still under heavy investigation and development, the implemented systems are still serving as an extendable foundation for future research...|$|R
40|$|<b>As</b> <b>continual</b> {{research}} is being {{conducted in the}} area of computer vision, one of the most practical applications under vigorous development is in the construction of a robust real-time face detection system. Successfully constructing a real-time face detection system not only implies a system capable of analyzing video streams, but also naturally leads onto the solution to the problems of extremely constraint testing environments. Analyzing a video sequence is the current challenge since faces are constantly in dynamic motion, presenting many different possible rotational and illumination conditions. While solutions to the task of face detection have been presented, detection performances of many systems are heavily dependent upon a strictly constrained environment. The problem of detecting faces under gross variations remains largely uncovered. This study presents a real-time face detection system which uses an image based neural network to detect images...|$|R
