Subsequent RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription {{from these}} DNA templates fully reconstituted in chromatin in a HeLa nuclear extract was increased 50 -fold compared with naked DNA. Remarkably, under specific conditions, {{production of a}} high level of transcripts occurred at very low DNA (1 ng/microliter) and HeLa nuclear protein (1. 6 micrograms/microliters) concentrations. When partially reconstituted templates were used, transcription efficiency was intermediate between that of fully reconstituted and naked DNA.

Depletion from the oocyte assembly extract of an NF-I-like factor which binds in the promoter region upstream of the TATA box (- 114 to - 101) or deletion from the promoter of the region interacting with this factor reduced the transcriptional efficiency of the <b>assembled</b> <b>templates</b> by a factor of 5, but transcription of these templates was still 10 times higher than that of naked DNA.

40|$|Chromatin {{architecture}} is regulated through both enzymatic and non-enzymatic activities. For example, the Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins maintain developmental gene silencing using {{an array of}} chromatin-based mechanisms. The essential Drosophila PcG protein, Posterior Sex Combs (PSC), compacts chromatin and inhibits chromatin remodeling and transcription through a non-enzymatic mechanism involving nucleosome bridging. Nucleosome bridging is achieved {{through a combination of}} nucleosome binding and self-interaction. Precisely how PSC interacts with chromatin to bridge nucleosomes is not known and {{is the subject of this}} work. We determine the stoichiometry of PSC-chromatin interactions in compact chromatin (in which nucleosomes are bridged) using Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM). We find that full compaction occurs with one PSC per nucleosome. In addition to compacting chromatin, we show that PSC oligomerizes nucleosome arrays. PSC-mediated oligomerization of chromatin occurs at similar stoichiometry as compaction suggesting it may also involve nucleosome bridging. Interactions between the tail of histone H 4 and the acidic patch of histone H 2 A are important for chromatin folding and oligomerization, and several chromatin proteins bind the histone H 2 A acidic patch. However, mutation of the acidic patch of histone H 2 A does not affect PSC’s ability to inhibit chromatin remodeling or bridge nucleosomes. In fact, PSC does not require nucleosomes for bridging activity but can bridge naked DNA segments.

The use of topological templates {{proves to be}} a versatile concept in protein design [1] and mimicry [2, 3].

40|$|The {{existence}} of torsional stress in eukaryotic chromatin has been controversial. To {{determine whether it}} could be detected, we probed the structure of an alternating AT tract.

The single-strand-specific nuclease P 1 {{was used to determine}} the structure of an alternating AT sequence upstream of the Xenopus beta-globin gene when assembled into chromatin in microinjected Xenopus oocytes. The pattern of cleavage by P 1 nuclease strongly suggests that the DNA in this chromatin template is under torsional stress. The cruciform was detected specifically in the most fully reconstituted templates at later stages of chromatin assembly, suggesting that negative supercoiling is associated with chromatin maturation. Furthermore, the number of torsionally strained templates increased dramatically at the time when transcription of <b>assembled</b> chromatin <b>templates</b> began. Transcription itself has been shown to induce supercoiling, but the requisite negative supercoiling for cruciform extrusion by (AT) n in oocytes was not generated in this way since the characteristic P 1 cutting pattern was retained even when RNA polymerase elongation was blocked with alpha-amanitin. Thus, torsional stress is associated with transcriptional activation of chromatin templates in the absence of ongoing transcription...|$|R

In this study, we investigated the role of inherent splice site strength in the alternative splicing decision and whether recognition of the splice sites is the major determinant of exon incorporation. Results We found that mutation of the flanking sub-optimal splice sites to consensus sequences caused the exon to be constitutively spliced in-vivo. These {{findings are consistent with}} the exon-definition model for splicing.

The resistance of the stable complex to the usual inhibitory effect of high DNA concentration suggests that more than one DNA binding factor recognizes the rDNA promoter region and is needed to direct faithful transcription. Finally, although the stable complex is specific for the rRNA initiation region, added vector sequences can neutralize nonspecific DNA binding components that are also present in the cell extract.

Using two distinct approaches to interrupt the physical interaction between Tax and KIX, we find that Tax transactivation from chromatin templates is strongly dependent on CBP/p 300 recruitment via the KIX domain.

As material properties emerge from both chemical and structural features, independent structural control across multiple length scales enables the realization of novel materials. Layer by layer (LBL) assembly provides nanoscale structural control for the fabrication of polymer-nanocomposites with exceptional material properties. However, the planar deposition technique limits the incorporation of alternative structural features as is required for advanced applications.

Expanded to carbon nanotube composites, the integration of inkjet LBL with paper-based electronics and traditional microfabrication techniques is explored. Next, reversible shape transformations are achieved in carbon nanotube composites driven by the stimuli-responsive behavior of polyelectrolyte multilayers.

The Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was chosen as a model biological template to investigate a series of approaches for the practical use of biological nanotemplates. Three specific achievements using TMV templates are discussed. ^ First, the deposition of silica on the surface of TMV has been achieved at a higher pH (5 - 7) as a means to enhance its usefulness as a template for the synthesis of nanostructures. Electron energy loss spectroscopy definitively showed the presence of a silica shell {{on the surface of the}} TMV while small angle X-ray scattering differentiated between silica-coated TMV and silica particles in the presence of uncoated TMV. The TMV-templated silica coatings were found to enhance the stability to the virus particle in methanol at conditions that would ordinarily disrupt the assembled particle. Silica-coated TMV virions were shown to be applicable as templates for the deposition of platinum and palladium nanoparticles with particle density comparable to the deposition on the TMV 2 cys. ^ Secondly, additional TMV templates were designed and created through PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis to include cysteine point mutations along the inner channel of the coat protein. The templates were then utilized for the spatially controllable growth of nickel and cobalt nanoparticles within the inner channel. Particle density was shown to vary with mutation location and catalyst concentration. ^ Finally, high area nickel and cobalt surfaces were assembled using genetically modified TMV 1 cys templates. TMV templates engineered to encode unique cysteine residues were self-assembled onto gold patterned surfaces in a vertically oriented fashion, producing an order of magnitude increase in surface area. Electroless deposition of metals onto surface <b>assembled</b> virus <b>templates</b> produced uniform coatings up to 40 nm thick. Within a nickel-zinc battery system, the incorporation of virus-assembled electrode surfaces more than doubled the total electrode capacity. ^ Combined these investigations demonstrate the versatility of the TMV template in achieving the successful construction and application of nanomaterials. ...|$|R

Template-mediated volumetric (i. e., interstitial) effects and interfacial factors are shown to preserve the metastable crystalline polymorphs of each corresponding 3 DOm oxide (i. e., anatase TiO 2 (A-TiO 2) and tetragonal ZrO 2 (t-ZrO 2)) during high-temperature calcination. Mechanistic investigations suggest that this polymorph stabilization {{is derived from the}} combined effects of the template–replica (MOx/SiO 2) interface and simultaneous interstitial confinement that limit the degree of coarsening during high-temperature calcination of the template–replica composite. The result is the identification of a facile yet versatile templating strategy for realizing 3 DOm oxides with (i) surface areas that are more than an order of magnitude larger than untemplated control samples, (ii) pore diameters and volumes that can be tuned across a continuum of size scales, and (iii) selectable polymorphism...|$|R
