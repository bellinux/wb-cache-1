He later became known as a benefactor and sponsor of local wrestling. Kristiansund's first major national tournament was held in 1915 and the first Norwegian Championships in Kristiansund were held in 1922. Løvold also traveled to the neighboring town of Molde to establish <b>a</b> <b>wrestling</b> club there, although wrestling never became as popular in Molde as in Kristiansund. He also established Trondheim's first wrestling club. From 1939, when the labourers' wrestling clubs in Kristiansund merged to form the club Kristiansund AK, Løvold represented this club.|$|E
