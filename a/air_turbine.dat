An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables.

5|$|The P.1127 lacked any in-built armaments, {{the ethos}} of {{tactical}} flexibility meant a reliance upon underwing hard point-mounted munitions and equipment, which included multiple 2-inch rocket batteries, 30-mm ADEN cannon gun pods, and 1,000 lb bombs, napalm, and range-extending drop tanks. The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel with a much smaller counterpart on the vertical stabilizer to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead. An unusual feature of the P.1127 was the installation of a ram <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> upon the rear fuselage just forward of the vertical stabilizer to provide power for ancillary services {{in the event of}} engine failure.|$|E

The <b>air</b> <b>turbines</b> included in the paper are as follows: Wells type turbines, impulse turbines, radial turbines, cross-flow turbine, and Savonius turbine. The overall performances of the turbines under irregular wave conditions, which typically occur in the sea, have been compared by numerical simulation and sea trial. As a result, under irregular wave conditions it is found that the running and starting characteristics of the impulse type turbines could be superior to those of the Wells turbine.

5|$|Three {{independent}} {{hydraulic systems}} are {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup hydraulic motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E
5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E

The airframe is very durable and strong, stressed for +9g, the normal limit in RAF service is +7.5/-4g. A dual hydraulic system supplies power to operate systems such as the aircraft's flaps, airbrakes and landing gear, together with the flight controls.

25|$|The AJ, SF, SH and SK 37 {{models of}} the Viggen had {{the first version of}} the RM8A engine with uprated {{internal}} components from the JT8D that it was based on. Thrust was 65.6kN dry and 115.6kN with afterburner. For the JA 37, the RM8A was developed into the RM8B, achieved by adding a third low-pressure compressor stage over the preceding model, increasing the turbine inlet temperature and fuel diffusion within the combustion chamber. Thrust is 72.1kN dry and 125.0kN with afterburner. Due to the increased length and weight of the RM8B engine over its predecessor, the airframe of the JA 37 was stretched in order to accommodate it. Onboard electrical power was provided by a 60 kVA generator. In the event of an in-flight engine failure, emergency power was provided by an automatically deploying ram <b>air</b> <b>turbine</b> (RAT), capable of generating 6 kVA.|$|E

This warm stream of air is leaving part of its thermodynamic energy to the <b>air</b> <b>turbines</b> placed in the path of the airflow. The solar chimney power stations were named Solar Aero-Electric Power Plants (SAEPPs) due to their similarity to Hydro Electric Power Plants. The efficiency of the SAEPPs is roughly proportional to the height of their solar chimneys. Solar Chimneys can be made as reinforced concrete structures (Concrete Solar Chimneys, CFCs), or as lighter than air inflated structures (Floating Solar Chimneys FSCs). These floating solar chimneys are made by successive balloon tubes, filled with a lighter than air gas. This permits to the FSCs to float in the air and thus to have heights 1. 5 ÷ 3 Km giving to their SAEPPs higher efficiencies than Concrete Solar Chimney SAEPPs. Using ground thermal storage, or artificial thermal storage in the form of water in closed plastic tubes, it can be proved that the SAEPPs can operate 24 hours per day 365 days per year with a minimum guaranteed power production. This means that the SAEPPs, although renewable by nature, can have a similar operation to conventional power stations and thus can replace them. In the present paper a comparison for construction cost of SAEPPs with Floating Solar Chimneys and Concrete Solar Chimneys is given. It is shown that FSC Technology Power Plants is 5 to 6 times cheaper than CFC Technology Power Plants. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R
