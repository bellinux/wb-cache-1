40|$|Many known 5 -HT 7 ligands contain {{either a}} serotonin-like or an arylpiperazine {{structure}} that, in published SAR studies, are generally supposed to bind the same receptor pocket. Conversely, we explored {{the hypothesis that}} two such moieties can co-exist in the same ligand, binding to different pockets. We thus designed and synthesized a set of compounds including both a 5 -hydroxyindol- 3 -ylethyl and a 1 - arylpiperazine moieties connected by a short linker. The compounds were tested for their affinity for human 5 -HT 7 serotonin receptor. We further prepared a novel series of 5 -HT 7 ligands, where the 5 - hydroxyindol- 3 -ylethyl moiety was bioisosterically replaced by a 3 -hydroxyanilinoalkyl one. Among the newly synthesized compounds, potent ligands at the 5 -HT 7 receptor, behaving as antagonists in functional tests, were identified, even if they showed limited subtype selectivity. Docking studies within {{a model of the}} 5 -HT 7 receptor showed that the binding site can actually accommodate both moieties, with the serotonin-like one in the putative orthosteric site and the arylpiperazine one occupying an <b>accessory</b> <b>pocket.</b> The present results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} devise and develop new 5 -HT 7 ligands merging two privileged structures in the same molecule...|$|E
40|$|Our {{investigation}} of quinazolines as H 3 K 9 methyltransferase/demethylase or DNMT inhibitors {{led us to}} identify MC 3774, a Lys-mimicking derivative displaying dual G 9 a methyltransferase/LSD 1 inhibition. In particular, MC 3774 showed IC 50 values of 1205 nM and 440 nM on G 9 a and LSD 1 respectively. In MV 4 - 11 leukemia cells, MC 3774 displayed antiproliferative activity with IC 50 = 894 nM. The most interesting aspect of this investigation is about the inhibition mechanism. We designed MC 3774 supposing that the insertion of the propaneamine moiety could mimic the H 3 K 4 me 2 moiety of the substrate bound within the active site. Surprisingly, the compound does not enter into the <b>accessory</b> <b>pocket</b> but binds the enzyme disposed with five copies in a stacked way obstructing the active site. The orientation of the molecules can be “face to face” or “head to tail”, and in both modes they interact with a cluster of negatively charged aminoacidic residues 4. This kind of non-covalent and reversible inhibition is typical for the interaction between quinazoline scaffold and the catalytic cleft of LSD 1, in fact MC 3774 does not inhibit G 9 a using the same stacking mode. From the compound MC 3774, some derivatives have been obtained {{as the result of}} the molecular simplification of the lead, which have led to the determination of the two methoxy at C 6 and C 7 positions, the dimethylaminopropylamine at C 2 and the N-benzylpiperidine at C 4, as essential for the effective inhibition of LSD 1. Considering these observation, we worked on the synthesis of several analogs of the lead compound MC 3774, modifying the quinazoline scaffold in position 2 with alkylamino functions of different length variously substituted at omega position and replacing the NH in position 4 with an oxygen atom or with N-CH 3, or modifying the N-benzyl moiety with other aryl-alkyl functions, with the aim to increase the selectivity towards LSD 1 or the dual inhibitory properties and to improve the potency in AML cells. These structural manipulations led to satisfying results: in fact two compounds among those synthesized, MC 4016 and MC 4057, show an increased inhibitory potency on LSD 1 with Kd values in the nanomolar range. In addition, for the compound MC 4013 we observed the improvement of the dual inhibitory properties demonstrated by the fact that the inhibitory potency grew on both the enzymes. Quinazolines also found a collocation among the wide array of DNMT inhibitors since when evidence of a low inhibitory activity of UNC 0638 over DNMT 1 was disclosed. In view of this finding, our research group spent many efforts in performing chemical manipulations of the quinazoline based histone methyltransferases and demethylases inhibitors, in order to achieve new knowledge about the potential of this scaffold in the context of DNMT inhibition. Firstly, we speculated that the removal of the methoxy groups from the positions 6 and 7 of the quinazoline core of BIX 01294, UNC 0638 and their analogs, should be useful to decrease the interactions that allow the targeting of enzymes that act on histone lysine residues. Indeed, the 6 -methoxy group is mimic for H 3 A 7 and the substituent at the C- 7 reproduces the bound conformation of H 3 K 9. Next, we investigated the substitution at the position 2 that led to the identification of MC 2705 a 6, 7 -desmethoxyquinazoline equipped with the 4 -amino-benzylpiperidine moiety and the 2 -phenylpiperazine group at the C- 2 position, as a novel and selective DNMT 3 A inhibitor. Another approach, was employed by Arimondo’s group. They supposed that the design of compounds able to resemble the transition state of the DNMT catalytic site, could be a good strategy to obtain an effective inhibition. Among the resulting series of derivatives, two compounds arranged with bulky substituents at the C- 4 and equipped with cytosine mimic group the quinoline nucleus, linked to the C- 7 through the 2 -aminoethyl-piperidinemethanol moiety which showed high inhibitory potency against DNMT 3 A as attested by the IC 50 values of 1. 1 and 0. 3 µM respectively. The present project arises from our fruitful collaboration with Arimondo’s group. The rational consists in the combination of the results obtained in the previous investigations, by designing new chimeric derivatives, endowed with the structural requirements that demonstrated to be essential for the inhibitory potency of the quinazoline based DNMT inhibitors, in order to get compounds suitable for the evaluation in vivo. The synthesis and biological evaluation of the designed series of properly substituted quinazoline based derivatives, led us to identify novel bulky compounds, endowed with excellent inhibitory potency against DNMT 3 A and, in a low extent, also against DNMT 1. From a structural point of view, they are characterized by the quinazoline scaffold decorated with the 2 -(N-phenylpiperazine), coming from the compound MC 2705, the variously arranged bulky hydrophobic moiety at the position 4, connected to the central core by the crucial secondary amino group, and differently sized substituents at the position 7 ranging from the simple hydroxyl group to the cytidine-mimicking quinoline nucleus with its relative linker. The methoxy group at the position 6, whose presence was initially correlated with the enzymes involved in the histone methylation, fits well into the active site of DNMT 3 A, but it is not strictly essential, since its elimination does not affect the inhibitory potency. They were screened in KG- 1 leukemic cells to evaluate their antiproliferative properties. The results indicated that some compounds among those synthesized, are able to inhibit the cells proliferation in a concentration dependent manner, with EC 50 values, determined by measuring the level of ATP released by the viable cells, in the low micromolar range...|$|E
30|$|Although crystal structure-based {{characterization}} of the active center of PSMA revealed an additional lipophilic binding <b>pocket</b> (S 1 <b>accessory</b> lipophilic <b>pocket)</b> near the S 1 site [32, 35], the affinity of natGa- and natLu- 11 was comparable to metallated 10 being in the low nanomolar range. Thus, substitution of suberic acid in inhibitor 10 by glutaric acid-(iodo-phenylalanine) in inhibitor 11 does not increase the affinity to PSMA as reported previously for PSMA inhibitors with aromatic moieties conjugated to the KuE motif [28].|$|R
