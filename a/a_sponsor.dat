5|$|Midway {{through the}} 2010 season, Bouygues Telecom {{announced}} that they wished to reduce their involvement in financing the team, and were interested in continuing their partnership with the squad. This was on the proviso that team manager Jean-René Bernaudeau could find a primary sponsor that would allow Bouygues Telecom to contribute €1 million to the team's budget, {{but the rest of}} its finances would be covered by an incoming sponsor. At this point in time, the team had lodged an application to become a UCI ProTeam once again in 2011.
