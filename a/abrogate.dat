5|$|Liliʻuokalani {{ascended to}} the throne on January 29, 1891, nine days after her brother's death. During her reign, she {{attempted}} to draft a new constitution which would restore {{the power of the}} monarchy and the voting rights of the economically disenfranchised. Threatened by her attempts to <b>abrogate</b> the Bayonet Constitution, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was bolstered by the landing of US Marines under John L. Stevens to protect American interests, which rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself.|$|E
5|$|After the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was {{ratified}} in 1920, the Russian SFSR recognized Lithuanian {{claims to}} the Vilnius Region and continued to support them. In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the Soviet Union expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to <b>abrogate</b> the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932. It made it clear, though, {{that it did not}} wish to be drawn into an armed conflict. This stance has been attributed to the growth of a threat from Japan; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the Red Army to invade either Poland or Latvia and could have resulted in a war on two fronts. The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage a more moderate version of the ultimatum. France and the United Kingdom, preoccupied with the Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible. They feared that the ultimatum had been approved by Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|As {{a strong}} proponent {{for a new}} constitution, White helped Queen Liliʻuokalani draft the 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Nāwahī was the other {{principal}} author, and Samuel Nowlein, captain of the Household Guard, was another contributor. These three had been meeting with the queen in secret since August 1892 after attempts to <b>abrogate</b> the Bayonet Constitution by legislative decision through a constitutional convention had proved largely unsuccessful. The proposed constitution would increase {{the power of the}} monarchy, restore voting rights to economically disenfranchised Native Hawaiians and Asians, and remove the property qualification for suffrage imposed by the Bayonet Constitution, among other changes. On the afternoon of January14, after the knighting ceremony of White and Nāwahī and the prorogation of the legislature, members of Hui Kālaiʻāina and a delegation of native leaders marched to ʻIolani Palace with a sealed package containing the constitution. According to William DeWitt Alexander, this was pre-planned by the queen to take place while she met with her newly appointed cabinet ministers in the Blue Room of the palace. She was attempting to promulgate the constitution during the recess of the legislative assembly. However, these ministers, including Samuel Parker, William H. Cornwell, John F. Colburn, and Arthur P. Peterson, were either opposed to or reluctant to support the new constitution.|$|E
5000|$|Fatoohi {{includes}} {{examples of}} verses <b>abrogated</b> by 9:5 to be 3:186, 53.29, 43:89, adding Tabari listed 9:5 to be <b>abrogating</b> 15 Quranic verses, Al-Balkhi suggested it <b>abrogated</b> 16 verses, Ibn Hazm claimed it <b>abrogated</b> 94 Quranic verses, Ibn Khuzayma concluded 9:5 <b>abrogated</b> 116 Quranic verses, while Ibn Salama and Ibn al-Arabi {{stated that it}} <b>abrogated</b> 124 verses. Various medieval Islamic scholars, but not all, considered verse 9:5 <b>abrogated</b> Quranic verse 2:256 ("there is no compulsion in religion"). Fatoohi adds that regardless of historical scholarship, {{it is a serious}} flaw to suggest that Quranic verse 9:5 <b>abrogated</b> commands in older Quranic revelations that Muslims should be tolerant of non-Muslims, when verse 9:5 is studied in the context of nearby verses {{and the fact that the}} Islamic scholars disagree with each other. Yaser Ellethy states that historical exegesis included Jews and Christians as the [...] "Others" [...] in the scope of <b>abrogating</b> verse 9:5, however, the historical analysis by Islamic scholars of [...] "abrogating tolerance against Others" [...] was baseless according to Ellethy.|$|R

5|$|Outside of the Western hemisphere, Hayes's biggest {{foreign policy}} concern dealt with China. In 1868, the Senate had {{ratified}} the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing an unrestricted flow of Chinese immigrants into the country. As the economy soured after the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing workmen's wages. During the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, anti-Chinese riots {{broke out in}} San Francisco, and a third party, the Workingman's Party, was formed {{with an emphasis on}} stopping Chinese immigration. In response, Congress passed a Chinese Exclusion Act in 1879, abrogating the 1868 treaty. Hayes vetoed the bill, believing that the United States should not <b>abrogate</b> treaties without negotiation. The veto drew praise among eastern liberals, but Hayes was bitterly denounced in the West. In the subsequent furor, Democrats in the House of Representatives attempted to impeach him, but narrowly failed when Republicans prevented a quorum by refusing to vote. After the veto, Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W. Seward suggested that both countries work together to reduce immigration, and he and James Burrill Angell negotiated with the Chinese to do so. Congress passed a new law to that effect, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, after Hayes left office.|$|E

5000|$|Yasir Qadhi {{explains}} {{that one reason}} for the difference in number of <b>abrogated</b> verses comes from a confusion over [...] "naskh" [...] (abrogation) and [...] "takhsees" [...] (clarification). Qadhi cites the following as an example of [...] "takhsees": verse 8:1 says the [...] "spoils are for Allah and His Messenger", whereas 8:41 says [...] "one-fifth is for Allah and His Messenger"; thus verse 8:41 explains 8:1, it doesn't cancel it. Yet many scholars, he says, include clarified verses with <b>abrogated</b> ones to produce a large total of <b>abrogated</b> verses.|$|R

25|$|A {{little less}} than two decades earlier, in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445 (1976), the Court had held that Congress can <b>abrogate</b> state {{sovereign}} immunity pursuant to its powers under the Fourteenth Amendment, which clearly contemplates limiting {{the power of the}} states. In Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1 (1989), the Court had held that Congress could also <b>abrogate</b> sovereign immunity under the Commerce Clause - but there was no majority in that decision. Justice Brennan was joined by three other justices in asserting that the Eleventh Amendment {{was nothing more than a}} reflection of common law sovereignty that could be swept aside by Congress; Justice Scalia was also joined by three other justices in taking the opposite view; and Justice Byron White wrote a separate opinion holding that Congress had such power, but stating his disagreement with Brennan's opinion (but not his own rationale).|$|E
