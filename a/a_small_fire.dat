5|$|<b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> {{broke out}} in the gas turbine engine room (located high on the ship behind the Queen Mary 2 sign) on the evening of 5 October 2011. The fire was started in one of the ship's gas turbines. No {{injuries}} were reported, and crew on board the ship managed to safely extinguish the fire.|$|E
5|$|Operating {{costs for}} Rich Passage 1 were funded by federal grants {{as part of}} the study, but expired {{at the end of the}} {{passenger}} service trial in 2012. As a result, the vessel spent several years in out-of-water storage, with the exception of infill trips for Washington State Ferries routes and periodic test runs. During one of the infill trips, the ferry ran aground near Port Hadlock in January 2013, and was later damaged by <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> while in storage in Port Townsend.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1912, the new library {{opened on}} the {{property}} near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, {{and much of the}} furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included hardwood floors, crown molding, windows that were two-stories tall, and a fireplace. The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> damaged the furnace room and about 50 books at the library.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} scored {{four hits}} and three near misses on and around Arizona. The near miss off the port bow {{is believed to}} have caused observers to believe that the ship had been torpedoed, although no torpedo damage has been found. The sternmost bomb ricocheted off the face of Turret IV and penetrated the deck to detonate in the captain's pantry, causing <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire.</b> The next forwardmost hit was near the port edge of the ship, abreast the mainmast, probably detonating {{in the area of the}} anti-torpedo bulkhead. The next bomb struck near the port rear 5-inch AA gun.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral George Pettengill {{relieved}} Bryant on 4 March 1935 and {{the ship}} participated in Fleet Problem XVI two months later. Arizona made a port visit to Balboa, Panama, in May 1936 during Fleet Problem XVII. On 8 June, Captain George A. Alexander relieved Baum as captain, and, 15 days later, Rear Admiral Claude C. Bloch relieved Pettengill. During gunnery practice on 24 July, the combustion gases from one gun of Turret II entered the gun turret, burning one crewman. The turret's sprinkling system was turned on to prevent any powder explosion, but the water leaked into the turret's electrical switchboard and started <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> that was easily put out. Due to the navy's limited budget, the ship spent most of this period in port as a fuel-saving measure. In Fiscal Year 1936–37, the ship was anchored for 267 days; the following year it was in port for 255 days. The ship {{spent the rest of}} her career based on the West Coast or in Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> {{that erupted}} in Haifa's Neve Yosef {{neighborhood}} in the afternoon was extinguished by midnight.|$|E
50|$|A light design utilising <b>a</b> <b>small</b> (7.5m) {{preparation}} building, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>firing</b> {{control room}} and the 36m launch ramp which was supplied in kit form, with legs resting in concrete recesses.|$|R
50|$|On {{the same}} day <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fire</b> in the highest tower of Alticom, the Gerbrandy Tower, {{interrupted}} transmission of TV- and radio in {{a large part of}} the Netherlands. There is no indication that these fires are related.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fire</b> {{reported}} at the reception area of Tamweel Tower in the U cluster. The only reported injury was an infant who {{was taken to the}} hospital to be treated for minor smoke inhalation.|$|R
25|$|On {{the morning}} of Tuesday, April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold placed <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> bomb in a field about three miles south of Columbine High School, and two {{miles south of the}} fire station. Set to explode at 11:14a.m., the bomb was {{intended}} as a diversion to draw firefighters and emergency personnel away from the school (it partially detonated and caused <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire,</b> which was quickly extinguished by the fire department).|$|E
25|$|On 24 November 2009 <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> in {{the boiler}} annexe of Unit B22 caused the second reactor {{also to be}} shut down. Subsequently Unit B22 has been {{intermittently}} shut down for up to several months at a time. Unit B21 was restarted in August 2010. Unplanned shutdowns continued into 2011, with B21 down for repairs from November 2011 to March 2012.|$|E
25|$|On March 24, 2017, {{the same}} week the {{building}} officially surpassed {{the height of the}} Four Seasons Hotel Miami, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> broke out on the 68th floor just before 7pm. It was extinguished within hours, with no injuries or delay to the project's timeline. The cause was not immediately known. No work was underway when the fire broke out.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship has}} {{been damaged by}} fire twice in recent years, first on 21 May 2007 while {{undergoing}} conservation. She was restored and was reopened to the public on 25 April 2012. On 19 October 2014 she was damaged in <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|R
50|$|The same {{conditions}} {{contributed to a}} major conflagration nearby in the 1923 Berkeley fire and a more limited conflagration {{in the same area}} on September 22, 1970, again under similar conditions. <b>A</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fire</b> also started in Wildcat Canyon on December 10, 1980.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s, the site, {{now officially}} named Butovo, was ceded to the infamous OGPU. In 1935 it {{was turned into}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>firing</b> range for the NKVD. The {{remaining}} grounds of the former farm were occupied by a sovkhoz, Kommunarka, and the dacha of Genrikh Yagoda.|$|R
25|$|The East Stand {{replaced}} the Old East Stand in 1983, being {{financed by the}} sale of ten year tickets. In October 2005, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> in the north terrace put the terrace out of commission for all of Ireland's Autumn internationals. This meant that people who had travelled {{from as far away}} as Australia and New Zealand could not attend the match. The terrace reopened for the first game of the 2006 Six Nations Championship.|$|E
25|$|A {{resident}} {{from the}} fourth-floor told {{the media that}} the initial source of combustion was a neighbour's fridge which had caught fire at 00:50 BST. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> {{could be seen in}} his kitchen through his opened door. They immediately began knocking on doors to alert people. Within 30 minutes the fire was out of control. Flames rapidly spread via the outside of the building to cover an area from the second floor to the top.|$|E
25|$|Climatic factors {{contribute}} to Australia's high incidence of bushfires, particularly during the summer months. Low relative humidity, wind and lack of rain can cause <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire,</b> either man-made or caused naturally by lightning strikes, to spread rapidly over large distances. Low humidity, {{the heat of the}} sun and lack of water cause vegetation to dry out becoming a perfect fuel for the fire. High winds fan the flames, increasing their intensity and the speed and distance at which they can travel.|$|E

50|$|Parnitha {{suffered}} {{extensive damage}} from a wildfire on Thursday, June 28, 2007 around {{the morning and}} noon hours, continuing for several days and burning approximately 56 km² of land; {{one of the worst}} recorded wildfires in the prefecture after that of Penteli. The magnitude of the devastation was unforeseen. <b>A</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fire</b> had, however, taken place in the 1960s.|$|R
25|$|The refit {{was planned}} to last from 1995 to 1996, {{but did not}} {{conclude}} until late 1999, after extensive corrosion was discovered in both ships. The refit cost for the two ships increased A$400 million, {{with half of the}} funding taken from repair and refit allocations for other ships. During Kanimblas conversion, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> started aboard, when a cigarette butt was dropped on piping insulation. The fire, which occurred on 8 February 1999, was extinguished quickly, and only caused superficial damage.|$|E
25|$|The island's {{resources}} for handling emergencies {{have recently been}} supplemented with a multi-purpose emergency vehicle {{which can be used}} as a police car, an ambulance and also a water trailer for a fire engine. The island has a regular firefighting unit, a duty which used to be performed by the monks. The last reported major fire on the island was in 1940 when the monastery was damaged. In December 2012, six firefighters had to be brought by boat from Tenby to douse <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
25|$|Steam locomotives, by comparison, require {{intensive}} maintenance, lubrication, {{and cleaning}} before, during, and after use. Preparing and firing a steam locomotive for use from cold {{can take many}} hours, {{although it may be}} kept in readiness between uses with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> to maintain a slight heat in the boiler, but this requires regular stoking and frequent attention to maintain the level of water in the boiler. This may be necessary to prevent the water in the boiler freezing in cold climates, so long as the water supply itself is not frozen.|$|E

2500|$|In Redesdale, {{southeast}} of Bendigo, a fire starting [...] {{west of the}} town burnt [...] and destroyed twelve houses and various outbuildings. The fire threatened the towns of Baynton and Glenhope. Glenhope was threatened again on 9February from <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fire</b> that {{broke away from the}} main front, resulting in extra fire crews being brought in from Bendigo and Kyneton. The fire was contained by 10 February.|$|R
5000|$|All Class C {{locomotives}} were 38' 11"-long 4-6-4T side tank engines {{with two}} cylinders measuring 14½" [...] by 22". Differences may be noted with the 1929 Class C and the 1939—1941; among others, the 1929 series was lighter (73 tons {{compared to the}} later series' 74.1 tones) but featured <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fire</b> grate (at 23.6 sq ft compared to the later series' 28 sq ft).|$|R
25|$|In 2004, a V {{block was}} created. It {{is thought that}} this refers {{to the concept of}} the block being a 'village' community. The V block was built to house the English department, whilst we awaited the new build block. There was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> in one of the old D block demountables, but the fire itself did not {{contribute}} to the installation of V block. However, 2 of the 5 buildings still remain which were not touched by the fire. V block housed the school's English department. But is now used as a cafeteria.|$|E
25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen. Rain will douse a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect. Metal fire rings generally {{do a good job of}} keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire.</b> To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.|$|E
25|$|For acts {{during the}} uprising, Lipski was {{decorated}} with the Cross of Valour (Krzyż Walecznych) ("for lifetime achievement, for the brave stance in the street fighting of 25 September, for persevering in a shed {{at the police station}} giving <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fire</b> under a strong defence, where he was wounded, and for active participation in patrols"), posthumously awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (by Polish President Lech Walesa on 13 September 1991) and with the highest Polish decoration, the Order of the White Eagle (by President Lech Kaczynski, 23 September 2006).|$|E
50|$|With Napoleon’s {{downfall}} and the Congress of Vienna, Rohrbach and {{the surrounding}} area became part of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld as the Principality of Lichtenberg. This arrangement lasted until 1834 when, by treaty, the Principality was incorporated into the Prussian state as the Sankt Wendel district. Twelve years later, Rohrbach burnt to ashes in a fire of unknown origin. <b>A</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fire</b> in 1891 claimed two houses.|$|R
50|$|The {{intentional}} ignition {{of fires}} {{is a common}} firefighting tactic. A burnout (also called a firing operation, or <b>firing</b> out) is <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>fire</b> ignited along <b>a</b> control line ahead of the main fire. The intent is to consume fuel ahead of the main fire, strengthening the control line. A backfire is a more aggressive type of burning done to influence {{the behavior of the}} main fire.|$|R
