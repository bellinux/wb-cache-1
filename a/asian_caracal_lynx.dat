50|$|In 1987, the zoo {{opened the}} Maya Temple exhibit and Wolf Woods exhibit. In 1988, the zoo {{completed}} new reptile exhibits in the Australasia Pavilion and the Primate Wing in the Americas Pavilion. <b>Caracal</b> <b>lynx</b> exhibit opened in 1989, {{the year after}} the spotted-neck otter exhibit opened.|$|R
40|$|Three <b>caracal</b> (<b>lynx)</b> Fells <b>caracal</b> kittens, two {{females and}} a male were {{received}} from the Fish River area some 50 km north of Cradock, Republic of South Africa, on the 20 th March 1980. These were found {{at the base of}} a dense Rhus erosa bush on the side of a hill and estimated at 14 days old based on the findings of Cade (1968 Int. Zoo Yb. 45) and Kralik (1967 Int. Zoo Yb. 132) ...|$|R
50|$|Carnivorous mammals in Jordan {{include the}} striped hyena, <b>caracal,</b> <b>lynx,</b> jungle cat, sand cat, wildcat, Arabian wolf, golden jackal, fennec fox, Arabian red fox, Blanford's fox, Rüppell's fox, Egyptian mongoose, least weasel, European badger, honey badger and European otter. There are about twenty species of bat {{and a similar}} number of rodents {{including}} the Caucasian squirrel, Asian garden dormouse, Euphrates jerboa, Middle East blind mole-rat, and various voles, jirds, mice, rats, spiny mice, gerbils and hamsters. Other mammals found in suitable habitat are the wild boar, European hare, mountain hare, Indian crested porcupine, rock hyrax, European hedgehog, long-eared hedgehog and desert hedgehog.|$|R
40|$|Sheep {{farmers in}} the Cape Midlands region of South Africa {{frequently}} sustain stock losses through predation by <b>caracal</b> <b>lynx.</b> Further losses are incurred when hyrax compete with sheep for available pasture. Hyrax constitute the natural prey for lynx {{with the result that}} culling either hyrax or lynx has complicated feedback effects. In order to investigate the spill-over problems from the natural predator-prey system on farming revenue, a differential equations model was previously formulated, comprising the sectors Hyrax, Lynx, Sheep, Pasture and Revenue and an optimisation procedure was used to determine the optimal culling rate policy for farmers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the numerical, behavioural and policy sensitivity of this model to parameter uncertainty...|$|R
2500|$|The word [...] "kitten" [...] {{derives from}} the Middle English word kitoun, which in turn came from the Old French chitoun or cheton. Juvenile big cats are called [...] "cubs" [...] rather than kittens; either term {{may be used for}} the young of smaller wild felids, such as ocelots, <b>caracals</b> and <b>lynx,</b> but [...] "kitten" [...] is usually more common for these species.|$|R
50|$|Wadi Wurayah {{is home to}} {{more than}} 100 species of mammals, birds, {{reptiles}} and amphibians as well as more than 300 species of plants. Famous for its scenic waterfall set amid the Hajar Mountains, Wadi Wurayah is recommended as a must-see in UAE off-road and tourist guides. It is a spectacular location with streams and pools dotted around the rocky outcrops. It is one of few remaining places in the world where the endangered Arabian tahr still roams free. Conservationists believe it to be among the last places in the UAE where the Arabian leopard, which has not been seen in the UAE since 1995, still survives. The same is true for the <b>caracal</b> <b>lynx,</b> a small, shy predator, which like the leopard is persecuted by farmers who believe it targets chickens and goats. The wadi is also home to the Garra barreimiae, a type of freshwater fish that lives only in the Hajar Mountains. Among the 208 species of plants is a species of wild orchid unique to the UAE, the Epipactis veratrifolia.|$|R
50|$|Some mammals {{native to}} the region are Sus scrofa, Vulpes vulpes, Hystrix cristata, Canis aureus, Canis lupus, Martes martes, Lynx lynx, Felis sylvestris, Ursus arctos, Meles meles, Lepus, Erinaceus europaeus and Sciurus. Migrants are <b>Lynx</b> <b>caracal</b> and Panthera pardus.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, {{police in}} Fintona, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland shot a cat. It was {{reportedly}} a caracal, a medium-sized wildcat species found in Africa and Asia, although {{a police report}} {{described it as a}} <b>lynx.</b> (<b>Caracals</b> are sometimes called desert lynxes, but are not true members of the Lynx genus.) ...|$|R
25|$|Burkina Faso has {{a larger}} number of {{elephants}} than many countries in West Africa. Lions, leopards and buffalo can also be found here, including the dwarf or red buffalo, a smaller reddish-brown animal which looks like a fierce kind of short-legged cow. Other large predators live in Burkina Faso, such as the cheetah, the <b>caracal</b> or African <b>lynx,</b> the spotted hyena and the African wild dog, one of the continent’s most endangered species.|$|R
50|$|The Canada lynx {{differs from}} the bobcat in having longer ear tufts, a greyer and less red coat, less {{distinct}} spotting on the coat, a slightly shorter tail completely black on the tip rather than only on the upper side, and larger paws. The bobcat is generally smaller than the Canada lynx, but may still be confused in areas where their ranges overlap, because bobcats tend to be larger in such areas. The <b>caracal</b> resembles the <b>lynxes</b> in having similar tufts on the ears.|$|R
5|$|In Eurasia, red foxes may be preyed upon by leopards, <b>caracals</b> and Eurasian <b>lynxes.</b> The lynxes chase red foxes {{into deep}} snow, where their longer legs and larger paws {{give them an}} {{advantage}} over foxes, especially when {{the depth of the}} snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red foxes are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red foxes than wolves do. North American felid predators of red foxes include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young foxes, while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} and evaluate a potential ecological network including core areas and large-scale corridors in the ¿zmir Province and its surrounding areas, Turkey. It {{is one of the}} first studies on the connectivity for mammal species and the detection of potential ecological corridors for Turkey. Four wide-ranging species (Hyaena hyaena, <b>Lynx</b> <b>lynx,</b> <b>Caracal</b> caracal, and Felis chaus) have been chosen as target species. Existing Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and surrounding lands have been evaluated based on a three criteria: (1) vegetation/habitat types, (2) carrying capacity and (3) road density using simple GIS-based models. The results are evaluated using the Minimum Viable Metapopulation (MVMP) standards. No KBA in the study region has a Key Population (KP) or Minimum Viable Population (MVP) with the exception of Boz Da¿lar. Least cost-path analysis has been applied {{to identify}} linkages between KBAs relevant for the four target species. The conclusion is that it is possible to maintain MVPs in the region when the KBAs are linked by ecological corridor...|$|R
40|$|In 1979 and 1980 predators {{were under}} control on sheep {{farms in the}} Ceres Karoo. At the time, a subsidised hunting club {{assisted}} landowners with predator control measures. A farmlevel analysis of data from the Ceres hunting club’s logbooks reveals that {{four out of five}} farms have experienced no predator damage whatsoever. For those reporting problems, the typical loss was in the region of one per cent of the estimated turnover. <b>Lynx</b> (<b>caracal),</b> leopards and feral dogs were responsible for most of the damage. Black-backed jackals were not a serious concern, but were also more difficult to catch. Lynx and feral dogs were controlled with ease. Death of some innocent animals was also recorded. The hunting club system thus appears to be succeeding in controlling certain predators, albeit with adverse consequences to other animals. Exploratory statistical analysis establishes that livestock losses lead to increased control efforts, which in turn leads to the death of more targeted and untargeted animals. There is even some evidence that more control efforts reduce stock losses in the following year...|$|R
