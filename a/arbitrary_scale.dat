25|$|For axiomatic {{treatment}} of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, {{it has become}} customary {{to refer to a}} zeroth law of thermodynamics. The customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, should be said to have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold. While the zeroth law permits the definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature, the second law of thermodynamics selects the definition of a single preferred, absolute temperature, unique up to an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>scale</b> factor, whence called the thermodynamic temperature. If internal energy is considered {{as a function of the}} volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium, thermodynamic absolute temperature appears as the partial derivative of internal energy with respect the entropy at constant volume. Its natural, intrinsic origin or null point is absolute zero at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest absolute temperature described by the model, the third law of thermodynamics postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The JPEG 2000 {{standard}} defines {{two methods}} for {{region of interest}} (ROI) coding, the maximum shift and the general scaling. In the maximum shift method, an ROI can have any shape that {{does not need to}} be transmitted to the decoder, but does not have the flexibility to select an <b>arbitrary</b> <b>scaling</b> value to compromise the ROI quality compared with the background. The general scaling based method supports any scaling value providing the user/application with the ability to control ROI and background qualities, but it limits the choice of the ROI shape and needs ROI shape coding. In this paper, we propose a novel ROI coding method named Bitplane Overlap Shift (BOShift). The proposed BOShift is compatible with the JPEG 2000 standard and it supports both <b>arbitrary</b> <b>scaling</b> values and <b>arbitrary</b> ROI shapes, without shape coding.

Ordinal regression turns up often in the social sciences, for example in the modeling of human levels of preference (on a scale from, say, 1-5 for [...] "very poor" [...] through [...] "excellent"), as well as in information retrieval.
