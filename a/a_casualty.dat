5|$|Immediately {{following}} their {{declaration of war}} on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the British War Cabinet began to consider the future of Palestine. By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of Britain's Allies and Associated Powers not fully engaged: the United States had yet to suffer <b>a</b> <b>casualty,</b> and the Russians were distracted by internal upheaval. A stalemate in southern Palestine was broken by the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October 1917.|$|E

This represented a total casualty rate of 64.8 percent, which was among the highest of any belligerent for the war. About another 4,000 men were captured. The majority of casualties occurred among the infantry (which sustained <b>a</b> <b>casualty</b> rate of 79 percent); however, the artillery (58 percent) and light horse (32 percent) also incurred significant losses.|$|E
5|$|By about noon, the Confederates {{had formed}} an attack line {{and were in}} {{position}} to advance on the works. Because of the forest {{on the west side}} of the Mauckport Road, a company of men dismounted and attacked the works head on. They were repulsed three times, but the Legion suffered <b>a</b> <b>casualty</b> during the second wave. Simultaneously, the Confederates launched a flanking maneuver on the eastern wing of the defensive works. The initial flanking attempt was prevented because of the superior weapons held by the thirty Legion soldiers on that wing. They were equipped with Henry rifles capable of firing fourteen rounds before reloading, and were able to keep the Confederates pinned down in the open field for about twenty minutes.|$|E
5|$|Later {{combined}} into the Australian Corps in 1917, the AIF divisions in France and Belgium were {{often used to}} spearhead operations, playing {{a significant role in}} the defeat of the German Army in 1918. By the end of the war the AIF had gained a reputation as a highly effective military force. Following the armistice on 11 November 1918, a process of demobilisation began, with the last Australian personnel being repatriated in late 1919. In all, 416,809 Australians enlisted during the war and 334,000 served overseas. The AIF sustained approximately 210,000 casualties, of which 61,519 were killed or died of wounds, <b>a</b> <b>casualty</b> rate among the highest of any belligerent for the war.|$|E

Corey attended to the wounded while exposed to fire, and continued to direct other bearer parties throughout the action until wounded himself, receiving wounds in the right groin and thigh. It was during this engagement that he was awarded a third bar to his Military Medal. Evacuated to <b>a</b> <b>casualty</b> station, Corey was operated on before receiving a transfer to a general hospital at Le Havre. Operated on again, he was sent to a hospital in Bristol, England. Repatriated to Australia on 30 April 1919, he was medically discharged in June.|$|E
5|$|Promoted {{to major}} on 8 June, Morshead {{distinguished}} {{himself in the}} Battle of Lone Pine on 6 August. So intense was the fighting that of the 22 officers in the battalion, Morshead {{was the only one}} who did not become <b>a</b> <b>casualty.</b> However, on 16 September, like many others, he succumbed to dysentery and paratyphoid fever. He was evacuated to the 3rd General Hospital on Lemnos, and then to England on the hospital ship Aquitania, where he was admitted to the 3rd London General Hospital in Wandsworth, England. For his services in the Gallipoli campaign, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Light Horse Brigade {{casualties}} were one other rank killed, one officer and nine other ranks wounded.

5|$|Another bout advertised for {{the event}} was Angle versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match. At Bound for Glory IV, Angle lost to TNA founder and {{on-screen}} co-owner Jeff Jarrett with Foley as Special Guest Enforcer. On the Impact! after Bound for Glory IV, Angle challenged Jarrett to another match at Turning Point, however, Jarrett refused. Angered by Jarrett's refusal, Angle began assaulting several wrestlers in TNA to persuade Jarrett into accepting the challenge. On the October 23 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett again to a rematch, which Jarrett again refused. Jarrett, however, recommended Abyss as Angle's opponent, who was <b>a</b> <b>casualty</b> of Angle's attacks the previous week. On the October 30 episode of Impact!, Angle fought Abyss in a contest which ended in a disqualification after Angle struck Abyss with a steel chair. Following their encounter, a match was promoted pitting Angle against Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Turning Point.|$|E
5|$|Another {{encounter}} {{connected to}} the narrative that was advertised for Turning Point was Kurt Angle versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match. After Angle lost to Jeff Jarrett at Bound for Glory IV, Angle challenged Jarrett to a rematch, which was refused on the October16 episode of Impact!. To get Jarrett to accept his challenge, Angle assaulted several wrestlers in TNA. On the October23 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a rematch for the second time. Jarrett refused the offer for a second time, but recommended <b>a</b> <b>casualty</b> of Angle's attacks, Abyss, as Angle's opponent. On the October30 episode of Impact!, a contest between Angle and Abyss ended in a disqualification after Angle struck Abyss with a steel chair. Following their encounter, a match was promoted pitting Angle against Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Turning Point. Angle won the bout at the show.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating <b>a</b> <b>casualty.</b> The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Woodruff joined the Australian Army Medical Corps. He stayed in Melbourne until he finished his Master of Surgery Degree in 1941. At that time, {{he was assigned to}} the Tenth Australian Army General Hospital in Malaya as a captain in the Medical Corps. According to Woodruff, his time in Malaya was quiet and relatively leisurely as the war in the Pacific was yet to begin in earnest. However, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor changed the situation and he was posted to <b>a</b> <b>casualty</b> clearing station where he worked as an anaesthetist, before being transferred into the Singapore General Hospital. A Japanese offensive resulted in the fall of Singapore and Woodruff was taken prisoner along with thousands of other Australian and British personnel.|$|E
5|$|Before the battle, both armies {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by smaller units; {{by the time}} of the battle, the Allied forces had about 60,000 men, with another 5,000 holding Frankfurt, and the Prussians had almost 50,000. The Russians and Austrians lost about 15,000 men (approx. 5,000 killed), although some sources suggest a slightly higher number, perhaps 15,600 or 15,700, about 26 percent. Christopher Duffy places Russian losses at 13,477; in addition, the Russians had lost about 4,000 at the Battle of Kay a week earlier. Sources differ on Prussian losses. Duffy maintains 6,000 killed and 13,000 wounded, <b>a</b> <b>casualty</b> rate of more than 37 percent. Gaston Bodart represents losses at 39 percent, and that two thirds (12,000) of the 19,000 casualties were deaths. Frank Szabo places Prussian losses at 21,000.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war the AIF {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} as a well-trained and highly effective military force, enduring more than two years of costly fighting on the Western Front before playing a significant role in the final Allied victory in 1918, albeit as a smaller part of the wider British Empire war effort. Like the other Dominion divisions from Canada and New Zealand, the Australians were viewed as being among the best of the British forces in France, and were often used to spearhead operations. 63 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross. This reputation came at a heavy cost, with the AIF sustaining approximately 210,000 casualties, of which 61,519 were killed or died of wounds. This represented a total casualty rate of 64.8 percent, which was among the highest of any belligerent for the war. About another 4,000 men were captured.
