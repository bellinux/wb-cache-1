5|$|Hunting large whales {{usually takes}} several hours. Killer whales {{generally}} choose to attack young or weak animals; however, {{a group of}} five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales. <b>Adult</b> <b>bull</b> sperm whales, which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability to}} be able to survive in both fresh and salt water also gives another benefit that has been driven by evolution. Because the {{majority}} of sharks are only able to survive in salt water, the bull shark has evolved to have their offspring in the fresh water where other sharks cannot enter. The freshwater acts as a protective area where the young are able to grow and mature without the threat of larger sharks preying on the younger bull sharks. This is an explanation for the behavior that is observed from the Bull sharks as to why there would be any reason for the <b>adult</b> <b>bull</b> shark to ever travel into a freshwater area despite being able to tolerate the high salinity of marine water.|$|E
25|$|In a {{research}} experiment, the bull sharks {{were found to}} be at the mouth of an estuary {{for the majority of the}} time. They stayed at the mouth of the river independent of the salinity of the water. The driving factor for a bull shark to be in fresh or salt water, however, is its age; as the bull shark ages, its tolerance for very low or high salinity increases. The majority of the newborn or very young bull sharks were found in the freshwater area, whereas the much older bull sharks {{were found to be}} in the saltwater areas, as they had developed a much better tolerance for the salinity. Reproduction is one of the reasons why <b>adult</b> <b>bull</b> sharks travel into the river—it is thought to be a physiological strategy to improve juvenile survival and a way to increase overall fitness of bull sharks. The young are not born with a high tolerance for high salinity, so they are born in fresh water and stay there until they are able to travel out.|$|E
40|$|In many mammal species, {{androgen}} {{levels in}} males are elevated {{during periods of}} mating activity, often to facilitate aggressive behavior between males over access to fertile females. However, this pattern might be less obvious in species with a rather low male-male aggression rate, or in {{those that are not}} strictly seasonal breeders. A complex social structure, as well as additional social and environmental factors, might add more to the complexity. Here, we applied a non-invasive method to monitor fecal androgen metabolite (fAM) levels in free-ranging giraffe bulls over a period of months to examine longitudinal patterns of androgen metabolite concentrations in relation to observed male sexual behavior in different age classes. Giraffes are non-seasonal breeders, living in a fission-fusion social system and males show a roaming strategy to search for fertile females. Our results show that season has an impact on fAM levels in free-ranging giraffes, with respective steroid concentrations being higher in summer. In the presence of females, fAM levels of bulls are significantly higher compared to when found in all-male groups, with old <b>adult</b> <b>bulls</b> showing the highest fAM levels. In contrast, young <b>adult</b> <b>bulls</b> have overall slightly higher fAM levels compared to old <b>adult</b> <b>bulls</b> when residing in all male groups. Sexual behavior increases fAM levels only in old <b>adult</b> <b>bulls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Present study {{analyzed}} {{the changes in}} peripheral blood testosterone concentrations and testicular cytogram in relation to age and semen quality in crossbred males. Three different age groups of crossbred males viz. bull calves (6 months, n = 5), young bulls (15 months, n = 5) and <b>adult</b> <b>bulls</b> (4 to 6 years, n = 8) were utilized for the study. Testicular fine needle aspiration cytology technique was used to quantify testicular cytology and their indices. Peripheral blood testosterone concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Semen samples collected from <b>adult</b> <b>bulls</b> were microscopically evaluated for quality parameters. Mean peripheral blood testosterone concentrations in bull calves, young <b>bulls</b> and <b>adult</b> <b>bulls</b> were 2. 28 ± 0. 09 ng/mL, 1. 42 ± 0. 22 ng/mL and 5. 66 ± 1. 08 ng/mL respectively, and that in <b>adult</b> <b>bulls</b> were significantly different (p< 0. 01) from young bulls and bull calves. There {{was no significant difference}} between the proportion of different testicular cells in bull calves and young bulls. Between young and <b>adult</b> <b>bulls,</b> significant differences (p< 0. 01) were observed in the proportion of spermatocytes, spermatozoa, and sperm: Sertoli cell ratio. The proportions of Sertoli cells showed a significant difference (p< 0. 01) between the three age groups. The number of primary spermatocytes had a positive correlation with peripheral blood testosterone concentrations in bull calves (r = 0. 719, p< 0. 01). Number of Sertoli cells per 100 germ cells was negatively correlated with blood testosterone concentration in young bulls (r = − 0. 713, p< 0. 01). Among different semen parameters in <b>adult</b> <b>bulls,</b> ejaculate volume (r = 0. 790, p< 0. 05) had positive relationship, and sperm motility had significant negative correlation (r = − 0. 711, p< 0. 05) with testosterone concentrations. The number of Sertoli cells and Sertoli cell index had a positive correlation with various semen quality parameters (p< 0. 001). Results of the present study conclude that number of Sertoli cells and Sertoli cell index are good indicators of semen quality, but peripheral blood testosterone concentrations may not have a direct relationship with various seminal attributes in crossbred bulls...|$|R
