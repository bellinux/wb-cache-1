5|$|Tesla's legacy {{has endured}} in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics, and video games. The {{impact of the}} {{technologies}} invented or envisioned by Tesla is <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in several types of science fiction.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Sue Ellen's {{alcoholism}} returns, and her {{struggles with}} it become <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> {{in the third}} season, putting a strain on {{her relationship with her}} son. Eventually she learns the truth about the circumstances surrounding J.R's death, and is angered at both Bobby and Bum that she had been kept in the dark about his illness and his final plan, although she makes amends.|$|E

5|$|A passionate {{advocate}} of evolutionary theory, Gould wrote prolifically on the subject, {{trying to communicate}} his understanding of contemporary evolutionary biology to a wide audience. <b>A</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in his writings is the history and development of pre-evolutionary and evolutionary thought. He was also an enthusiastic baseball fan and sabermetrician (analyst of baseball statistics), and made frequent reference to the sport in his essays. Many of his baseball essays were anthologized in his posthumously published book Triumph and Tragedy in Mudville (2003).|$|E
5|$|Dave Lister, {{played by}} Craig Charles, is a genial Liverpudlian and {{self-described}} bum. He was the lowest-ranking of the 169 crew {{members on the}} ship before the accident. He has a long-standing desire to return to Earth and start a farm and/or diner on Fiji (which is under three feet of water following a volcanic eruption), but is left impossibly far away by the accident, which renders him the last (known) surviving member of the human race. He likes Indian food, especially chicken vindaloo, which is <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in the series.|$|E
5|$|Heroes and {{religious}} masters with above normal height are <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in Chinese folklore. For instance, his student Wu Song {{is said to}} be over nine feet tall in the same folktale. In The Story of Yue Fei, the General simultaneously duels with two other warriors vying for first place in a military exam; one is nine feet tall and the other is eight feet tall. A Hagiography of the Taoist saint Zhang Daoling states he was over seven feet tall.|$|E
5000|$|The orchestra's {{first decade}} of albums {{included}} only entirely original compositions {{in the style of}} the baroque rondò, [...] "a musical composition built on the alternation of <b>a</b> principal <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> and contrasting episodes".|$|R

5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings {{on the walls}} of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner and Dutch Golden Age painting. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including The Great Wave off Kanagawa. The sea has appeared in literature since Homer's Odyssey (8th century BC). The sea is <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in the Haiku poems of the Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉) (1644–1694).|$|E
5|$|In 1970 Zappa met {{conductor}} Zubin Mehta. They {{arranged a}} May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, {{the music was}} mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie 200 Motels. Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one. His dissatisfaction became <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> throughout his career; he often felt {{that the quality of}} performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate with the money he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.|$|E
5|$|The Platonic solids {{and other}} polyhedra are <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic {{featuring}} the small stellated dodecahedron, attributed to Paolo Uccello, {{in the floor}} of the San Marco Basilica in Venice; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for Luca Pacioli's 1509 book The Divine Proportion; as a glass rhombicuboctahedron in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in Albrecht Dürer's engraving Melencolia I; and in Salvador Dalí's painting The Last Supper in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> major <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> of {{his novels}} is the {{conflict}} of a rich heir with his brother, cousin or rival long cheated out of his lawful rights (Huszt of Huszt 1906, The Two Lives of Magdalena 1917, Northern Lights 1930).|$|R

It depicts a child being taught about the [...] "lost" [...] {{province}} of Alsace-Lorraine {{in the aftermath}} of the Franco-Prussian War. This loss is <b>a</b> frequently <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in his work.|$|R
5000|$|A {{trademark}} {{identified with}} Montblanc {{is the white}} stylized six-pointed star with rounded edges, representative of the Mont Blanc snowcap from above, the symbol being adopted in 1913. The number [...] "4810," [...] the mountain's height in meters, is also <b>a</b> commonly <b>recurring</b> <b>theme.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{situation}} of the Banat-Swabians, the German-speaking minority in Romania, is <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in Müller's writing. Historically, Germans were recruited by the Austria-Hungary to repopulate southern areas following the expulsion of the Turks of the Ottoman Empire. They were given special privileges, allowed to keep their language and Roman Catholicism, even in areas in which the Orthodox Church was paramount. Their communities spoke German into the 20th century. They were among ethnic Germans, or Volksdeutsche, whom Adolph Hitler proposed to unite in a greater Germany. Millions of ethnic Germans were expelled from eastern Europe after the war; thousands were forced into labor camps. Even years later, they were often discriminated against in Romania under the communist government.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{nationalism}} and secularism {{were two of}} the six founding principles of the Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the leader of {{the early decades of the}} Republic, aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify geographical names were <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme.</b> Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of Rize until 1921) were prohibited (as was the case with Der Grosse Weltatlas, a map published in Leipzig).|$|E
5|$|As in {{plot and}} setting, Tolkien brings his {{literary}} theories {{to bear in}} forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modern anachronism exploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example, Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is {{the form of the}} riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading {{to an understanding of the}} deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in The Hobbit.|$|E
5|$|Through Swayamvaram, Gopalakrishnan {{became the}} first Indian {{director}} to use sound as <b>a</b> leitmotif (<b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> musical <b>theme).</b> The film provided a new experience to Indian cinema-goers, as it used ample amounts of natural sounds with a minimalistic background score.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{the song}} [...] "A Little Bit of Heaven" [...] only reached number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100, {{it was used}} as <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> love <b>theme</b> for Eden Capwell and Cruz Castillo on the {{television}} soap opera Santa Barbara.|$|R
25|$|Each of the {{principals}} – the Doge, Jacopo and Lucrezia – is given a distinctive orchestral theme, which accompanies them at each of their most important appearances on stage. <b>A</b> fourth <b>recurring</b> <b>theme,</b> this time vocal in origin ("Silenzio, mistero") {{is associated with the}} Council of Ten.|$|R
5|$|Each episode {{typically}} follows Bauer, {{officials in}} the U.S. government, and the conspirators behind {{the events of the}} day, often simultaneously. 24 is known for employing plot twists which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal drama, delving into the private lives of the characters. As part of <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme,</b> characters are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas. Examples of this are a bombing in Season 2, which can only be prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in Season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Season 4 is also notable for a scene in which two men — one of whom possesses crucial information — are dying in a room with only one surgeon.|$|E
5|$|Reckoning is {{the second}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band R.E.M., released on April 9, 1984 by I.R.S. Records. Produced by Mitch Easter and Don Dixon, the album was recorded at Reflection Sound Studio in Charlotte, North Carolina, over 16 days in December 1983 and January 1984. Dixon and Easter intended to capture the sound of R.E.M.'s live performances, and used binaural recording on several tracks. Singer Michael Stipe dealt with darker subject matter in his lyrics, and water imagery is <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> on the record. Released to critical acclaim, Reckoning reached number 27 in the United States—where it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1991—and peaked at number 91 in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Stories in {{the series}} {{frequently}} emphasize the internal struggles, passions, and tragedies of the characters, and the main plot often recedes into the background as the focus shifts to their personal lives. Games also explore relationships between characters, ranging from love to rivalry. Other recurring situations that drive the plot include amnesia, a hero corrupted by an evil force, mistaken identity, and self-sacrifice. Magical orbs and crystals are recurring in-game items that are frequently connected to the themes of the games' plots. Crystals often {{play a central role}} in the creation of the world, and a majority of the Final Fantasy games link crystals and orbs to the planet's life force. As such, control over these crystals drives the main conflict. The classical elements are also <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> {{in the series}} related to the heroes, villains, and items. Other common plot and setting themes include the Gaia hypothesis, an apocalypse, and conflicts between advanced technology and nature.|$|E
5000|$|The broader concept {{on which}} the film is founded, that of clothes on revolt, had {{previously}} appeared in Méliès's film The Bewitched Inn. The film historian Paolo Cherchi Usai notes that the film evokes {{the concept of a}} split personality, <b>a</b> constantly <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in Méliès's work: ...|$|R
5000|$|During his {{nearly three}} decades on television, Taylor {{was known for his}} canned {{delivery}} of the nightly sports highlights, which consisted largely of <b>a</b> set of <b>recurring</b> <b>themes</b> including: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} part of the “Known Space” series, where the {{political}} and cultural differences between Earth humans and those of the asteroid belt are <b>an</b> important <b>recurring</b> <b>theme.</b> It is {{one of a group of}} Known Space stories in which Niven speculates on the effect on human culture of simple universal organ transplants: ...|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> {{in these}} myths is {{the effort of}} the gods to {{maintain}} maat {{against the forces of}} disorder. They fight vicious battles with the forces of chaos at the start of creation. Ra and Apep, battling each other each night, continue this struggle into the present. Another prominent theme is the gods' death and revival. The clearest instance where a god dies is the myth of Osiris' murder, in which that god is resurrected as ruler of the Duat. The sun god is also said to grow old during his daily journey across the sky, sink into the Duat at night, and emerge as a young child at dawn. In the process he comes into contact with the rejuvenating water of Nun, the primordial chaos. Funerary texts that depict Ra's journey through the Duat also show the corpses of gods who are enlivened along with him. Instead of being changelessly immortal, the gods periodically died and were reborn by repeating the events of creation, thus renewing the whole world. But it was always possible for this cycle to be disrupted and for chaos to return. Some poorly understood Egyptian texts even suggest that this calamity is destined to happen—that the creator god will one day dissolve the order of the world, leaving only himself and Osiris amid the primordial chaos.|$|E
5|$|The third novel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, follows Harry in {{his third}} year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort in any form. Instead, Harry must deal with the {{knowledge}} that he has been targeted by Sirius Black, his father's best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the murder of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the dementors – dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul and feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to Remus Lupin, a Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who is eventually revealed to be a werewolf. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry comes to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, Peter Pettigrew, who had been hiding as Ron's pet rat, Scabbers. In this book, <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> throughout the series is emphasised – in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.|$|E
25|$|Bandinelli's lifelong {{obsession}} with Michelangelo is <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> <b>theme</b> in assessments of his career.|$|E
50|$|Like the Symphony No. 4, the Fifth is a {{cyclical}} symphony, with <b>a</b> <b>recurring</b> main <b>theme.</b> Unlike the Fourth, however, {{the theme is}} heard in all four movements, a feature Tchaikovsky had first used in the Manfred Symphony, which was completed {{less than three years}} before the Fifth.|$|R
5000|$|... "(She Was A) Hotel Detective" [...] is a {{song and}} single by {{alternative}} rock band They Might Be Giants. It was released as a single {{two years after the}} release of They Might Be Giants, the album on which it originally appeared.
