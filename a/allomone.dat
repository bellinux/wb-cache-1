5000|$|The <b>allomone</b> {{produced}} by an orchid is specific to its pollinator, {{of which it}} usually only has one (Ayasse et al. 2007; Gogler et al. 2009, Schluter et al. 2009) [...] The <b>allomone</b> {{is a mixture of}} alkenes and alkanes (Schiestl and Cozzolino 2008). There are one or more active species in this mixture that account for the attraction of pollinators (Vereeken and Schiestl 2008). Pollinators and orchids use the same chemical compounds in the same absolute amounts in their pheromones and allomones, respectively (Schiestl 2008).|$|E

50|$|Many insects, {{including}} parasitic insects, use semiochemicals, {{which are}} natural chemicals released by an organism {{that affect the}} behaviors of other individuals. Pheromones are intraspecific signals that aid in finding mates, food and habitat resources, warning of enemies, and avoiding competition. Interspecific signals known as <b>allomones</b> and kairomones have similar functions.|$|R
5000|$|The larvae of the berothid {{lacewing}} Lomamyia latipennis feed on termites {{which they}} subdue with an aggressive <b>allomone.</b> The first instar approaches a termite and waves {{the tip of}} its abdomen near the termite's head. The termite becomes immobile after 1 to 3 minutes, and completely paralysed very soon after this, although it may live for up to 3 hours. The berothid then feeds on the paralysed prey. The third instar feeds {{in a similar manner}} and may kill up to six termites at a time. Contact between the termite and the berothid is not necessary for subduing, and other insects present are not affected by the <b>allomone.</b>|$|E
50|$|In yellow dog tick lifecycle, it is {{attached}} in to three hosts to complete its life cycle. When the host {{such as a}} dog starts to scratch, female dog tick starts to produce a dog-repelling <b>allomone,</b> which enable tick to survive on the hosts further time.|$|E
50|$|An <b>allomone</b> is any {{chemical}} substance produced and released {{by an individual}} of one species that affects the behaviour {{of a member of}} another species to the benefit of the originator but not the receiver. Production of allomones is a common form of defence, particularly by plant species against insect herbivores.|$|E
50|$|The flowers emit <b>allomones</b> {{that attract}} the bee species Tetralonia cressa and Eucera pulveraceae. Eucera longicornis males have been {{observed}} attempting to copulate with the flowers.It is also believed that male bees would preferentially select orchids with the most bee-like lips and attempt to mate with them, transferring pollen in the process.|$|R
40|$|Many exocrine {{products}} used by ground beetles are pheromones and <b>allomones</b> {{that regulate}} intra- and interspecific interactions {{and contribute to}} their success in terrestrial ecosystems.

50|$|Lomamyia latipennis are {{species of}} insect {{in the family}} Berothidae. The larvae feed on {{termites}} which they subdue with an aggressive <b>allomone.</b> The first instar approaches termites and waves the tip of its abdomen near the termites' head. The termite becomes immobile after 1 to 3 minutes, and completely paralysed very soon after this, although it may live for up to 3 hours. The berothid then feeds on the paralyzed prey. The later instars feed {{in a similar manner}} and are able to paralyze multiple termites at the same time. Contact between the termite and the berothid is not necessary for subduing, and other insects present are not affected by the <b>allomone.</b> Adult berothid lacewings are not predatory and feed on nectar like most lacewings. However, female berothids lay egg clusters on logs, stumps or trees infested with termites. The tiny, newly hatched larvae crawl across the wood seeking cracks and crevices that will lead to the termites within.|$|E
50|$|Many insects have {{developed}} ways {{to defend against}} these plant defenses (in an evolutionary arms race). One method of adapting to allomones {{is to develop a}} positive reaction to them; the <b>allomone</b> then becomes a kairomone. Others alter the allomones to form pheromones or other hormones, and yet others adopt them into their own defensive strategies, for example by regurgitating them when attacked by an insectivorous insect.|$|E
5000|$|... "Allomone was {{proposed}} by Brown and Eisner (Brown, 1968) to denote those substances which convey an advantage upon the emitter. Because Brown and Eisner {{did not specify}} {{whether or not the}} receiver would benefit, the original definition of <b>allomone</b> includes both substances that benefit the receiver and the emitter, and substances that only benefit the emitter. An example of the first relationship would be a mutualistic relationship, and the latter would be a repellent secretion." ...|$|E
40|$|The troglomorphic {{millipede}} Brachydesmus troglobius Daday, 1889 (Polydesmida: Polydesmidae) secretes <b>allomones</b> from glands on both lateral {{surfaces of}} its body segments. The secretion was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis with electron and chemical ionization, and was shown to be composed of a mixture of benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, benzoylnitrile, benzoic acid and mandelonitrile benzoate. Hydrogen cyanide was qualitatively identified by the picric acid test. This is the first identification of these compounds in a cave-dwelling polydesmid...|$|R
50|$|Several Desmodium species contain potent {{secondary}} metabolites. They {{are used}} aggressively in agriculture in push-pull technology. Tick-trefoils produce high amounts of antixenotic <b>allomones</b> - chemicals which repel many insect pests - and allelopathic compounds which kill weeds. For example, D. intortum and D. uncinatum are employed as groundcover in {{maize and sorghum}} fields to repel Chilo partellus, a stem-boring grass moth. They also suppress witchweeds such as Asiatic witchweed (Striga asiatica) and purple witchweed (S. hermonthica).|$|R
25|$|Unlike pheromones, <b>allomones</b> {{harm the}} {{receiver}} at {{the benefit of}} the producer. This grouping encompasses the chemical arsenal that numerous insects employ. Insects with chemical weaponry usually make their presence known through aposematism. Aposematism is utilized by non-palatable species as a warning to predators that they represent a toxic danger. Additionally, these insects tend to be relatively large, long-lived, active, and frequently aggregate. Indeed, longer-lived insects {{are more likely to be}} chemically defended than short lived ones, as longevity increases apparency.|$|R
5000|$|The {{amygdala}} (in olfaction) processes pheromone, <b>allomone,</b> and kairomone (same-species, cross-species, and cross-species {{where the}} emitter is harmed and the sensor is benefited, respectively) signals. Due to cerebrum evolution this processing is secondary and therefore is largely unnoticed in human interactions. Allomones include flower scents, natural herbicides, and natural toxic plant chemicals. The info for these processes {{comes from the}} vomeronasal organ indirectly via the olfactory bulb. The main olfactory bulb's pulses in the amygdala are used to pair odors to names and recognize odor to odor differences.|$|E
50|$|In a {{research}} study, larvae in captivity were offered spiders in the genus Metepeira. They {{made no effort}} to pounce on the spiders, but when one climbed {{on the back of the}} larva, it arched its tail and head, trapping the spider between the tail spine and the mandibles. The larva then devoured the spider, at the same time relaxing its tail. In another study, several spiders were released in the presence of a single larva and they were all later found congregated on its back. The researchers thought it possible that the larva released an <b>allomone</b> which attracted the spiders.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>allomone</b> is any {{chemical}} substance released {{by an individual}} of one species that affects {{the behavior of a}} member of another species to the benefit of the originator but not the receiver.1 Production of allomones is a common form of defense, such as by plant species against insect herbivores or prey species against predators. Sometimes species produce the sex pheromones of the organisms they exploit as prey or pollinators (such as bolas spiders and some orchids). The term [...] "Allomone" [...] was proposed by Brown, Eisner, and Whittaker to denote those substances which confer an advantage upon the emitter.|$|E
50|$|Chemical ecology is {{study of}} {{interactions}} among organisms, and between organisms and their environment, that involve specific molecules {{or groups of}} molecules termed semiochemicals that function as signals to initiate, modulate, or terminate a variety of biological processes. Molecules that serve in such roles typically are readily diffusible organic substances of low molecular mass that derive from secondary metabolic pathways, but also include peptides and other natural products. Chemical ecological processes mediated by semiochemicals include ones that are intraspecific (occurring within a species) or that are interspecific (occurring between species). A variety of functional subtypes of signals are known, including pheromones, <b>allomones,</b> kairomones, and attractants and repellents.|$|R
50|$|Sceliages species consume only millipedes (Diplopoda). Utilisation of millipedes by the Scarabaeinae {{can be both}} facultative and obligate, and {{has been}} {{documented}} since 1966, while active predation is recognised in Sceliages and Deltochilum species.Sceliages species are alerted {{to the presence of}} injured or freshly-killed millipedes by the smell of quinone-based defensive <b>allomones</b> - the millipedes are then pushed to a suitable site, buried and turned into pear-shaped, soil-encrusted brood-balls. In one observation in Namaqualand a Sceliages brittoni beetle was drawn to a millipede attacked by large reduviid bugs, Ectricodia crux. The beetle wrestled the injured millipede away from the reduviids and then buried it.|$|R
50|$|Fronds are olive to yellow-green, {{and about}} 1m long, while {{leaflets}} are narrow (80-140 x 2-4 mm), with strongly revolute margins. Juvenile leaves {{are covered in}} greyish wool, becoming glabrous with age. Both male and female lemon-coloured cones are some 25 cm in length, occur in clusters of 2-5, and are densely woolly. Initially believed to be wind-pollinated, recent studies show that cones are pollinated mainly by the weevil family, and beetles from the Boganiidae, such as Metacucujus encephalarti. The Boganiidae are known only from South Africa and Australia, and this distribution, shared with the cycad family, indicates an ancient association between these insects and these plants. The beetles are strongly attracted by <b>allomones</b> produced in the early mornings and evenings by {{both male and female}} cones.|$|R
50|$|Trail pheromones are semiochemicals {{secreted}} {{from the}} body of an individual to impact the behavior of another individual receiving it. Trail pheromones often serve as a multi purpose chemical secretion that leads members of its own species towards a food source, while representing a territorial mark {{in the form of an}} <b>allomone</b> to organisms outside of their species. Specifically, trail pheromones are often incorporated with secretions of more than one exocrine gland to produce a higher degree of specificity. Considered one of the primary chemical signaling methods in which many social insects depend on, trail pheromone deposition can be considered one of the main facets to explain the success of social insect communication today. Many species of ants, including those in the genus Crematogaster use trail pheromones.|$|E
5000|$|Lestrimelitta limao is a neotropical eusocial bee species {{found in}} Brazil and Panama and {{is part of}} the Apidae family. It is a species of stingless bees that {{practices}} obligate nest robbing. They have never been spotted foraging from flowers, an observation that supports their raiding behavior. Because of their lack of hind corbicula, they must raid to obtain enough protein in their diet in the form of pollen and nectar. Lestrimelitta limao secrete a lemon-scented alarm <b>allomone,</b> from which they receive their name, in order to conduct successful raids. L. limao are hypothesized to produce poisonous honey that is toxic if consumed by humans. Because robber bees are so rare and difficult to observe, there is a limited scope of information available.|$|E
50|$|Orchids of {{the genus}} Ophrys use sexual {{deception}} to attract pollinators to their flowers. In sexual deception, an orchid attracts male pollinators by producing the sex pheromone of virgin female pollinators {{in addition to providing}} visual and tactile cues (Schiestl 2005; Schluter et al. 2009; Stokl et al. 2009). These signals stimulate mating behavior in the male pollinators, which then attempt copulation, called “pseudocopulation”, with the orchid labellum (Schluter et al. 2009). During pseudocopulation, pollen from the flower’s column becomes attached to some part of the pollinator, usually the head or abdomen, and the pollinator inadvertently carries and transfers this pollen to other flowers when they are once again enticed into pseudocopulation. While the morphological cues such as the shape and texture of the labellum play a role especially at close range in inducing the pollinator mating behavior, the orchid’s pheromone mimic, or <b>allomone,</b> has been shown to play the most important role in enticing pollinators to the flower (Schiestl 2005; Schluter et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|The 20 th {{century was}} marked by great discovers, which had a deep impact on plants {{resistance}} against pest insects. In this context, high studies were developed about cucurbitacins, an important group of secondary substances produced by plants. These substances are mainly produced by the Cucurbitacea family and act against the insects like <b>allomones,</b> imposing an obstacle to the herbivory. However, some insects, mainly defoliators beetles of the Luperini tribe (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), defeated these defenses of the plants and used them as alimentary stimulants and/or in the defense against natural enemies. The action mode of cucurbitacins against the target-insects opens possibilities of its application in the plants breeding, aiming the resistance against insects as well on its utilization in toxic baits or trap cultures...|$|R
5000|$|Like {{their sister}} family Lycaenidae, {{numerous}} species of Riodinidae are myrmecophiles (involving about 280 ant species). The larvae of many species have special organs, {{which have a}} soothing or tempting effect on ants. Many Riodinidae larvae have so-called [...] "tentacle nectary organs" [...] on the eighth segment of the abdomen that secrete a fluid which is eaten by ants. Other tentacle organs on the third thoracic segment {{have been shown to}} emit <b>allomones</b> which influence ants. Studies suggest caterpillar acoustic signals are used to enhance their symbioses with ants (see singing caterpillars). The location of riodinid organs that function in caterpillar-ant symbioses differs from those found in the Lycaenidae, suggesting that the organs in these two families of butterflies are not homologous in origin.|$|R
500|$|Another {{category}} of plant defenses are those features that indirectly protect the plant by enhancing {{the probability of}} attracting the natural enemies of herbivores. Such an arrangement is known as mutualism, in this case of the [...] "enemy of my enemy" [...] variety. One such feature are semiochemicals, given off by plants. Semiochemicals are a group of volatile organic compounds involved in interactions between organisms. One group of semiochemicals are allelochemicals; consisting of <b>allomones,</b> which play a defensive role in interspecies communication, and kairomones, which are used by members of higher trophic levels to locate food sources. When a plant is attacked it releases allelochemics containing an abnormal ratio of these herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Predators sense these volatiles as food cues, attracting them to the damaged plant, and to feeding herbivores. The subsequent {{reduction in the number}} of herbivores confers a fitness benefit to the plant and demonstrates the indirect defensive capabilities of semiochemicals. Induced volatiles also have drawbacks, however; some studies have suggested that these volatiles also attract herbivores.|$|R
5000|$|A kairomone (a coinage {{using the}} Greek καιρός opportune moment, {{paralleling}} pheromone [...] ), is a semiochemical, emitted by an organism, which mediates interspecific interactions {{in a way}} that benefits an individual of another species which receives it, and harms the emitter. This [...] "eavesdropping" [...] is often disadvantageous to the producer (though other benefits of producing the substance may outweigh this cost, hence its persistence over evolutionary time). The kairomone improves the fitness of the recipient and in this respect differs from an <b>allomone</b> (which is the opposite: it benefits the producer and harms the receiver) and a synomone (which benefits both parties). The term is mostly used in the field of entomology (the study of insects). Two main ecological cues are provided by kairomones; they generally either indicate a food source for the receiver, or the presence of a predator, the latter of which is less common or at least less studied.|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that, {{contrary}} {{to what has been}} stated in the literature, the limited antennal movements of the myrmecophilous beetle, Claviger testaceus, are not required for inducing the workers of its host, Lasius flavus, to regurgitate food. Experiments have also shown that the regurgitations are released by the secretions of the Claviger's labral (cephalic) and Wasmann (abdominal) glands. These secretions contain a regurgitation <b>allomone</b> and are taken up by the ants when they lick the beetle's mouthparts or trichomes.

40|$|During {{its natural}} life cycle, the yellow dog tick, Haemaphysalis leachi, has three hosts, {{and it has}} to spend enough time on each of them to {{complete}} a blood meal. When irritated, the females of this tick species produce a cuticular secretion that contains a dog-repelling <b>allomone.</b> This improves the tick's chances of survival by deterring the dog from biting the tick off its body. Employing response-guided isolation techniques in conjunction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the defensive <b>allomone</b> of H. leachi was found to consist of the six homologous aliphatic aldehydes from hexanal to undecanal. A mixture of synthetic versions of these six aldehydes in quantities corresponding to those secreted by one tick elicited strong aversion reactions in the majority of dogs of various breeds. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

40|$|In biology, many organisms {{coordinate}} their interactions in a self-organizing and emergent way solely {{by means of}} indirect communication based on chemical substances. These so-called semiochemicals comprise pheromones, mediating the coordination between organisms of the same species, as well as allelochemics, such as <b>allomones,</b> kairomones, synomones, and apneumones, mediating the coordination between organisms of different species. In order to exploit this biological diversity for the engineering of well adapted coordination mechanisms for self-organizing emergent multiagent systems, the micro- and macroscopic effects of {{the different types of}} semiochemicals have to be better understood. In this paper, we analyze these effects and based on that provide design guidelines that identify appropriate types of digital semiochemicals to use for the interactions between agents on the local level in order to achieve certain required effects on the global level. We apply these guidelines within an existing engineering methodology and present as a result an iteratively refined model of a decentralized coordination mechanism well adapted for the solution of pickup and delivery problems by self-organizing emergent multiagent systems. ...|$|R

40|$|This review {{outlines}} the responsive polymer methods currently in use with their potential application to plant protection and puts forward plant-specific mechanisms as stimuli in newly devised methods for smart release of crop protection agents (CPAs). CPAs include chemicals (fungicides, insecticides, herbicides), biochemicals (antibiotics, RNA-based vaccines for plant viruses), semiochemicals (pheromones, repellents, <b>allomones),</b> microbial pesticides, growth regulators (insect and plant) or micronutrients, all with crop protection effects. This appraisal focuses on emerging uses of polymer nano-encapsulated CPAs. Firstly, {{the most interesting}} advances in controlled release methods are critically discussed with their advantages and drawbacks. Secondly, several plant-specific stimuli-based smart methods are anticipated for use alongside the polymer nano- or micro-capsules. These new CPA release methods are designed to (i) protect plants against infection produced by fungi or bacteria, and (ii) apply micro-nutrients when the plants need it the most. Thus, we foresee (i) the responsive release of nano- encapsulated bio-insecticides regulated by plant stress enzymes, and (ii) the delivery of micro-nutrients synchronized by the nature or intensity of plant root exudates. Such continued advances of nano-scale smart polymer-based CPAs {{for the protection of}} crops herald a “small revolution” for the benefit of sustainable agriculture...|$|R
