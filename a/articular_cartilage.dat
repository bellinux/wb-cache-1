5|$|The {{articular}} cartilage's {{capacity for}} repair is limited: partial-thickness defects in the <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage</b> do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage</b> which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend {{to lead to}} deterioration of the articular surface. As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson StageII, III).|$|E
5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage,</b> or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage.</b> This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E
5|$|Similar to OATS, arthroscopic <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage</b> paste {{grafting}} is {{a surgical}} procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.|$|E
40|$|Diseases in <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> have {{affected}} {{millions of people}} globally. Although the biochemical and cellular composition of <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> is relatively simple, there is a limitation in the self-repair ability of the cartilage. Therefore, developing strategies for cartilage repair is very important. Here, we report on a new liquid resin preparation process of water-based polyurethane based photosensitive materials with hyaluronic acid with application of the materials for 3 D printed customized cartilage scaffolds. The scaffold has high cytocompatibility and is one that closely mimics the mechanical properties of <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages.</b> It is suitable for culturing human Wharton’s jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJMSCs) and the cells in this case showed an excellent chondrogenic differentiation capacity. We consider that the 3 D printing hybrid scaffolds may have potential in customized tissue engineering and also facilitate the development of cartilage tissue engineering...|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanics}} of an avian's wings involve a complex interworking of forces, {{particularly at the}} shoulder {{where most of the}} wings' motions take place. These functions depend on a precise balance of forces from the muscles, ligaments, and <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> as well as inertial, gravitational, and aerodynamic loads on the wing.|$|R
5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) {{is a joint}} {{disorder}} in which cracks form in the <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage</b> and the underlying subchondral bone. OCD usually causes pain and swelling of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. Physical examination typically reveals an effusion, tenderness, and a crackling sound with joint movement.|$|E
5|$|Continuous passive motion (CPM) {{has been}} used to improve healing of the {{articular}} surface during the postoperative period for people with full-thickness lesions. It has been shown to promote <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage</b> healing for small (< 3 mm in diameter) lesions in rabbits. Similarly, Rodrigo and Steadman reported that CPM for six hours per day for eight weeks produced an improved clinical outcome in humans.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is useful for}} staging OCD lesions, evaluating {{the integrity of the}} joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage edema {{in the area of the}} irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage</b> and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, articular surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and arthroscopy have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.|$|E

50|$|Squatting below {{parallel}} qualifies a squat as deep while squatting {{above it}} qualifies as shallow. Some authorities caution against deep squats; though the {{forces on the}} ACL and PCL decrease at high flexion, compressive forces on the menisci and <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> in the knee peak at these same high angles. This makes the relative safety of deep versus shallow squats difficult to determine.|$|R
40|$|Numerical models {{represent}} {{a powerful tool}} for investigating the biomechanical behavior of <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages,</b> in particular in the case of complex conformation of anatomical site. In the literature, there are complex non-linear-multiphase models for investigating the mechanical response of <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages,</b> but seldom implemented for the analysis of high organized structure such as the foot. In the present work, the biomechanical behavior of foot cartilage is investigated by means of a fiber-reinforced hyperelastic constitutive model. The constitutive parameters are obtained through the comparison between in vitro experimental indentation tests on cartilage and numerical analysis data interpreting the specific experimental conditions. A finite element model of the hindfoot region is developed. Particular attention is paid to model cartilage in order to respect its morphometric configuration, including also the synovial capsule. The reliability of the procedure adopted is evaluated by comparing the numerical response of tibio-talar joint model with in vivo experimental tests mimicking the foot response in stance configuration...|$|R
5|$|OCD {{is caused}} by blood {{deprivation}} in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone {{to die in a}} process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage</b> it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage.</b> One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E
5|$|OCD is a {{relatively}} rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Widuchowski W et al. found OCD to {{be the cause of}} <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage</b> defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies. Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1. However, OCD has become more common among adolescent females as they become more active in sports. The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is to develop a}} {{mathematical}} model for the knee joint under the framework of multibody system dynamics. The model is composed by two bodies: the femur, which is stationary, and the tibia, which is considered to move relative to the femur. Due to their higher stiffness compared to that of the <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages,</b> the femur and tibia are modeled as rigid bodies. The <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> are modeled to be deformable structures with specific material characteristics. The main ligaments of the knee joint are included in the model as nonlinear springs. The geometrical profiles of the intervening contact anatomical structures, namely distal femur and proximal tibia, are extracted from a magnetic resonance image (MRI) and then fitted using piecewise cubic splines. Besides the gravitational force, an external force is applied at the center of mass of tibia to provide a dynamic activity to the model. When the bodies contact each other, a continuous non-linear force law is applied to calculate the contact forces as function of an indentation. The forces produced by the ligaments, together with the contact forces, are introduced into the equations of motion as external forces applied to the system. The mechanical behavior of the knee <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> was evaluated using different contact laws. Computational simulations applying an external force with different amplitude values were also performed and the dynamic response of the ligaments was analyzed.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo interrelate <b>articular</b> calcified <b>cartilage</b> thickness, {{mineralisation}} density, tidemark {{count and}} tidemark linear accretion rate by {{site in the}} equine third metacarpal distal condyle. To {{determine the effects of}} exercise during early life on <b>articular</b> calcified <b>cartilage.</b> MethodSix of 12 pasture-raised Thoroughbred horses were exercised from 10 days old. Calcein labels were given 19 and 8 days prior to euthanasia at 18 months old. Osteochondral specimens were cut from the distal third metacarpal condyle and imaged using confocal scanning light microscopy (CSLM) and quantitative backscattered electron scanning electron microscopy (qBSE). <b>Articular</b> calcified <b>cartilage</b> thickness and total thickness mineralisation density were measured on montaged qBSE image sets, and inter-label mineralisation density, tidemark count and linear accretion rate measured on registered CSLM–qBSE image pairs. ResultsCalcified cartilage thickness, mineralisation density, tidemark count and linear accretion rate varied significantly between sites. Regions with thinner calcified cartilage had greater linear accretion rates, hence rapid chondroclastic resorption. Mineralisation density was positively correlated with linear accretion rate. Fewer multiple tidemarks were counted in regions with greater linear accretion rates. Lag time between the tidemark and cement line was estimated (180 days; in the range of 0 – 648 days). Exercise had little effect on measured parameters. ConclusionThe major determinant of <b>articular</b> calcified <b>cartilage</b> thickness is the rate of chondroclastic resorption, not tidemark linear accretion rate. Our evidence supports coupled, mechanosensitive regulation of chondroclastic resorption and linear accretion rate in <b>articular</b> calcified <b>cartilage.</b> Exercising pasture-reared foals causes little additional adaptation in distal third metacarpal <b>articular</b> calcified <b>cartilage...</b>|$|R
40|$|The costal cartilages {{belong to}} the group of the {{permanent}} cartilages, as well as thyroid, tracheal and the <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages.</b> These cartilages ossify incompletly or do not ossify at all. The ossification of the caudal costal and the <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> {{is considered to be a}} manifestation of degeneration, although according to the recent studies the ossification of the thyroid, the tracheal and the first rib cartilages is physiological. The costal cartilage ossification begins at a different age but only in a certain percentage of people. The female and the male pattern of ossification is different. Although the etiology and the occurence of ossification in various populations were studied very deeply, even at the microscopic level, still a lot of questions are not ansvered. Due to the heterogeneity and insuficiency of the data in the Czech literature we decided to evaluate the incidence of the costal cartilage ossification in the sample of the Czech population. We decided to verify the presence of the sexual dimorfism of the ossification and describe the development of the ossification changes at the microscopic level for better understanding of the ossification of human costal cartilage.

5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for <b>articular</b> <b>cartilage</b> to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E

40|$|AbstractElectro-chemo-mechanical {{couplings}} in <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> and corneal stroma {{are due to}} {{the presence}} of electric charges on proteoglycans. In addition, at non-physiological pH, collagen molecules become charged as well. Variation of the pH of the electrolyte has strong implications on the electric charge of these tissues, and by the same token, on their transport and mechanical properties. Indeed, <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> and corneal stroma swell and shrink depending on the composition of the electrolyte, they are in contact with. Emphasis is laid here on the combined effects of pH, ionic strength, calcium and chloride binding on mechanical properties. The tissues are viewed as three-phase multi-species porous media. The constitutive framework is phrased in the theory of thermodynamics of deformable porous media. Acid–base reactions, as well as ion binding, are embedded in this framework. Although, macroscopic in nature, the approach accounts for a number of biochemical details defining collagen and proteoglycans. The model is used to simulate laboratory experiments where specimens of <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> and corneal stroma are put in contact with a bath of controlled chemical composition. Chemical loadings, where the ionic composition and pH of the bath are varied, are intermingled with mechanical loadings. The variations of the stress and strain are observed to depend strongly on the ionic strength and ion type present in the bath: sodium chloride leads to a stiffer response than calcium chloride and hydrochloric acid. Moreover, when the bath changes from basic to acidic, the change of sign of the fixed charge across the isoelectric point has definite mechanical implications, and it gives rise to non-monotonous evolutions of the stress, strain and chemical content. While the chemo-mechanical effect is a key phenomenon that governs the behavior of tissues with fixed charges, the converse mechano-chemical effect is significant in corneal stroma due to its low stiffness...|$|R

With the advancing performance and thus diagnostic opportunities of 3 D-OCT devices, we carried out a systematic study by monitoring arthrotic alterations of porcine osteochondral explants that are mechanically induced under traumatic impaction. As for in-vitro tomographic imaging we utilized two OCT devices, a Thorlabs FD-OCT device with 92 KHz A-scan rate and 1310 nm as central wavelength and a self-developed FD-OCT device at 840 nm central wavelength. This allows the comparison in image contrast and optical pene tration of cartilage tissue between these two spectral bandwidths. Further we analyzed human biopsies of <b>articular</b> <b>cartilages</b> with various degrees of osteoarthritis. The 2 D and 3 D OCT tomograms are characterized qualitatively regarding the inner tissue structure and quantitatively regarding the tissue absorption parameters.
