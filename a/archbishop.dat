5|$|Around 877, Æthelred {{wrote to}} Pope John VIII to {{complain}} about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The exact nature of the dispute is not clear, but the reply from the pope to the <b>archbishop</b> still exists. The pope told the <b>archbishop</b> that Canterbury had papal support and that the pope had written to the king urging the king to respect {{the rights of the}} <b>archbishop.</b> The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 and that the deposition was supported by Æthelred. Other historians, however, do not agree that there was a deposition of the king supported by the <b>archbishop</b> at this time.|$|E

Pope Alexander III punished Béla with ecclesiastic sanctions, but Béla reconciled with <b>Archbishop</b> Lucas of Esztergom, who absolved him and excommunicated Andrew of Kalocsa.
