5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on <b>a</b> <b>door</b> (<b>in</b> some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Forbidden Zone is a 1980 American musical fantasy comedy film {{directed}} and produced by Richard Elfman, and co-written by Elfman and fellow Mystic Knights member Matthew Bright.

5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

25|$|A false door is a wall {{decoration}} {{that looks like}} <b>a</b> <b>door.</b> <b>In</b> ancient Egyptian architecture, this was a common element in a tomb, the false door representing a gate to the afterlife.

25|$|The {{front of}} the house faces {{northwest}}. The first floor of the house is divided in two by a central passage, leading from <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> the northwest to <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> the southeast, with a staircase running up on the northeast side. On the northeast side of the central passage is the primary chamber (or bedroom) in the front, and the little parlor in the back. Between the primary chamber and the little parlor is a smaller passage, leading to a service staircase and a small, side stairway. The Gunston Hall Plantation official website says that on the southwest side of the house is a parlor in the front and a dining room in the back. However, the Historic American Buildings Survey says that on the southwest side of the house the dining room is in the front and a palladian room is in the back.|$|E

25|$|In the foyer, to {{the right}} of the door leading to the library, was a set of plain marble stairs with an {{intermediate}} landing and single turn which lead to the third floor. Behind the steps was a conservatory with a bay window facing northwest. From the intermediate landing, <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> the northeast wall gave out onto an orchestra balcony overlooking the ballroom. The base of the balcony is decorated with corbels, plaster drapery, and guttae.|$|E
25|$|The {{identification}} of dungeons and rooms {{used to hold}} prisoners {{is not always a}} straightforward task. Alnwick Castle and Cockermouth Castle, both near England's border with Scotland, had chambers in their gatehouses which have often been interpreted as oubliettes. However, this has been challenged. These underground rooms (accessed by <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> the ceiling) were built without latrines, and since the gatehouses at Alnwick and Cockermouth provided accommodation {{it is unlikely that the}} rooms would have been used to hold prisoners. An alternative explanation was proposed, suggesting that these were strong-rooms where valuables were stored.|$|E

The balustrade continues along the stairwell in the second floor hallway. Like the first floor, many original finishes remain. <b>A</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> the hallway conceals a short stair to the attic, which also mostly remains as it was originally constructed.

25|$|Above Taylor's vaulted kitchen, {{between the}} Pillared Room and the State Dining room, Soane created a Smaller Dining Room (sometimes called the Breakfast Room) that still exists. To build it, Soane removed the chimney {{from the kitchen}} to put <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> the room. He then moved the chimney to the east side, running a Y-shaped split flue inside the walls up either side {{of one of the}} windows above. The room {{therefore}} has a unique architectural feature: over the fireplace there is a window instead of the usual chimney breast.|$|E
25|$|The {{forward section}} of the first Vista-Dome car was {{partitioned}} off and reserved for women and children. There was <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> the corridor under the dome just behind the women's restroom to the reserved section. Early on, this reserved section was opened up to all passengers and the door and partitions were removed. Ownership of the cars was split between the three railroads almost evenly across all car types. Each car was owned by one railroad, but the ownership of the cars in any one day's train depended more on what was available at the terminals than whose railroad the train was operating over.|$|E

During the time Mike raps his verses, Chester stands atop a platform with gargoyles on the edges. This platform is in front of <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> the shape of a trapezoid. Near the end of the video, the skies turn dark and it begins to rain, and the band performs in the downpour {{until the end of the}} song, where the rain stops and the camera pans away from the tower, showing the wasteland where Shinoda had rapped in is now a lush Greenland. During the rain the statues on the tower begin to move.|$|E
25|$|The Broadway subway {{plan was}} changed in 1915 to route both tracks into 60th Street and {{to cross the}} East River by a tunnel {{just north of the}} Queensboro Bridge. The 59th Street {{crossing}} was obviously now useless, and at 60th Street, the subway would have to be at a lower grade, {{on its way to the}} 60th Street Tunnel. The 59th Street crossing was worked into a pedestrian underpass for the IRT 59th Street station, which turned into a way to get between the downtown platform and the direct subway entrance to Bloomingdale's on the uptown platform. That section is still in use, and the floor level is that of the never-completed BMT station. The 60th Street crossing was mostly destroyed when the existing station was built at a lower grade. <b>A</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> the southern wall across from the platform opens into a remaining unused space, and suggests the platform level of the original grade, which is the same as the 59th Street underpass.|$|E
25|$|The show's set {{included}} <b>a</b> <b>door</b> <b>in</b> the background. During the show, Sales {{would answer}} {{a knock at}} the door and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: when he opened the door, he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think the stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon back and forth in the doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E
