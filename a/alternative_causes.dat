5|$|A team {{composed}} of astronomers from France and Switzerland used the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to examine Kepler-40. SOPHIE uses radial velocity measurements to examine stars for exoplanets. After background light was removed and <b>alternative</b> <b>causes</b> for radial velocity variations were disproved (for example, that Kepler-40 {{was actually a}} close binary star), the team used SOPHIE to analyze {{the properties of the}} actual star. The astronomers observing the star found that it is nearing the main sequence turn-off (the star fuses the last of its hydrogen and becomes a red giant). The establishment of stellar parameters helped the astronomers extrapolate the exoplanet's parameters and prove the existence of Kepler-40b. The discovered planet was the sixth transiting planet to have been discovered in orbit around stars with a radius of more than 1.8 times that of the Sun, after planets including Kepler-5 and Kepler-7.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the degree of}} discounting and augmen-tation of a target <b>cause</b> by an <b>alternative</b> <b>cause</b> given a varying number of observations on the <b>alternative</b> <b>cause</b> while holding its degree of covariation constant. Two experiments showed that more observations of the <b>alternative</b> <b>cause</b> resulted in greater dis-counting or augmentation of a target cause. This sample size effect cannot be explained by current attribution theories based on statistical notions or belief updating but can {{be accounted for by}} a connectionist framework. In addition, the authors found that the sample size effect was stronger when the information was presented in a sequential trial-by-trial format as opposed to a summarized format but found no effect of information order. Possible extensions of statistical models with confidence weights that take account of sample size were considered and simulated but none accommodated the data as well as connectionis...|$|R

5|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. The {{underlying}} mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder {{in which the}} body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of <b>alternative</b> <b>causes,</b> and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There {{are a number of}} subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results of nerve conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} {{digestive}} tract lesions, mild bleeding and mild resultant anemia is treated with iron supplementation, and no specific treatment is administered. There is limited data on hormone treatment and tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding and anemia. Severe anemia or episodes of severe bleeding {{are treated with}} endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) or laser treatment of any lesions identified; this may {{reduce the need for}} supportive treatment. The expected benefits are not such that repeated attempts at treating lesions are advocated. Sudden, very severe bleeding is unusual—if encountered, <b>alternative</b> <b>causes</b> (such as a peptic ulcer) need to be considered—but embolization may be used in such instances.|$|E

40|$|Rats {{received}} {{either a}} common-cause (i. e., A→B, A→food) or a causal-chain training scenario (i. e., B→A, A→food) before {{their tendency to}} approach the food magazine during the presentation of B was assessed {{as a function of}} whether it was preceded by a potential <b>alternative</b> <b>cause.</b> Causal model theory predicts that the influence of an <b>alternative</b> <b>cause</b> should be restricted to the common-cause scenario. In Experiment 1, responding to B was reduced when it occurred after pressing a novel lever during the test phase. This effect was not influenced by the type of training scenario. In Experiment 2, rats were familiarized with the lever prior to test by training it as a potential cause of B. After this treatment, the lever now failed to influence test responding to B. In Experiment 3, rats given common-cause training responded more to B when it followed a cue that had previously been trained as a predictor of B, than when it followed another stimulus. This effect was not apparent in rats that received causal-chain training. This pattern of results is the opposite of that predicted by causal model theory. Thus, in three experiments, the presence of an <b>alternative</b> <b>cause</b> failed to influence test responding in manner consistent with causal model theory. These results undermine the application of causal model theory to rats, but are consistent with associative analyses...|$|R

25|$|Although {{members of}} the HIV/AIDS denialist {{community}} are united by their disagreement with the scientific finding that HIV {{is the cause of}} AIDS, the specific positions taken by various groups differ. Denialists claim many incompatible things: HIV does not exist; HIV has not been adequately isolated, HIV does not fulfill Koch's postulates, HIV testing is inaccurate, and that antibodies to HIV neutralize the virus and render it harmless. Suggested <b>alternative</b> <b>causes</b> of AIDS include recreational drugs, malnutrition, and the very antiretroviral drugs used to treat the syndrome.|$|E

50|$|Data {{shows that}} stock market returns in many {{countries}} during the May-October period are systematically negative or lower than the short-term interest rate.

EMH predicts that stock market returns should not be predictably lower than the short-term interest rate (risk free rate).|$|R

40|$|Sensory {{involvement}} is thought {{not to be}} a feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, in the setting of a specialist motor neuron disease clinic, we have identified five patients with sporadic ALS and a sensory neuropathy for which an <b>alternative</b> <b>cause</b> could not be identified. In three individuals, sensory nerve biopsy was performed, demonstrating axonal loss without features of an alternative aetiology.

40|$|Two {{cases of}} leflunomide-induced {{peripheral}} neuropathy are described; in a 60 -year-old woman with sero-negative polyarthralgia-myalgia syndrome and a 65 -year-old man with sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis, both treated with leflunomide at 20 mg/day. Nerve conduction studies and electromyogram showed sensorimotor axonal neuropathy in both cases. An <b>alternative</b> <b>cause</b> for the axonal neuropathy was excluded by extensive investigations, including cerebrospinal fluid examination and nerve biopsy {{in the second}} patient.

50|$|<b>Alternative</b> <b>causes</b> of this {{tissue damage}} have been {{proposed}} and involve release of interleukin 15 and activation of the innate immune system by a shorter gluten peptide (p31-43/49). This would trigger killing of enterocytes by lymphocytes in the epithelium. The villous atrophy seen on biopsy may also be due to unrelated causes, such as tropical sprue, giardiasis and radiation enteritis. While positive serology and typical biopsy are highly suggestive of coeliac disease, lack of response to diet may require these alternative diagnoses to be considered.|$|E

40|$|The {{high altitudes}} of most {{mountain}} ranges have commonly been ascribed to late Cenozoic uplift, {{without reference to}} when crustal thickening and other tectonic processes occurred. Deep incision and recent denudation of these mountain ranges, abundant late Cenozoic coarse sediment near them, and palaeobotanical evidence for warmer climates, where high mountain climates today are relatively cold, have traditionally been interpreted as evidence for recent uplift. An <b>alternative</b> <b>cause</b> of these phenomena is late Cenozoic global climate change: towards lower temperatures, increased alpine glaciation, a stormier climate, and perturbations to humidity, vegetative cover and precipitation...|$|R
40|$|Base rate neglect on the {{mammography}} {{problem can}} be overcome by explicitly presenting a causal basis for the typically vague false positive statistic (Krynski and Tenenbaum, 2007). One account of this causal facilitation effect is that people make probabilistic judgements over intuitive causal models parameterised with {{the evidence in the}} problem. Poorly defined or difficult to map evidence interferes with this process, leading to errors in statistical reasoning. To assess whether the construction of parameterised causal representations is an intuitive or deliberative process, in Experiment 1 we combined a secondary load paradigm with manipulations of {{the presence or absence of}} an <b>alternative</b> <b>cause</b> in typical statistical reasoning problems. We found limited effects of a secondary load, no evidence that information about an <b>alternative</b> <b>cause</b> improves statistical reasoning, but some evidence that it reduces base rate neglect errors. In Experiments 2 and 3 where we did not impose a load, we observed causal facilitation effects. The amount of Bayesian responding in the causal conditions was impervious to the presence of a load (Experiment 1) and to the precise statistical information that was presented (Experiment 3). However, we found less Bayesian responding in the causal condition than did Krynski and Tenenbaum (2007). We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings and the suggestion that there may be population effects in the accuracy of statistical reasoning...|$|R
