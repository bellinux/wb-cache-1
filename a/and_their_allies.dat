5|$|The AERA {{essentially}} collapsed {{after its}} acrimonious convention in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations {{were created in}} its aftermath.

5|$|In December 1789, {{after five}} years of {{diplomatic}} wrangling about the terms of the Treaty of Mangalore that had ended the Second Anglo-Mysore War, the ruler of Mysore Tipu Sultan again declared war on the British East India Company <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>allies</b> in Southern India. For the next two years the war continued as British forces <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>allies</b> drove the Mysore armies back towards the capital of Seringapatam. Both sides were reliant on supply by sea to maintain their campaigns inland: the British forces were supported from their major ports at Bombay and Madras, later stationing additional forces at the small port of Tellicherry inside Mysore territory. The Mysorean forces were supplied through Mangalore by French ships. France had been an ally of the Tipu Sultan's father Hyder Ali during the Second Anglo-Mysore War and although the political instability caused by the French Revolution in Europe prevented active involvement, they ensured that their ships kept up a supply of equipment to Mysore throughout the war.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{phylogeny}} and higher classification of the Staphylinidae auct. <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>allied</b> groups, i. e., Pselaphidae auct., Scaphidiidae auct., Scydmaenidae auct., Silphidae auct., and Catopiaria. The ground plan conditions of the Staphylinoidea are briefly described concerning the morphological characters useful for phylogenetic analysis. The phylogeny of the Staphylinidae <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>allied</b> groups is inferred, principally using the Hennigian method of phylogenetic analysis. Based on my phylogenetic study, a higher classification of the section Brachelytra is newly proposed. The family Staphylinidae auct. {{is divided into three}} families, Oxytelidae sensu novo, Staphylinidae sensu novo, and Oxyporidae sensu novo. The Pselaphidae auct. are included in the Oxyporidae sensu novo. Accordingly, the section Brachelytra is classified into six families : Silphidae, Oxytelidae sensu novo, Staphylinidae sensu novo, Oxyporidae sensu novo, Scaphidiidae and Scydmaenidae...|$|R

5|$|After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, which {{resulted}} in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary, Ferdinand I was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia.

50|$|In the 17th century, Anishinaabe warriors {{from the}} north of Wisconsin were {{constantly}} fighting the white invaders (at that time and in that area, the French and French-Canadian colonists) <b>and</b> <b>their</b> Indian <b>allies.</b> Between 1630 and 1665, thousands of Indians who lived along the northeast Atlantic Coast were driven from their homes by the French <b>and</b> <b>their</b> Indian <b>allies.</b> Many fled west {{to the north of}} present-day Wisconsin, seeking the safety of Lake Michigan and Anishinaabe warriors. The whites <b>and</b> <b>their</b> Indian <b>allies</b> invaded the eastern end of the Lake Superior region but were driven off.

Attempts to run the blockade and resupply Malta proved to be a failure; previous convoys such as Harpoon (from Gibraltar) and Vigorous (from Alexandria, Egypt) had lost most of their merchantmen and their escorts had been damaged. A new convoy was hence planned for mid-August, and named Pedestal.|$|E
