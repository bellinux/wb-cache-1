50|$|<b>Anticipatory</b> <b>Breach</b> is an {{important}} aspect of the doctrine of repudiation. <b>Anticipatory</b> <b>Breach</b> occurs where one party repudiates their obligations under the contract prior to the time set to perform obligations. In response, an aggrieved party may, by accepting the repudiation, elect to terminate the contract and claim damages. However, in an instance where an aggrieved party chooses not to accept the repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, the contract will continue on food and the aggrieved party will have no right to damages unless and until an actual breach occurs.|$|E
50|$|Remedies may {{be claimed}} {{as soon as}} the breach occurs. This is {{especially}} helpful in cases of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach,</b> as the claimant does not {{have to wait for the}} date when performance falls due.|$|E

50|$|Liability in Contract arises if a {{mediator}} breaches (written or verbal) contract {{with one or}} more parties. The two forms of breach are failure to perform and <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach.</b> Limitations on liability include the requirement to show actual causation.|$|E
50|$|A breach by anticipatory {{repudiation}} (or simply <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach)</b> is an unequivocal {{indication that}} the party will not perform when performance is due, or {{a situation in which}} future non-performance is inevitable. An <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> gives the non-breaching party the option to treat such a breach as immediate, and, if repudiatory, to terminate the contract and sue for damages (without waiting for the breach to actually take place) For example, A contracts with B on January 1 to sell 500 quintals of wheat and to deliver it on May 1. Subsequently, on April 15 A writes to B and says that he will not deliver the wheat. B may immediately consider the breach to have occurred and file a suit for damages for the scheduled performance, even though A has until May 1 to perform. However, a unique feature of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> is that if an aggrieved party chooses not to accept a repudiation occurring before the time set for performance, not only will the contract continue on foot, but also there will be no right to damages unless and until an actual breach occurs.|$|E
50|$|Anticipatory repudiation, {{also called}} an <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach,</b> {{is a term}} in the law of {{contracts}} that describes a declaration by the promising {{party to a contract}} that he or she does not intend {{to live up to his}} or her obligations under the contract.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} arises {{as to why}} any party would want to provide notice of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach.</b> The reason is that once the performing party is informed of the <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach,</b> a duty is then created for the performing party to mitigate damages {{as a result of}} the breach. Another situation where anticipatory repudiation can occur is where a party has reason to believe the other party is not going to perform and requests reasonable assurances that the other party will perform (see UCC 2-609(1)). If such reasonable assurances are not given, it will constitute anticipatory repudiation, for which the performing party has various remedies, including termination. However, anticipatory repudiation only applies to a bilateral executory contract with non-performed duties on both sides. Additionally, the repudiation must be unequivocal.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe thesis {{discusses}} {{the origin and}} development of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> of contract in South African law {{leading up to the}} decision in Datacolor International (Pty) Ltd v Intamarket (Pty) Ltd 2001 (2) SA 284 (SCA) and the implications of this decision on the law. This decision is generally regarded as the culmination of the development of a 'new approach' to repudiation, as a form of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> of contract, in South African law and this 'new approach' and other aspects of the decision will be discussed in detail. Drawing on Datacolor International (Pty) Ltd v Intamarket (Pty) Ltd and the decisions of Lord Diplock in English law the thesis proposes a model for <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> of contract that defines <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> of contract as conduct or circumstances that support a conclusion, with reasonable certainty, that a contracting party will fail to perform their primary obligations under the contract correctly and that such failure justifies affording the aggrieved party a right to cancel the contract. <b>Anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> of contract will therefore always amount to a material breach of contract, where material breach of contract consists of a failure by a contracting party to perform her or his primary obligations correctly, or conduct which indicates with reasonable certainty that she or he will fail to perform their primary obligations correctly, which will substantially deprive the aggrieved party of the benefit of the contract. If, balancing the interests of the parties, it would be fair to afford the aggrieved party a right to cancel the contract this conduct will amount to a material breach of contract. Anticipatory breaches of contract are those material breaches which consist of conduct indicating that a failure will occur rather than consisting of the actual failure to perform a primary obligation. In addition to defining when the remedy of cancellation is available to an aggrieved party the thesis also proposes certain other modifications to the remedies available to an aggrieved party facing an <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> of contract including introducing into the South African law, as a remedy for an anticipated breach of contract, a 'request for an adequate assurance of performance' modelled on the remedy of the same name originating in the Uniform Commercial Code...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{in detail}} the English doctrine of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach,</b> a hugely important subject {{in terms of both}} contract theory and commercial practice. It fills a significant gap in the existing literature with a comprehensive, systematic and in-depth treatment of the subject. The book not only restates the doctrine of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> but also rejuvenates it, developing the proposition that the doctrine is essentially a mechanism for sanctioning present contractual remedies for future breaches. This proposition is developed in four parts consisting of nine chapters, which cover between them various aspects of the doctrine of anticipatory breach: historical genesis, theoretical characterisations, terminology, the constitution of an <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach,</b> the defence of anticipated breach, the principle of election, the peculiarities of a right to claim damages, the assessment of damages, the victim 2 ̆ 7 s ability to continue with its performance and to claim the contract price when it is due, etc. Above all the book presents a carefully engineered critical review of the doctrine of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> as it stands, challenging the misconceptions with which it was historically associated, the obscurity and precariousness of its theoretical foundation and the resulting inconsistency and inflexibility in its application. Instead, the author argues for a reformulation which follows a more rational, coherent and refined theoretical framework.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of the study of breach of contract is that of the need for termination of the breached contract for the recovery of damages. It is suggested that the classification of damages, by describing them, variously, as being ‘expectation’, or ‘loss of bargain’, damages, or for <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach,</b> gives limited guidance as to whether termination of the breached contract is a prerequisite for their recovery. This short article advances the discrete argument that in order to determine if termination of the breached contract is necessary for the recovery of damages, a practitioner’s enquiries could be more usefully focussed upon ascertaining whether the damages sought to be recovered are in respect of the consequences of the loss arising from the breaching party’s unperformed obligations, rather than adopting the criteria of ‘expectation’, or ‘loss of bargain’, losses, or for <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach,</b> as the case may be...|$|E

40|$|In the April {{number of}} this journal Professor Joseph H.

40|$|The Law and {{economics}} movement has {{paid a lot}} of attention to carefully analyzing various doctrines of contract law. Yet, with few exceptions, the doctrine of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> seems to have escaped law {{and economics}} scholars 2 ̆ 7 scrutiny. Specifically, the question of optimal choice of remedies has escaped scholars 2 ̆ 7 eyes. While traditionally in England the party who files a law suit can get only damages, in the US the party can not only ask for assurances for performance, but also, in appropriate cases, get specific performance. Which regime is better? Can parties opt in and out of those regimes? Is there a legal regime which is superior to both the English and American regimes? In this paper we attempt to start filling in this gap by studying the relationship between various regimes of remedies. Specifically, we start by studying the conditions in which the American legal regime (which grants the non-breaching party an option to choose, in appropriate cases, between specific performance and actual damages) is superior to the English regime (which allows the non-breaching party to seek only actual damages). We then explore a third regime, which as far as we know does not exist, and show that it is unconditionally Pareto Superior to both the English and American legal regimes. Our analysis in this paper informs transactional lawyers of the relevant economic factors they should consider when deciding between remedies in a given <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> context. We focus on the ex-ante design of the contract in light of new and asymmetric information that the parties anticipate they will gain after they draft the contract. We assume fist, for simplicity, that no renegotiation or investments are involved. We demonstrate the optimal way to design contract clauses which takes advantage of the information that the seller and the buyer receive between the time they enter into the contract and the time of the breach. We present two models. One is for non-market goods and the other is for market-goods. The law is different with respect to the way damages are calculated for these two classes of goods. We thus model both types of transactions. Section two describes the legal background against which we have designed our models. Section three surveys the literature that evaluates contract remedies in the context of <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> context from an economic perspective. Section four presents two simple models with incomplete two-sided asymmetric information. In section four, we compare the performance of the American legal regime with that of the English one. Section five discusses some interesting extensions meant to approach the first-best allocative efficiency. The appendix provides a more rigorous mathematical demonstration of the model...|$|E

40|$|RESUME The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to provide a}} general {{description}} of the purpose, functions and principles governing the right to unilaterally terminate a contract under Czech law. The main part of the thesis provides overview of the provisions of the new Civil Code regarding termination of contract, describing the conditions for termination of the contract, limitations on contractual freedom to agree upon grounds for the termination of the contract, prerequisites of the termination of the contract and the legal consequences to the rights and obligations of the contractual parties following successful termination of the contract. The thesis differentiates between the following generally applicable grounds for the termination of the contract: (i) a material breach of contract; (ii) a breach of contract (whether material or immaterial) constituting delay within the meaning of the new Civil Code, (iii) fulfilment of specific obligation with defects and (iv) <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> of contract. Each ground for termination is analysed in detail and the overlaps of the specific grounds for termination is identified.

40|$|Are health {{maintenance}} organization (HMO) physicians obligated to act exclusively {{in the interest of}} the individual patient? Does the mere existence of financial incentives to limit patient care violate this obligation? To what extent are doctors responsible for the population of patients served by a health plan, or for promoting a fair distribution of health care among society as a whole? These questions come to the fore in the recent U. S. Supreme Court case, Pegram v. Herdrich. In Pegram, Herdrich claimed that the terms of the Carle HMO organization, rewarding its physician owners for limiting medical care, entailed an inherent or <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> of the physician 2 ̆ 7 s fiduciary duty under ERISA.

40|$|This article {{considers}} the exceptio non adimpleti contractus (defence of the unfulfilled contract / right to withhold {{performance of a}} reciprocal obligation if the other party did not make or tender proper performance). It first focuses {{on the role of}} this defence in lease contracts. The weight of South African authority is in favour of only recognising proportional reduction in rent as a remedy for a lessee who received partial use and enjoyment of the leased object, so that a right to withhold the full rent with reference to the exceptio is not available as a further defence. Nevertheless, the case of Ntshiqa v Andreas Supermarket, which applied the exceptio and the rules on the relaxation thereof in the leading case on the exceptio of BK Tooling v Scope Precision Engineering in this context, has not been specifically overruled, and has often been cited with approval by academic writers. This creates uncertainty about the lessee's exact obligations and remedies. If it is accepted that proportional reduction in rent is the appropriate remedy, rather than the exceptio, it may give the impression that the law of lease is not consistent with the general principles of contract law on remedies for breach, which recognise that the exceptio applies to all reciprocal contracts. However, there may be good policy reasons why different types of specific contracts should have their own deviating rules. This contribution shows that in this instance the rules on lease could be reconciled with the general principles. It argues for some modification of the currently accepted principles on the exceptio as well as recognition of proportionate reduction in price as a generalised remedy for breach. There is already implicit support for this modification in the cost orders made by courts who relaxed the exceptio. When rent is payable in advance, the right to suspend performance {{in the face of an}} <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> becomes relevant, and proposals are also made in this regard. The rules argued for in this contribution are consistent with a more general principle that the exceptio as well as the remedy of suspension may only be raised to the extent consistent with good faith or reasonableness. The article also comprises comparative research into Austrian and German law as well as the Principles of European Contract Law: Lease and the European Draft Common Frame of Reference...|$|E

Konvencija za slučaj buduće povrede ugovora uređuje pravna sredstva odgode ispunjenja obveze, zaustavljanje robe u prijevozu (pravo kojim se smije koristiti samo kupac) te raskid ugovora. Treba utvrditi kada su se ispunile pretpostavke za korištenje spomenutih pravnih sredstava. To pitanje je osobito značajno jer korištenje tih sredstava bez opravdanog razloga može za posljedicu imati povredu ugovora. International uniform law envisages {{a number}} of {{situations}} in which a breach {{is said to have}} occurred prior to the time agreed upon for performance. In the area of international sales contracts, arts. 71, 72, and 73 (2) of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (hereafter "CISG"), applicable to both the buyer and the seller, lay down, on the one hand, the situations in which an <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> is deemed to have occurred and, on the other hand, the remedies available to the aggrieved party. In other words, these provisions designate the circumstances in which, even though no breach of contract has yet been committed and the time for performance of the obligation has not yet elapsed, a party may, in order to protect his own interests, temporarily stop complying with his contractual obligations or completely free himself from those obligations. In this respect, arts. 71, 72, and 73 (2) CISG differ from arts. 49 and 64 CISG, which govern the right of the aggrieved party to avoid the contract when performance is overdue, that is when the other party has actually committed a fundamental breach of contract. Under art. 71 CISG, if it becomes apparent that one party will not perform a substantial part of his obligation, the other party may suspend performance of his obligations. The innocent party is however compelled to restore performance if the other party provides adequate assurance of performance. Such assurance may be considered adequate even if it shows that performance might not be complete and perfect. Furthermore, the failure, by one party, to provide adequate assurance of performance does not constitute, in itself, a fundamental breach, and consequently does not authorize the other party to declare the contract avoided. In turn, the conditions that ought to be satisfied, under art. 72 CISG, for the innocent party to be entitled to declare the contract avoided, are more onerous than those of art. 71 CISG. They require that the future occurrence of the breach be objectively "clear" (rather than just "apparent") and that the suspected breach be of fundamental nature. Furthermore, in the case of art. 72 CISG, the innocent party must give notice to the other party prior to the declaration of avoidance, in order to allow the latter party to provide adequate assurance of performance...|$|E
40|$|Public private {{partnership}} (PPP) is {{an alternative}} method for the financing of public infrastructure, based {{on the concept of}} financing public undertakings by private funds. The technique {{can be used in a}} number of different sectors such as transportation, energy, waste management, housing, education and healthcare. However, the focus for this essay is made to large-scale capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as, inter alia, motorways, railroads, bridges, water supply and energy facilities. PPP is commonly used all over Europe, particularly in England, and have recently grown exceedingly in the Nordic countries. Despite this European trend, the Swedish government has so far been hostile against making use of the PPP. However, given the positive outcome from the development that has taken place in the Nordic countries, Sweden is likely to follow the track. There are various forms of private public partnerships, however, the basic concept is that a private company, solely established for the purpose of carrying out the project in question, takes the primary responsibility for the financing, designing, building and operating of a project facility, which is then transferred to the public sector. Using such a single purpose vehicle (SPV) reduces the risks for the project sponsors thus making it possible for them to attain a “non-recourse financing”. This means that the lenders have no recourse against the project sponsors and therefore only may take recourse to the assets held by the project company for the repayment of their loans and for interest payments on such loans. However, the value of the asset of the project company, at least at the beginning of the construction phase, is significantly limited and uncertain. There is often no established market for project assets such as a power plant or a motorway and the facilities are in general owned by the public sector, rather than the project company. The non-recourse financing technique in addition to the fact that there is no real asset to take security in thus exposes the creditors to considerable risk. The lenders are forced to almost solely rely on the future revenues of the project company. Both the creditors and the equity holders therefore focus their attention on the prospective future cash flow of the project company. The most important objective for the creditors as well as for the equity holders is thus to keep the project running. The future revenues are generally provided by the public sector party, once the project is finalized. Hence, the key threat is a public sector party cancellation of the contract. In order to make these projects “bankable” the parties involved are forced to create innovative contractual solutions taking these foreseeable conditions into consideration. Apart from the traditional form of security, various forms of “quasi security” are often used. One of the most important features in this regard is direct agreements. Direct agreements are entered into between the project company, the banks financing a project and the parties to the project’s key underlying commercial contracts. The key contracts for this purpose would typically include the concession agreement, the main construction contract, any operation and maintenance agreement, any long-term supply contract and any long-term sales contracts. The objective of a direct agreement is basically to enable the banks to “step into the shoes of the project company” if it defaults in its loan obligations. The agreements provide a right for the creditors to assume the project company’s rights and obligations under the contract for a specified period of time or allow the transfer of the contract to a separate company established by the banks for this purpose. If such an assumption is made, then the project contractors can not terminate the defaulted contracts prematurely, their cancellation rights are to say “frozen”. Hence, direct agreements draw third parties into a projects finance agreement in that compulsory consent to accomplish an eventual assignment is obtained prior to such transfer is being considered. In doing so, the lenders can hinder third parties from exercising their contractual rights. However, direct agreements are met in accordance with English law, which is generally considered more ‘creditor friendly’ than the Germanic law tradition. Albeit the parties involved have agreed upon this solution, implications in the Swedish jurisdiction may render these agreements ineffective. The key threat to the efficiency of using direct agreements in Sweden is the potential bankruptcy of the project company. The bankruptcy itself does not necessarily create significant complications for the lenders, however the expected right of the bankruptcy’s estate to enter into the debtor’s contracts exposes the lender to higher risk. The purpose of this essay is to examine the efficiency of direct agreements used in private public partnerships and project financing in general, relating to large-scale infrastructure projects, in the light of Swedish law, particularly with regard to the project company’s bankruptcy and the principal rule of the estate’s right to enter into the debtor’s contracts. The two basic questions are, firstly whether the bankrupt estate is entitled to enter into the project company’s contracts, (or from a contractual perspective, whether the solvent party is entitled to cancel its contractual obligations) and secondly whether the right of the estate to accede to the project company’s contract is mandatory and hence an agreement opposing such right is void against the estate. The essay seeks to discuss these basic questions de lege lata as well as de lege ferenda in Sweden and to compare the legal situation in the Nordic countries and in England. Furthermore, the purpose of this essay is to suggest solutions of the problems evinced, principally to devise a law reform. The essay holds that the two perspectives deliberated in doctrine, the solvent party as opposes to the bankrupt estate and its creditors prove inadequate pertaining to project finance. There is considerably more interest to take into account that renders the traditional argumentation invoked in legal literature inapplicable for the particular circumstances at stake in project finance. The concept of “all creditors” must be modulated. The interest of protection noticeably varies among different creditors and hence there are reasons to give preference for the syndicated lenders who comprise the major part of the creditors and those subjected to the major risks. It is held that none of the likely risks expressed in legal literature or key arguments invoked in favour of the bankruptcy perspective is pertinent considering project finance where the lenders have step in rights. There are incitements to consider other creditors in the contracting of the solvent party and the debtor prior to the bankruptcy. The solvent party does incur an inconsiderable further damage or inconvenience beyond what he would have suffered if the contracts instead had been cancelled on the day of the bankruptcy judgement. Besides this inconvenience is not a matter of concern solely for the single contracting party however encompasses the public interest of infrastructure and the quality of such. Besides the lender’s step in comprise a substitute providing a noticeably better solution. The most efficient and favourable solution for “all creditors” will be achieved by entitling the lender’s and hence not the estate to enter into the project company’s contracts, particularly the project agreement. It may certainly be questioned why the estate should be considered as a “new third party” not possible to include in direct agreements prior to a bankruptcy, when all major creditors participate in such agreement. However, the essay states that de lege lata as well as de lege ferenda remain uncertain. The principal rule de lege lata give preference to the right of entry for the estate in analogy with the 63 § SAG. Albeit exceptions can be made in analogy with <b>anticipatory</b> <b>breach</b> such deviations from the basic principle is subjected to inconveniences. The debate de lege ferenda indicates a highly trend towards company reorganisation and increased priority of secured creditors. The objectives behind the new insolvency rules and the essence of the debate of incorporating the two insolvency proceedings are considerably more likely to be achieved if the lender’s are entitled to enter into the debtor’s contract. The commission advocates flexibility and the importance of giving all the creditors incentives to participate. It can be questioned if the best way to achieve such goals is through mandatory rules is. Conversely, the principle of freedom of contract and encouraging private work out insensitive, as provided for in direct agreements, is without doubt a better solution for the particular circumstances in project finance. In conclusion, a balancing of interest, de lege lata, definitely points in favour of entitling the lender’s to step in and the solvent party to cancel and hence not entitling the estate to accede to the debtor’s contracts. However, uncertainty prevails. Besides, it is just a matter of time before a legal reform is brought into force, prescribing general rules in favour of the bankruptcy estate to enter. It is thus essential to carve out exceptions for project finance and public private partnership in such proposal. Against this background the essay concludes with a proposal of a law reform...|$|E
