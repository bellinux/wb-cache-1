5|$|The {{text of the}} {{encyclical}} was destroyed in several countries. In France, the ban on usury persisted until the French Revolution of 1789, the same year in which Turgot's Mémoire sur les prets d'argent, <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> usury, was allowed to be published.|$|E
5|$|A Vindication of the Rights of Men, in a Letter to the Right Honourable Edmund Burke; Occasioned by His Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790) is a {{political}} pamphlet, written by the 18th-century British liberal feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, which attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism. Wollstonecraft's was the first response in a pamphlet war sparked by the publication of Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> constitutional monarchy, aristocracy, and the Church of England.|$|E

In 2008, Jackson's father, Jesse Jackson, wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times attacking presidential candidate Obama for his lack of activist involvement; Jackson Junior responded sharply in the same paper with <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> Obama.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} famous anti-Tom books are The Sword and the Distaff by William Gilmore Simms, Aunt Phillis's Cabin by Mary Henderson Eastman, and The Planter's Northern Bride by Caroline Lee Hentz, with the last author having been a close {{personal}} friend of Stowe's when the two lived in Cincinnati. Simms' book was published {{a few months after}} Stowe's novel, and it contains a number of sections and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> slavery as seen {{through the eyes of a}} northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner.|$|E
5|$|Before the duel, Hamilton wrote <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> his {{decision}} to duel {{while at the same}} time intending to throw away his shot. Hamilton viewed his roles of being a father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, placing his family's welfare in jeopardy and his moral and religious stances as reasons not to duel, but he felt it impossible to avoid due to having made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. He intended to accept the duel and throw away his fire in order to satisfy his morals and political codes, respectively. His desire to be available for future political matters also played a factor.|$|E
5|$|Seydlitz {{rejoined the}} King in 1758 and on 25 August, at the Battle of Zorndorf, Seydlitz's cavalry again secured the victory. He led thirty-six squadrons into {{a mass of}} Russian cavalry mingled with infantry. This charge broke the Russian right wing and sent them running for the woods. At the Prussian debacle at Hochkirch, on 14 October 1758, he covered the Prussian retreat with 108 squadrons, and in the {{disaster}} of Kunersdorf, on 12 August 1759, he received another severe wound in a hopeless attempt to storm a hill held by the Russians; his 8th Cuirassiers {{was one of the}} few intact regiments at the end of the battle. While recuperating in Berlin, he helped organize <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the city during the Austro-Russian raid (October 1760). Although he was unable to prevent the Russians from briefly occupying the city, Frederick later praised Seydlitz for his conduct.|$|E

5|$|The Second and Third of May 1808 {{are thought}} to have been {{intended}} as parts of a larger series. Written commentary and circumstantial evidence suggest that Goya painted four large canvases memorializing the rebellion of May 1808. In his memoirs of the Royal Academy in 1867, José Caveda wrote of four paintings by Goya of the second of May, and Cristóbal Ferriz—an artist and a collector of Goya—mentioned two other paintings on the theme: a revolt at the royal palace and <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> artillery barracks. Contemporary prints stand as precedents for such a series. The disappearance of two paintings may indicate official displeasure with the depiction of popular insurrection.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publication}} of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women, and her works have been considered <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although {{attempts have been made}} to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family and travel.|$|E
5|$|Zephaniah Kingsley wrote <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> {{slavery and}} the three-tier social system that {{acknowledged}} the rights of free people of color that existed in Florida under Spanish rule. Kingsley briefly served on the Florida Territorial Council, planning the transition when Florida was annexed by the United States. During his time on the council, he attempted to influence Florida lawmakers to recognize free people of color and allow mixed-race children to inherit property. In addition to the architectural qualities, the site is significant as his home {{and that of his}} unique family.|$|E

5|$|The 9th Armored Division made a {{stand at}} Bastogne and held off the Germans {{long enough to}} enable the 101st Airborne Division to dig in for <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the city, {{resulting}} in the Battle of Bastogne. After a rest period in January 1945, the 9th Armored Division made preparations for a drive across the Roer River. The offensive was launched on February 28, and the 9th smashed across the Roer to Rheinbach, sending patrols into Remagen. The Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen was found intact, and was seized by elements of the 9th Armored Division minutes before demolition charges were set to explode on March 7, 1945. The division exploited the bridgehead, moving south and east across the Lahn River toward Limburg, where thousands of Allied prisoners were liberated. The Division drove on to Frankfurt {{and then turned to}} assist in the closing of the Ruhr Pocket. In April it continued east, encircled Leipzig and secured a line along the Mulde River. The division was shifting south to Czechoslovakia when the war in Europe ended on V-E Day in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Apologetic Summary History of the People of These Indies (Spanish Apologética historia summaria de las gentes destas Indias) {{was first}} written as the 68th {{chapter of the}} General History of the Indies, but Las Casas changed it into a volume of its own, {{recognizing}} that the material was not historical. The material contained in the Apologetic History is primarily ethnographic accounts of the indigenous cultures of the Indies – the Taíno, the Ciboney, and the Guanahatabey, but it also contains descriptions {{of many of the}} other indigenous cultures that Las Casas learned about through his travels and readings. The history is apologetic because it is written as <b>a</b> <b>defense</b> <b>of</b> the cultural level of the Indians, arguing throughout that indigenous peoples of the Americas were just as civilized as the Roman, Greek and Egyptian civilizations—and more civilized than some European civilizations. It was in essence a comparative ethnography comparing practices and customs of European and American cultures and evaluating them according to whether they were good or bad, seen from a Christian viewpoint.|$|E
