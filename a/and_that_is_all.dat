Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet.

25|$|Manifest Destiny was {{the idea}} that it was God’s will for the United States to expand because it is Protestant, democratic, and white. It {{promoted}} the notion of American racial superiority, casting all nonwhites, including Native Americans, Mexicans, and blacks, as inferior beings. John L. O'Sullivan coined the phrase in 1845, first using it in his newspaper, the United States Democratic Review. Manifest destiny soon became an important element of American political rhetoric. It called for the expansion of the United States and was a justification used by southerners for extending slavery. An example of this was the annexation of Texas. President James K. Polk used the argument of manifest destiny to support his intentions of claiming Texas. In 1845, Texas entered the United States as the fifteenth slave state. Since whites were seen as superior beings, slavery didn’t seem like such a brutal practice. The whites were not the ones suffering, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> that mattered.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's {{boss and}} the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> you desire.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film {{any more than a}} man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, on the day of release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space we could tell the comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>all</b> saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with ourselves, with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Essay" [...] was {{composed}} {{at a time}} when the prestige of Rymer and neo-Aristotelianism in England was already declining, and though Wesley expressed some admiration for Rapin and Le Bossu, he is by no means docile under their authority. Whatever the weight of authority, he says, [...] "I see no cause why Poetry should not be brought to the Test , as well as Divinity...." [...] As to the sacred example of Homer, who based his great epic on mythology, Wesley remarks, [...] "But this [...] being now antiquated, I cannot think we are oblig'd superstitiously to follow his Example, any more than to make Horses speak, as he does that of Achilles." [...] To the question of the formidable Boileau, [...] "What Pleasure can it be to hear the howlings of repining Lucifer?" [...] our critic responds flippantly,"I think 'tis easier to answer than to find out what shew of Reason he had for asking it, or why Lucifer mayn't howl as pleasantly as either Cerberus, or Knoeladus." [...] Without hesitation or apology he takes issue with Rapin's conception of Decorum in the epic. But Wesley is empiricist as well as rationalist, and the judgment of authority can be upset by appeal to the court of experience. To Balzac's suggestion that, to avoid difficult and local proper names in poetry, generalized terms be used, such as Ill-luck for the Fates and the Foul Fiend for Lucifer, our critic replies with jaunty irony, [...] "... and whether this wou'd not sound extremely Heroical, I leave any Man to judge", and thus he dismisses the matter. Similarly, when Rapin objects to Tasso's mingling of lyric softness in the majesty of the epic, Wesley points out sharply that no man of taste will part with the fine scenes of tender love in Tasso, Dryden, Ovid, Ariosto, and Spenser [...] "for the sake of a fancied Regularity." [...] He had set out to defend the Biblical epic, the Christian epic, and the propriety of Christian machines in epic, and no rules or authority could deter him. As good an example as any of his independence of mind can be seen In a note on Bk. I, apropos of the poet's use of obsolete words (Life of Our Blessed Lord, 1697, p.27): It may be in vicious imitation of Milton and Spenser, he says in effect, but I have a fondness for old words, they please my ear, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> the reason I can give for employing them.|$|E
2500|$|Sackville-West {{loved to}} travel, {{frequently}} going to France, Spain and to visit Nicolson in Persia, and these trips were emotionally draining for Woolf, who missed Sackville-West intensely. Woolf's novel To the Lighthouse with its theme of longing {{for someone who}} is not there was inspired partly by the frequent absences of Sackville-West. Woolf was inspired by Sackville-West to write one of her most famous novels, , featuring a protagonist who changes sex over the centuries. This work was described by Sackville-West's son Nigel Nicolson as [...] "the longest and most charming love-letter in literature." [...] Unusually, Woolf documented the moment of the conception of Orlando: she wrote in her diary on 5 October 1927: [...] "And instantly the usual exciting devices enter my mind: a biography beginning in the year 1500 and continuing to the present day, called Orlando: Vita; only with a change about from one sex to the other" [...] (excerpt from her diary published posthumously by her husband Leonard Woolf). Woolf felt she needed Sackville-West's permission to write Orlando, asking in a letter: [...] "But listen, suppose Orlando turns out to be Vita and its all about you and the lusts of your flesh and the lure of your mind...Do you mind, say Yes or No?" [...] Reflecting Sackville-West's interest in the Romany, when Orlando goes to bed as a man and mysteriously wakes up as a woman in Constantinople (which is implied might have been the result of a spell cast by a Romany witch whom he married), it is at a Romany camp in the Balkans that Orlando is first welcomed and accepted as a woman, as the Romany in the novel make no distinctions between the sexes. [...] Ultimately Woolf satirizes Sackville-West's Romany fetish, as Orlando, an English aristocrat, prefers not to live in poverty as part of wandering Romany caravan in the Balkans, because the call of a settled life of the aristocracy at a country house in England proves to too strong for her, just as in real life Sackville-West fantasised about living the nomadic life of a Romany, but in reality preferred the settled life in the English countryside. [...] Orlando, which was intended as a fantasy where the character of Orlando (a stand-in for Sackville-West) inherits an estate not unlike Knole (which Sackville-West would have inherited as the eldest child if she had been a man) ironically marked the beginning of a tension between the two women. Sackville-West often complained in her letters that Woolf was more interested in writing a fantasy about her than in returning her gestures of affection in the real world. After finishing Orlando, Woolf wrote a letter to Sackville-West saying: [...] "For Promiscuous you are <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> to be said about it. Look in the Index of Orlando-after Pippin and see what comes next-Promiscuity passim". In another letter, Woolf warned Sackville-West: [...] "Yes, you are an agile animal-no doubt about it-but as to your gambols being diverting...I'm not so sure...I'm a fair-minded woman. You only be careful with your gamboling or you'll find Virginia's soft crevices lined with hooks".|$|E
