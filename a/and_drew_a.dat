5|$|From 2000 to 2011, {{the stadium}} was the almost-permanent home of Welsh football. The {{national}} team played {{the vast majority}} of home matches at the Millennium Stadium, with a handful of friendly matches {{once or twice a year}} at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham or Liberty Stadium, Swansea. The first Welsh football game at the stadium was played against Finland in 2000, <b>and</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> then-record home crowd for Welsh football of over 66,000. This has since been beaten on several occasions. However, since 2011, the majority of home games have been played at the smaller Cardiff City Stadium, the home of Cardiff City.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped the pistol <b>and</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E

When Prince Louis was serving with the Mediterranean Fleet, she spent some winters in Malta. In 1887, she contracted typhoid but, after being nursed through her illness by her husband, was sufficiently recovered by June to attend Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee celebrations in London. She was interested in science <b>and</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> detailed geological map of Malta and also participated in archaeological digs both {{on the island and}} in Germany.

5|$|An episode {{featuring}} a storyline about a school shooting garnered the series {{an all-time high}} audience of 930,000 Canadian viewers. A second episode with a storyline about oral sex also earned just under 1,000,000 viewers. Overall, the season averaged an audience of 600,000 and was the top domestic drama for Canadian teenagers aged 12 to 17, and adults in three age brackets; ages 18 to 34, ages 18 to 49, and ages 25 to 54. In the US, the season received an 80% larger audience compared to season three, and one episode received 540,000 viewers <b>and</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> Nielsen rating of 2.7 for teenagers and 4.7 for female teenagers, meaning that on average 2.7% of the nation's teenagers, and 4.7% of the nation's female teenagers were tuned in at any given moment.|$|E
5|$|D was {{a success}} in Japan. In total it sold one million copies there and the Saturn version {{reached the top of}} the sales charts in its first week. It was one of the few genuine hits for the 3DO in Japan, <b>and</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} cult following of hardcore fans even before being ported to other systems. A Japanese re-release for the 3DO titled D's Diner: Director's Cut contained additional content and a bonus soundtrack disc. The PlayStation release of D was set to be published by Acclaim and manufactured by Sony. Orders for around 100,000 units had already been made before Sony decided to give their other titles manufacturing priority. Sony told Eno they had only manufactured 40,000 units, which made Eno very upset, but ultimately, Sony had only manufactured 28,000 units. This shortage upset Eno so much that he later announced, at a Sony event, that he would release his next games for the Sega Saturn. WARP's later games, including those in the D series, Enemy Zero (1996) and D2 (1999), were released exclusively on Sega platforms.|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{attempted}} to hit every batter in the Cincinnati Reds lineup on May 1, 1974, {{as he was}} angry that the Pirates were intimidated by the Big Red Machine. Ellis admired Pete Rose and was concerned about how he would respond, but Ellis {{decided to do it}} regardless. Ellis hit Rose, Joe Morgan, and Dan Driessen {{in the top of the}} first inning. Cleanup batter Tony Pérez avoided Ellis' attempts <b>and</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> walk; the first pitch to Perez was thrown behind him and over his head. Ellis threw two pitches that he aimed at the head of Johnny Bench, at which point Ellis was removed from the game by manager Danny Murtaugh. Ellis' box score for the game reads as follows: 0 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 0 K. Ellis tied eight other players for the MLB record with the three hit batsmen in the inning.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{was accused}} (in a lawsuit brought by Mona Brewer against Earl Paulk of Chapel Hill Harvester Church) of using {{money from a}} $125 million green space bond sale to {{purchase}} a Decatur, GA church building from Paulk for $2.4 million, a sum claimed to be unjustifiably {{in excess of the}} land's actual value. The County made no use of the property, and was the building was later leased to a start-up cable network for a token sum of a dollar per year. During the ensuing court case, the plaintiff alleged that, as part of a questionable relationship, Paulk arranged for a sexual encounter between Jones and one of Paulk's former mistresses. When deposed, Jones refused to answer questions relating to that incident, {{as well as a number}} of other questions involving his dealings with Paulk. That case was ultimately withdrawn by the plaintiff's attorney, Louis Levenson, who felt that the judge in the case was biased against his client. The case was subsequently refiled <b>and</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> different judge.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of the opening against a {{world-class}} player was at Berlin in April 1918, a double round-robin tournament with four players: Akiba Rubinstein, Carl Schlechter, Jacques Mieses and Milan Vidmar. Vidmar had to play Black {{in the first round}} against Rubinstein, then ranked the fourth best player in the world with a very positional style. At a loss for what to play, he sought advice from his friend Abonyi, who showed him the Budapest Gambit and the main ideas the Hungarian players had found. Vidmar followed Abonyi's advice and beat Rubinstein convincingly in just 24 moves. This victory so heartened Vidmar that he {{went on to win the}} tournament, while Rubinstein was so demoralised by this defeat that he lost another game against Mieses <b>and</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> third one against Schlechter in the same opening.|$|E

25|$|The {{settlement}} of the first recording ban of 1942–43, leading {{to an increase in}} royalties paid to musicians, had a serious effect on the financial viability of the big bands, including Ellington's Orchestra.
