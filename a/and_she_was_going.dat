2500|$|Posing as {{a married}} couple, Argüello and Khaled boarded the plane using Honduran passports—having {{passed through a}} {{security}} check of their luggage—and were seated in the second row of tourist class. Once the plane was approaching the British coast, they drew their guns and grenades and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance. According to Khaled, {{in an interview in}} 2000,"So half an hour (after take off) we had to move. We stood up. I had my two hand grenades and I showed everybody I was taking the pins out with my teeth. Patrick stood up. We heard shooting just the same minute and when we crossed the first class, people were shouting but I didn't see who was shooting because it was behind us. So Patrick told me 'go forward I protect your back.' So I went and then he found a hostess <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to catch me round the legs. So I rushed, reached to the cockpit, it was closed. [...] So I was screaming 'open the door.' Then the hostess came; she said 'she has two hand grenades,' but they did not open (the cockpit door) and suddenly I was threatening to blow up the plane. I was saying 'I will count and if you don't open I will blow up the plane.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I know her," [...] Mr. Watson answered, [...] "too well. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> the Kaiser Wilhelm, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to rob me {{of twenty}} {{thousand}} pounds." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I may," [...] said Cecilia. She knew {{quite well}} {{that she would}} not. Nan would return to Campden on the special train, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> back west in three days.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not the}} footman who had {{answered}} the door, as usual, but Mrs. Carling's maid. She had taken the letters from the postman, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> away with them upstairs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; and Gwendoline {{went out}} just now {{to buy a}} few things, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to call round upon father when he has got his dinner cleared away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Compose yourself," [...] said my mother; [...] "Bridget's bundle <b>is</b> made up, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going.</b> I'm {{sorry for}} her too, poor thing; for she seemed anxious to keep the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She’s {{been with}} us these last two trips," [...] replied the mate. [...] "She’s had {{business}} to settle in London, <b>and</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>been</b> <b>going</b> through your lockers to clear up, like." ...|$|R
60|$|She met his eyes, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to {{make some}} rejoinder; but before she had time to speak, her mother's little, clear, conciliatory voice interposed. Mrs. Vivian appealed to her daughter, as she had done the night before.|$|E
6000|$|McEachern {{continued}} his drumming. [...] "Don't think there's been anything underhand about this," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "She absolutely {{refused to do}} anything unless you gave your consent. She said you had been partners all her life, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do the square thing by you." ...|$|E
6000|$|So Mr. Fotheringham {{could be}} in no real haste to be gone, and had only hurried away to avoid Theodora. However, {{there was no more}} musing time, the children's dinner was ready, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> down with the little girls, when her father entered. 'How is Arthur?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{other girl}} laughed. “I believe {{there were several}} Walthews, and Violet is, perhaps, proud of the connection,” <b>she</b> said. “They <b>are</b> an old family, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to marry one of them.” ...|$|R
50|$|Buffy {{fears that}} being the slayer means being alone, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> deserted by {{everyone}} <b>she</b> loves. This <b>is</b> a fear that Buffy struggles with throughout {{the remainder of the}} season and in future seasons.|$|R

60|$|This {{was in his}} coaxing voice; {{but it was not}} {{a moment}} when she could bear to be turned aside, like an importunate child, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to speak; but he saw the wrong fishing-rod carried out, called hastily to James, ran down-stairs, and was gone, without even looking back at her.|$|E
60|$|The magic lantern {{show was}} a splendid one. The views were good and the {{lecturer}} witty. We repeated his jokes to {{each other all the}} way home. Sara, who had not enjoyed the exhibition at all, seemed to feel more cheerful when it was over <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> home. The Story Girl on the contrary was gloomy.|$|E
6000|$|At twelve {{she put on}} her {{hat with}} two jabs of the hat-pins, and hastened to the {{elevator}}, exulting in freedom. The elevator was crowded with girls in new white frocks, voluble about their afternoon's plans. One of them carried a wicker suit-case.

6000|$|... "Yes, I know chatterboxes {{mean all}} right, but they forget. Now, Rose <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a great scholar <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> a lady, very quick, too; but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> awkward, now, <b>and</b> {{my little girl}} mustn't {{make it hard for}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ah! {{why did he}} ever wake? It was so real; he {{had seen}} her so plainly; it was life; it was the very smile she wore at Ducie; that sunny glance, so full of joy, beauty, and love, which he could live to gaze on! And now he was in prison, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be married to another. Oh! there are things in this world that may well break hearts! ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} {{there was a}} double {{excitement}} for her. She was going to hunt, from which scruples about propriety had threatened to hinder her, until {{it was found that}} Mrs. Torrington was horsewoman enough to accompany her--going to hunt {{for the first time since}} her escapade with Rex; <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> again to see Deronda, in whom, since last night, her interest had so gathered that she expected, as people do about revealed celebrities, to see something in his appearance which she had missed before.|$|E
60|$|Jane Lavinia went {{slowly over}} the bridge and up the lane. If only Aunt Rebecca {{had been a little}} sorry! But the morning was perfect and the air clear as crystal, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to New York, and fame and fortune were to be hers for the working. Jane Lavinia's spirits rose and bubbled over in a little trill of song. Then she stopped in dismay. She had {{forgotten}} her watch--her mother's little gold watch; she had left it on her dressing table.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Dave--Roger--what do you think!" [...] cried Laura.

6000|$|It was Tom's step, then, that Maggie {{heard on}} the stairs, when her need of love had triumphed over her pride, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> down with her swollen eyes and dishevelled hair to beg for pity. At least her father would stroke her head and say, [...] "Never mind, my wench." [...] It is a {{wonderful}} subduer, this need of love,--this hunger of the heart,--as peremptory as that other hunger by which Nature forces us {{to submit to the}} yoke, and change the face of the world.|$|E
6000|$|She {{went on with}} sobs, and now {{telling her}} story {{with a sort of}} fragmentary hurry: [...] "She went out bright and shining, out of this house for ever.

And somewhere she'd got a parcel of her things hidden to pick up, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> off--out of this house for ever!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I have a {{pleasant}} recollection of an incident {{so many years}} ago--when Madame Bernhardt came to Hartford, where I lived, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to play and the tickets were three dollars, {{and there were two}} lovely women--a widow and her daughter--neighbors of ours, highly cultivated ladies they were; their tastes were fine and elevated, but they were very poor, and they said [...] "Well, we must not spend six dollars on a pleasure of the mind, a pleasure of the intellect; we must spend it, if it must go at all, to furnish to somebody bread to eat." ...|$|E
