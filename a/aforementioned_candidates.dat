5000|$|On October 31, Cruz was {{a speaker}} at a Growth and Opportunity Party event in Iowa. It was commented that Cruz {{received}} the biggest showing {{of the ten}} candidates present at the event. In a poll released on November 2, Cruz came in second place for favorability among Iowans, only surpassed by Ben Carson. Two other polls released the same day showed Cruz in third place in Iowa at 15%, behind Donald Trump and Ben Carson. In a Quinnipiac University poll, noted by Fox News as having been taken after the CNBC debate, Cruz came in fourth place at 13%, behind the two <b>aforementioned</b> <b>candidates</b> and Marco Rubio. Cruz stated shortly after the poll {{that the possibility of}} Rubio and himself being the last candidates remaining in the crowded field was a [...] "plausible outcome." [...] Cruz received the most votes of any candidate in the field on Breitbart.com, which was held in the days following the CNBC debate.|$|E
30|$|Besides the <b>aforementioned</b> <b>candidate</b> gene studies, a {{genome-wide}} association {{study was}} conducted in 396 isolated ICTEV patients and 1000 controls of European descent to identify novel genes for ICTEV (Zhang et al. 2014). The selected genetic variants from the genome-wide association study were further replicated with an independent cohort of 370 isolated ICTEV cases and 363 controls with the same ethnicity. The genome-wide association and replication study found an intergenic SNP on chromosome 12 q 24.31 between NCOR 2 and ZNF 664 that was significantly associated with ICTEV. However, Additional suggestive SNPs (Hox Genes, PITX 1, TBX 4, FOXN 3, SORCS 1 and MMP 7 /TMEM 123) and identified pathways were not significant in the replication phase.|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{autoimmune}} {{thyroid disease}} (AITD) {{in which a}} number of autoantigens have been identified and characterized, the situation in thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is far from clear. A number of candidate antigens have been identified by probing Western blots of orbital tissue (OT) with sera from TAO patients, the most frequently cited being proteins of molecular weight 23, 28, 55, 64, 78 and 120 kilodaltons. In an attempt to identify autoantigens in TAO we have produced a lambda gt 11 human eye muscle expression library. This has been screened with sera from four patients with severe TAO whose antibodies bind {{to one or more}} of the <b>aforementioned</b> <b>candidate</b> antigens or to a thyroglobulin/acetylcholinesterase (Tg/Ache) shared epitope. Four clones were isolated and characterized; clone R 14 encodes the carboxyl terminal 193 amino acids of an IgE binding protein, clones R 10 and R 13 encode unknown proteins having significant similarity with heat shock protein 27 and the U 1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein respectively. Clone R 1 encodes an unknown peptide of 347 amino acids having no similarity with proteins in available data banks. R 1 clone affinity purified autoantibodies bind to a protein of Mr 78 kD in a Western blot of porcine eye muscle tissue. Autoantibodies to the R 1 recombinant lysogen were clearly demonstrated in 5 of 20 sera from Graves disease patients, its role merits further investigation. The possible relevance of these clones to the pathogenesis of TAO is discussed as well as the limitations of this type of approach in the identification of unknown autoantigens.

40|$|A lead {{slowing-down}} spectrometer (LSDS) {{system is}} a promising nondestructive assay technique that enables a quantitative measurement of the isotopic contents of major fissile isotopes in spent nuclear fuel and its pyroprocessing counterparts, such as 235 U, 239 Pu, 241 Pu, and, potentially, minor actinides. The LSDS system currently under development at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (Daejeon, Korea) is planned to utilize a high-flux (> 1012  n/cm 2 ·s) neutron source comprised of a high-energy (30  MeV) /high-current (∼ 2 A) electron beam and a heavy metal target, which results in a very intense and complex radiation field for the facility, thus demanding structural shielding to guarantee the safety. Optimization of the structural shielding design was conducted using MCNPX for neutron dose rate evaluation of several representative hypothetical designs. In order to satisfy the construction cost and neutron attenuation capability of the facility, while simultaneously achieving the aimed dose rate limit (< 0. 06  μSv/h), a few shielding materials [high-density polyethylene (HDPE) –Borax, B 4 C, and Li 2 CO 3] were considered for the main neutron absorber layer, which is encapsulated within the double-sided concrete wall. The MCNP simulation indicated that HDPE-Borax is the most efficient among the <b>aforementioned</b> <b>candidate</b> materials, and the combined thickness of the shielding layers should exceed 100  cm to satisfy the dose limit on the outside surface of the shielding wall of the facility when limiting {{the thickness of the}} HDPE-Borax intermediate layer to below 5  cm. However, the shielding wall must include the instrumentation and installation holes for the LSDS system. The radiation leakage through the holes was substantially mitigated by adopting a zigzag-shape with concrete covers on both sides. The suggested optimized design of the shielding structure satisfies the dose rate limit and can be used {{for the construction of a}} facility in the near future...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic framework {{to evaluate the}} performance of conservation voltage reduction (CVR) by determining suitable substations for CVR in operations planning. Existing CVR planning practice generally only focuses on the energy saving aspect without taking other underlying attributes into account, i. e., network topology and reduced voltage effects on other substations. To secure the desired operating reserve and avoid any adverse impacts, these attributes should be considered for implementing CVR more effectively. This research develops a practical decision-making framework based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to quantify several of the <b>aforementioned</b> attributes. <b>Candidate</b> substations for CVR deployment are prioritized such that performances are compared in terms of {{power transfer distribution factor}} (PTDF), voltage sensitivity factor (VSF), and CVR factor. In addition, to meet a specified reserve requirement, an integer programming approach is adopted to select potential substations for CVR implementations. Case studies for a Korean electric power system under diverse operating conditions are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|White spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV) is a pathogen {{that causes}} considerable mortality of the farmed shrimp, Penaeus monodon. Candidate ‘vaccines’, WSSV envelope protein VP 28 and formalin-inactivated WSSV, can provide short-lived {{protection against the}} virus. In this study, P. monodon was orally intubated with the <b>aforementioned</b> vaccine <b>candidates,</b> and protein expression in the gut of immunised shrimps was profiled. The alterations in protein profiles in shrimps infected orally with live-WSSV were also examined. Seventeen of the identified proteins in the vaccine and WSSV-intubated shrimps varied significantly compared {{to those in the}} control shrimps. These proteins, classified under exoskeletal, cytoskeletal, immune-related, intracellular organelle part, intracellular calcium-binding or energy metabolism, are thought to directly or indirectly affect shrimp's immunity. The changes in the expression levels of crustacyanin, serine proteases, myosin light chain, and ER protein 57 observed in orally vaccinated shrimp may probably be linked to immunoprotective responses. On the other hand, altered expression of proteins linked to exoskeleton, calcium regulation and energy metabolism in WSSV-intubated shrimps is likely to symbolise disturbances in calcium homeostasis and energy metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is {{the fourth}} most common cancer in the UK. Despite {{intensive}} research that identified the key driver mutations, the precise consequences of each mutation and how they modify therapeutic response is unclear. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that the serrated subgroup of CRC, which is driven by oncogenic KRAS or BRAF mutations, is associated with the poorest survival. Germline mutations in either Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and Liver kinase B 1 (LKB 1) cause intestinal hamartomas that can progress to CRC. However, there is an ongoing debate whether tumourigenesis arises from the epithelial or the mesenchymal compartment of the gut and the contribution of these mutations to sporadic CRC. The aim of this thesis was to: •	Address the role of Pten and Lkb 1 in the murine intestinal epithelium •	Determine if these mutations cooperate with other driver mutations such as Apc and KRas. •	Understand the mechanistic basis that drives changes in homeostasis and tumourigenesis. •	Use recently developed small molecule inhibitors that target these <b>aforementioned</b> <b>candidate</b> pathways. 	 Neither Pten nor Lkb 1 deficiency was sufficient to drive neoplasia in the murine intestinal epithelium. Loss of Pten in the murine epithelium does not alter intestinal homeostasis and appears to be redundant. Lkb 1 deficiency causes an expansion of the goblet cells linage and activation of the Hippo pathway but only when either KRas or Apc mutations are present does this result in accelerated tumourigenesis. Pten and KRas cause MAPK and PI 3 K pathway hyperactivation that results in hyperproliferation and serration of the murine gut. These precursor lesions are sensitive to MEK, PI 3 K/mTOR and surface Wnt inhibition. KRas driven tumours from either Lkb 1 or Pten deficient mice acquire a Wnt pathway hyperactivation that drives invasion and metastasis in mice and leads to resistance of PI 3 K/mTOR and surface WNT inhibition. Taken together my data has shown that KRAS mutation can initiate tumours via a serrated route which on the further deregulation of Wnt signalling convert to tumours resembling classical CRC. Importantly these tumours are now Wnt ligand independent and appear treatment resistant, analogous to the human tumours that are adenocarcinoma that bear a serrated signature. Importantly loss of either LKB 1 or PTEN accelerated tumourigenesis down either the serrated or the classical route and suggests key roles for these proteins in sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis. Given the drug resistance of our models, they could be utilized as excellent therapeutic testing models that may more closely recapitulate the human disease...|$|R
50|$|Interim {{head coach}} Lindsey Hunter was officially granted {{a chance to}} be interviewed by the Detroit Pistons to be their head coach on April 24, 2013, which led to {{indications}} that the Suns were looking for a new head coach. On May 9, 2013, the Suns announced that along with Hunter, assistant coaches Brian Shaw of the Indiana Pacers, Kelvin Sampson of the Houston Rockets, Mike Budenholzer of the San Antonio Spurs, and Quin Snyder from PBC CSKA Moscow were considered options to be the team's head coach for this season. Five days later, the Suns announced that their search would expand to also include assistant head coaches Mike Malone of the Golden State Warriors, David Fizdale of the Miami Heat, and Jeff Hornacek of the Utah Jazz, with the latter assistant also being a Suns fan favorite. In addition to the <b>aforementioned</b> announced <b>candidates,</b> the Suns also announced interest in looking at Los Angeles Lakers assistant coach Steve Clifford, Houston Rockets assistant coach J.B. Bickerstaff, Villanova University head coach Jay Wright, Butler University head coach Brad Stevens, and Iowa State University head coach Fred Hoiberg. On May 26, 2013, the Suns announced that former Suns player Jeff Hornacek was the new head coach, to replace interim head coach Lindsey Hunter, who later signed with the Golden State Warriors in September 2013 as an assistant head coach. Hornacek got a three-year contract with an optional fourth year.|$|R

What's more, because I must strive for accuracy, I will go ahead and correct the mathematical errors of the <b>aforementioned</b> weak <b>candidate</b> right now. It was said that I have four mistresses, but actually I have five. Confusing four with five ought to be considered shameful even for a first grader. It seems like he failed to count one.

40|$|Several radiolabeled {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) {{have been}} used as radioimmunotherapy (RIT) agents for cancer therapy. The use of mAbs as RIT agents is due to their ability to carry effectors, in the form of radionuclides which emit alpha (α) particles, beta (β) particles, or auger electrons, and bind specifically to cancer expressed receptor. This paper reports the preparation of radiolabelled trastuzumab in form of (177 Lu-DOTA) m -PAMAM G 3 -F(ab') 2 -trastuzumab, which will be expected as a potential RIT agent for therapy of breast cancer overexpressed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2). Due to its reduced molecular weight, the use of F(ab') 2 -trastuzumab on the <b>aforementioned</b> RIT agent <b>candidate</b> is expected to reach its target much faster compared to the intact trastuzumab. Meanwhile, the role of PAMAM G 3 is to increase the specific activity of the radiotherapeutic agent of Lu- 177 due to the ability of its 32 –NH 2 functional groups that are able to bind many DOTAs (£ 31) which in turn can bind a large number of 177 Lu. The preparation was initiated by fragmentation of trastuzumab using pepsin enzyme in 0. 02 M acetic acid buffer with a pH of 4. 5 to produce F(ab') 2 -trastuzumab with a purity of 95 % after purification with PD- 10 column. The F(ab') 2 -trastuzumab was then reacted with succinimidyl 4 -(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane- 1 -carboxylate (SMCC) to produce SMCC-F(ab') 2 -trastuzumab. The next reaction was to conjugate SMCC-F(ab') 2 -trastuzumab with DOTA-PAMAM G 3. 0 -SH, which was prepared by reaction NHS-DOTA with PAMAM G 3. 0 and followed by reacting it with 2 -iminothiolane to give (DOTA) m -PAMAM G 3. 0 -F(ab') 2 -trastuzumab. Finally, the (DOTA) m -PAMAM G 3. 0 -F(ab') 2 -trastuzumab was radiolabelled with 177 Lu to produce (177 Lu-DOTA) m -PAMAM G 3. 0 -F(ab') 2 -trastuzumab, resulting in a radiochemical purity of 98 % after purification with PD- 10 column.
