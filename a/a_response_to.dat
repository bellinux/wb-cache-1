5|$|Fishing {{regulations}} include catch {{limits and}} gear restrictions to prevent {{damage to the}} species habitat and population. There are different gear restrictions for commercial and recreational fishers. In 2007, regulations were imposed to reduce the harvesting by one third, as <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> overfishing in the South Atlantic. The South Atlantic catch limit was later increased in October 2012 as <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the increased population. The 2013 limits in the southern U.S. Atlantic waters for the species, measured in gutted weight, is currently 405,971 pounds for longline and 135,324 pounds for hook-and-line fishing.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that increased competition due {{to the evolution of}} key innovations among other groups, perhaps as <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> predation, drove the Ediacaran biota from their niches.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's {{power base}} was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a {{resolution}} in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E

5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> {{the poor}} {{reception}} and {{claims that the}} system could not handle the original game, Simon Thomley, who later assisted {{with the development of}} the 2013 mobile port, released an unofficial, proof-of-concept version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the system.

5|$|Beginning {{with this}} ceremony, the AMPAS music branch divided the {{category}} of Best Original Score into two categories: Best Dramatic Score and Best Musical or Comedy Score. This was seen as <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the dominance of Walt Disney Feature Animation films in the Original Score and Original Song categories in recent years. Four years later, the two scoring categories were merged back into one category.|$|E
5|$|Dejection was <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> Wordsworth's Immortality Ode. It conveys {{feelings}} of dejection, expressed through {{an inability to}} write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E

30|$|Number {{of days of}} {{vomiting}} or nausea {{per week}} {{was derived from the}} first and second item. If a subject provided <b>a</b> valid <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the severity of nausea question that was >[*] 0 but did not provide <b>a</b> valid <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the vomiting-episode question, this day was counted as a day of nausea/vomiting. If a subject provided <b>a</b> valid <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the vomiting-episode question that was >[*] 0 but did not provide <b>a</b> valid <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the nausea-severity question, this day was counted as a day of nausea/vomiting. If the answer to the number of vomiting episodes was 99 (the maximum allowable value on the eDiary spinner), then the data were considered missing.|$|R
5|$|Female taiko {{performance}} has {{also served as}} <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> gendered stereotypes of Japanese women as being quiet, subservient, or a femme fatale.

5|$|For the Papuan Campaign, MacArthur awarded Blamey the American Distinguished Service Cross, and Blamey {{was created}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire on 28 May 1943. This was unusual {{as it was}} the Australian Labor Party's policy not to award knighthoods, but was done as <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the British government's awards to British and American {{officers}} for the North African campaign. Blamey's and Herring's knighthoods would be the last that the Labor government would award to Australian soldiers.|$|E
5|$|From 1530, {{the colonists}} became the arbiters of power, {{installing}} and deposing governors. Spanish government in Honduras was riven by factionalism. As <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> the growing anarchy, the colonists requested that Pedro de Alvarado intervene. Alvarado arrived in 1536, {{put an end}} to the political infighting, and gained an important victory over Sicumba, a Maya leader in the Ulúa valley. Alvarado founded two towns that later became important, San Pedro de Puerto Caballos (later to become San Pedro Sula) and Gracias a Dios.|$|E
50|$|Although some {{observers}} attribute nocebo responses (or placebo <b>responses)</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> subject's gullibility, {{there is no}} evidence that an individual who manifests <b>a</b> nocebo/placebo <b>response</b> <b>to</b> one treatment will manifest <b>a</b> nocebo/placebo <b>response</b> <b>to</b> any other treatment; i.e., there is no fixed nocebo/placebo-responding trait or propensity.|$|R

5|$|In late June 2006, before Booker took office, New Jersey {{investigators}} foiled a plot {{to assassinate}} Booker led by Bloods gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons.

40|$|Three {{children}} {{and two young}} adults with severe asthma who had frequent episodes of respiratory failure were studied. Isocapnic hypoxia and hyperoxic hypercapnia were produced separately using a rebreathing apparatus. Alveolar carbon dioxide tension and oxygen tension were estimated by continuously sampling expired gases. The three young children had <b>a</b> diminished <b>response</b> <b>to</b> hypoxia but <b>a</b> normal <b>response</b> <b>to</b> hypercapnia when compared to control asthmatic children (p less than 0. 05) or healthy children (p less than 0. 05). The two young adult patients had <b>a</b> normal <b>response</b> <b>to</b> hypoxia but one had <b>a</b> low <b>response</b> <b>to</b> hypercapnia. Studies of parents of these patients suggested that the chance combination of a possibly familial, inappropriate <b>response</b> <b>to</b> hypoxia with severe asthma {{would lead to a}} risk of respiratory failure...|$|R

5|$|Locusts are the {{swarming}} {{phase of}} certain species of short-horned grasshoppers {{in the family}} Acrididae. Swarming behaviour is <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. This causes the grasshopper to change colour, feed more and breed faster. The transformation of a solitary individual into a swarming one is induced by several contacts per minute over a short period.|$|E
