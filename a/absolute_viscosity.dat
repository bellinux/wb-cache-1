50|$|Simple {{atomization}} {{techniques are}} available in which liquid metal is forced through an orifice at a sufficiently high velocity to ensure turbulent flow. The usual performance index used is the Reynolds number R = fvd/n, where f = fluid density, v = velocity of the exit stream, d = diameter of the opening, and n = <b>absolute</b> <b>viscosity.</b> At low R the liquid jet oscillates, but at higher velocities the stream becomes turbulent and breaks into droplets. Pumping energy is applied to droplet formation with very low efficiency (on the order of 1%) and control over the size distribution of the metal particles produced is rather poor. Other techniques such as nozzle vibration, nozzle asymmetry, multiple impinging streams, or molten-metal injection into ambient gas are all available to increase atomization efficiency, produce finer grains, and to narrow the particle size distribution. Unfortunately, {{it is difficult to}} eject metals through orifices smaller than a few millimeters in diameter, which in practice limits the minimum size of powder grains to approximately 10 μm. Atomization also produces a wide spectrum of particle sizes, necessitating downstream classification by screening and remelting a significant fraction of the grain boundary.|$|E

The <b>absolute</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the different vegetable oils were determined using a Lamy Viscometer RM 100, a rotating viscometer with coaxial cylinder. The torque of each sample at different temperatures was recorded at different shear rates.

40|$|The {{theory of}} the {{measurement}} of the <b>absolute</b> <b>viscosity</b> (the' ratio of shearing stress to rate of shear) of instantaneously thixotropic fluids from flow along a tube and from flow between concentric cylinders makes assumptions requiring critical examination. An instrument using flow along a tube is suitable only for instantaneously thixotropic fluids: an instrument using flow between concentric cylinders is also suitable for normally thixotropic fluids. The design of these instruments is particularly related, "both to the conditions necessary for {{the validity of the}} given theory and to the characteristics of the fluids used. The usually accepted treatment of the tube flow is in error if the fluid has a yield value. The fluids used, ball-mill dispersions of solid particles in liquid media, have static and dynamic yield values that are different, and this necessitates a special measuring procedure in both instruments. The relation between the rate of shear and the shearing stress determined by either instrument is the same within the limits of experimental error: this error is small so that the validity of the methods of measurement is demonstrated. The dynamic yield values of these fluids are independent of temperature, but the <b>absolute</b> <b>viscosity</b> at any given shearing stress (including the limiting viscosity for high rates of shear measured in another instrument of the concentric cylinder type) varies as the viscosity of the medium.

Examination of the experimental results shows that the curve relating fluid resistance to Reynolds number has a form very similar to that for a single sphere moving in an infinite fluid, although the discontinuities which are present in the latter curve at the critical value of the Reynolds number are absent in the former; that the effects of the walls of the container are negligible; that the resistance to flow is accurately proportional to depth of bed, and that the hydraulic resistance varies inversely as the fourth power of the voidage of the bed approximately, for beds of normal density of packing, although the value of the index varies with the value of the voidage. The evidence also indicates that the hydraulic resistance is not accurately defined by the mean value of the voidage, but is subject to considerable variations due to the statistical nature of a bed, and that the effect of the walls of the container may be computed on the assumption of flow through a pair of parallel channels of different hydraulic resistance...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} {{time-dependent}} models of mantle upwellings above a cold downwelling in the New Zealand-Antarctica region since 80 Ma can explain anomalous geophysical observations: ~ 1. 0 km of positive residual bathymetry at the Antarctica margin, a large Ross Sea geoid low, 0. 5 – 0. 9 km of excess tectonic subsidence of the Campbell Plateau since 80 Ma, and several seismic wave speed anomalies. Model {{results indicate that}} the largest mantle upwelling, centered in the Ross Sea, has an average temperature anomaly of 200 °C and density anomaly of 0. 6 %, and it rose from midmantle depths at 80 Ma to a present depth of 400 – 1000 km. Anomalous Campbell Plateau subsidence requires a smaller hot anomaly evolving within the upper mantle under the region of the reconstructed Late Cretaceous Campbell Plateau. The excess subsidence of the plateau results from northward drift of New Zealand away from the dynamic topography high created by the smaller hot anomaly. To fit present-day geoid and residual topography observations, we require a large lower:upper mantle viscosity ratio of 100 : 1.

40|$|Perturbation viscometry is a {{recently}} developed method which measures the logarithmic gradient of the viscosity-composition curve for gas mixtures using {{a variant of}} capillary-tube viscometry. A gas mixture flowing through a capillary has its composition perturbed {{by the addition of}} a small flow of gas, normally one of the pure components of the gas mixture. Two pressure changes, the first due to the change in flowrate and second due to the change in viscosity are seen at the capillary. The logarithmic viscosity gradient is calculated from the ratio of these two pressure changes. Integration of logarithmic viscosity gradients measured for the full composition range yields the mixture viscosity relative to the viscosity of either component of the gas mixture. This method is attractive because, for measurements of equal precision, integration of the gradients is potentially much more precise than conventional methods that measure the <b>absolute</b> <b>viscosities</b> directly. Integration of the logarithmic viscosity gradients could be accomplished either by application of the trapezium rule or numerical integration of a polynomial fitted to the data. Here a method with better theoretical foundations is presented. The method fits a differential form of the Sutherland equation to the logarithmic viscosity gradients. The fitted parameters of the equation are then used to generate the viscosity ratios by substitution into the normal form of the Sutherland equation. The quality of fit obtained may be used to test of the consistency of the experimental data. Experimental data gathered for the mixtures argon-nitrogen, helium-argon and helium-nitrogen at 98. 5 °C are analysed using this procedure. The internal consistency of the data is checked by direct comparison of calculated values for the gradients generated from the fitted Sutherland parameters with actual experimental data. The calculated relative viscosities are compared with extant data and theoretical predictions and show good agreement. Also the calculated Sutherland parameters are well within the scatter of the parameters obtained from alternative sources...|$|R
