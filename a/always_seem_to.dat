5|$|Dr. Paul Steiner (Bryant Haliday) and Dr. Christopher Mitchell (Ronald Allen) {{work on a}} {{projection}} device {{that enables them to}} transmit any object within a few miles of the machine. While they find the device works with inanimate objects, the living creatures they use it on <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> die. When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think the problem has been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E
5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E

25|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{faced in}} determining {{a theory of}} anaphora that properly encompasses bound variable pronouns is properly determining the definition of bound. As previously stated, a bound variable pronoun {{is said to be}} bound if it is c-commanded by its antecedent. In many cases, this definition makes correct predictions about the availability of bound variable interpretations. However, as in the example below, this requirement does not <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> work.|$|E

Poirot however is convinced that Hugh is sane and begins his investigations, asking Diana to arrange for him {{to spend the night}} in the manor. He searches Hugh's room and also makes a trip to a local chemist, supposedly to pick up a toothbrush.|$|E
25|$|The {{new record}} is coming along great! The new jams are high energy, and are gonna be a blast to play live. We're working on really using all three vocals, which {{we used to}} do a bit more in the early days and works great, and people <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> want more of, so that will be fun. But mostly I expect a great Dillinger Four record: fun, fast-paced, great change-ups and a couple songs on this one where it's a bit {{different}} than stuff we've done before.|$|E

25|$|The duo, usually led by Tom, {{were known}} for rants on {{the evils of}} the {{internal}} combustion engine, people who talk on mobile phones while driving, Peugeots, women named Donna who <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> drive Chevrolet Camaros, lawyers, the clever use of the English language, people who choose to live in Alaska (or similar snowy, icy climates), and practically anything else, including themselves. They had a relaxed and humorous approach to cars, car repair, cup holders, pets, lawyers, car repair mechanics, SUVs, and almost everything else. They often cast a critical, jaundiced insider's eye toward the auto industry. Tom and Ray were committed {{to the values of}} defensive driving and environmentalism.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, intense {{feelings}} of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be present, {{as much as}} it is actually present and experienced from past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or flashbacks may haunt the person, and nightmares may be frequent. Insomnia may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generations, thus making genetics as one of the components of the causes of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.|$|E

500|$|... "I {{was stunned}} by their performance" [...] was Sinden's assessment.

[...] "They are always moving, never standing around, they head-man the puck as well as anyone has ever done — and they <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be in the right place." [...] According to Canada's goaltender Ken Dryden: [...] "We didn't play our game at all. After they tied it up, we started playing a panic type of game. Sometimes there were five men going for the puck at once." [...] At the end of the game, Team Canada accidentally snubbed the Soviets by returning to the dressing room directly without shaking hands with the Soviets after the game.|$|E
500|$|Poniewozik {{notes that}} [...] "It also remains {{a delight to}} watch Spacey pump the humid breath of life into House of Cards’ arid Capitol chill. If only his {{character}} weren’t so dominant of his surroundings as well. One reason the series’ movements can feel so mechanical is that, so far, no one seems nearly in Underwood’s league: not the adversaries he battles directly, nor the sad sacks that he gulls without their even knowing it." [...] Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News notes that the preview episodes show that [...] "Frank's [...] "Survivor"-like back-stabbing is beginning to feel a bit repetitive." [...] and that his lack of an adversarial foil has become an issue: [...] "...things <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> fall neatly into place for him. Even his showdowns with the president (Michel Gill) come off as one-sided..." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday notes that [...] "Frank Underwood has no remorse, no superannuated sense of Washington tradition or decorum, and certainly no second thoughts. He is TV's perfect monster of the moment - a compleat malefactor, with a pleasing honey-toned drawl." ...|$|E
500|$|Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club {{suggested}} that the influence of Endtroducing..... {{may have had a}} negative effect on the album itself, saying that it [...] "has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn." [...] The album's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to [...] "repeat Endtroducing..... over and over again". Despite this, DJ Shadow {{has made it clear that}} he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album's praise: [...] "...people <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never felt that way. I think that I have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then so be it, that's cool." [...] As of April 26, 2005, Endtroducing..... has sold upwards of 290,000 copies in the United States alone.|$|E

He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "It's one thing to get back to Victory Lane, but to do it at Talladega wow." [...] "I've wanted to win here for so long. This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes to show you how much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E
500|$|Within {{an hour of}} pre-order availability, Dark Before Dawn reached No. 1 on {{the rock}} albums chart on iTunes and No. 3 on the overall album chart.

It achieved gold certification on August 18, 2016. The disc's lead single [...] "Failure" [...] spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Songs chart as well. Billboards Jason Lipshutz felt the album's success was [...] "eyebrow-raising", noting that, {{in addition to the}} band's lineup change, [...] "135,000 in pure album sales is a hefty number in 2015 – it's a bigger number than the respective bows of recent Madonna, ASAP Rocky, and Kelly Clarkson albums". Joe DeTomaso, program director of active rock station WAQX-FM, added that, [...] "They've always been a top-level band for the format, but not quite on the level of Disturbed or Shinedown or bands like that. They <b>always</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> put out hit records without getting the kind of recognition that they deserved." [...] Forbes Hugh McIntyre writes that runner-up Tori Kelly's 75,000 copies [...] "puts Breaking Benjamin's figures into perspective" [...] and that despite [...] "a pretty extensive lineup change, it looks like fans were awaiting their return with open arms." ...|$|E
