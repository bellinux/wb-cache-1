5|$|The conquests {{were made}} behind <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> {{subordination}} to Rome. Zenobia issued coins {{in the name}} of Claudius' successor Aurelian, with Vaballathus depicted as king; since Aurelian was occupied with repelling insurgencies in Europe, he tolerated the Palmyrene coinage and encroachments. In late 271, Vaballathus and his mother assumed the titles of Augustus (emperor) and Augusta.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh displayed <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E

25|$|The deities were housed {{inside the}} temple, {{shielded}} {{from the outside}} by curtains. The idol of Huitzilopochtli was modeled from amaranth seeds held together with honey and human blood. Inside of him were bags containing jade, bones and amulets to give life to the god. This figure was constructed annually and it was richly dressed and fitted with <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> gold for his festival held during the Aztec month of Panquetzaliztli. At {{the end of the}} festival, the image was broken apart and shared among the populace to be eaten.|$|E

25|$|On {{the same}} spur, {{immediately}} east of Temple VII and also facing north, is Temple VI, or Andews' Temple. During the first constructive stage identified at Comalcalco, the upper structure had mud walls. Later, it {{was replaced by}} two rectangular rooms made of bricks. The upper structure is the same design as that of Temples I, V and VII. In {{the remains of the}} central stairway, archaeologist Román Piña Chán discovered <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> the sun God Kinich Ahau in stucco. The mask is still visible to visitors and has earned the temple the nickname Temple of the Mask.|$|E
500|$|Gavin Long {{noted that}} Vasey was [...] "highly strung, thrustful, hard working... {{concealed}} a deeply emotional even sentimental nature behind <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> laconic and blunt speech. Although {{he was appointed}} to head the administrative staff there burned within him a desire to lead Australian troops as a commander." [...] Nonetheless, Vasey remained AA during the Battle of Bardia. Following the capture of Tobruk in January 1941, he replaced Frank Berryman as GSO1.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{cartoons}} Davenport drew during the 1896 campaign were simple in execution and somber in mood. One, for example, depicts Hanna walking down Wall Street, bags {{of money in}} each hand and a grin on his face. [...] Another shows only Hanna's hand and wrist—and McKinley dangling from his fob chain. [...] One that {{is intended to be}} funny depicts McKinley as a small boy accompanied by Hanna as nursemaid; McKinley tugs at Hanna's skirts, wanting to go into a shop where the labor vote is for sale. [...] Another shows Hanna wearing a Napoleon hat (McKinley was said to resemble the late emperor), raising <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> McKinley's face to his own.|$|E

500|$|Statues in {{the park}} include a bronze statue of Hiawatha {{carrying}} Minnehaha created by Jacob Fjelde. [...] It was created for the Columbian Exposition in 1893 {{and moved to the}} park in 1912. [...] Other statues commemorate several notable figures including John H. Stevens, the first authorized resident on {{the west bank of the}} Mississippi River in what would become Minneapolis. He was granted permission to occupy the site, then part of the Fort Snelling military reservation, in exchange for providing ferry service to St. Anthony across the river. A statue of Swedish musician and poet Gunnar Wennerberg was placed {{in the park}} in 1915. <b>A</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> Dakota leader Taoyateduta (Little Crow) was placed overlooking the falls in 1992.|$|E
500|$|The Arabian {{milestones}} {{presented the}} Palmyrene king as a Roman governor and commander, referring {{to him as}} vir clarissimus rex consul imperator dux Romanorum. The assumption of such titles was probably meant to legitimize Zenobia's control of the province, not yet a usurpation of the imperial title. Until now, Zenobia could {{say that she was}} acting {{as a representative of the}} emperor (who was securing the eastern lands of the empire) while the Roman monarch was preoccupied with struggles in Europe. Although Vaballathus' use of the titles amounted to a claim to the imperial throne, Zenobia could still justify them and maintain <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> subordination to Rome; an [...] "imperator" [...] was a commander of troops, not the equal of an emperor ("imperator caesar").|$|E
500|$|Walton's first {{successful}} large-scale concert work, the Viola Concerto (1929) is {{in marked contrast}} to the raucous Portsmouth Point; despite the common influence of jazz and of the music of Hindemith and Ravel, in its structure and romantic longing it owes much to the Elgar Cello Concerto. In this work, wrote Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor in The Record Guide, [...] "the lyric poet in Walton, who had so far been hidden under <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> irony, fully emerged." [...] Walton followed this pattern in his two subsequent concertos, for Violin (1937) and for Cello (1956). Each opens reflectively, is in three movements, and contrasts agitated and jagged passages with warmer romantic sections. The Cello Concerto is more introspective than the two earlier concertos, with a ticking rhythm throughout the work suggesting the inexorable passage of time.|$|E

500|$|Due to Duchovny's contract, he {{was only}} {{available}} for shooting on certain days. Spotnitz commented on the irony of [...] "paying all this money to get [...] services for a limited time" [...] only to have him {{spend most of the}} episode [...] "in a hospital bed, semi-dead". He later lamented the limited access to Duchovny as it prevented the [...] "most satisfying use of the actor or character". Some scenes featuring Mulder were filmed using different people. For instance, the scene of Mulder's exhumation was filmed with a double who wore <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> Duchovny's face. Head make-up artist Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf later said [...] "It was brilliant, because nobody knew that." [...] For the shots of the stunt double as well as Duchovny later in the episode, she used egg whites and a facial mask to give Mulder's skin a [...] "really cool, old, dried-up cracked skin effect." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{these visits}} and {{especially}} in public, Rimsky-Korsakov wore <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> geniality. Privately, he found the situation emotionally complex, and confessed his fears to his friend, the Moscow critic Semyon Kruglikov. Memories persisted of the tension between Tchaikovsky and The Five over the differences in their musical philosophies—tension acute enough for Tchaikovsky's brother Modest to liken their relations {{at that time to}} [...] "those between two friendly neighboring states... cautiously prepared to meet on common ground, but jealously guarding their separate interests". Rimsky-Korsakov observed, not without annoyance, how Tchaikovsky became increasingly popular among Rimsky-Korsakov's followers. This personal jealousy was compounded by a professional one, as Tchaikovsky's music became increasingly popular among the composers of the Belyayev circle, and remained on the whole more famous than his own. Even so, when Tchaikovsky attended Rimsky-Korsakov's nameday party in May 1893, Rimsky-Korsakov asked Tchaikovsky personally if he would conduct four concerts of the Russian Musical Society in Saint Petersburg the following season. After hesitation, Tchaikovsky agreed. While his sudden death in late 1893 prevented him from fulfilling this commitment in its entirety, the list of works he had planned to conduct included Rimsky-Korsakov's Third Symphony.|$|E
500|$|The Foxtrot tour covered Europe and North America from September 1972 to August 1973. The {{show at the}} National Stadium in Dublin on 28 September 1972 {{marked the}} debut of Gabriel wearing a costume on stage, {{something}} that surprised the other band members as they were kept uninformed. Originally suggested by Charisma booking agent Paul Conroy, Gabriel went off stage during an instrumental section in [...] "The Musical Box" [...] and reappeared in his wife's red dress and a fox's head. The incident resulted in front cover reports in the music press, allowing the band to double their performance fee. [...] In December 1972, Stratton-Smith organised the band's first gigs in the US with a show at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts and Philharmonic Hall in New York City with openers String Driven Thing, in aid of the United Cerebral Palsy Fund. They were well received despite the band complaining of technical issues. Gabriel's costumes expanded in the following months to include fluorescent face paint and a cape fitted with bat wings for [...] "Watcher of the Skies", several guises throughout [...] "Supper's Ready", and <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> an old man for [...] "The Musical Box". An album of recordings from the following UK leg, initially recorded for the American radio program King Biscuit Flower Hour, was released as Genesis Live in July 1973.

2500|$|Instructions (statements) in {{assembly}} language are generally very simple, unlike those in high-level languages. Generally, a mnemonic is a symbolic {{name for a}} single executable machine language instruction (an opcode), and {{there is at least}} one opcode mnemonic defined for each machine language instruction. Each instruction typically consists of an operation or opcode plus zero or more operands. Most instructions refer to a single value, or a pair of values. [...] Operands can be immediate (value coded in the instruction itself), registers specified in the instruction or implied, or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage. This is determined by the underlying processor architecture: the assembler merely reflects how this architecture works. Extended mnemonics are often used to specify a combination of an opcode with a specific operand, e.g., the System/360 assemblers use [...] as an extended mnemonic for [...] with <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> 15 and [...] ("NO OPeration" [...] – do nothing for one step) for [...] with <b>a</b> <b>mask</b> <b>of</b> 0.|$|E
