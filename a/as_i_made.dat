5|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> {{clear in}} my {{telegram}} to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs {{me that the}} rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. Therefore, I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.|$|E
2500|$|Lane {{was adopted}} and raised by Ella Lane, {{who also had}} four other children. As a youth in Austin, Lane grew up poor, busing tables at local hotels and shining shoes on Congress Avenue. [...] He also helped his mother with a laundry {{business}} {{she ran out of}} the home. [...] Lane became known as [...] "Cue Ball" [...] and later recalled how he acquired the nickname: [...] "I was in a pool hall in 12th street. We were playing for money, maybe a dime. As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the eight ball, the other guy took off running. He didn't want to pay. I grabbed that cue ball and just as he made the corner I threw it and hit him upside the head. The guy didn't know what had hit him." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{spending}} 10 {{months as}} a trainee, IU released [...] "Lost Child" [...] (...) as her first single. She performed the song {{live for the}} first time on the music program, M! Countdown, on September 18, 2008, making it her debut performance as a professional singer. Regarding the performance, IU recalled the crowd had hurled insults at her and though she felt discouraged by it, she now considers it a beneficial experience. [...] "Lost Child" [...] is the lead single from her debut extended play Lost and Found, which was released on September 24, 2008. For the album, IU was awarded the [...] "Rookie of the Month" [...] by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in November 2008. However, the album did not do well commercially. During an interview in 2011, IU said, [...] "My first album failed, but I'm grateful for that. If I had become successful as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> my debut, I wouldn't appreciate my staff members and the popularity that I'm enjoying now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Three days later, {{mounted on}} my stately gray [...] "Ladrone," [...] I led my little pack-train out of Ashcroft, bound for Teslin Lake, some twelve hundred {{miles to the}} Northwest. It was a lovely spring afternoon, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> rode <b>I</b> <b>made</b> some rhymes to express my feeling of exultation.|$|R
60|$|I {{agreed with}} the old man, and {{dismissed}} him. So {{soon as he was}} gone, I quitted my chamber, and all dust staineded <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>I</b> <b>made</b> my way down to the garden. A turn in one of the boxwood-bordered alleys brought me suddenly face to face with Madonna Paola.|$|R
60|$|Quick <b>as</b> {{lightning}} <b>I</b> <b>made</b> a feint at his head; {{as quickly}} he gave ground, {{and at the}} same time I saw a pistol glitter in his hand.|$|R
2500|$|Members of Image Ten were {{involved}} in filming and post-production, participating in loading camera magazines, gaffing, constructing props, recording sounds and editing. Production stills were shot and printed by Karl Hardman, who stated {{in an interview that}} a [...] "number of cast members formed a production line in the darkroom for developing, washing and drying of the prints <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the exposures. As I recall, I shot over 1,250 pictures during the production". Upon completion of post-production, Image Ten found it difficult to secure a distributor willing to show the film with the gruesome scenes intact. Columbia and American International Pictures declined after requests to soften it and re-shoot the final scene were rejected by producers. Romero admitted that [...] "none of us wanted to do that. We couldn't imagine a happy ending.... Everyone want a Hollywood ending, but we stuck to our guns". The Manhattan-based Walter Reade Organization agreed to show the film uncensored, but changed the title from Night of the Flesh Eaters to Night of the Living Dead because a film had already been produced under a similar title to the former. While changing the title, the copyright notice was accidentally deleted from the early releases of the film.|$|E
60|$|One end of him rose a little, {{the other}} end wagged gently, but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> no further remark, both ends subsided.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> no reply, {{she gently}} took my hands within her own, removed them from my face, and fixed her eyes steadfastly on mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "But it {{was such}} a simple thing," [...] Hector said. [...] "It was merely a reconnaissance, such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> scores of times in Italy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, good heavens, {{you talk}} <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> <b>made</b> {{a habit of}} {{blacking}} up! You talk as if you expected {{me to come to}} the altar smothered in burnt cork." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{never put}} out, Miss Rowley," [...] {{said the old}} lady, [...] "as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am <b>made</b> to think that what I do is taken in good part." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> my {{way through}} the grounds I saw Audrey in the distance, walking with the Nugget. I avoided them and went on into the house.|$|E
60|$|Then, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> no remarks or suggestions, the {{messenger}} departed, {{saying that he}} would return on the morrow to lead me {{to the place of}} trial.|$|E
60|$|I was {{not half}} {{so sure of}} this <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> him think; but {{it gave him a}} great deal of comfort, and he went off very much enlivened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing immediately, sir," [...] said he, rather abashed; [...] "but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> up my {{mind about}} Mary Thorne,--quite made {{up my mind}}, I think it right to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jest <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> up my {{mind this}} noon that I'd let Sam Barney lug me off to jail rather than stay any longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Richard," [...] she said, [...] "I believe I {{have loved}} you always. If I have been wilful and wicked, I have {{suffered}} {{more than you}} know--even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> you suffer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little Julie," [...] he said, [...] "you are a brick. Don't you bother about me. It isn't {{quite so}} bad <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> out--only don't {{tell your mother}} that." ...|$|E
60|$|Glancing round <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> a {{suitable}} reply, I {{observed that the}} family effects were already packed, and {{that the amount of}} luggage was by no means overwhelming. I congratulated Mrs. Micawber on the approaching change.|$|E
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> {{my fourth}} journey I caught {{the sound of}} a distant tumult, the shouts of war, the screams of agony, and above them all the well-remembered cry of [...] "Valhalla! Valhalla! Victory or Valhalla!" ...|$|E
6000|$|It was now {{suggested}} that I {{should attempt to}} influence the patient's arm, <b>as</b> heretofore. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the attempt and failed. Dr. F--then intimated a desire to have me put a question. <b>I</b> did so, <b>as</b> follows: ...|$|R
60|$|But {{all this}} time we had no girl, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>made</b> up my mind about the matter, I {{naturally}} grew impatient, and at last I determined {{to go and get}} a girl myself.|$|R
60|$|LARRY. <b>I</b> talk <b>as</b> <b>I</b> think. You've <b>made</b> a {{very good}} match, let me tell you.|$|R
60|$|I had {{not been}} mistaken. A moment later a dark figure loomed {{up out of the}} darkness, and the exclamation which greeted me, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> my {{presence}} known, showed that I had taken him by surprise.|$|E
60|$|But I {{was already}} pulling {{out into the}} stream. He {{continued}} to shout after me, and presently I saw the two joined by Booth, and all watched me in dismay <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> for the opposite shore.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the money}} {{which has been}} taken this morning is in the drawer, and unless there is {{something}} more {{you want to say}} to me I will go, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> an engagement down town for ten o'clock." ...|$|E
60|$|HORNBLOWER. One cottage is {{the same}} <b>as</b> another, missis. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> ye a fair offer of five pounds for the moving.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said I, [...] "you {{forget that}} I have, every day, arrangements, almost without number, {{of such a}} kind to make, and <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> one, <b>I</b> {{immediately}} forget all about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps not," [...] the Marquis conceded. [...] "I may {{be wrong}} to ignore the {{literature}} of the present day, but such attempts <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> to appreciate it have been unsatisfactory. You enjoyed the play, dear?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> it out, however, {{he would}} turn his back on poor Jacob in case the savages had him in their power, and I asked myself again and again what course I should pursue in such a situation.|$|E
60|$|Our men {{taught them}} to make wooden spades, such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> for myself; and gave among them twelve hatchets, and three or four knives; and there they lived, the most {{subjected}} innocent creatures that were ever heard of.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And Legge Wilson {{from the}} India Office is here already. I {{spoke to him}} in some jewelled bower <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> my way here, not five minutes since. It's quite a success. Don't you think it very nice, Lady Carbury?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr Melmotte {{had been}} so quick that Montague {{had been unable to}} {{interrupt}} him. 'There need be no trouble about that, Mr Melmotte, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> up my mind {{that it would not be}} fit that I should go.' ...|$|R
60|$|As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>made</b> sure of {{what the}} packing-case contained, I {{restored}} the wood to its original place {{and then began to}} nail down the cover, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had done on the crockery case. I had just driven one of the nails home when a slight noise disturbed me.|$|R
60|$|After {{we arrived}} at Grindelwald, tired <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> {{sketches}} of nine varieties, which I intend to color {{as soon as we}} rest long enough. So much I did for love of the dear little souls.|$|R
