While many mobsters from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> testified against their crime families since the 1980s, the Genovese family has only had seven members turn state's evidence in its history.|$|E

25|$|Stilwell’s home, {{built in}} 1933–1934 on Carmel Point, Carmel, California, remains a private home. A number of streets, buildings, and areas <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> been named for Stilwell over the years, {{including}} Joseph Stilwell Middle School in Jacksonville, Florida. The Soldiers’ Club he envisioned in 1940 (a {{time when there}} was no such thing as a soldiers’ club in the Army) was completed in 1943 at Fort Ord on the bluffs overlooking Monterey Bay. Many years later the building was renamed “Stilwell Hall” in his honor, but because of the erosion of the bluffs over the decades, the building was taken down in 2003. Stilwell's former residence in Chongqing – a city along the Yangtze River to which Chiang's government retreated after being forced from Nanjing by Japanese troops – has now been converted to the General Joseph W. Stilwell Museum in his honor.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{image of}} an Irish {{immigrant}} is led {{to a certain extent}} by racist and anti-Catholic stereotypes. In modern times, in the United States, the Irish are largely perceived as hard workers. Most notably they are associated with the positions of police officer, firefighter, Roman Catholic Church leaders and politicians in the larger Eastern Seaboard metropolitan areas. Irish Americans number over 35 million, making them the second largest reported ethnic group in the country, after German Americans. Historically, large Irish American communities have been found in Philadelphia; Chicago; Boston; New York City; New York; Detroit; New England; Baltimore; Pittsburgh; St. Paul, Minnesota; Buffalo; Broome County; Butte; Dubuque; Quincy; Dublin; Hartford; New Haven; Waterbury; Providence; Kansas City; New Orleans; Braintree; Weymouth; Norfolk; Nashville; Scranton; Wilkes-Barre; O'Fallon; Tampa; Hazleton; Worcester; Lowell; Los Angeles; and the San Francisco Bay Area.

2500|$|American elm {{trees are}} known for their towering canopies, which provide {{abundant}} shade throughout the spring, summer, and fall.

2500|$|Writing for The American Spectator, Jeremy Lott commented {{positively}} {{about the}} protest movement: [...] "While the suits at Comedy Central and Yale University Press have been cowed, people <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>have</b> decided {{to speak up}} and thereby magnify the offense a thousandfold." [...] Helge Rønning, {{a professor at the}} Institute of Media and Communication at the University of Oslo, said the offense to Muslims was outweighed by freedom-of-speech concerns. [...] "Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion {{is as important as the}} indignation that comes from the Muslim side," [...] he told the [...] NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). [...] "I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [...] Vebjørn Selbekk, a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted Danish cartoons of Mohammed in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. [...] "I think maybe this is the right way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," [...] he said. In an analysis of the protest movement and surrounding controversy, staff writer Liliana Segura of AlterNet noted, [...] "In a democratic society where free speech is vigilantly protected, it is perfectly reasonable to call out censorship, particularly when it springs from some form of tyrannical religious extremism." ...|$|E
