5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two.

5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine.

Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to examine the perceptions of risk regarding falling held by older <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> their <b>adult</b> children. Using a focused ethnographic approach, older <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> children were interviewed in depth. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes within groups and to compare the perspectives of older <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>adult</b> children. Findings highlighted differences in perceptions and approaches to action between older <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> their <b>adult</b> children. There were three approaches to action adopted by these families, which focused around whose actions were dominant: parents 2 ̆ 7 actions, shared actions, and children 2 ̆ 7 s secret actions. The results emphasize the value placed on independence by older <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> the impact of multiple family relations taking action to prevent falls. The present study points to the importance of including multiple family perspectives in research concerning injury prevention for older adults...|$|R
