3000|$|In 1950, Kato {{published}} {{a paper in}} a physics journal (denoted as based on a presentation in 1948) on the quantum adiabatic theorem. It is his only paper on the subject but has strongly impacted virtually all the huge literature on the subject and related subjects ever since (there are more Google Scholar citations of this paper than of [314]). We will begin by describing his theorem and its proof which introduced what he called adiabatic dynamics and I’ll call the Kato dynamics. We’ll see that the Kato dynamics defines a notion of parallel transport on the natural vector bundle over the manifold of all k-dimensional subspaces of a Hilbert space, [...] H, and so a connection. This connection is called the Berry connection and its holonomy is the Berry phase (when k= 1). All this Berry stuff was certainly not even hinted at in Kato’s work but it is implicit in the framework. Then I’ll {{say something about the}} history before Kato and finally a few brief words <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> later developments.|$|E
40|$|Large area multi-projector {{displays}} {{are becoming}} increasingly popular for scientific visualization and virtual reality applications. Though most of the geometric calibration issues for such displays have been addressed in the past, the color variation across the display is still not addressed in a comprehensive fashion. The two major components of this color variation are the color non-uniformity within a single projector’s field of view termed as intra-projector variation and the variation across different projectors termed as inter-projector variations. Understanding {{the properties of the}} color variation across a multi-projector display can help us make simplifying assumptions which in turn can render the problem of achieving color uniformity in such displays tractable. In this paper we study the properties of intra-projector variations in different kinds of projectors. We investigate the validity of the assumptions of channel constancy, spatial homogeneity, spatial uniformity and response non-linearity in case of projectors. It has been shown before that such assumptions for display devices like CRT monitors and LCD panels are valid or can be modeled by simple mathematical functions. We will show that the projectors are quite different in this respect and some assumptions that can be safely made <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> display devices cannot be made for projector. 1...|$|E
40|$|Those {{involved}} in delivering or evaluating energy efficiency programs {{have had a}} reasonably comfortable relationship with environmental advocates over the years. In fact heightened environmental concerns helped spur {{the latest round of}} enthusiasm for energy efficiency among regulators and legislators. What <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> groups that are battling for the public’s attention lately – how might their efforts affect energy efficiency? If the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement grows how will it affect publicly-funded energy efficiency? Will utility-led energy efficiency programs be frowned upon by the OWS crowd? Will they want to see more states taking energy efficiency programs away from utilities and creating new institutions to run them (as, for example, is done in Wisconsin) ? On {{the other side of the}} spectrum, will the Tea Party target energy efficiency regulations as evidence that the government has overstepped its constitutional purview? Will their push for deregulation lead to a pull back from regulations authorizing public-benefits charges to fund energy efficiency programs? This paper provides a framework for thinking about these questions and considering the potential ramifications if either of these movements grows in influence and targets energy efficiency. The paper will break the energy efficiency realm down into several parts representing key organizational or regulatory issues and consider the positions that the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street members either have already expressed or are likely to express based on their foundational principles...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to estimate equivalence scales and evaluate their price and utility dependencies. To do this we unify two strands of the empirical literature on this topic, one that relies on demand data and one that relies on subjective evaluations of wellbeing. This way we are able to employ the strengths of both kinds of information. Equivalence scales are not identified from demand data alone. This is because changes in demographics could affect wellbeing directly, i. e., in ways that are not revealed by changes in behavior. The demand-based literature rules out such effects a priori and restricts parameters that measure them. In this paper we do not rely on such restrictions and instead use subjective evaluations of wellbeing as an additional source of information. Because demand data are highly informative <b>about</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> parameters of the model its use increases efficiency. This becomes critical once we specify complex preference structures that allow for the equivalence scale's dependence on price and utility. Our model nests the typical models used in the subjective and the demand literature and we are able to test down both kinds. We find evidence for direct utility effects. This rejects the validity of some of the restrictions applied by the demand literature within the Indonesian context. We estimate equivalence scales that are of reasonable magnitude and decrease in utility. We also find that the scales increase in the food to nonfood price ratio for poor households, whereas we do not find price dependence for more affluent households. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
