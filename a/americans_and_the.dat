5|$|The play {{deals with}} {{relations}} between Native <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first European settlers in America.

5|$|Field {{lacrosse}} is a {{full contact}} outdoor men's sport played with ten players on each team.

The other versions, women's lacrosse (established in the 1890s) and box lacrosse (which originated in the 1930s), are played under significantly different rules.|$|E

Monsoor was protecting other SEALs, two of whom were 15 feet away from him. Monsoor's position made him the only SEAL on the rooftop with quick access to an escape route.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} Portuguese {{settlement in}} the land which would become Brazil was São Vicente, which was established in 1532 by Martim Afonso de Sousa. As the years passed, the Portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward, conquering more lands from both indigenous <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Spanish. Brazil had secured most of its present-day borders by 1750 and was regarded by Portugal {{as the most important}} part of its far-flung maritime Empire. On 7 September 1822, the heir of Portuguese King Dom João VI secured the independence of Brazil from Portugal and, as Dom Pedro I, became its first Emperor.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{beginning}} of the American Revolutionary War, Spanish governor, Bernardo de Galvez, in New Orleans assisted the American rebels with weapons, food, blankets, tents and ammunition.

After the official entry of Spain into the American Revolutionary War in June 1779 {{on the side of the}} <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> French, the British began preparing an invasion to attack St. Louis and other Mississippi outposts.

5|$|While Texas had won its independence, {{political}} battles raged {{between two}} factions {{of the new}} Republic. The nationalist faction, led by Mirabeau B.

Their opponents, led by Sam Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful co-existence with Native Americans. The conflict between the factions was typified by an incident known as the Texas Archive War.|$|E

5|$|Cornwallis {{pulled back}} from all of his outer defenses, except for the Fusilier's redoubt {{on the west side}} of the town and redoubts 9 and 10 in the east. Cornwallis had his forces occupy the {{earthworks}} immediately surrounding the town because he had received a letter from Clinton that promised relief force of 5,000 men within a week and he wished to tighten his lines. The <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> French occupied the abandoned defenses and began to establish their own batteries there. With the British outer defenses in their hands, allied engineers began to lay out positions for the artillery. The men improved their works and deepened their trenches. The British also worked on improving their defenses.|$|E
5|$|During one leg of {{the return}} trip, the men were stopped by the Hukbalahap, Filipino Communist guerrillas who hated both the <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Japanese.

Angered by the message, Mucci sent the lieutenant back to insist that pursuing Japanese forces would be coming. The lieutenant came back and told Mucci that only Americans could pass, and Pajota's men had to stay. Both the Rangers and guerrillas were finally allowed through after an agitated Mucci told the lieutenant that he would call in an artillery barrage and level the whole village. In fact, Mucci's radio was not working at that point.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{fired his}} signal guns at 09:00 and the Hessians began to attack up Battle Pass, while the main army came at Sullivan from the rear. Sullivan left his advance guard {{to hold off}} the Hessians while he turned {{the rest of his}} force around to fight the British. Heavy {{casualties}} mounted between the <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> British, and men on both sides fled out of fear. Sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat. By this point, the Hessians had overrun the advance guard on the heights and the American left had completely collapsed. Hand-to-hand fighting followed, with the Americans swinging their muskets and rifles like clubs to save their own lives. Many of the Americans who surrendered were bayoneted by the Hessians. Sullivan, despite the chaos, managed to evacuate most of his men to Brooklyn Heights though he himself was captured.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{before the}} Axis {{surrender}} in April 1943, the 1st Airborne Division, now commanded by Major-General George F. Hopkinson, arrived in North Africa, and the 1st Parachute Brigade once again came under their command for further operations in Sicily. The invasion of Sicily {{was to be}} carried out by General Bernard Montgomery's Eighth Army landing in the east and Lieutenant General George S. Patton's U.S. Seventh Army coming ashore in the west. These seaborne landings were to be supported by airborne assaults whereby the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division would support the <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 1st Airborne Division the British. The British airborne assault was divided into brigade-sized operations: Operation Ladbroke by the 1st Airlanding Brigade took place on the night of 9/10 July, and Operation Fustian by the 1st Parachute Brigade on the night of 13/14 July. A third operation to drop 2nd Parachute Brigade beside Augusta on the night of 10/11 July (Operation Glutton) was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, Chicago Black Hawks {{owner and}} staunch American {{nationalist}} Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager {{to compile a}} team of only American players; at the time, Taffy Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. With eight out of 14 players Americans, the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens, New York <b>Americans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record. In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were facing an upset, having fallen 3–0 in the seven-game series to the fifth-place Detroit Red Wings. Toronto rebounded, and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup, becoming {{the first of four}} teams in the NHL to come back from a 3–0 series deficit and the only team to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E

5|$|On September 26, {{transports}} with artillery, siege tools, {{and some}} French infantry and shock troops from Head of Elk, {{the northern end}} of the Chesapeake Bay, arrived, giving Washington command of an army of 7,800 Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000 Continentals. Early on September 28, Washington led the army out of Williamsburg to surround Yorktown. The French took the positions on the left while the Americans took the position of honor on the right. Cornwallis had a chain of seven redoubts and batteries linked by earthworks along with batteries that covered the narrows of the York River at Gloucester Point. That day, Washington reconnoitered the British defenses and decided that they could be bombarded into submission. The <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> French spent the night of the 28th sleeping out in the open, while work parties built bridges over the marsh. Some of the American soldiers hunted down wild hogs to eat.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 17, a drummer {{appeared}} followed by an officer waving a white handkerchief. The bombardment ceased, and the officer was blindfolded and led behind the French and American lines. Negotiations began at the Moore House on October 18 between Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Dundas and Major Alexander Ross (who represented the British) and Lieutenant Colonel Laurens (who represented the <b>Americans)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Marquis de Noailles (who represented the French). To make sure that nothing fell apart between the French and Americans at the last minute, Washington ordered that the French be given an equal share in {{every step of the}} surrender process.|$|E
5|$|The {{war between}} Tecumseh and Harrison {{merged with the}} War of 1812 when the {{remnants}} of the Indian Confederation allied with the British in Canada. The Siege of Fort Harrison is considered to be the United States' first land victory during the war. Other battles that occurred in the modern state of Indiana include the Siege of Fort Wayne, the Pigeon Roost Massacre and the Battle of the Mississinewa. The Treaty of Ghent, signed in 1814, ended the war and relieved American settlers from their fears of the nearby British and their Indian allies. This marked the end of hostilities with the Native Americans in Indiana. Of the 58 recorded incidents between Native <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States in Indiana during the 19thcentury, 43 were Indian victories.|$|E
