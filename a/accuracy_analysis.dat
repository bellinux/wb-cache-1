Because of the delay between dialysate formation and the actual measurements of the blood glucose level, we subtracted 5  min from the time stamp {{of the values of}} the CGM device; as such reference blood glucose values matched with the moment dialysate was formed. Subsequently, device and reference measurements were merged. Paired measurements were used for determining point and trend accuracy of the device. To be considered for the statistical analysis, each patient needed to have at least multiple samples with at most 30  min in between. However, patients excluded for statistical analysis remained included in the reliability analysis. While each paired sample was included in the point <b>accuracy</b> <b>analysis,</b> only the samples with a gap of at most 30  min to the next sample were included in the trend <b>accuracy</b> <b>analysis.</b> In addition, when the device was calibrated within the daily 8 -h block of intense sampling, the calibration sample and the subsequent sample were not considered for trend <b>accuracy</b> <b>analysis.</b> This way, large changes in trend due to the calibration were excluded from the analysis.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{detailed}} <b>accuracy</b> <b>analysis</b> for {{the orientation of}} an innovative open-chain pointing mechanism is carried out, employing methods for indirect measurements. The particular shape of the mechanism exhibits the advantage of high structural stiffness and different pointing accuracy in comparison with a standard orthogonal axes gimbal. With the aim of finding out advantages and drawbacks as regard {{the accuracy of the}} proposed pointing mechanism, an <b>accuracy</b> <b>analysis</b> is performed through three different methods of uncertainty expression and propagation based on the probability theory or the theory of evidence. The proposed pointing mechanism, in comparison with the standard orthogonal axes gimbal, exhibits a considerable lower uncertainty for two of the three Euler angles that are used for the end-effector orientation expression and a higher uncertainty for the third Euler angle. Thus, the proposed mechanism could be particularly suited for pointing directional antennas, allowing the employment of high-data-rate communication systems. This result is strengthened {{by the fact that the}} <b>accuracy</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed with different uncertainty expression and propagation methods, which take into account only random effects or both random and systematic effects...|$|E

40|$|The RD- 14 M large LOCA test, {{characterized}} by a reliable set of experimental data, was selected for an international standard problem exercise (SPE) entitled “Intercomparison and validation of computer codes for thermal–hydraulics safety analyses”. The activity was performed within the frame of International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEAs) Technical Working Group on Advanced Technologies for Heavy Water Reactors (TWG-HWR). In this study, the recently improved fast Fourier trans- form based method (FFTBM) was used for accuracy quantiﬁcation of RD- 14 M large LOCA test B 9401 calculations of six participants using four different thermal–hydraulic codes. In addition, developing the capability to calculate the accuracy {{as a function of}} time-continues-valued accuracy, did further improvement of FFTBM. Namely, in the past only single val- ued accuracy parameters for selected time windows and time intervals were calculated. The objective {{of the study was to}} demonstrate that the new FFTBM is a powerful tool for quantitative assessment of thermal–hydraulic codes. For demon- stration, the test from the facility simulating heavy water reactor was used. The blind <b>accuracy</b> <b>analysis</b> was completed based on solely experimental and calculated data.
