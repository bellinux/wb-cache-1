40|$|This {{monograph}} {{is dedicated}} to the systematic presentation of main trends, technologies and methods of computational intelligence (CI). The book pays big attention to novel important CI technology- fuzzy logic (FL) systems and fuzzy neural networks (FNN). Different FNN including new class of FNN- cascade neo-fuzzy neural networks are considered and their training algorithms are described and analyzed. The applications of FNN to the forecast in macroeconomics and at stock markets are examined. The book presents the problem of portfolio optimization under uncertainty, the novel theory of fuzzy portfolio optimization free of drawbacks of classical model of Markovitz as well as an application for portfolios optimization at Ukrainian, Russian and American stock exchanges.

40|$|Personal {{bankruptcy}} {{has been}} enacted in the Czech legal system since 2008. In the six years, {{during which the}} legal regulation was in effect, there here have been already 84, 000 <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> personal <b>bankruptcy</b> filed and the number is still increasing. For the em- pirical part of this work, I have created a data set matrix consisting of 175 applicants <b>for</b> personal <b>bankruptcy</b> and 25 descriptive variables. I found out that personal bankruptcy was permitted in more than 90 % of the cases. The single variable with the highest influence on the positive handling of the request <b>for</b> personal <b>bankruptcy</b> was the manner of filling in the application. Handwritten applications have a much lower percentage of approval than those written on a computer or a typewriter.

40|$|Sweden needs {{a policy}} that stimulates {{economic}} growth. Year 1996 the Business Reorganization Act (1996 : 764) came into force. The goal with this law was to savebusiness, make it profitable and avoid unnecessary bankruptcies. Shortly afterwards itturned out that the law had no positive effect. A very few numbers of companies appliedfor reconstruction {{and the number of}} <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> continued to increase. In 2004, in order to stabilize the situation and bring about neutrality between twoproceedings, company reorganization and bankruptcy, the government proposed thereform of priority rules. The new proposition replaced the business mortgage. Accordingthe new priority rules the floating charge was limited from 100 per cent to 55 per cent. But the effect of the new reform was negative. This caused intense debates amongpoliticians and economists. The negative effects of the reform weighted more than the positive ones and in 2007 it was proposed to increase the percentage share from 55 percent to 75 percent. On January 2009 this will be changed to 100 per cent again. Something went wrong. Why do so many companies choose to go into bankruptcy insteadof business reorganizing? Why didn’t the new priority rules work properly? The focus {{of this study is to}} analyze the reasons why the law of business reorganization has so weak effect, why the reform of priority rules has failed. ...|$|R
