Thirdly, that of making a picture which paid no regard whatever to established, although not practised, moral convention.|$|E
25|$|After reports had {{surfaced}} {{that both}} parties had agreed to all terms, Golden Boy Promotions released a press release on December 22, 2009, revealing that Pacquiao was unwilling {{to comply with the}} Olympic-style drug testing requested by Team Mayweather. The following day, Bob Arum, Top Rank founder and CEO, declared the fight was off and Pacquiao would be facing a different opponent: We appeased Mayweather by agreeing to a urine analysis at any time, and blood testing before the press conference and after the fight. Mayweather pressed for blood testing even up to the weigh-in. He knew that Manny gets freaked out when his blood gets taken and feels that it weakens him. This is just harassment <b>and,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> just signaled that he didn't want the fight. Arum told David Mayo of the Grand Rapids Press.|$|E

25|$|It {{caused him}} to reflect. But there was no result. The {{justice of the peace}} was a stern man. On the trial he found fault with the scheme and {{required}} us to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.” The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” Then he said to the jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.” He said it in open court, before everybody, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it did not seem very kind.|$|E

500|$|Ayananka Bose was the film's cinematographer. According to Bose, its {{location}} {{was the big}} factor in his work: [...] "Dostana is based in Miami <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> Miami means sunshine and beaches. That is what stayed in my mind." [...] Bose chose a bright frame because the film was a comedy about friendship, and the bright frame conveyed vibrancy: [...] "That is what automatically gave Dostana its expression." [...] He found the office set challenging, since {{there was nowhere to}} put lights and the room had glass {{on one side and a}} wall on the other. However, Bose enjoyed filming on the apartment and office sets.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel was}} {{published}} by Chapman and Hall in the UK on 19 July 1957, and by Little, Brown in the US on 12 August. The Daily Telegraph had partly revealed the book's principal theme three months earlier: [...] "The publishers hope to establish 'Pinfold' as a household word meaning 'half round the bend'." [...] This comment followed closely on the release of Muriel Spark's first novel, The Comforters, which also dealt with issues of drug-induced hallucination. Although {{it would have been}} in Waugh's commercial interests to have ignored or downplayed Spark's book, he reviewed it generously in The Spectator on 22 February 1957: [...] "a complicated, subtle <b>and,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at least, an intensely interesting first novel".|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} {{throughout}} September 2004 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Before filming, ABC {{announced that the}} production would adapt elements from the original 1900 book, rather than the 1939 film. such as the Silver Shoes instead of the Ruby slippers. [...] On August 25, 2004, {{it was announced that}} Hilary Duff, Jessica Simpson, and Ashanti had auditioned for the role of Dorothy Gale, but Ashanti had won the part. When asked about how she felt about working with the Muppets, Ashanti replied, [...] "I love children, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the Muppets are just like little kids." [...] She also stated, [...] "The director had to give me a few pointers and tips for acting with them, {{but the most important thing}} that I learned was to keep eye contact." [...] Also in August 2004, BBC News reported that Quentin Tarantino would appear in the film.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the band}} members have {{expressed}} their dissatisfaction with All Hope Is Gone and {{is considered to be}} their least favorite Slipknot album. Feeling discontent over the record's production process, Root said, [...] "it felt a little bit rushed. And it felt like we were trying to do things just to appease a schedule, which I didn't really like." [...] Root was particularly disappointed with the record's producer, Dave Fortman, and said, [...] "Dave Fortman really helped me appreciate Rick Rubin as a producer. [...] wasn't able to get nine people together on the same page <b>and,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that's {{the most important thing in}} making a Slipknot record." [...] Conversely, Jordison said, [...] "It's finally the record that I've wanted Slipknot to sound like." [...] He went on to compliment Fortman's ear for tone, and considered All Hope Is Gone to be the band's best album. All Hope Is Gone was mixed by Colin Richardson in Miloco's The Engine Room studio in the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Because {{there was}} still a chance that the seventh season may have been the show's last, the {{character}} of Billy Miles, played by Zachary Ansley and who originally appeared in the pilot episode, was brought back in and featured in [...] "Requiem" [...] to bring the series full-circle. Ansley would also appear in several eighth season episodes as well. After the conclusion of the episode, David Duchovny expressed his desire to leave the series.

500|$|In 1936 London Films {{released}} Things to Come, {{in which}} Richardson played the swaggering warlord [...] "The Boss". His performance parodied the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini so effectively {{that the film}} was immediately banned in Italy. The producer was Alexander Korda; the two men formed a long and mutually beneficial friendship. Richardson later said of Korda, [...] "Though not so very much older than I am, I regarded {{him in a way}} as a father, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> he was as generous as a prince." [...] In May 1936 Richardson and Olivier jointly directed and starred in a new piece by Priestley, Bees on the Boatdeck. Both actors won excellent notices, but the play, an allegory of Britain's decline, did not attract the public. It closed after four weeks, the last in a succession of West End productions in which Richardson appeared to much acclaim but which were box-office failures. In August of the same year he finally had a long-running star part, the title role in Barré Lyndon's comedy thriller, The Amazing Dr Clitterhouse, which played for 492 performances, closing in October 1937.|$|E

500|$|Against all expectations, the war {{continued}} for five years. During this period, PedroII's {{time and energy}} were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that [...] "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost." [...] "Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness {{had no effect on}} his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously PedroII remarked: [...] "What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me? Many better kings than I have lost it, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry." ...|$|E

He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> that is where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Stone commented that [...] "In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring the civil rights struggle into this is just a non sequitur. Of course we will release Isaac from his contract and we wish him well." [...] According to a later commentary by Stone, prior to the episode's screening Hayes had asked the South Park creators to have Comedy Central pull the episode before it aired and not include it in the series DVD, which they refused.|$|E

[...] I've been around long enough to know when an artist gives it their all, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it doesn't get better than this. This video is gonna be fucking awesome!

The fight scene was choreographed by Steven Ho. He commented that Spears incorporated the moves learned during rehearsals, but also incorporated [...] "her own flavor", by adding a small shuffle of steps in her heels. The length of the dresses also presented a problem, and there were discussions about shortening the trains for safety issues. They were later added as 'weapons', as Ho explained, [...] "as if they were sharp blades, giving Britney reason to jump and evade around them." ...|$|E
