The validity of the models has been illustrated in a real case-study boiler, a 300 MW Chinese power station. The results on same real plant data show that both models have good prediction accuracy, while the ANN model II has less input parameters.

In order to combine them in an optimal gasifying blend, the gasification behavior of each feedstock was {{compared with that of}} wastewater sludge through the following criteria: the raw feedstock proximate and ultimate composition, the solid conversion, the gas heating value, the pollutants release and the ashes melting. Operated alone, the conversion rate of the feedstocks after 58 min of solid residence time was over 77 % of initial mass. The Syngas low heating value produced at 1123 K was in the range of 9. 0 to 11. 9 MJ m À 3. The major concerns regarding the wastewater sludge were the pollutants precursors' release (NH 3, COS…) and the <b>ash</b> slagging and <b>fouling.</b> The calculated slagging and fouling indexes were high also for olive pomace and for waste wood. Finally, among the possible blends studied the paper labels and plastic labels can be co-gasified with secondary and digested wastewater sludge without any restriction, reeds and solid recovered fuel can be blinded with secondary wastewater sludge without any restriction, a specific attention have to be taken to fouling when they are blended with digested wastewater sludge.

40|$|Superheater is for {{generating}} superheated steam from the saturated steam from the evaporator outlet. In {{the case of}} pulverized coal fired boiler, a relatively small amount of ash causes problems with <b>ash</b> <b>fouling</b> on the heating surfaces, including the superheaters. In the convection pass of the boiler, the flue gas temperature is lower and ash deposits can be loose or sintered. <b>Ash</b> <b>fouling</b> not only reduces heat transfer from the flue gas to the steam, but also {{is the cause of}} a higher pressure drop on the flue gas flow path. In the case the pressure drop is greater than the power consumed by the fan increases. If the superheater surfaces are covered with ash than the steam temperature at the outlet of the superheater stages falls, and the flow rates of the water injected into attemperator should be reduced. There is also an increase in flue gas temperature after the different stages of the superheater. Consequently, this leads to a reduction in boiler efficiency. The paper presents the results of computational fluid dynamics simulations of the first stage superheater of both the boiler OP- 210 M using the commercial software. The temperature distributions of the steam and flue gas along the way they flow together with temperature of the tube walls and temperature of the ash deposits will be determined. The calculated steam temperature is compared with measurement results. Knowledge of these temperatures is of great practical importance because it allows to choose the grade of steel for a given superheater stage.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{of forest}} residues and other biomass is often hampered by <b>ash</b> sintering, <b>fouling</b> and corrosion caused by potassium salts. Kaolin {{has been shown}} to be an efficient absorbent for different species of potassium. This investigation was carried out with the aim to clarify if the leaching of Al or metals bound in aluminium silicate forms is an obstacle to the utilisation of kaolin as fuel additive and if the resulting ash would react differently with water than a normal wood ash. It was shown that kaolin addition decreases the leaching of K at high pH values, but leaching of Al and all trace elements was generally low at all pH (4, 7 and 13) used. Addition of kaolin during the combustion reduced the initial setting time of ash-water mixtures and the presence of kaolin also stabilised the ash structure. From theses results it can be concluded that kaolin addition seems to be a good way to decrease ash related problems during combustion, without deteriorating the properties of the resulting ash or preventing the use of the ash as mineral nutrient in forestry.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Biomass co‐products {{from the}} dry‐grind ethanol {{production}} process and/or corn stover are potential {{sources for the}} energy needed to operate the plant. The ethanol plant co‐products alone contain sufficient energy to meet the electrical and thermal needs of the plant {{as well as to}} produce excess power that can be sold. Fuel characteristics of co‐products of the ethanol dry‐grind process [distillers wet grains (DWG), concentrated distillers solubles (referred to as “syrup”), and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) ], and corn stover are evaluated. Analyses include proximate, ultimate, selected metals, ash fusion temperatures, minerals in the ash, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Higher heating values for the co‐products are greater than for corn stover and for most other biomass materials. The ethanol co‐products contain large amounts of nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, which will require major control technologies for combustion or gasification systems to meet emissions limits. The alkali metal content (potassium and sodium oxides) of the ash is high (22 % to 34 %) for co‐products and corn stover, which will require careful design to avoid to <b>ash</b> <b>fouling</b> in combustion and steam generation units.

The paper focuses on chemical, technological and quality characteristics of ash from the combustion of lignite from Polish deposits.

The measured ash melting temperatures from the collected lignite samples have shown that the sintering, softening, melting and flow temperatures, determined in an oxidizing atmosphere (air), are higher than those determined in a reducing atmosphere. In the majority of Polish lignite deposits, the dominant component of ash was SiO 2, followed by CaO.

Such temperatures affect the partitioning of inorganic components through phase transformations. In most biomass fuels, potassium {{is a significant}} component present as inorganic species or bound to organic molecules. At temperatures approaching 1600 K KOH and KCl become volatilized and are released to the gas phase. These gases condense out in cooler parts of the furnace and lead to increased corrosive deposits and adhesion of ash. Gas-phase potassium {{can also lead to}} the formation of sulfate aerosols and re-combine with other solid-phase <b>ash</b> components influencing <b>fouling</b> and slagging in the furnace. In order to model these processes and predict the likely fate of potassium during the combustion process, it is necessary to understand the release mechanisms and patterns of release.

Many new developments in analytical, modeling, and combustion testing methods in the past 20 years have made it possible to identify root causes of ash deposition. A concise and comprehensive guidelines document has been assembled for solving ash deposition as related to coal-fired utility boilers. While this report accurately captures the current state of knowledge in ash deposition, note that substantial research and development is under way to more completely understand and mitigate slagging and fouling.

The ash was also evaluated to see if any connections could be drawn between the physical properties of the ash and its fouling capabilities.

Additionally, <b>ash</b> <b>fouling</b> evaluation was also performed through XRF analysis. The weight fraction of C, defined in percentage as wt. %, improved from 56 to 68 wt. % and the high heating value rose from 26. 4 to 30. 0 MJ·kg− 1 as torrefaction temperature increased, reaching typical values of subbituminous coal and finding the best results at 200 °C in terms of maximizing the heating value and minimizing the energy losses. Accordingly, from FTIR analysis it was observed that the degree of coalification increased during torrefaction of TPOMW. ASE results shown that the residual olive oil in TPOMW was removed during torrefaction, being completely eliminated at 300 °C. The alkali index for TPOMW was found to be 0. 66 kg alkali·GJ− 1, which implied a high fouling tendency that could be mitigated through co-firing. Finally, t-TPOMW briquettes with good mechanical strength and energy density of 26. 7 GJ·m− 3 were produced using a hydraulic piston press.

Development of combustion methods suitable for such residues is presently being pursued by a number of companies. Because many biomass fuels have compositions that makes them inclined to cause ash sintering problems and emissions of acid gases, there may be it need for the use of additives to decrease such problems. The aim of this work was to examine the ash characteristics of some agricultural crops and residues and to find mixtures of fuels and additives that can form the basis for production of fuel pellets with minimal problems. The work is focused on biomass fuel pellets for small-scale grate-fired combustors.

Many {{problems associated with}} coal combustion, such as <b>ash</b> clinkering, slagging, <b>fouling,</b> agglomeration and deposition on heat exchange surfaces are routinely encountered in these power plants. Most thermal power industries generate database on elemental composition of coal ashes to predict the slagging and clinkering behavior of coal.

Knowledge of structural characteristics of minerals and mineral phase transformation that occurs {{during the process of}} combustion of coal is essential to understand the slagging and clinkering behavior. There are a number of reports in the literature that provide information on the mineral matter association in coal (Van Dyk et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2012; Dai et al. 2014 a, b). Vassilev et al.

However, a small fraction of the mineral matter (as fly ash) is entrained with the raw syngas out of the gasifier to downstream processing. This molten/sticky fly <b>ash</b> could cause <b>fouling</b> of the syngas cooler. Therefore, it is preferable to minimize the quantity of fly ash and maximize slag. In addition, the hot raw syngas is cooled to convert any entrained molten fly slag to hardened solid fly ash prior to entering the syngas cooler. To improve gasification availability through better design and operation of the gasification process, better understanding of slag behavior and characteristics of the slagging process are needed. Slagging behavior is affected by char/ash properties, gas compositions in the gasifier, the gasifier wall structure, fluid dynamics, and plant operating conditions (mainly temperature and oxygen/carbon ratio). The viscosity of the slag is used to characterize the behavior of the slag flow and is the dominating factor to determine the probability that ash particles will stick. Slag viscosity strongly depends on the temperature and chemical composition of the slag. Because coal has varying ash content and composition, different operating conditions are required to maintain the slag flow and limit problems downstream. This report briefly introduces the IGCC process, the gasification process, and the main types and operating conditions of entrained flow gasifiers used in IGCC plants. This report also discusses the effects of coal ash and slag properties on slag flow and its qualities required for the entrained flow gasifier. Finally this report will identify the key operating conditions affecting slag flow behaviors, including temperature, oxygen/coal ratio, and flux agents...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, ALSTOM Power Inc. (ALSTOM) has {{developed}} a range of low cost, in-furnace technologies for NOx emissions control for the domestic U. S. pulverized coal fired boiler market. This includes ALSTOM's internally developed TFS 2000 firing system, and various enhancements to it developed {{in concert with the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). As of 2004, more than 200 units representing approximately 75, 000 MWe of domestic coal fired capacity have been retrofit with ALSTOM low NOx technology. Best of class emissions range from 0. 18 lb/MMBtu for bituminous coals to 0. 10 lb/MMBtu for subbituminous coals, with typical levels at 0. 24 lb/MMBtu and 0. 13 lb/MMBtu, respectively. Despite these gains, NOx emissions limits in the U. S. continue to ratchet down for new and existing (retrofit) boiler equipment. If enacted, proposed Clear Skies legislation will, by 2008, require an average, effective, domestic NOx emissions rate of 0. 16 lb/MMBtu, which number will be reduced to 0. 13 lb/MMBtu by 2018. Such levels represent a 60 % and 67 % reduction, respectively, from the effective 2000 level of 0. 40 lb/MMBtu. Low cost solutions to meet such regulations, and in particular those that can avoid the need for a costly selective catalytic reduction system (SCR), provide a strong incentive to continue to improve low NOx firing system technology to meet current and anticipated NOx control regulations. In light of these needs, ALSTOM, in cooperation with the DOE, is developing an enhanced combustion, low NOx pulverized coal burner which, when integrated with ALSTOM's state-of-the-art, globally air staged low NOx firing systems, will provide a means to achieve less than 0. 15 lb/MMBtu NOx at less than 3 / 4 the cost of an SCR with low to no impact on balance of plant issues when firing a high volatile bituminous coal. Such coals can be more economic to fire than subbituminous or Powder River Basin (PRB) coals, but are more problematic from a NOx control standpoint as existing firing system technologies do not provide a means to meet current or anticipated regulations absent the use of an SCR. The DOE/ALSTOM program performed large pilot scale combustion testing in ALSTOM's Industrial Scale Burner Facility (ISBF) at its U. S. Power Plant Laboratories facility in Windsor, Connecticut. During this work, the near-field combustion environment was optimized to maximize NOx reduction while minimizing the impact on unburned carbon in <b>ash,</b> slagging and <b>fouling,</b> corrosion, and flame stability/turn-down under globally reducing conditions. Initially, ALSTOM utilized computational fluid dynamic modeling to evaluate a series of burner and/or near field stoichiometry controls in order to screen promising design concepts in advance of the large pilot scale testing. The third and final test, to be executed, will utilize several variants of the best nozzle tip configuration and compare performance with 3 different coals. The fuels to be tested will cover a wide range of coals commonly fired at US utilities. The completion of this work will provide sufficient data to allow ALSTOM to design, construct, and demonstrate a commercial version of an enhanced combustion low NOx pulverized coal burner. A preliminary cost/performance analysis of the developed enhanced combustion low NOx burner applied to ALSTOM's state-of-the-art TFS 2000 firing system was performed to show that the burner enhancements is a cost effective means to reduce NOx...|$|R
40|$|Cattle biomass (CB) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a renewable, supplementary fuel for co-firing and reburning. Reburning coal with CB {{has the potential to}} reduce NOx and Hg emissions from coal fired systems. The present research focuses on three areas of combustion: 1) Biomass reburning experiments are conducted to determine the optimum operating conditions for the NOx reduction using blends of coal and CB as reburn fuels. 2) Since CB contains higher ash contents compared to coals, the fouling behavior is also investigated under the transient and short-time operation. 3) Finally CB contains higher Cl compared to coals, which oxidizes Hg to HgCl 2. To understand the Hg oxidation behavior, a fundamental study of Hg oxidation in coal combustion is conducted using a plug flow reactor (PFR). The main parameters investigated are types of the reburn fuel, reburn equivalence ratios (ERRBZ), O 2 concentrations in the reburn gas, injection angles of the reburn fuel, cross-sectional geometries of the reburn nozzles, symmetric and asymmetric reburn injections, reburn heat inputs, baseline NOx concentrations, and presence and absence of the heat exchangers (HEX). The results of reburning show that CB is a very effective fuel in NOx reduction, and the extent of NOx reduction is strongly dependent to the ERRBZ. The optimum conditions of the boiler operation for biomass reburning are as follows: ERRBZ = 1. 1, 45 ? upward circular reburn nozzles, 12. 5 % O 2 in the reburn gas, symmetric injection, and presence of HEXs. To make an effective reburn process, the baseline NOx concentrations must be higher than 230 g/GJ (0. 5 lb/mmBTU) and the reburn heat input higher than 20 %. The results of <b>ash</b> <b>fouling</b> show the presence of ash in the hotter region of the furnace seems to promote heat radiation thus augmenting the heat transfer to the HEX. The growth of the layer of ash depositions over longer periods typically lowers overall heat transfer coefficients. The addition of HCl to Hg containing gases in the PFR significantly increases Hg oxidations. The addition of NO inhibited the overall reaction and shifted the reaction temperature higher while the addition of O 2 promoted Hg oxidations and lowered the reaction temperature. For heterogeneous cases, the use of the VWT catalyst promotes the reduction of Hg 0 and shifted the reaction temperatures lower than those for homogeneous cases...|$|E
40|$|Gasification {{of biomass}} is a one of the several {{technologies}} for energy production from biomass. Biomass is a promising renewable source of energy and is in a centre of attention of energy industry {{not only in the}} Czech Republic, but also in the EU and in the world. Gasification is a thermo chemical transformation of fuel with access of understoicheiometric amount of oxidizer which produces gas of low heating value. Its main combustible components are hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane. Produced gas may be further used in power and heating plants. Besides combustible and neutral components, gas also contains pollutants such as sulphur compounds, chlorine compounds, ash and tar. It is tar which is considered to be the underbelly of gasification as it causes, along with <b>ash,</b> <b>fouling</b> in transport tracks and terminal equipment, and blocks direct application of gas. This dissertation thesis presents design of filter for elimination of tar from the gas generated in fluid gasification equipment. This work is closely related to current research at Energy Institute at Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at Brno University of Technology. First part deals with theoretical background of this issue. Biomass properties are mentioned in relation to gasification. Types of gasification equipment are described and principle of gasification including chemical reactions is given in detail. Special part is dedicated to pollutants in the gas, especially to production of tar and its properties, which is important for consequent work. Main focus is on possibilities of catalytic cleaning of gas from tar. Principle of tar decomposition is described and types and properties of catalysts are given. Part of the thesis tackles the issue of real operations and loss of efficiency of catalyst due to sulphur compounds, sintering and carbon fouling. Based on experience and analysis {{in the first part of}} the thesis, concept of elimination of tar from gas was laid out. In addition to that, method for measurement at Biofluid 100 experimental unit was outlined and filter for testing of industrial catalysts using metal was designed. Series of experiments were further conducted in order to find out efficiency of three opted catalysts for tar decomposition. Results of these experiments are described in detail and assessed in the conclusion of this thesis which also contains outline for economic assessment of method of gas cleaning using catalysts...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The Texas Panhandle is {{regarded}} as the âCattle Feeding Capital of the Worldâ, producing 42 % of the fed beef cattle in the United States within a 200 -mile radius of Amarillo generating more than 5 million tons of feedlot manure /year. Apart from feedlots, the Bosque River Region in Erath County, just north of Waco, Texas with about 110, 000 dairy cattle in over 250 dairies, produces 1. 8 million tons of manure biomass (excreted plus bedding) per year. While the feedlot manure has been used extensively for irrigated and dry land crop production, most dairies, as well as other concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOâs), the dairy farms utilize large lagoon areas to store wet animal biomass. Water runoff from these lagoons has been held responsible for the increased concentration of phosphorus and other contaminates in the Bosque River which drains into Lake Wacoâthe primary source of potable water for Wacoâs 108, 500 people. The concentrated animal feeding operations may lead to land, water, and air pollution if waste handling systems and storage and treatment structures are not properly managed. Manure-based biomass (MBB) {{has the potential to be}} a source of green energy at large coal-fired power plants and on smaller-scale combustion systems at or near confined animal feeding operations. Although MBB particularly cattle biomass (CB) is a low quality fuel with an inferior heat value compared to coal and other fossil fuels, the concentration of it at large animal feeding operations can make it a viable source of fuel. The overall objective of this interdisciplinary proposal is to develop environmentally benign technologies to convert low-value inventories of dairy and beef cattle biomass into renewable energy. Current research expands the suite of technologies by which cattle biomass (CB: manure, and premature mortalities) could serve as a renewable alternative to fossil fuel. The work falls into two broad categories of research and development. Category 1 â Renewable Energy Conversion. This category addressed mostly in volume I involves developing. Thermo-chemical conversion technologies including cofiring with coal, reburn to reduce nitrogen oxide (NO, N 2 O, NOx, etc.) and Hg emissions and gasification to produce low-BTU gas for on-site power production in order to extract energy from waste streams or renewable resources. Category 2 â Biomass Resource Technology. This category, addressed mostly in Volume II, deals with the efficient and cost-effective use of CB as a renewable energy source (e. g. through and via aqueous-phase, anaerobic digestion or biological gasification). The investigators formed an industrial advisory panel consisting fuel producers (feedlots and dairy farms) and fuel users (utilities), periodically met with them, and presented the research results; apart from serving as dissemination forum, the PIs used their critique to red-direct the research within the scope of the tasks. The final report for the 5 to 7 year project performed by an interdisciplinary team of 9 professors is arranged in three volumes: Vol. I (edited by Kalyan Annamalai) addressing thermo-chemical conversion and direct combustion under Category 1 and Vol. II and Vol. III (edited by J M Sweeten) addressing biomass resource Technology under Category 2. Various tasks and sub-tasks addressed in Volume I were performed by the Department of Mechanical Engineering (a part of TEES; see Volume I), while other tasks and sub-tasks addressed in Volume II and IIII were conducted by Texas AgriLife Research at Amarillo; the TAMU Biological & Agricultural Engineering Department (BAEN) College Station; and West Texas A&M University (WTAMU) (Volumes II and III). The three volume report covers the following results: fuel properties of low ash and high ash CB (particularly DB) and MB (mortality biomass and coals, non-intrusive visible infrared (NVIR) spectroscopy techniques for ash determination, dairy energy use surveys at 14 dairies in Texas and California, cofiring of low quality CB with high quality coal, emission results and <b>ash</b> <b>fouling</b> behavior, using CB as reburn fuel for NOx and Hg reduction, gasification of fuels to produce low quality gases, modeling of reburn, pilot scale test results, synthesis of engineering characterization, geographical mapping, a transportation cost study to determine potential handling and transportation systems for co-firing with coal at regional coal-fired power plants, software analyses for the design of off-site manure, pre-processing and storage systems for a typical dairy farm or beef cattle feedlot, recursive production functions/systems models for both cattle feedlots, systems modeling, stocks and flows of energy involved in the CAFO system, feedback from an Industry Advisory Committee (IAC) to the investigators on project direction and task emphasis and economics of using CB as cofiring and reburn fuel...|$|E
40|$|The {{significant}} and consistent use of coal {{as a major}} source for power generation results in the emissions of various hazardous trace elements into the environment. Coupled with the advancement of oxyfuel combustion, a promising CO₂ abatement technology, there is a pressing need to fully understand trace element behaviour. Therefore, this research project aims at contributing towards fundamental understanding regarding the mechanisms governing the behaviour of trace elements under the conditions that are typically encountered in brown coal air and oxyfuel combustion. To address literature gaps regarding trace element emissions and partitioning, both laboratory-scale and pilot-scale studies have been conducted. The highlight of these studies is the focused use of brown coals (lignites), e. g. Victorian brown coal (VBC), due to the limited knowledge for these coals which possess distinct properties and burns differently from high-rank coals that have been studied intensively in the literature. In terms of mode of occurrence in the original coal, trace elements in brown coals are mostly organically bound rather than being present in discrete minerals typical {{to that of other}} high-rank coals. For these coals, a wide variety of trace elements have been examined, including As, Ba, Be, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn. Of these, As and Cr are highlighted as elements of major environmental concern based on their known adverse health and ecological effects. These two elements are studied in greater detail since their speciation affects their toxicity. To accomplish trace element quantification and characterisation for these purposes, a number of advanced analytical instruments and methods were utilised, including inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The scope of this thesis includes firstly establishing and standardising the trace element quantification analysis method, microwave-assisted digestion performed in conjunction with ICP-OES, for accurate communication of the main body results. The laboratory-scale studies, which utilises a drop-tube furnace, then compare the trace element behaviour derived from a VBC to that from a Chinese lignite. For this, the emission dynamics of their respective trace elements during pyrolysis and char oxidation, different stages of the coal combustion process, were studied in both air and oxyfuel gaseous environments. Further to that, the laboratory-scale studies encompass the additional focus on the emission and speciation of As and Cr. For the study on As, three coals of different type and origin were tested for its As valency using the synchrotron-based XANES during coal combustion in air and oxyfuel combustion mode. On the other hand, the novel study on Cr mechanisms for speciation involved monitoring the evolution of Cr species from reacting reagent-grade compounds using in-situ high-temperature XRD. Finally, as means to validate the laboratory-scale results on a larger-scale, the Chinese lignite was then subjected to air combustion in a pilot-scale 30 MWth pulverised coal-fired boiler. Here, a side objective of this work was to investigate the effects of using a silica additive on the emissions and partitioning of trace elements in brown coal. The use of fuel additives is commonly adopted by various facilities as they have been proven to inhibit <b>ash</b> slagging and <b>fouling</b> issues, however, their effects on trace element emissions have not been fully documented. Overall, clarifying trace element emissions and partitioning behaviour is of mainstream interest, and this research ultimately provide a clearer picture for the management of trace elements derived from the use of brown coal for power generation...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, Alstom Power Inc. (Alstom) has {{developed}} a range of low cost, infurnace technologies for NOx emissions control for the domestic U. S. pulverized coal fired boiler market. This includes Alstom's internally developed TFS 2000 {trademark} firing system, and various enhancements to it developed {{in concert with the}} U. S. Department of Energy. As of the date of this report, more than 270 units representing approximately 80, 000 MWe of domestic coal fired capacity have been retrofit with Alstom low NOx technology. Best of class emissions range from 0. 18 lb/MMBtu for bituminous coal to 0. 10 lb/MMBtu for subbituminous coal, with typical levels at 0. 24 lb/MMBtu and 0. 13 lb/MMBtu, respectively. Despite these gains, NOx emissions limits in the U. S. continue to ratchet down for new and existing boiler equipment. On March 10, 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR requires 25 Eastern states to reduce NOx emissions from the power generation sector by 1. 7 million tons in 2009 and 2. 0 million tons by 2015. Low cost solutions to meet such regulations, and in particular those that can avoid the need for a costly selective catalytic reduction system (SCR), provide a strong incentive to continue to improve low NOx firing system technology to meet current and anticipated NOx control regulations. The overall objective of the work is to develop an enhanced combustion, low NOx pulverized coal burner, which, when integrated with Alstom's state-of-the-art, globally air staged low NOx firing systems will provide a means to achieve: Less than 0. 15 lb/MMBtu NOx emissions when firing a high volatile Eastern or Western bituminous coal, Less than 0. 10 lb/MMBtu NOx emissions when firing a subbituminous coal, NOx reduction costs at least 25 % lower than the costs of an SCR, Validation of the NOx control technology developed through large (15 MWt) pilot scale demonstration, and Documentation required for economic evaluation and commercial application. During the project performance period, Alstom performed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and large pilot scale combustion testing in its Industrial Scale Burner Facility (ISBF) at its U. S. Power Plant Laboratories facility in Windsor, Connecticut in support of these objectives. The NOx reduction approach was to optimize near-field combustion to ensure that minimum NOx emissions are achieved with minimal impact on unburned carbon in <b>ash,</b> slagging and <b>fouling,</b> corrosion, and flame stability/turn-down. Several iterations of CFD and combustion testing on a Midwest coal led to an optimized design, which was extensively combustion tested on a range of coals. The data from these tests were then used to validate system costs and benefits versus SCR. Three coals were evaluated during the bench-scale and large pilot-scale testing tasks. The three coals ranged from a very reactive subbituminous coal to a moderately reactive Western bituminous coal to a much less reactive Midwest bituminous coal. Bench-scale testing was comprised of standard ASTM properties evaluation, plus more detailed characterization of fuel properties through drop tube furnace testing and thermogravimetric analysis. Bench-scale characterization of the three test coals showed that both NOx emissions and combustion performance are a strong function of coal properties. The more reactive coals evolved more of their fuel bound nitrogen in the substoichiometric main burner zone than less reactive coal, resulting in the potential for lower NOx emissions. From a combustion point of view, the more reactive coals also showed lower carbon in ash and CO values than the less reactive coal at any given main burner zone stoichiometry. According to bench-scale results, the subbituminous coal was found to be the most amenable to both low NOx, and acceptably low combustibles in the flue gas, in an air staged low NOx system. The Midwest bituminous coal, by contrast, was predicted to be the most challenging of the three coals, with the Western bituminous coal predicted to behave in-between the subbituminous coal and the Midwest bituminous coal. CFD modeling was used to gain insight into the mechanisms governing nozzle tip performance with respect to NOx emissions. The CFD simulations were run as steady state, turbulent, non-reacting flow with heat transfer and focused on predicting the near field mixing and particle dispersion rates. CFD results were used to refine the proposed tip concepts before they were built, as well as to help identify and evaluate possible improvements to the tips for subsequent test weeks...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Gasification {{provides}} a proven {{alternative to the}} dependence on petroleum {{for the production of}} high value products such as liquid fuels and chemicals. Syngas, the main product from gasification can be converted to fuels and chemicals via a number of possible synthesis processes. Coal and natural gas are currently the main feedstock used for syngas production. In South Africa (SA), Sasol operates the largest commercial coal-to-liquids conversion process in the world, based on updraft fixed bed gasification of low grade coal to syngas. Co-utilizing alternative and more sustainable feedstock (such as biomass and wastes) with coal in existing coal-based plants offers a realistic approach to reducing the costs and risks associated with setting up dedicated biomass conversion plants. An experimental and modelling investigation was performed to assess the impacts of co-gasifying two of the most commonly available agricultural wastes in SA (sugarcane bagasse and corn residue) with typical low grade SA coals, on the main products of updraft fixed bed gasification, i. e. liquid condensates and syngas. Condensates are produced in the pyrolysis section of the updraft gasifier, whereas syngas is a result of residual char conversion. An experimental set-up that simulates the pyrolysis section of the gasifier was employed to investigate the yield and composition of devolatilized products at industrially relevant conditions of 26 bars and 400 - 600 °C. The results show that about 15 wt% of coal and 70 wt% of biomass are devolatilized during the pyrolysis process. The biomass derived condensates were determined to comprise of significantly higher quantities of oxygenates such as organic acids, phenols, ketones, and alcohols, whereas coal derived hydrocarbon condensates were dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, creosotes and phenols. Results of investigation into the influence of coal-biomass feedstock mix ratio on yields of products from pyrolysis show limited evidence of non-additive or synergistic behaviour on the overall distribution of solid, liquid and gas yields. On the other hand, in terms of the distribution of specific liquid phase hydrocarbons, there was significant evidence in favour of non-additive pyrolysis behaviour, as indicated by the non-additive yield distribution of specific chemicals. Synergistic trends could also be observed in the thermogravimetric (TGA) study of pyrolysis under kinetically controlled non-isothermal conditions. Model free and model fitting kinetic analysis of the TGA data revealed activation energies ranging between 94 - 212 kJ mol- 1 for the biomass fuels and 147 - 377 kJ mol- 1 for coal. Synergistic interactions may be linked to the increased presence of hydrogen in biomass fuels which partially saturates free radicals formed during earlier stages of devolatilization, thereby preventing secondary recombination reactions that would have produced chars, allowing for the increased formation of volatile species instead. Analysis of char obtained from the co-pyrolysis experiments revealed that the fixed carbon and volatile content of the blended chars is is proportional to the percentage of biomass and coal in the mixture. CO 2 reactivity experiments on the chars showed that the addition of biomass to coal did not impose any kinetic limitation on the gasification of blended chars. The blended chars decomposed at approximately the same rate as when coal was gasified alone, even at higher biomass concentrations in the original feedstock blend. Based on these observations, a semi-empirical equilibrium based simulation of syngas production for co-gasification of coalbiomass blends at various mix ratios was developed using ASPEN Plus. The model showed that H 2 /CO ratio was relatively unaffected by biomass addition to the coal fuel mix, whereas syngas heating value and thermal efficiency were negatively affected. Subsequent evaluation of the production cost of syngas at biomass inputs ranging between 0 - 20 wt% of coal reflected the significant additional cost of pretreating biomass (3. 3 % of total capital investment). This resulted in co-gasification derived syngas production costs of ZAR 146 /tonne (ZAR 12. 6 /GJ) at 80 : 20 coalbiomass feedstock ratio, compared to a baseline (coal only) cost of ZAR 130 /tonne (ZAR 10. 7 /GJ). Sensitivity analysis that varied biomass costs from ZAR 0 ZAR 470 revealed that syngas production costs from co-gasification remained significantly higher than baseline costs, even at low to zero prices of the biomass feedstock. This remained the case even after taking account of a carbon tax of up to ZAR 117 /tCO 2. However, for range of carbon tax values suggested by the SA treasury (ZAR 70 tCO 2 to ZAR 200 tCO 2), the avoided carbon tax due to co-feeding biomass can offset between 40 - 96 % of the specific retrofitting cost at 80 : 20 coal-biomass feedstock mass ratio. In summary, this dissertation has showed that in addition to the widely recognized problems of <b>ash</b> <b>fouling</b> and sintering, co-feeding of biomass in existing coal based updraft gasification plants poses some challenges in terms of impacts on condensates and syngas quality, and production costs. Further research is required to investigate the potential in ameliorating some of these impacts by developing new high value product streams (such as acetic acid) from the significant fraction of condensates derived from biomass. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Vergassing bied 'n beproefde alternatief vir die afhanklikheid van petroleum vir die produksie van hoë waarde produkte soos vloeibare brandstof en chemikalieë. Sintese gas, die belangrikste produk van vergassing, kan omgeskakel word na brandstof en chemikalieë deur 'n aantal moontlike sintese prosesse. Steenkool en aardgas is tans die belangrikste grondstowwe wat gebruik word vir sintese gas produksie. In Suid-Afrika (SA) bedryf Sasol die grootste kommersiële steenkool-totvloeistof omskakelingsproses in die wêreld, gebaseer op stygstroom vastebed vergassing van laegraadse steenkool na sintese gas. Die gebruik van alternatiewe en meer volhoubare grondstowwe (soos biomassa en afval) saam met steenkool in die bestaande steenkool-gebaseerde aanlegte bied 'n realistiese benadering tot die vermindering van die koste en risiko's wat verband hou met die oprigting van toegewyde biomassa omskakelingsaanlegte. 'n Eksperimentele en modelleringsondersoek is uitgevoer om die impak van gesamentlike vergassing van twee van die mees algemeen beskikbare landbouafvalprodukte in Suid-Afrika (suikerriet bagasse en mieliereste) met tipiese laegraadse SA steenkool op die vernaamste produkte van stygstroom vastebed vergassing, dws vloeistof kondensate en sintese gas, te evalueer. Kondensate word geproduseer in die piroliese gedeelte van die stygstroomvergasser, terwyl sintese gas 'n resultaat is van die omskakeling van oorblywende houtskool. 'n Eksperimentele opstelling wat die piroliese gedeelte van die vergasser simuleer is gebruik om die opbrengs en die samestelling van produkte waarvan die vlugtige komponente verwyder is by industrie relevante toestande van 26 bar en 400 - 600 °C te ondersoek. Die resultate toon dat ongeveer 15 % (massabasis) van die steenkool en 70 % (massabasis) van die biomassa verlore gaan aan vlugtige komponente tydens die piroliese proses. Daar is vasgestel dat die kondensate afkomstig van biomassa uit aansienlik hoër hoeveelhede suurstofryke verbindings soos organiese sure, fenole, ketone, en alkohole bestaan, terwyl koolwaterstofkondensate afkomstig uit steenkool oorwegend bectaan uit polisikliese aromatise verbindings, kreosote en fenole. Die resultate van die ondersoek na die invloed van die verhouding van steenkool tot biomassa grondstof op piroliese opbrengste toon beperkte bewyse van nie-toevoegende of sinergistiese gedrag op die algehele verspreiding van soliede, vloeistof en gas opbrengste. Aan die ander kant, in terme van die verspreiding van spesifieke vloeibare fase koolwaterstowwe, was daar beduidende bewyse ten gunste van 'n sinergistiese piroliese gedrag. Sinergistiese tendense is ook waargeneem in die termogravimetriese (TGA) studie van piroliese onder kineties beheerde nieisotermiese toestande. Modelvrye en modelpassende kinetiese analise van die TGA data het aan die lig gebring dat aktiveringsenergieë wissel tussen 94 - 212 kJ mol- 1 vir biomassa brandstof en 147 - 377 kJ mol- 1 vir steenkool. Ontleding van die houtskool verkry uit die gesamentlike piroliese eksperimente het aan die lig gebring dat die onmiddellike kenmerke van die gemengde houtskool die geweegde gemiddelde van die individuele waardes vir steenkool en biomassa benader. CO 2 reaktiwiteitseksperimente op die houtskool het getoon dat die byvoeging van biomassa by steenkool nie enige kinetiese beperking op die vergassing van gemengde houtskool plaas nie. Die gemengde houtskool ontbind teen ongeveer dieselfde tempo as wanneer steenkool alleen vergas is, selfs teen hoër biomassa konsentrasies in die oorspronklike grondstofmengsel. Op grond van hierdie waarnemings is 'n semi-empiriese ewewig-gebaseerde simulasie van sintese gas produksie vir gesamentlike vergassing van steenkool-biomassa-mengsels vir verskeie mengverhoudings ontwikkel met behulp van Aspen Plus. Die model het getoon dat die H 2 /CO verhouding relatief min geraak is deur biomassa by die steenkool brandstofmengsel te voeg, terwyl sintese gas se verhittingswaarde en termiese doeltreffendheid negatief geraak is. Daaropvolgende evaluering van die produksiekoste van sintese gas vir biomassa insette wat wissel tussen 0 - 20 % (massabasis) van die hoeveelheid steenkool het die aansienlike addisionele koste van die vooraf behandeling van biomassa (3. 3 % van die totale kapitale belegging) gereflekteer. Dit het gelei tot 'n produksiekoste van ZAR 146 /ton (ZAR 12. 6 /GJ) vir sintese gas afkomstig uit gesamentlike-vergassing van 'n 80 : 20 steebkool-biomassa grondstof mengesl, in vergelyking met 'n basislyn (steenkool) koste van ZAR 130 /ton (ZAR 10. 7 /GJ). Sensitiwiteitsanalise wat biomassa koste van ZAR 0 - ZAR 470 gevarieër het, het aan die lig gebring dat sintese gas produksiekoste van gesamentlike vergassing aansienlik hoër bly as die basislyn koste, selfs teen 'n lae of nul prys van biomassa grondstof. Dit bly die geval selfs nadat koolstof belasting van tot ZAR 117 /tCO 2 in ag geneem is. In opsomming het hierdie verhandeling getoon dat, bykomend tot die wyd-erkende probleme van as besoedeling en sintering, die gesamentlike gebruik van biomassa in bestaande steenkool stygstroom vergassingsaanlegte groot uitdagings inhou in terme van die impak op die kwaliteit van kondensate en sintese gas, asook produksiekoste. Verdere navorsing is nodig om die potensiaal te ondersoek vir die verbetering van sommige van hierdie impakte deur die ontwikkeling van nuwe hoë waarde produkstrome (soos asynsuur) uit die beduidende breukdeel van kondensate wat verkry word uit biomassa...|$|E
