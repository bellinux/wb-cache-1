5|$|Following the {{resignation}} of CIA director George Tenet in 2004, Bush nominated Porter Goss to head the agency. The White House ordered Goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration. After Goss' appointment, many of the CIA's senior <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> fired or quit. The CIA {{has been accused of}} deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 election.|$|E
40|$|<b>Agents</b> <b>are</b> {{entities}} that act upon the world. Rational <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> {{those that do}} so in an intelligent fashion. What is essential to such an <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> the ability to select and perform actions. Actions are selected by planning, and performing such actions {{is a matter of}} plan execution.

5|$|On {{arrival at}} Port Louis on 18 June, the <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> {{confronted by a}} large body of heavily armed militia opposed to the {{abolition}} of slavery. Although they ordered Magallon to attack the islanders, the general refused and the <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> sent back to sea in a small corvette, eventually returning to Europe. Sercey remained in the East Indies, refitting his ships and joining his squadron to that already at Île de France. This force he divided, sending Preneuse and a corvette to patrol the Mozambique Channel. The remaining six frigates, comprising Vertu, Régénérée, Forte, Seine, Prudente and Cybèle, with the privateer schooner Alerte, Sercey took eastwards on 14 July, towards the Bay of Bengal.|$|E
5|$|All NIU Huskie {{sporting}} events, {{home and}} away, through Sunday were canceled. Most students left campus for the weekend. A {{spokesman for the}} ATF stated that <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> dispatched to the scene to assist and to help trace the weapons used. The FBI also sent agents to assist. According to police, Steven Kazmierczak removed the hard drive from his laptop computer and a computer chip from his cell phone and did not leave a note that could help explain why he chose a geology class on Valentine's Day to open fire. Investigators were expected {{to spend at least}} three more weeks until releasing a report on the incident.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1956 two FDA {{officials}} {{arrived at}} Orgonon {{to supervise the}} destruction of the accumulators. Most of them had been sold by that time and another 50 were with Silvert in New York. Only three were at Orgonon. The FDA <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> not allowed to destroy them, only to supervise the destruction, so Reich's friends and his son, Peter, chopped them up with axes as the agents watched. Once they were destroyed, Reich placed an American flag on top of them.|$|E
50|$|The Government of Madras was {{represented}} by a political agent. From 1800, when the first Political <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> appointed, till 1840, the Political <b>Agent</b> <b>was</b> usually the District Collector of Tanjore, from 1840 to 1865, the <b>Agent</b> <b>was</b> the Collector of Madurai and from 1865 to 1947 the <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> the Collector of Trichinopoly.

5|$|Prickly pear cacti were {{introduced}} into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, burning and crushing all proved ineffective. Two control <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> introduced to help control {{the spread of}} the plant, the cactus moth Cactoblastis cactorum, and the scale insect Dactylopius. Between 1926 and 1931, tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around Queensland with great success, and by 1932, most areas of prickly pear had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Rakočević, Sabolović, Radojčić and {{two other}} former KOS <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> tried in Belgrade in 1993. The five were charged with {{instigation}} of terrorism and other crimes, but all were acquitted. Radojčić was arrested again in Zagreb in late 1993. The second Trial of Radojčić and eight other suspects charged in connection with Operations Labrador and Opera, held in Zagreb, ended with the acquittal of Radojčić and Ratomir Mažibrada, who were in custody, and the convictions of the other defendants who were all tried in absentia.|$|E
5000|$|Ablative of <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> a more {{generalized}} {{version of}} the ablative of personal agent, used when the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> an inanimate object. When the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> a person, the preposition ā/ab is used, for example rēx ā mīlitibus interfectus est [...] "The king was killed by the soldiers"; but when the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> a thing, the preposition is omitted and the ablative case is sufficient, for example: rēx armīs mīlitum interfectus est [...] "the king was killed by the weapons of the soldiers".|$|R

30|$|Triadic {{patterns}} are groups {{in which all}} three <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> linked {{to each other in}} different ways. In the egalitarian triad (300), all links are reciprocated and of equal strength. In the collateral triad (120 D), only two <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> connected by a strong reciprocated link and the third <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> collaterally connected to them both by a strong incoming but non-reciprocated link. By contrast, in the broker triad (120 U), the two <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> connected to the third one by a strong outgoing link [a pattern known as tertius gaudens (Simmel 1964)]. This is a broker’s position, where a single <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> appreciated by a dyad and can thus influence the dyad.|$|R
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{complicated by the}} American spoils system. After Andrew Jackson assumed the U.S. presidency in March 1829, many competent Indian <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> replaced by unqualified Jackson loyalists, argues historian John Hall. Men like Thomas Forsyth, John Marsh, and Thomas McKenney were replaced by less qualified men such as Felix St. Vrain. In the 19th century, historian Lyman Draper argued that the Black Hawk War {{could have been avoided}} had Forsyth remained as the agent to the Sauks.|$|E
5|$|After {{some time}} off to recover in Zwittau, Schindler was {{promoted}} to second in command of his Abwehr unit and relocated with his wife to Ostrava, on the Czech-Polish border, in January 1939. He was involved in espionage {{in the months leading}} up to Hitler's seizure of the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March. Emilie helped him with paperwork, processing and hiding secret documents in their apartment for the Abwehr office. As he frequently travelled to Poland on business, he and his 25 <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> in a position to collect information about Polish military activities and railways for the planned invasion of Poland. One assignment called for his unit to monitor and provide information about the railway line and tunnel in the Jablunkov Pass, deemed critical for the movement of German troops. Schindler continued to work for Abwehr until as late as fall 1940, when he was sent to Turkey to investigate corruption among the Abwehr officers assigned to the German embassy there.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1941, Tronstad {{was aware}} that heavy water {{production}} at Vemork had greatly increased. In the beginning, Tronstad had not {{been aware of the}} connection between heavy water and atomic weaponry, but it eventually became clear that Germany could be running a nuclear energy project, especially after Harold Urey visited the United Kingdom in November 1941. Tronstad later learned from Jomar Brun that further expansion of heavy water production was being discussed. Brun had been a part of a small conference on the issue, hosted by Kurt Diebner in Berlin, in January 1942. Brun would later communicate with England through Einar Skinnarland, a covert Special Operations Executive agent hailing from Rjukan. In October 1942, Brun was summoned to England, reportedly at the request of Winston Churchill. Instead, a team of <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> parachuted into the area to gather more intelligence, under the codename Operation Grouse.|$|E
50|$|In general, some, but not all, <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> {{federal law}} {{enforcement}} officers, and hold either arrest authority or the right to conduct minor criminal/non-criminal investigations. In some agencies, however, an agent can have both arrest and minor criminal/non-criminal investigatory authority, yet still have no authority to conduct major criminal investigations. On the other hand, nearly all special <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> {{federal law enforcement}} officers, are distinctly empowered to conduct both major and minor criminal investigations, and hold arrest authority. Most special <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> authorized to carry firearms both on and off-duty, whereas only some <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> authorized to do so. The title of special <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> almost exclusively used in federal law enforcement (United States) for federal criminal investigators.|$|R

5|$|As {{the months}} passed, and the privations in Constantinople increased, the pro-Kantakouzenos faction {{in the capital}} grew as the Empress refused even to {{consider}} negotiations. Twice <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> sent to assassinate Kantakouzenos, but they failed. The Empress eventually fell out with Patriarch John Kalekas, who was deposed in a synod on 2 February 1347. On the same night, supporters of Kantakouzenos opened the disused Golden Gate, and Kantakouzenos entered the city with 1,000 men. Meeting no resistance, his troops surrounded the Palace of Blachernae, the imperial residence, the next morning, but the Empress refused to surrender for several days, still fearful of the fate that awaited her. Kantakouzenos' men grew impatient and stormed part of the palace complex, and John V persuaded his mother to accept a settlement.|$|E
5|$|At Eurocorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead {{and send}} him to be rebooted while they plan to {{retrieve}} Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6. Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a Eurocorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of Eurocorp's <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to Eurocorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping {{to use it to}} make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was naïve to think that way.|$|E
5|$|Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan Hance (Jeremy Roberts), {{a serial}} killer Black had helped to {{apprehend}} twenty years before. Hance was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked up during his tours of duty. Black {{was one of a}} number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who responded to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location — however, the tip was called in by Hance himself and the raid became an ambush. Three <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> killed, and Black was cornered by Hance, who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the young Black was able to overpower and arrest him.|$|E

5|$|For his part, Minh resented that he {{had been}} deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot {{for as long as he}} could, and then tried to revive it by claiming that French <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not aware of any such threat.|$|E
5|$|In late December {{and early}} January, student demonstrations in South Vietnam were held against {{neutralism}} and French President Charles de Gaulle, who advocated {{the removal of}} the Americans and negotiations between the two Vietnams. The Council of Notables had accused the provisional government and junta of having an uncertain stance on the issue and went as far as to recommend that South Vietnam suspend diplomatic relations with France. The rumors and crisis heightened when a reputed French agent, Lieutenant Colonel Tran Dinh Lan suddenly returned to Saigon after several years in France. He had served in both the French and Vietnamese National Army and had brought with him several million US dollars worth of South Vietnamese piasters. Lan moved into the home of one of Kim's top aides, fuelling speculation that French <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> being systematically brought into the capital. Such rumors served to spread the belief that a French-sponsored neutralist deal was imminent and gave the conspirators an opportunity to act.|$|E
5|$|It {{was soon}} {{established}} {{that some of}} the pirates were from Cabo Rojo, since they disembarked there. Undercover <b>agents</b> <b>were</b> sent to the town to track them, and new mayor Juan Font y Soler requested resources to deal with a larger group which was out of control. Links between the pirates and local sympathizers made arresting them difficult. The central government, frustrated with Cabo Rojo's inefficiency, demanded the pirates' capture and western Puerto Rico military commander José Rivas was ordered to exert pressure on local authorities. Although Cofresí was tracked to the beach in Peñones, near his brothers' homes in Guaniquilla, the operation only recovered the Johns sails, meat, flour, cheese, lard, butter and candles; the pirates escaped aboard a schooner. A detachment caught Juan José Mateu and charged him with conspiracy; his confession linked Cofresí to the two hijackings.|$|E
