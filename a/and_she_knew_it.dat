2500|$|One Ojibwa {{woman from}} the far western end of Lake Superior, Oshahgushkodanaqua, who married in 1793 John Johnston, a British fur trader based in Sault St. Marie working for the North West Company, later gave an account in her old age of how she came {{to be married to}} a British writer named Anna Brownell Jameson. According to Jameson's 1838 book Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada, Oshahgushkodanaqua told her when she was 13, she {{embarked}} on her [...] "vision quest" [...] to find her guardian spirit by fasting alone in a lodge painted black on a high hill. During Oshahgushkodanaqua's [...] "vision quest": [...] "She dreamed continually of a white man, who approached her with a cup in his hand, saying [...] "Poor thing! Why are you punishing yourself? Why do you fast? Here is food for you!" [...] He was always accompanied by a dog, who looked up at her like he knew her. Also, she dreamed of being on a high hill, which was surrounded by water, and from which she beheld many canoes full of Indians, coming to her and paying her homage; after this, {{she felt as if she}} was being carried up into the heavens, and as she looked down on the earth, she perceived it was on fire and said to herself, [...] "All my relations will be burned!", but a voice answered and said, [...] "No, they will not be destroyed, they will be saved!", <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was a spirit, because the voice was not human. She fasted for ten days, during which time her grandmother brought her at intervals some water. When satisfied that she had obtained a guardian spirit in the white stranger who haunted her dreams, she returned to her father's lodge". About five years later, Oshahgushkodanaqua first met Johnston, who asked to marry her, but was refused permission by her father who did not think he wanted a long-term relationship. When Johnston returned the next year and again asked to marry Oshahgushkodanaqua, her father granted permission, but she herself declined, saying she disliked the implications of being married until death, but ultimately married under strong pressure from her father. Oshahgushkodanaqua came to embrace her marriage when she decided that Johnston was the white stranger she saw in her dreams during her vision quest. The couple stayed married for 36 years with the marriage ending with Johnston's death, and Oshahgushkodanaqua played an important role in her husband's business career. Jameson also noted Oshahgushkodanaqua was considered to be a strong woman among the Ojibwa, writing [...] "in her youth she hunted and was accounted the surest eye and fleetest foot among the women of her tribe".|$|E
