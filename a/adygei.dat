5000|$|The Circassians {{refer to}} {{themselves}} as Adyghe (also transliterated as Adyga, Adyge, <b>Adygei,</b> Adyghe, Attéghéi).

It is spoken by various tribes of the Adyghe people: Abzekh, Adamey, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, Temirgoy, Mamkhegh, Natekuay, Shapsug, Zhaney and Yegerikuay, each with its own dialect. The language is referred to by its speakers as Adygebze or Adəgăbză, and alternatively transliterated in English as Adygean, Adygeyan or <b>Adygei.</b> The literary language is based on the Temirgoy dialect.|$|E
50|$|Local mullahs {{and some}} chiefs favored resettlement, {{because they felt}} oppressed by the Russian administration. They feared {{that in order to}} gain full Russian {{citizenship}} they would have to convert to Christianity. Additionally, local chieftains were keen to preserve their ancient privileges and feudal rights that had been abolished throughout the Russian Empire by the Emancipation Manifesto in 1861. The obligatory conscription was also among the factors that worried these populations, although in fact they would never have been made subject to military draft. Of those Circassian chiefs who favoured resettlement mainly came from the Abzakh tribe who moved their people to new lands in the north from where they previously lived. It is from the Abzakh tribe that most of the remaining Circassians stem from and comprise the titular nation of the modern day <b>Adygei</b> Republic in Russia. Other Circassian chiefs from different tribes who were also gathered at a meeting (1861) with Tsar Alexander II in the Russian town of Yekaterinodar, and promised to accept Russian rule if Cossacks and Russian soldiers were removed from Circassia, beyond the Kuban and Laba rivers. The Russians rejected the Circassian proposal. Those chiefs refused Russian proposals to move their people out of their ancestral lands.|$|E
5000|$|According to a 2012 {{study on}} ethnic Turkish people, [...] "Turkish {{population}} has a close genetic similarity to Middle Easternand European populations and {{some degree of}} similarity to South Asian and Central Asian populations." [...] At K = 3 level, using individuals from the Middle East (Druze and Palestinian), Europe (French, Italian, Tuscan and Sardinian) to obtatin a more representative database for Central Asia (Uygur, Hazara and Kyrgyz), clustering {{results indicated that the}} contributions were 45%, 40% and 15% for the Middle Eastern, European and Central Asian populations, respectively. For K = 4 level, results for paternal ancestry were 38% European, 35% Middle Eastern, 18% South Asian and 9% Central Asian. K= 7 results of paternal ancestry were 77% European, 12% South Asian, 4% Middle Eastern, 6% Central Asian. However, Hodoglugil et al. caution that results may indicate previous population movements (e.g. migration, admixture) or genetic drift, given Europe and South Asia have some genetic relatedness. The study indicated that the Turkish genetic structure is unique, and admixture of Turkish people reflects the population migration patterns. Among all sampled groups, the <b>Adygei</b> population (Circassians) from the Caucasus was closest to the Turkish samples among sampled European (French, Italian), Middle Eastern (Druze, Palestinian), and Central (Kyrgyz, Hazara, Uygur), South (Pakistani), and East Asian (Mongolian, Han) populations.|$|E

Of interest were the data of how the self-administration of the different population categories {{in the second half of}} the 19 th century was realized, when the question came up of the highland nobility rights equialization with the rights of the Russian noblemen, for what the considerable part of the highland aristocracy stroke vigorously. The description of class gradation of the highland societies, such as Kabardinian, <b>Adygei,</b> Ossetian is given. Caucasian noblemen were nothing more than the petty liegemen of the princes. By the end of the 19 th century the class division preserved its value only in everyday life: each family name bore the stamp of its origin...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{variation}} in CYP 3 A activity {{may influence the}} rate of the metabolism and elimination of CYP 3 A substrates in humans. We previously reported four new CYP 3 A 4 coding variants in three different racial groups. In the present study, we examined metabolism of nifedipine by the recombinant forms of these allelic variants. Metabolism of nifedipine by the L 293 P (CYP 3 A 4 * 18), M 445 T (CYP 3 A 4 * 3), and P 467 S (CYP 3 A 4 * 19) al-lelic variants was not significantly different from wild-type CYP 3 A 4 * 1. However, F 189 S (CYP 3 A 4 * 17) exhibited a 99 % decrease in both Vmax and CLmax of nifedipine compared with CYP 3 A 4 * 1. Of 72 racially diverse individuals, CYP 3 A 4 * 17 was identified in 1 of 24 Caucasian samples [1 : 5 Eastern European (<b>Adygei</b> ethnic group) ]. Genotyping of an extended set of 276 genomic DNAs of Caucasians (100 from the Coriell Repositor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract We have {{surveyed}} 15 high-altitude adaptation candidate {{genes for}} signals of positive selection in North Caucasian highlanders using targeted re-sequencing. A total of 49 unrelated Daghestani from three ethnic groups (Avars, Kubachians, and Laks) living in ancient villages located at around 2, 000 m {{above sea level}} were chosen as the study population. Caucasian (<b>Adygei</b> living at sea level, N = 20) and CEU (CEPH Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe; N = 20) were used as controls. Candidate genes were compared with 20 puta-tively neutral control regions resequenced in the same individuals. The regions of interest were amplified by long-PCR, pooled according to individual, indexed by adding an eight-nucleotide tag, and sequenced using the Illumina GAII platform. 1, 066 SNPs were called using false dis-covery and false negative thresholds of * 6 %. The neutral regions provided an empirical null distribution to compare with the candidate genes for signals of selection. Two genes stood out. In Laks, a non-synonymous variant within HIF 1 A already known {{to be associated with}} improvement in oxygen metabolism was rediscovered, and in Kuba-chians a cluster of 13 SNPs located in a conserved intronic region within EGLN 1 showing high population differenti-ation was found. These variants illustrate both the common pathways of adaptation to high altitude in different popu-lations and features specific to the Daghestani populations, showing how even a mildly hypoxic environment can lead to genetic adaptation...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} Master Thesis {{refers to}} the results of the research work carried out at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK, under the direct supervision of Dr. Chris Tyler-Smith, Head of the Human Evolution Team. The aim of the study is to ascertain signals of positive selection in human populations living at high altitude using targeted next-generation DNA re-sequencing of candidate genes and control regions in 96 individuals. For this purpose 55 Daghestani from three ethnic groups were selected as case populations living at high altitudes (> 2, 000 msl). <b>Adygei</b> (n = 20), CEU (n = 20) and 1 chimpanzee sample were used as controls. The Daghestani populations {{have a long history of}} permanence (> 10. 000 years) at high altitudes and their peculiar demographic history make them suitable for hypoxia adaptation studies. In order to disentangle selective and demographic effects on the genome, fifteen candidate genes involved in oxygen metabolism (HIF 1 α; PHD 1; PHD 2; PHD 3; VHL; EPO; EPOr; VEGF; EDN 1; NOS 3; ACE; α,β,γ,δ-Hb) were sequenced together with twenty-seven “control regions” selected among those used in the Hominid Project (Wall, Cox et al. 2008) and the ENCODE 3 Project ([URL] DNA samples obtained from whole blood or cell cultures were used to amplify the targeted genomic regions by long-template PCR. The amplimers were visualized by gel electrophoresis and those belonging to the same individuals were pooled together and subsequently purifiedusing the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. Each pooled sample was indexed by adding an eight nucleotides tag, and 8 samples were combined and sequenced on each lane of an Illumina flow-cel. The sequenced DNA was sorted and aligned to the reference sequence using the MAQ algorithm (Li, Ruan et al. 2008). Parameters checking the goodness of the sequencing outputs as well as summary statistics and neutrality tests (Tajima’s D, Fu and Li’s D and F, Fay and Wu’s H) were calculated on “PHASED” haplotype data. Candidate targets of positive selection (re-sequenced genes) and neutral regions were analyzed for putative signals of adaptation to hypoxia and several novel SNPs characterized. Particularly, four non synonymous mutations were found responsible for altering the functionality of HIF 1 α, ACE, EPOr and NOS 3 and could be considered as putative candidate for hypoxia adaptation...|$|E
