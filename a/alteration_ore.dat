40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of pilot mineral potential mapping project undertaken for cu-priferous volcanic-hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) mineralisation in Cyprus. Mineral poten-tial or prospectivity maps are a digital extension to traditional geochemical, geophysical and geological exploration methodologies. They are constructed using statistical modelling tech-niques (e. g. weights of evidence, fuzzy logic) and use mineral deposit models and spatial digi-tal data. Mineral deposit models can be empirically based, comprising a catalogue of charac-teristic features, such as host-rock lithology, deposit form (vein, stockwork), <b>alteration,</b> <b>ore</b> mineralogy etc. Deposit models may also be genetic or conceptual. Here, they describe min-eralisation in terms of formation processes such as fluid chemistry, temperature and metal precipitation mechanisms. The best are, however, an amalgamation of empirical information and genetic concepts—a typical example would be that developed by Hedenquist et al. (1996) for epithermal mineralisation. The mineral deposit model aids in selecting the most appropriate input data themes and the statistical methods are used to integrate the various data layers to produce the mineral potential map. This study focuses on Cu-bearing VHMS mineralisation in one of its type localities - the Troodos ophiolite - and utilises digital geologi-cal, structural and geophysical maps, along with mineral alteration maps derived from ASTER satellite data, to produce a prospectivity map that identifies new exploration targets...|$|E
40|$|The Kago deposit {{is a small}} deposit {{located at}} the {{southern}} tip of the Satsuma Peninsula of Southern Kyushu, Japan. It lies proximal to the well-known Nansatsu-type mineralisation province dominated by high-sulfidation type epithermal deposits. The deposit was heavily mined in the 18  th Century, largely for its relatively higher gold compared to that of surrounding and regional deposits. The Kago deposit is a typical low-sulfidation deposit, characterised by adularia-quartz veins, composed of electrum, Ag-tetrahedrite, polybasite, chalcopyrite and pyrite. Based on mine records, the grade ranged from 4. 1 to 13. 3  g/t Au and 2. 6 – 6. 6  g/t Ag. Alteration grades from low to high temperature argillic into a propylitic zone at the extremes of the vein exposures. Carbonate is absent. Fluid inclusion microthermometry reveals a typical temperature range of 220 – 240  °C with salinity of 0. 7 – 2. 6 NaCl eq. wt%. Electrum from high-grade ore ranges from 66 to 69  wt% Au. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age dating of adularia bearing colloform/crustiform and brecciated veins, suggests a mineralisation event from 4. 23 to 4. 0  Ma. δ 18 O of veined and silicified quartz ranges from + 4. 0 to + 18. 4 ‰. δ 18 OH 2 O of fluids in equilibrium with quartz, in the dominant range of measured fluid inclusion temperatures, ranges from − 6. 5 ‰ to − 0. 2 ‰. δ 34 S of pyrite has a narrow range from − 1. 8 to 2. 7 ‰. The deposit lies at the northern extent of the classic Nansatsu high-sulfidation epithermal area, in which a number of silicified bodies punctuate the region in a roughly semi-circular shape. The Kago deposit lies within the principle mineralisation age range of the high-sulfidation deposits, which range from 5. 5 to 3. 7  Ma. The structural displacement of the Kago deposit from the Nansatsu mineralisation and the differing host rocks has greatly influenced <b>alteration,</b> <b>ore</b> and rock-water interaction of the ore depositing fluids. Here we seek to establish the relationship that this extended mineral province has between the differing styles of mineralisation...|$|E
40|$|The Ernest Henry Cu–Au deposit {{was formed}} within a zoned, {{post-peak}} metamorphic hydrothermal system that overprinted metamorphosed dacite, andesite and diorite (ca 1740 – 1660 Ma). The Ernest Henry hydrothermal system {{was formed by}} two cycles of sodic and potassic alteration where biotite–magnetite alteration produced in the first cycle formed ca 1514 ± 24 Ma, whereas paragenetically later Na–Ca veining formed ca 1529 + 11 /− 8 Ma. These new U–Pbtitanite age dates support textural evidence for incursion of hydrothermal fluids after the metamorphic peak, and overlap with earlier estimates for the timing of Cu–Au mineralization (ca 1540 – 1500 Ma). A distal to proximal potassic alteration zone correlates with a large (up to 1. 5 km) K–Fe–Mn–Ba enriched alteration zone that overprints earlier sodic alteration. Mass balance analysis indicates that K–Fe–Mn–Ba alteration—largely produced during pre-ore biotite- and magnetite-rich alteration—is associated with K–Rb–Cl–Ba–Fe–Mn and As enrichment and Na, Ca and Sr depletion. The aforementioned chemical exchange almost precisely counterbalances the mass changes associated with regional Na–Ca alteration. This initial transition from sodic to potassic alteration may have been formed during {{the evolution of a}} single fluid that evolved via alkali exchange during progressive fluid-rock interaction. Cu–Au ore, dominated by co-precipitated magnetite, minor specular hematite, and chalcopyrite as breccia matrix, forms a pipe-like body at the core of a proximal alteration zone dominated by K-feldspar alteration. Both the core and K-feldspar alteration overprint Na–Ca alteration and biotite–magnetite (K–Fe) <b>alteration.</b> <b>Ore</b> was associated with the concentration of a diverse range of elements (e. g. Cu, Au, Fe, Mo, U, Sb, W, Sn, Bi, Ag, F, REE, K, S, As, Co, Ba and Ca). Mineralization also involved the deposition of significant barite, K(–Ba) –feldspar, calcite, fluorite and complexly zoned pyrite. The complexly zoned pyrite and variable K–(Ba) –feldspar versus barite associations are interpreted to indicate fluctuating sulphur and/or barium supply. Together with the alteration zonation geochemistry and overprinting criteria, these data are interpreted to indicate that Cu–Au mineralization occurred as a result of fluid mixing during dilation and brecciation, in the location of the most intense initial potassic alteration. A link between early alteration (Na–Ca and K–Fe) and the later K-feldspathization and the Cu–Au ore is possible. However, the ore-related enrichments in particular elements (especially Ba, Mn, As, Mo, Ag, U, Sb and Bi) are so extreme compared with earlier alteration that another fluid, possibly magmatic in origin, contributed the diverse element suite geochemically independently of the earlier stages. Structural focussing of successive stages produced the distinctive alteration zoning, providing a basis both for exploration for similar deposits, and for an understanding of ore genesis...|$|E

40|$|The Mule Canyon mine {{exploited}} shallow, low-sulfidation, epithermal Au-Ag deposits {{that lie}} near {{the west side}} of the Northern Nevada rift in northern Lander County, Nevada. Mule Canyon consists of six small de-posits that contained premining reserves of about 8. 2 Mt at an average grade of 3. 81 g Au/tonne. It is an un-common mafic end member of low-sulfidation Au-Ag deposits associated with tholeiitic bimodal basalt-rhyo-lite magmatism. The ore is hosted by a basalt-andesite eruptive center that formed between about 16. 4 to 15. 8 Ma during early mafic eruptions related to regionally extensive bimodal magmatism. Hydrothermal <b>alteration</b> and Au-Ag <b>ores</b> formed at about 15. 6 Ma and were tightly controlled by north-northwest- to north-striking high-angle fault and breccia zones developed during rifting, emplacement of mafic dikes, and eruption of mafic lava flows.

All alteration types con-tain abundant pyrite and/or marcasite ± arsenopyrite. Field relations indicate that silica-adularia alteration is superimposed on argillic and propylitic alteration.

40|$|The Martabe gold district, {{situated}} on the north-west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, consists of four high-sulfidation epithermal gold-silver deposits over an 8 km strike length: Purnama, Baskara, Kejora and Gerhana and one low-sulfidation epithermal gold-silver deposit, Pelangi. Resources have been estimated for the three principal known deposits, Purnama, Baskara and Pelangi. Resources (inferred, indicated and measured) are 91. 2 Mt @ 1. 5 ppm Au and 19 ppm Ag for Purnama, 36. 6 Mt @ 1. 0 ppm Au and 4 ppm Ag for Baskara, and 10. 4 Mt @ 1. 1 ppm Au for Pelangi. Reserves (proved and probable) are based on an optimized open-pit mine design which extends approximately 900 m north-south along strike; total Purnama reserves are identifying 35. 7 Mt @ 1. 9 ppm gold and 26 ppm Ag. Martabe {{is located in the}} western Sunda Banda magmatic arc within and adjacent to a Late Tertiary porphyritic dacite and andesite dome and diatreme complex that was emplaced into a volcano-sedimentary sequence comprising interlayered sandstone, siltstone, carbonaceous mudstone and andesite lava flows. Martabe is located near a series of fault splays of the Sumatra Fault System and this structural framework has {{played an important role in}} the formation of the deposits. At Martabe there are a wide variety of distinctive breccias within the dome and diatreme complex. The origins and processes of these breccias are varied and include phreatomagmatic, phreatic, tectonic and hydraulic brecciation. Recognition of stratified and unstratified breccias, base surge deposits and overlying airfall tuffs indicate that the initial setting was a maar volcanic field, containing multiple diatreme vents. Intrusion of felsic magma into a fault-bounded block of brecciated carbonaceous mudstone (part of Sumatran Fault System) within an active hydrothermal system resulted in phreatomagmatic brecciation at Martabe. The presence of juvenile magmatic clasts with delicate wispy texture and cuspate margins, in situ rhyolite clasts associated with dacitic-andesitic dykes and base surge (stratified breccia) deposits are the key pieces of evidence for a phreatomagmatic origin. The flow dome complex formed at ca. 3. 8 ± 0. 5 Ma (quartz-phyric dacite, U-Pb method) and 3. 1 ± 0. 4 to 2. 8 ± 0. 3 Ma (hornblende-phyric andesite, U-Pb method), and extensive alteration closely followed emplacement of the domes at 3. 30 ± 0. 11 to 2. 14 ± 0. 10 Ma (alunite, K-Ar method). These periods of hydrothermal activity indicate the magmatic/hydrothermal system was active from 3. 8 to 2. 1 Ma and the main-stage alteration occurred within 0. 5 – 0. 8 Ma of dome emplacement. All identified economic and sub-economic gold-silver mineralization of the district displays a zonal pattern of alteration typical of high-sulfidation epithermal systems, with the presence a low-sulfidation epithermal system at the periphery (i. e., Pelangi). In general, the alteration at Martabe consists of siliceous (quartz dominant), advanced argillic (alunitic and kaolinitic), argillic and propylitic alteration. The ‘alunitic’ alteration assemblage consists of quartz+alunite±dickite/kaolinite±pyrite; the ‘kaolinitic’ assemblage refers to quartz+kaolinite/dickite±alunite±pyrite; the argillic assemblage contains illite-smectite-pyrite+quartz; and the propylitic assemblage consists of chlorite+epidote+calcite ±illite/sericite±pyrite±quartz. Alteration is typically zoned from a core of brecciated, massive and vuggy quartz (siliceous alteration) that grades outwards through advanced argillic alteration (alunitic and kaolinitic) to argillic alteration that is surrounded by a peripheral zone of pervasive propylitic alteration. Economic mineralization is hosted within the siliceous and advanced argillic alteration zones. The alteration zones most likely occurred as multiple stages and formed contemporaneously with the Martabe dome magmatism. The majority of epithermal Au-Ag mineralization in the district is characterized as high-sulfidation, based on the sulfide and sulfosalt mineral assemblage and advanced argillic <b>alteration.</b> <b>Ore</b> mineralization consists of enargite-luzonite+tetrahedrite-tennantite-pyrite in veins, vugs and as breccia matrix. Jarosite, hematite and goethite are the most common products of oxidation. Gold is present as micron-sized native gold grains associated with quartz, Fe-oxides, enargite-luzonite, tetrahedrite-tennantite and covellite-digenite. Purnama consists of disseminated Au-Ag mineralization distributed sub-horizontally within and adjacent to the western perimeter of the diatreme with both strong lithological and structural control. A quartz matrix-supported breccia contains the majority of high-grade ore, although lower grade mineralized zones occur within pervasive advanced argillic-alunitic altered breccias and advanced argillic-kaolinitic altered andesite. At Baskara and Kejora, mineralization is sub-vertical and spatially associated with phreatic and phreatomagmatic breccia bodies emplaced along NE-striking faults. The best gold mineralization occurs at the contact between breccia bodies and the dacite-andesite dome. At Pelangi, gold- and silver-bearing, low-sulfidation, quartz veins and stockworks cross-cut the advanced argillic alteration. At Gerhana, the mineralization are with both lithology and structural controls and are likely similar to Purnama. Results of a LA-ICP-MS study of trace-element mineral chemistry in pyrite and enargite indicate significant variability in trace-element compositions, particularly in Fe, Te, Bi, Sn, Se, Au, Pb, Mo, W and Ba. Three generations of pyrite are recognized. An early stage of well-crystallized pyrite (stage- 1) is enclosed by fine (submicron) overgrowths of second stage of poorly crystalline pyrite (stage- 2). The stage- 1 cores have relatively low trace element concentrations. Conversely, the stage- 2 pyrites contain an abundant variety of trace elements with high concentrations. Stage- 3 pyrite occurs as filling vugs or fractures and encompasses stage- 1 and stage- 2 pyrite. Stage- 3 pyrite has a similar range of trace elements as stage 2 but at lower concentrations. In general, the most abundant trace elements in enargite are those that also form discrete sulfosalt, selenide and telluride accessory phases. Enargite in the Purnama and Gerhana deposits is enriched in Au, Se and Te. The sequence of events that formed the Martabe diatreme/dome complex and associated alteration and mineralisation is interpreted to be: (i) Down faulting of pre-Miocene sedimentary units. (ii) Intrusion of felsic magma along existing structures. Interaction of meteoric water with magma initiated early hydrothermal convection (low-sulfidation fluid). Formation of argillic and propylitic alteration. (iii) Felsic intrusions continued to move up along the existing faults and triggered phreatomagmatic and phreatic eruptions (diatreme formation). (iv) Phreatomagmatic eruptions continued to excavate the conduit and widen the diatreme producing multiple crosscutting breccias. (v) High temperature, extremely acid (high-sulfidation) fluids from condensation of magmatic volatiles caused advanced argillic alteration. No precious-metal mineralization accompanied this alteration. (vi) The hydrothermal system returned to convection of meteoric water (low-sulfidation fluid). Formation of Au-Ag-bearing, quartz-chalcedony veins. (vii) Intrusion of dacite and hornblende andesite into the diatreme creating the dome complex. Triggering of phreatomagmatic and phreatic eruptions. (viii) Domes interacted with meteoric water causing hydrothermal convection of a low-sulfidation fluid with overpressure leading to hydrothermal brecciation. (ix) Introduction of magmatic, metal-rich, high-sulfidation fluid depositing Cu-Au mineralization (disseminated and fracture-controlled pyrite-enargite-luzonite-tennantite-tetrahedrite). (x) Late-stage phreatic brecciation. (xi) Oxidation, erosion and weathering. The Martabe Au-Ag deposits show a complex interplay of intrusive events, phreatomagmatic, phreatic, and hydrothermal brecciation and differing stages of hydrothermal (low- and high-sulfidation) fluid introduction. The superposition of both high- and low-sulfidation mineralizing events increases the precious metal content of the mineralization, and adds to the overall exploration potential of the district...|$|E

Host rocks to the deposit as well as the ores and altered rocks were metamorphosed and affected by heterogeneous ductile strain during the Svecokarelian orogeny the total duration of which was 2. 0 – 1. 8 Ga. These processes both reworked the mineral assemblages of the original hydrothermal alteration system and reshaped the structural geometry of the deposit, following formation of the ores and the associated hydrothermal alteration. In order to study primary geological and ore-forming processes at Falun, it is necessary firstly to investigate the nature of the tectonothermal modification. In this licentiate thesis, a three-dimensional modelling approach is used in order to evaluate geometric relationships between lithologies at the deposit. This study demonstrates the polyphase character (D 1 and D 2) of the strong ductile deformation at Falun. The major rock-forming minerals in the silicate alteration rocks are quartz, biotite/phlogopite, cordierite, anthophyllite, chlorite, and minor almandine and andalusite. On the basis of microstructural investigations, it is evident that these minerals grew during distinct periods in the course of the tectonic evolution, with major static grain growth between D 1 and D 2, and also after D 2. Furthermore, the occurrence of F 2 sheath folds along steeply south-south-east plunging axes is suggested as a key deformation mechanism, forming cylindrical, rod-shaped ore bodies which pinch out at depth. The sheath folding also accounts for the same stratigraphic level (footwall) on both the eastern and western sides of the massive sulphide ores. A major, sulphide-bearing high-strain zone defines a tectonic boundary at the deposit and bounds the massive sulphide ores to the north. The geological evolution in the Falun area involved emplacement of felsic sub-volcanic intrusive and volcanic rocks and some carbonate sedimentation; followed by hydrothermal <b>alteration,</b> <b>ore</b> formation and the intrusion of dykes and plutons of variable composition after burial of the supracrustal rocks. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) U-Pb (zircon) geochronology of key lithologies in and around the Falun base metal sulphide deposit indicates a rapid sequence of development of different magmatic pulses with individual age determinations overlapping within their uncertainties. The intense igneous activity, as well as the feldspar-destructive hydrothermal alteration and ore formation are constrained by two 207 Pb- 206 Pb weighted average (zircon) ages of 1894 ± 3 Ma for a sub-volcanic host rock not affected by this type of alteration and 1891 ± 3 Ma for a felsic dyke, which cross-cuts the hydrothermally altered zone and is also unaffected by this alteration. All other ages, including the granitic plutonic rocks, fall in the interval between these ages. The lithological, structural and geochronological observations have implications for the environment and the conditions of ore formation at the Falun deposit. Several aspects argue for an ore system resembling a classic volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) system in terms of type of alteration, metal zonation, the pyritic character of massive sulphides and an inferred vent-proximal location in relation to the convection-driving magmatic system. The bowl-shaped, sub-seafloor feeder part of such a system might have served as an initial inhomogeneity in the strata for the later development of strong stretching along steep axes and sheath fold formation during ductile strain. Possible discordant relationships along the margins of the massive sulphide ores, coupled with the syn-magmatic, pre-tectonic timing of ore formation are in accordance with a general VMS-type model for the Falun base metal sulphide deposit. These results provide a compromise solution to the previous debate around two opposing models of strictly syn-genetic vs. epigenetic, post-deformational carbonate-replacement processes for ore formation at the deposit. The Falun pyritic Zn-Pb-Cu-(Au-Ag) sulphide deposit, {{situated in the}} Palaeoproterozoic (1. 9 – 1. 8 Ga) Bergslagen lithotectonic unit in the south-western part of the Fennoscandian Shield, {{is one of the major}} base and minor precious metal sulphide deposits in Sweden.

The sheath folding also accounts for the same stratigraphic level on both the eastern and western sides of the massive sulphide ores. A major, sulphide-bearing high-strain zone defines a tectonic boundary inside the deposit and bounds the massive sulphide ores to the north. A precursor to this zone can have played a central role as a metal-bearing fluid conduit during ore genesis, prior to reactivation of the zone in the ductile regime. The geological evolution in the Falun area involved emplacement of felsic volcanic and sub-volcanic rocks and some carbonate sedimentation, followed by ore formation and hydrothermal alteration as well as the intrusion of dykes and plutons of variable composition. U-Pb zircon geochronology of key lithologies in and around the Falun base metal sulphide deposit indicates a rapid sequence of development of different magmatic phases with individual age determinations overlapping within their uncertainties. The igneous activity is constrained between a zircon U-Pb concordia age of 1899 ± 7 Ma for a sub-volcanic host rock and a zircon 207 Pb- 206 Pb weighted average age of 1891 ± 3 Ma for a felsic dyke, with all other reliable ages, including the quartz-rich plutonic rocks, falling in the interval between them. This interval also included the hydrothermal alteration and ore formation at Falun. It is suggested that the bowl-shaped, sub-seafloor feeder part of a high-sulphidation and Au-bearing volcanogenic massive sulphide ore system, with replacement of carbonates and (sub) -volcanic rocks, served as an initial inhomogeneity in the strata for the later development of strong stretching along steep axes and sheath fold formation during ductile strain. The observation of discordant relationships along the margins of the massive sulphide ores, coupled with the syn-magmatic, pre-tectonic timing of ore formation, corroborate this hypothesis, providing a compromise solution to the previous debate around two opposing models of strictly syn-genetic vs. epigenetic, post-deformational carbonate-replacement processes of ore formation at the Falun base metal sulphide deposit.

40|$|The {{association}} of porphyry copper style mineralisation with extensive calc alkaline igneous activity {{is not in}} doubt. However, {{the role of the}} magmatic system in the formation of such deposits is still not fully understood. Extensive works have investigated the associated <b>alterations,</b> <b>ore</b> petrology, fluid compositions and the theoretical models of ore metal transference from magma to hydrothermal fluid. Despite these numerous studies, little or no information on the chemical composition and physical processes that occur in the magmatic system has been forthcoming. Silicate melt inclusions provide a method of directly sampling the volatile and ore metal content of magmatic systems. A study of a copperrich andesite from Hahajima, Japan, demonstrates that though the majority of calc alkaline systems have the potential to form a porphyry copper deposit, the physiochemical conditions of the magma chamber prevent most from doing so. The melt inclusions contain significant amounts of copper (up to 2000 ppm), which exceed the average andesitic melt copper content by several orders of magnitude. Measured average water content of 3. 3 wt%, and a CI/H 2 O ratio of 0. 06 from the melt inclusions are typical of those expected for an arc andesite. The analysis of samples from the Morenci and Chino porphyry copper deposits of the SW USA showed that the melt inclusions contained a maximum of c. 700 ppm Cu. By employing a fractional crystallisation model it is possible to demonstrate that melt responsible for the formation of these deposits was not an exotic copper-rich melt. However, both of these deposits displayed trace element characteristics similar to those of Adakites. A study of copper-rich quartz-included biotites from Morenci demonstrated that the parental magma of this system had a small but significant amount of crustal contamination. The copper enrichment in these biotites is the consequence of the mineral's interaction with a copper-carrying exsolved magmatic volatile phase which was in equilibrium with the melt. The quartz phenocrysts from Morenci, which host the melt inclusions and biotites have a complex history of growth and resorption. These events are faithfully recorded by the quartz's zoning. It is possible by the application of existing crystallisation models to demonstrate that during the later stages of the Morenci magma's crystallisation that a magmatic volatile phase was undergoing cycles of undersaturation, saturation and exsolution. This 'pumping' of volatiles was driven by the phenomenon of undercooling. These studies of calc-alkaline magmatic systems and their contribution to the porphyry copper-forming process, serve to provide some ground truths to the current models used to understand their formation and may provide the basis for the development of future exploration tools...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although the lode-gold eposits of the Yilgarn block are {{hosted by}} a variety of rocks, and their {{structural}} style, associated <b>alteration</b> and <b>ore</b> mineralogy are also variable, common parameters suggest tha they represent a coherent group of epigenetic deposits, most of which formed during a widespread (500 000 km 2) and broadly synchronous (2635 + 10 Ma) hydro-thermal event in the closing stages of the Late Archaean tectonothermal evolution of the host granitoid-greenstone terrains. Progressive variations in deposit parameters can be correlated with the metamorphic grade of the enclosing greenstone successions. These systematic variations, combined with evidence for their timing and the P-T conditions of their formation, indicate that the deposits form a continuum in which gold deposition took place from 15 km depth (> 5 kbar, 700 ~ marking hydrothermal fluid flow and fluid evolution through the middle and upper crust.

This paper is aimed to describe characteristics of <b>alteration</b> and <b>ore</b> mineralization associated  with metamorphic rock-related gold deposits.   The study area is found the placer and  primary gold hosted by metamorphic rocks. The gold is evidently derived from gold-bearing quartz veins hosted by Pompangeo Metamorphic Complex (PMC). These quartz veins are currently recognized in metamorphic rocks at Rumbia Mountains. The quartz veins are mostly sheared/deformed, brecciated, irregular vein, segmented and  relatively massive and crystalline texture with thickness from 1 cm to 15. 7 cm. The wallrock are generally weakly altered. Hydrothermal alteration types include sericitization, argillic, inner propylitic, propylitic, carbonization and carbonatization.

40|$|The late Carboniferous (330 - 300 Ma) Variscan {{evolution}} of the Armorican Massif (France) {{is characterized by the}} complex interaction of various processes, all linked to each other, namely deformation, magmatism, circulation of various types of fluids and related <b>alteration</b> and <b>ore</b> formation. In the Armorican Massif, the major structural feature is the lithospheric dextral South Armorican Shear Zone (SASZ), which separates two distinct domains: the low-grade metamorphic Central Armorican Domain (CAD) to the North and the high-grade South Armorican Domain (SAD) to the South. The SASZ is divided into two branches along which synkinematic peraluminous leucogranites were emplaced [1]. Leucogranites emplacements occurred simultaneously along these two branches. Indeed, the Lizio and the Questembert granites were emplaced at 315 ± 5 Ma and 315 ± 4 Ma (U-Pb on zircon) along the northern and southern branches, respectively. Supracrustal leucogranites such as the Questembert granite have been pervasively altered by fluids. The nature of the alteration and the fluids involved changed through time from a high temperature alteration by magmatic fluids expelled from the crystallizing magma to a late hydrothermal alteration triggered by a mix between metamorphic and meteoric fluids as observed in the French Massif Central [2]. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dating of muscovite grains from the Questembert granite yielded plateau dates ranging from 319 Ma down to 303 Ma, interpreted as a 15 Ma time span of pervasive hydrothermal circulations.

Although the geochemical characteristics of these komatiites {{have led to the}} belief that these lavas were uncontaminated, radiogenic Os isotopic compositions (?Os = + 20. 2 and + 33. 2) obtained from well-preserved komatiites and olivine separates suggest that the Alexo flow has been contaminated by crust-derived material. These data are compatible with the trace-element enrichment observed in melt inclusions trapped within olivine. Redistribution of Os and Re did occur at least at the mineral scale and most likely during the Grenville orogeny. Hydrothermal fluids were channeled along the contact between the komatiites and their basement, and were responsible for the remobilization of Re or Os (or both) within the sulfides at Alexo and Hart. Matrix and disseminated sulfides from Texmont are located within the pile of cumulates and seem to have escaped this localized alteration. Although the Abitibi sulfides have experienced various degrees of metamorphism (from prehnite–pumpellyite to low amphibolite facies), the initial Re–Os isotopic composition of the flows appears to have been preserved at the whole-rock scale. Re–Os isotopic heterogeneity of the Abitibi sulfides is best explained by variable R-factor of the sulfides. Re and Os concentrations and Os isotopic heterogeneity of the Abitibi sulfides are consistent with the current model of nickel sulfide formation, which implies that the assimilation of sulfidic sedimentary rocks was the trigger for sulfide saturation...|$|R

Main minerals are arsenopyrite and pyrite - accompanied by quartz, adularia, sericite, + (tourmaline, chlorite, carbonates, graphite), as main gangue minerals - with subordinate amounts of boulangerite, bismuthinite, kobellite, jamesonite, chalcopyrite, marcasite, galena, sphalerite, rutile, titanite, scheelite, beryl, fluorite, and minor native gold, electrum, native bismuth, fahlore, pyrrhotite, mackinawite, etc., defining a meso-catathermal paragenesis. Detailed microscopic study allows the author to propose a general descriptive scheme of textural classification {{for this type of}} ore. Most of the ores fill open spaces or veins, seal cracks or cement breccias; disseminated ores with replacement features related to alteration (mainly silicification, sericitization, and adularization) are also observed. Intensive and repeated cataclasis is a common feature of many ores, suggesting successive events of brittle deformation, hydrothermal flow, and ore precipitation. Gold may be transported and accumulated in any of these events, but tends to be concentrated in later ones. The origin of the gold ores is explained in terms of hydrotherreal discharge, associated with mainly brittle deformation and possibly related to granitic magmas, in the global tectonic frame of crustal evolution of West Galicia. The mineralogical and textural study suggests some criteria which will be of practical value for exploration and for ore processing. Ore grades can be improved by flotation of arsenopyrite.

Based on contrasting geological characteristics, the mineralization in the Lengshuikeng ore district {{can be divided into}} porphyry-hosted and stratabound types. The porphyry-hosted mineralization is distributed in and around the Lengshuikeng granite porphyry and shows a distinct alteration zoning including minor chloritization and sericitization in the proximal zone; sericitization, silicification, and carbonatization in the peripheral zone; and sericitization and carbonatization in the distal zone. The stratabound mineralization occurs in volcano-sedimentary rocks at ∼ 100 – 400 m depth without obvious zoning of <b>alterations</b> and <b>ore</b> minerals. Porphyry-hosted and stratabound mineralization are both characterized by early-stage pyrite–chalcopyrite–sphalerite, middle-stage acanthite–native silver–galena–sphalerite, and late-stage pyrite–quartz–calcite. The δ³⁴S values of pyrite, sphalerite, and galena in the ores range from − 3. 8 to + 6. 9 ‰ with an average of + 2. 0 ‰. The C–O isotope values of siderite, calcite, and dolomite range from − 7. 2 to − 1. 5 ‰ with an average of − 4. 4 ‰ (V-PDB) and from + 10. 9 to + 19. 5 ‰ with an average of + 14. 8 ‰ (V-SMOW), respectively. Hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon isotopes indicate that the hydrothermal fluids were derived mainly from meteoric water, with addition of minor amounts of magmatic water.

Structural {{data suggest that}} this intrusion {{is part of a}} larger, partially exposed body. A dense network of primary and secondary joints, in many places filled with various ore and gangue minerals, is a conspicuous feature of the intrusion. Hydrothermal alteration affecting the intrusion and the wall rocks includes: uralitization (amphibole–epidote), secondary biotitization and propylitization. Propylitic alteration occurred in two stages: high temperature (epidote-actinolite-chlorite) and middle to low temperature (sericite-chlorite-carbonate-epidote and chlorite-sericite-carbonate). Products of later alteration events include quartz-adularia, quartz-carbonate, carbonate, quartz-zeolites and zeolites. Apart from previously recognized contact-metasomatic mineralization, the presence of stockwork-type and disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite mineralization, hosted by both the intrusion and the host rocks, is documented here.

The relationship of fluid inclusions to alteration and mineralization was estab-lished by occurrence restricted to the alteration zones around the deposits and the presence in fluid inclusions of solid phases which also occur as megascopic phases in the alteration.

30|$|Rock-magnetic and {{microscopic}} {{studies of}} the iron ores and associated igneous rocks in the Cerro de Mercado, Mexico, were carried out to determine the magnetic mineralogy and origin of natural remanent magnetization (NRM), related to the thermo-chemical processes due to hydrothermalism. Chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) seems {{to be present in}} most of investigated ore and wall rock samples, replacing completely or partially an original thermoremanent magnetization (TRM). Magnetite (or Ti-poor titanomagnetite) and hematite are commonly found in the ores. Although hematite may carry a stable CRM, no secondary components are detected above 580 °, which probably attests that oxidation occurred soon enough after the extrusion and cooling of the ore-bearing magma. NRM polarities for most of the studied units are reverse. There is some scatter in the cleaned remanence directions of the ores, which may result from physical movement of the ores during faulting or mining, or from perturbation of the ambient field during remanence acquisition by inhomogeneous internal fields within these strongly magnetic ore deposits. The microscopy study under reflected light shows that the magnetic carriers are mainly titanomagnetite, with significant amounts of ilmenite-hematite minerals, and goethite-limonite resulting from alteration processes. Magmatic titanomagnetites, which are found in igneous rocks, show trellis, sandwich, and composite textures, which are compatible with high temperature (deuteric) oxy-exsolution processes. Hydrothermal <b>alteration</b> in <b>ore</b> deposits is mainly indicated by martitization in oxide minerals. Grain sizes range from a few microns to > 100 μm, and possible magnetic state from single to multidomain, in agreement with hysteresis measurements.

For quantitative modeling of the aeromagnetic anomalies, we used data on bulk susceptibility and natural remanent intensity for quantifying the relative contributions of induced and remanent magnetization components and allow a better control of the geometry of source bodies. The position and geometry of this magnetic source are shown as an ENE-striking tabular body, steeply inclined (75 °) to the south.|$|R

These deposits comprise mainly base metal bearing sulfide/sulfosalts quartz veins, while disseminated pyrite with small quantities of gold appear in areas of vuggy silica alteration.

Very abundant, penetrative, stockwork-like Fe-Al sulfate veins are found in the argillic and advanced argillic <b>alteration,</b> but <b>ore</b> veins do not show a clear relationship with the alteration zone. Mass balance using the isocone method reveals a gradual lixiviation of most of the elements (except silica) in the highly altered volcanic rocks involving a generalized loss of mass and an increase in the content of some metallic elements (Zn, Pb, Cu) in the less altered zones. Vein sulfides show a similar or slighty heavier sulfur signature (?? 34 S: 6 - 12 ???) compared to the dominant volcanic signature of the zone (?? 34 S: 1 - 7 ???[1]), suggesting a magmatic source but with possible incorporation of sea water sulfate via inorganic reduction. Such magamtic input could also be related to the gold mineralization. The barite signature (?? 34 S: 19 - 21 ???) also supports sea water involvement. Pyrite in silicification shows depleted sulfur (?? 34 S: 2 - 6 ???) perhaps as product of the disproportionation of magmatic SO 2 which produced the acid alteration. Abundant alunite-jarosite has light sulphur (?? 34 S: 4 - 10 ???), but its abundance and ocurrence rule out a simple supergene origin.

It is a part of the eastern extension of the well-studied Tampere schist belt located between the Central Finland Granitoid Complex to the north and Pirkanmaa migmatite belt to the south. To the east of the study area is the Makkola area, also geologically related to the Tampere schist belt. The deformational events in these supracrustal areas are related to the collision of Central and Southern Svecofennia at 1. 88 – 1. 87 Ga. The purpose of this Master’s project was to study the volcanic and volcanogenic rocks of the study area extending over an area of 30 x 20 km and assess their tectonic setting and genesis. The study is part of the Gold Potential Mapping Project of the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK). The data include more than 1300 field observations, 80 thin sections and 85 geochemical analyses. Some older field observations and geological and aeromagnetic maps were also utilized. The occurrences of volcanic rocks have been divided into five subareas: Partala, Kakaristo, Mustajärvi, Ouninpohja, and Länkipohja. The volcanic rocks have mainly intermediate, calc-alkaline to shoshonitic composition, they are enriched in light rare earth elements, depleted in high-field strength elements, and have trace element features that plot them in arc volcanic and active continental margin settings in tectonic discrimination diagrams. The volcanic rocks of Länkipohja and Partala areas are more acidic and alkaline than other volcanic rocks of this study. Otherwise, no remarkable differences in geology or geochemistry were found between the subareas of the study area and the Makkola area to the east and the Tampere schist belt to the west. It is concluded that the whole geological system has formed in a continental arc setting. Furthermore, the presence of a subduction component is inferred from large LILE/HFSE ratio.

The supracrustal rocks were intruded by diabase dykes and sills and by granitic plutons. The supracrustal rocks have been tilted into a sub-vertical position. Foliation follows approximately the bedding planes, or is developed in schistose shear or fault zones. Lineations are generally steeply dipping and positioned in foliation planes. The rocks of the West Bergslagen belt are metamorphosed to greenschist or lower amphibolite mineral parageneses. Hydrothermal <b>alterations</b> and related <b>ore</b> mineralizations occur in the West Bergslagen belt, and are studied in this thesis. The aims {{of the study were}} to understand the working of the hydrothermal systems operative in the Proterozoic crust of West Bergslagen, and include topics such as: hydrothermal fluid genesis, interaction between rock minerals and fluids, mobility of elements in the systems and estimates of mass in/decrease during the processes, and relation of hydrothermal fluids with the different ore forming processes. An important aim was to determine the amount of involvement of sea water in the hydrothermal processes, and to evaluate the Early Proterozoic chemical and isotopic composition of sea water compared with present sea water...|$|R
