In-stent restenosis and bypass graft failure are characterized by excessive smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and concomitant myointima formation with luminal obliteration. Here we show that during the development of myointimal hyperplasia in human arteries, SMCs show hyperpolarization of their mitochondrial membrane potential (Δ Ψ m) and acquire a temporary state with a high proliferative rate and resistance to apoptosis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2 (PDK 2) was identified as a key regulatory protein, and its activation proved necessary for relevant myointima formation. Pharmacologic PDK 2 blockade with dichloroacetate or lentiviral PDK 2 knockdown prevented Δ Ψ m hyperpolarization, facilitated apoptosis and reduced myointima formation in injured human mammary and coronary arteries, rat aortas, rabbit iliac arteries and swine (pig) coronary arteries. In contrast to several commonly used antiproliferative drugs, dichloroacetate did not prevent vessel re-endothelialization.

40|$|Isoniazid (INH), {{a widely}} used {{first-line}} antitubercular drug, {{has been noted}} {{to be associated with}} hepatotoxicity. In spite of extensive researches over many decades, the mechanism of INH-induced hepatotoxicity still remains poorly understood. Recently, mitochondrial toxicity has been emerging as a new paradigm for INH-induced hepatotoxicity. In this study, we showed that INH impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in human hepatocarcinoma HepG 2 cells. INH reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and induced mitochondria swelling. INH also inhibited the protein expressions of three major mitochondrial biogenesis regulators, SIRT 1, PGC 1 α and NRF 1, along with increased acetylation of PGC 1 α. Meanwhile, INH decreased the number of mitochondria, accompanied by decreased expression of mitochondrial protein COX IV. INH caused mitochondrial fragmentation involving decreased levels of the fusion protein MFN 2 as well as the fission protein DRP 1. INH-reduced DRP 1 expression was associated with the increase of apoptosis, suggesting the existence of pro-survival fission and its involvement in mitochondrial quality control. INH activated p 38 MAPK, whereas inhibition of p 38 MAPK aggravated INH-induced decreases of SIRT 1, PGC 1 α, NRF 1, COX IV and DRP 1 expressions. P 38 MAPK inhibition also further up-regulated the acetylation of PGC 1 α and exacerbated INH-induced MMP loss, mitochondrial swelling and apoptosis. Taken together, INH-activated p 38 MAPK induced mitochondrial biogenesis to <b>alleviate</b> <b>apoptosis</b> through partly recovering SIRT 1 -PGC 1 α pathway activation. In the meantime, p 38 MAPK activation by INH promoted protective mitochondrial fission to <b>alleviate</b> <b>apoptosis</b> by partial recovery of DRP 1 expression...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Opening of the {{mitochondrial}} permeability transition pore (mPTP) is {{a critical}} event during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Recently, we showed that Panax quinquefolium saponin (PQS) <b>alleviates</b> <b>apoptosis</b> of cardiomyocytes by suppressing excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) during I/R injury. Here, we hypothesized that this anti-apoptotic effect might be mediated through inhibition of mPTP and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Methods: Ninety-six healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham, I/R, I/R+PQS (200 mg/kg/d), Cyclosporine A (CsA, 10 mg/kg), I/R+CsA (10 mg/kg), and I/R+PQS+CsA. I/R was modeled in rats by ligating the left anterior descending artery (LAD) for 30 min followed by 120 min of reperfusion. To evaluate the cardioprotective function of PQS, we measured hemodynamics, serum content of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), myocardial infarct size, and myocardial apoptotic index (AI). We investigated the underlying mechanism by examining changes in the mitochondrial ultrastructure and membrane potential (&#x 0394;&#x 03 A 8;m), dynamics of mPTP opening, expression of cleaved caspase- 3, cleaved caspase- 9 in the myocardium, Bcl- 2 and Bax in the mitochondria versus cytosol, and translocation of cytochrome c. Results: Administration of PQS to I/R rats significantly reduced serum CK-MB level, infarct size and AI. In addition, PQS protected the mitochondrial structure, markedly inhibited mPTP opening and &#x 0394;&#x 03 A 8;m depolarization, led to upregulation of Bcl- 2 and downregulation of Bax in the mitochondria compared to the cytosol, and suppressed the expression of cleaved caspase- 9 and cleaved caspase- 3, as well as I/R induced translocation of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm. Conclusion: Our results show that PQS can <b>alleviate</b> <b>apoptosis</b> of cardiomyocytes during I/R injury, possibly due to repressed mitochondrial apoptotic pathway associated {{with the opening of}} mPTP induced by myocardial I/R injury...|$|R
40|$|Alterations in the {{expression}} and {{activity of the}} centrosomal kinase, Aurora-A/serine/threonine kinase 15 (STK 15), affect genomic stability, disrupt the fidelity of centrosome duplication, and induce cellular transformation. Here, we provide evidence that p 160 ROCK, a Rho-associate serine/threonine kinase, associates with Aurora-A in a protein complex with other STK 15 -associated factors. Suppression of Aurora-A by small interfering RNA in HeLa cells blocks the ability of centrosomes to organize normal mitotic spindles, induces G 2 /M cell cycle arrest, and promotes accumulation of tetraploid cells. In many cases, one outcome of such abnormalities is apoptosis. Introduction of a second genetic lesion, suppression of p 160 ROCK by RNA interference, can rescue abnormal mitotic spindle formation, release the G 2 /M cell cycle arrest, and <b>alleviate</b> <b>apoptosis,</b> leading to a greater accumulation of aneuploid cells.

Methods HPMCs were induced by 50 mmol/L D type glucose or mannitol for 72 hours respectively, flow cytometry was employed to detect the rate of apoptotic cells, and the expression levels of apoptosis- and fibrosis-related proteins were detected by Western blotting. The untreated HPMCs were transfected with Lenti-PUMA-α, and the treated cells were transfected with shRNA-PUMA-α, the number of apoptotic cells and the expression levels of apoptosis- and fibrosis-related proteins were detected with the methods mentioned above. Results Flow cytometry showed {{that the rate of}} apoptotic HPMCs increased after being induced by high glucose for 72 hours, and Western blotting revealed that the expression levels of pro-apoptotic and pro-fibrotic related proteins increased, but the arrestins of apoptosis-and fibrosis-related proteins decreased. Up-regulation of PUMA-α promoted apoptosis and fibrosis, while down-regulation of PUMA-α <b>alleviated</b> <b>apoptosis</b> and fibrosis of HPMCs.

The present study investigated the efficacy and mechanism of leukocytapheresis (LCAP) to partially eliminate peripheral neutrophils and attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced lung injury in dogs. A total of 24 healthy male mongrel dogs were enrolled and randomly divided into LPS, LCAP and LCAP-sham groups. All animals were injected with LPS to induce endotoxemia. The serum levels of leucocytes, neutrophil elastase, arterial blood gas, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) subunit p 65 in lung tissues were measured.

Several {{studies have demonstrated that}} the absence of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a predominant apolipoprotein in the brain, leads to an increased susceptibility to neurodegeneration. Previously, we observed that genistein, a soy isoflavone, significantly <b>alleviated</b> <b>apoptosis</b> and tau hyperphosphorylation in SH-SY 5 Y cells. Therefore, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of dietary genistein supplementation (0. 5 g/kg diet) in the cortex and hippocampus of wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 (WT) and ApoE knockout (ApoE−/−) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 24 weeks. Genistein supplementation alleviated neuroinflammation and peripheral and brain insulin resistance. Reductions in oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress were also observed in ApoE−/− mice fed a genistein-supplemented diet. Beta-secretase 1 and presenilin 1 mRNA levels and beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) protein levels were reduced in response to genistein supplementation in ApoE−/− mice but not in WT mice. Although the absence of ApoE did not increase tau hyperphosphorylation, genistein supplementation reduced tau hyperphosphorylation in both WT and ApoE−/− mice. Consistent with this result, we also observed that genistein alleviated activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β, which are involved in tau hyperphosphorylation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that genistein alleviated neuroinflammation, Aβ deposition, and hyperphosphorylation in ApoE−/− mice fed an HFD...|$|R

40|$|Development of {{multiple}} drug resistance mechanisms in melanomas necessitates the identification of new drug targets, which when inhibited could impact multiple cellular pathways, thus circumventing potential resistance. By performing complementary DNA microarray analysis, we identified four key components of the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery—CRM 1, RAN (RAN-GTPase), RANGAP 1, and RANBP 1 —to be overexpressed in human melanoma metastases. Chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM 1) inhibition induced a marked depletion of prosurvival/cytoplasmic extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1 / 2 (Erk 1 / 2) and p 90 ribosomal S 6 kinase 1 and elicited persistent Erk-signaling hyperactivation. Consistently, CRM 1 inhibition inflicted extensive apoptosis in melanoma cells while sparing nontransformed melanocytes and primary lung fibroblasts. Apoptosis required both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways and {{was associated with a}} nuclear entrapment and downregulation of the antiapoptotic CRM 1 target protein, Survivin. Apoptosis was preceded by a G 1 cell-cycle arrest, and even though CRM 1 inhibition mediated marked p 53 and p 21 induction in wild-type p 53 melanoma cells, the latter's silencing or inactivation failed to <b>alleviate</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> Notably, CRM 1 inhibition induced cell line–specific, G 1 to S progression–retarding changes in the expression {{of multiple}} cell-cycle regulatory proteins, thus potentially explaining p 53 dispensability. We propose CRM 1 as a potential therapeutic target in human melanoma, whose inhibition induces loss of prosurvival/cytoplasmic Erk 1 / 2, mediates persistent Erk hyperactivation, and initiates a multitude of cell context–dependent molecular events to trigger G 1 arrest followed by massive apoptosis...|$|R
40|$|Neural crest cells (NCCs) {{migrate from}} {{different}} regions along the anterior-posterior {{axis of the}} neural tube (NT) to form different structures. Defective NCC development causes congenital neurocristopathies affecting multiple NCC-derived tissues in human. Perturbed Hoxb 5 signaling in vagal NCC causes enteric nervous system (ENS) defects. This study aims to further investigate if perturbed Hoxb 5 signaling in trunk NCC contributes to defects of other NCC-derived tissues besides the ENS. We perturbed Hoxb 5 signaling in NCC from the entire NT, and investigated its impact {{in the development of}} tissues derived from these cells in mice. Perturbation of Hoxb 5 signaling in these NCC resulted in Sox 9 downregulation, NCC apoptosis, hypoplastic sympathetic and dorsal root ganglia, hypopigmentation and ENS defects. Mutant mice with NCC-specific Sox 9 deletion also displayed some of these phenotypes. In vitro and in vivo assays indicated that the Sox 9 promoter was bound and trans-activated by Hoxb 5. In ovo studies further revealed that Sox 9 <b>alleviated</b> <b>apoptosis</b> induced by perturbed Hoxb 5 signaling, and Hoxb 5 induced ectopic Sox 9 expression in chick NT. This study demonstrates that Hoxb 5 regulates Sox 9 expression in NCC and disruption of this signaling causes Sox 9 downregulation, NCC apoptosis and multiple NCC-developmental defects. Phenotypes such as ENS deficiency, hypopigmentation and some of the neurological defects are reported in patients with Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Whether dysregulation of Hoxb 5 signaling and early depletion of NCC contribute to ENS defect and other neurocristopathies in HSCR patients deserves further investigation. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|Cell {{apoptosis}} is {{a contributing}} factor in the initiation, progression and relapse of atrial fibrillation (AF), a life-threatening illness accompanied with stroke and heart failure. However, the regulatory cascade of apoptosis is intricate and remains unidentified, especially {{in the setting of}} AF. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the roles of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (MAP), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and their cross-talking in tachypacing-induced apoptosis. HL- 1 cells were cultured in the presence of tachypacing for 24 h to simulate atrial tachycardia remodeling. Results showed that tachypacing reduced cell viability measured by the cell counting kit- 8, dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential detected by JC- 1 staining and resulted in approximately 50 % apoptosis examined by Hoechst staining and annexin V/propidium iodide staining. In addition, the proteins involved in ER stress, MAP and MAPKs were universally up-regulated or activated via phosphorylation, as confirmed by western blotting; and reversely silencing of ER stress, caspase- 3 (the ultimate executor of MAP) and MAPKs with specific inhibitors prior to pacing partially <b>alleviated</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> An inhibitor of ER stress was applied to further investigate the responses of mitochondria and MAPKs to ER stress, and results indicated that suppression of ER stress comprehensively but incompletely attenuated the activation of MAP and MAPKs aroused by tachypacing, with the exception of ERK 1 / 2, one branch of MAPKs. Our study suggested tachypacing-induced apoptosis is regulated by ER stress-mediated MAP and MAPKs. Thus, the above three components are all promising anti-apoptotic targets in AF patients and ER stress appears to play a dominant role due to its comprehensive effects...|$|R

We investigated the effects of sevoflurane on EMP-induced brain injury. Rats were exposed to EMP and immediately treated with sevoflurane. The protective effects of sevoflurane were assessed by Nissl staining, Fluoro-Jade C staining and electron microscopy.

We induced ERS by exposing the intestinal porcine epithelial cell line J 2 (IPEC-J 2) to tunicamycin (TUNI) to explore the potential of l-glutamine to reduce ERS-induced apoptosis. Our experiments demonstrated that exposing cells to TUNI results in spontaneous ERS and encourages the upregulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP 78). Prolonged TUNI-induced ERS was found to increase apoptosis mediated by C/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), accompanied by GRP 78 downregulation. Treatment with l-glutamine was found to promote cell proliferation within the growth medium but to have little effect in basic Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium.

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} and prevalence {{of heart failure}} increases with age. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of heart failure. In the end-stage of human heart failure, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis is observed. Exercise training {{is one of the}} nonpharmacological treatments for chronic heart failure. Methods: In the present study, we investigated the effect of treadmill exercise on the aging-induced apoptosis within cardiac myocytes in relation to the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) using rats. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and Western blotting for the expression of Bcl- 2, Bax, HSP 70, and phosphorylated p 38 (p-p 38) in the cardiac myocardium were conducted. Results: Aging induced apoptosis in the myocardium, which was confirmed by increased TUNEL-positive cells and the enhancement of Bax. Expression of HSP 70 was suppressed and p-p 38 expression was enhanced by aging. Treadmill exercise <b>alleviated</b> aging-induced <b>apoptosis</b> with enhancing HSP 70 expression and suppressing p-p 38 expression in the cardiac myocytes. Conclusion: Based on the present results, it can be inferred that treadmill exercise can provide a cardioprotective effect on aging-induced apoptosis through the enhancement of HSP 70 expression in the heart. Thus, regular exercise may be a useful strategy for preventing heart problems in the elderly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether progesterone (PROG) <b>alleviates</b> the neuronal <b>apoptosis</b> in neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain damage through the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt/glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β (GSK- 3 β) signaling pathway. A total of 96 newborn Wistar rats aged 7 days were randomly divided into four groups: sham surgery, HI, drug prevention (PROG) and Akt inhibitor groups. HI animal models were established by a conventional method. All animals were sacrificed 24 h after hypoxia. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the distribution and expression of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and the GSK- 3 β proteins in the brain, and western blot analysis was used to determine the p-Akt and GSK- 3 β protein contents. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was also used to determine the GSK- 3 β content of the brain tissue, and flow cytometry was used to evaluate the apoptosis rate of neural cells. The expression of p-Akt protein was reduced in the brain tissues of the HI group, whereas GSK- 3 β expression was increased. In addition, the GSK- 3 β content of the brain and the neuronal apoptosis rate were significantly increased. PROG pre-treatment increased p-Akt expression, decreased GSK- 3 β expression and GSK- 3 β content, and also reduced neuronal apoptosis. Following administration of the Akt inhibitor wortmannin, p-Akt expression decreased, GSK- 3 β expression increased, and the GSK- 3 β content and neuronal apoptosis rate significantly increased (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, PROG activates the PI 3 K/Akt/GSK- 3 β pathway to promote Akt activation, enhance p-Akt expression and inhibit GSK- 3 β expression, thereby inhibiting neuronal <b>apoptosis,</b> <b>alleviating</b> HI brain injury and inducing a cerebroprotective effect...|$|R

40|$|Background: Human fetal striatum-derived neural {{stem cells}} (hfsNSCs) are {{important}} in regenerative medicine; however, their ability to self-renew diminishes quickly following passages in culture. Typically when hfsNSC-derived neurospheres are dissociated by accutase, more than 90 % of the cells survive, but only 6 - 8 % of the cells are able to form secondary neurospheres. Our hypothesis is that the hfsNSCs that are unable to form new neurospheres become apoptotic. Methods/Results: Because the NSC apoptosis process has never been characterized in detail, we characterized hfsNSC apoptosis using multiparameter analysis and determined {{that the majority of}} hfsNSCs undergo apoptosis after passaging, which leads to a reduction in self-renewal. The replacement of trituration with vortexing decreases apoptosis, increases self-renewal, and does not affect NSC differentiation. When we used live cell staining with Annexin V, Hoechst 33342, and PI together, the apoptotic index was in agreement with what could be obtained using fixed-cell staining methods, including TUNEL and activated caspase- 3 immunocytochemistry. NSC apoptosis could be divided into 9 stage types based on our live cell assay. Several types during early and late stages had similar staining profiles that could be further discriminated based on cell size. Conclusion: Apoptosis largely contributes to the low self-renewal of neurospheres, and replacing trituration with vortexing aided in <b>alleviating</b> NSC <b>apoptosis.</b> Multiparameter analysis is required for the identification of NSC apoptosis, particularly when live cell staining is used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mesenchymal {{stem cell}} (MSC) -based regen-erative therapy is {{currently}} {{regarded as a}} novel approach with which to repair damaged tissues. However, the efficiency of MSC transplantation is limited due to the low survival rate of engrafted MSCs. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production is increased in numerous diseases and serves an essential function in the regulation of apoptosis {{in a variety of}} cell types. Previous studies have indicated that low-dose LPS pretreatment contributes to cytoprotection. In the current study, LPS was demonstrated to induce apoptosis in human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) via the activation of caspase, in a dose-dependent manner. Low-dose LPS pretreatment may protect hUCMSCs against apoptosis induced by high-dose LPS, by upregulating the expression of cellular FADD-like IL- 1 β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP). The {{results of the present study}} indicate that pretreatment with an appropriate concentration of LPS may <b>alleviate</b> high-dose LPS-induced <b>apoptosis...</b>|$|R

Objective. To explore the mechanism of cardioprotective effects of Chinese medicine, Yiqi Huoxue recipe, in rats with myocardial infarction- (MI-) induced heart failure. Methods. Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent left anterior descending artery (LAD) ligation or sham operation. The surviving MI rats were divided randomly into three groups: MI (5 mL/kg/d NS by gavage), MI + Metoprolol Tartrate (MT) (12 mg/kg/d MT by gavage), andMI + Yiqi Huoxue (5 mL/kg recipe by gavage).

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} γ coactivator- 1 (PGC- 1) designates {{a family}} of coactivators consisting of PGC- 1 α, PGC- 1 β and PRC. By associating with transcription factors like nuclear receptors, they induce transcription of target genes {{that are responsible for}} mitochondrial biogenesis, glucose uptake, gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation and β-oxidation of fatty acids. Originally identified in brown adipose tissue, these coactivators are predominately expressed in tissues with high energy requirements (skeletal muscle, heart, liver, brain, kidney) upon stimulation with physiological stressors (exercise, cold, fasting). PGC- 1 ’s expression and function is therefore highly tissue specific. PGC- 1 α is to date the best studied of all family members. One of the tissues high in energy demand is the retina; its photoreceptors convert light into a signal that can be interpreted by the brain. However, thus far the physiological role of PGC- 1 α has never been studied there. In the first project of this thesis, we consequently analyzed PGC- 1 α and to a certain extent also PGC- 1 β expression and function in mouse retina: We first assessed expression patterns of PGC- 1 α and PGC- 1 β. Second, we subjected mice with a global deletion of the PGC- 1 α gene (PGC- 1 α knockout = KO) and wildtype (WT) control mice to high intensity light compared to a dark setting and studied their retinae’s morphology (histology), function (electroretinogram) and gene expression levels (microarray, real time PCR). We found the PGC- 1 α KO mice to display increased apoptosis and disrupted retinal photoreceptor structure compared to the wildtype (WT) control animals upon light exposure. The corresponding light damage could also be confirmed by ERG in some animals. Microarray analysis revealed downregulation of DNA repair and phototransduction as well as an upregulation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways, respectively in the KO animals. Finally, we confirmed in an in vitro setting that overexpression of PGC- 1 α helped <b>alleviate</b> <b>apoptosis.</b> The role of PGC- 1 β in skeletal muscle has not been thoroughly studied either: More specifically, we wanted to address its role in glucose metabolism/ insulin sensitivity and fiber type composition as well as to identify exclusive target genes of PGC- 1 β in this tissue in the second project. For this purpose, we aimed at generating a skeletal muscle specific knockdown mouse: Different small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) and control, scrambled shRNAs against mouse PGC- 1 β were designed according to different design principles (shRNA vs shRNA-mir) and tested for their knockdown efficiency and specificity in cell culture. The most promising one was then inserted into a vector backbone used to generate adeno-associated virus (AAV). We decided to produce the AAV serotype AAV 2 / 6, as it displays specific tropism for skeletal muscle (AAV 2 / 6). Injection quantity, route and duration until onset of shRNA expression were optimized with a virus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). The virus carrying shRNA was then injected into the mouse tibialis anterior muscle and after 3 weeks of incubation time analyzed for inflammatory gene expression. Semi- quantitative real time PCR analysis revealed that expression of PGC- 1 β as well as of its downstream target genes was significantly reduced. In vivo testing of a skeletal muscle specific promoter, however, did not lead to a significant reduction of PGC- 1 β levels. In summary, we showed that PGC- 1 α has a protective role in light induced apoptosis in the retina (project 1). In project 2, we showed that a reduction of PGC- 1 β in skeletal muscle leads to diminished expression of genes implicated in OXPHOS...|$|R
40|$|Neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) play major roles in {{neurological}} recovery after cerebral infarction (CI). This study {{was trying to}} investigate whether miR- 200 a, a vital regulator in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis, also has a role in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injured NSCs. In this study, primary NSCs were subjected to OGD/R conditions to mimic an in vitro CI model. Before OGD/R induction, NSCs were transfected with vector or shRNA against miR- 200 a to overexpress or suppress miR- 200 a expression. The changes in cell viability, apoptosis, migration, the expression of c-Myc, and the phosphorylation of STAT 1, STAT 3 and MAPK were respectively assessed. Inhibitors of STAT 1 / 3 and MAPK, i. e., Nifuroxazide and BIRB 796, were used to administrate miR- 200 a-silenced NSCs, and the expressions of above mentioned proteins were detected. After OGD/R exposure, miR- 200 a was up-regulated in NSCs (P < 0. 001). miR- 200 a silencing alleviated OGD/R-induced the decrease of cell viability and migration (P < 0. 01); meanwhile, <b>alleviated</b> OGD/R-induced <b>apoptosis</b> via reducing Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio and down-regulating p 53 and cytochrome c (P < 0. 01 or P < 0. 001). c-Myc, p-STAT 1, p-STAT 3, p-MAPK were all negatively regulated by miR- 200 a (P < 0. 01 or P < 0. 001); more important, the increase of c-Myc induced by miR- 200 a silencing was abolished by Nifuroxazide or BIRB 796 (P < 0. 01 or P < 0. 001).

40|$|Pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (PAs) are a {{group of}} compounds found in various plants {{and some of them}} are widely consumed in the world as herbal medicines and food supplements. PAs are potent hepatotoxins that cause irreversible liver injury in animals and humans. However, the mechanisms by which PAs induce liver injury are not clear. In the present study, we determined the hepatotoxicity and molecular mechanisms of senecionine, one of the most common toxic PAs, in primary cultured mouse and human hepatocytes as well as in mice. We found that senecionine administration increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels in mice. H&E and TUNEL staining of liver tissues revealed increased hemorrhage and hepatocyte apoptosis in liver zone 2 areas. Mechanistically, senecionine induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c as well as mitochondrial JNK translocation and activation prior to the increased DNA fragmentation and caspase- 3 activation in primary cultured mouse and human hepatocytes. SP 600125, a specific JNK inhibitor, and ZVAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor, <b>alleviated</b> senecionine-induced <b>apoptosis</b> in primary hepatocytes. Interestingly, senecionine also caused marked mitochondria fragmentation in hepatocytes. Pharmacological inhibition of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp 1), a protein that is critical to regulate mitochondrial fission, blocked senecionine-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and apoptosis. More importantly, hepatocyte-specific Drp 1 knockout mice were resistant to senecionine-induced liver injury due to decreased mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. In conclusion, our results uncovered a novel mechanism of Drp 1 -mediated mitochondrial fragmentation in senecionine-induced liver injury. Targeting Drp 1 -mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis may be a potential avenue to prevent and treat hepatotoxicity induced by PAs...|$|R

However, its role in hESCs remains poorly understood. Here, we studied functional roles of the endogenous miR- 302 / 367 cluster in hESCs by employing specific TALE-based transcriptional repressors. We revealed that miR- 302 / 367 cluster dually regulates hESC cell cycle and apoptosis in dose-dependent manner. Gene profiling and functional studies identified key targets of the miR- 302 / 367 cluster in regulating hESC self-renewal and apoptosis.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) on the myocardial cells of mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus combined with hyperuricemia (HUA), and clarify the mechanism thereof. Methods The mouse cardiac myocytes (MCM) cultured with 25 mmol/L high glucose (HG) medium {{were divided into two}} groups: HG plus 300 μmol/L sodium palmitate for 18 hours as high glucose and high fat (HG+HF) group, and HG+HF plus 1500 μmol/L uric acid (UA) for 18 hours as HG+HF+HUA group. Then the myocardial cells in HG+HF+HUA group, by use or not use UCP 2 inhibitor genipin, were further divided into two groups: vehicle group and genipin group. In order to verify the mechanism of UCP 2 in myocardial cells injury caused by high glucose, high lipid and high uric acid, the myocardial cells were divided again into genipin group and genipin+N-acetylcysteine (NAC) group. Accordingly, the apoptosis of myocardial cells were measured by flow cytometry at specific time, the mRNA and protein expressions of UCP 2 were determined by q-PCR and Western blotting, and the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by DHE staining and ELISA. Results The apoptosis rate of myocardial cells increased obviously, and the expression levels of UCP 2 decreased and of ROS elevated significantly in HG+HF+HUA group than in HG+HF group (P< 0. 05). As the expression levels of UCP 2 decreased by genipin intervention, the apoptosis rate of myocardial cells and ROS level in HG+HF+HUA group increased more obviously (P< 0. 05). In contrast, such an effect was reversed by the application of antioxidants NAC (P< 0. 05).
