500|$|The club {{returned}} to Serie A after gaining promotion in the 1999–2000 season, though after a closely contested relegation battle, they were relegated immediately {{back down the}} following season. They failed to gain promotion following this and slipped further down. The failed 2001–02 Serie B campaign was costly, the cost of production was €70,895,838, just about €10million fewer than in 2000–01 Serie A, heavily due to the high amortisation of the player asset (€33,437,075). However, value of production was just €21,183736 (excluding player profit) and the net loss was €28,856,093 that season. Net asset on 30 June 2002 was €2,166,997, already including about €20million recapitalisation. The club once quoted the law [...] "21 February 2003 No.27" [...] to lower the amortisation expense by extending the <b>amortisation</b> <b>period</b> beyond the contract length of players to 10-year (UEFA ruled the Italian special law was not lawful and all club should use IFRS standards, thus causing a re-capitalization crisis in 2006), which some players contract (with a total residual accounting value of €46,601,225) was amortise in special way for €4,660,123 only and the rest for €1,659,088 in 2002–03, however the cost of production was still exceed the value of production for €19,071,218 in 2002–03. By August 2004, Napoli was declared bankrupt with debts estimated up to €70million. To secure football in the city, film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis refounded the club under the name Napoli Soccer, as they {{were not allowed to}} use their old name. FIGC placed Napoli in Serie C1, where they missed out on promotion after losing 2–1 in play-offs to local rivals Avellino in 2004–05 Serie C1.|$|E
30|$|Public-private {{partnership}} contracts {{were introduced}} in France by decree no. 2004 – 559 dated 17 June 2004. They allow the State or a dependent public establishment to give a third party a global mission for a period determined according to {{the duration of the}} investment <b>amortisation</b> <b>period</b> or the chosen means of financing. This can consist in the financing of works or equipment necessary for the public service, the construction or transformation of works, cleaning, maintenance, operation and management, as well as other service provisions contributing to the public service mission (such as traffic management).|$|E
30|$|The second way is {{referred}} to as the “Green Road”, where titles initially published in classic paid-for media would be made available free-of-charge on the web, be it on the author’s or the author’s university server, after a certain period (6  months is an often-mentioned time scale for such schemes) 5 In this case, the issue of open access narrows to the question if an <b>amortisation</b> <b>period</b> of 6  months is sufficient to cover the costs accrued. So the Green Road is based on a primary publication produced by the publishers, thereby admitting that publishers provide useful if not indispensable services for the scientific publication system (Deutsche UNESCO Kommission 2007, p. 19) 6 The Green Road is about the delayed release of published contents, in the spirit of open access. This too implies a partial expropriation of the publishers, concerning the service contributions provided by them, and a decisive curtailment of their opportunities for longer-term sales, which are essential for full cost recovery in many cases.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: New digital {{detectors}} {{were developed}} for medical applications, {{which have the}} potential to substitute the X-ray film and revolutionise the radiological technique. Digital Detector Arrays (DDA: Flat Panel Detectors, Line Detectors) and Imaging Plates (Computed Radiography) allow a fast detection of radiographic images in a shorter time and with higher dynamic than film applications. Companies report about a reduction of exposure time down to 5 – 25 % in comparison to NDT film exposures. This provides together with the reduction of consumables economical (and also ecological) benefits and short <b>amortisation</b> <b>periods.</b> But this does not always provide the same image quality as NDT film. The requirements of the European and USA standards for film radiography are analysed to derive correct requirements for the digital image quality and procedures for prediction and measurement of image quality. Basically the USA standards seem to be more tolerant for these new innovative technologies. New standard proposals use signal/noise ratio and unsharpness as dominant parameters for image quality. Specialised measurement procedures are described. The properties of the new detectors can be controlled by electronics and exposure conditions. New names appear in literature like "direct radiography " and "film replacement techniques". The basic advantage of the new digital techniques is the possibility to use numeric procedures for image interpretation. Industrial radiology can be optimised for crack detection as well as for analysis of flaw depth and shape measurement. Automated flaw detection, measurement of part dimensions and detection o...|$|R
40|$|With little current public {{information}} on intangible asset capitalisation in the New Zealand environment, this study uses companies {{listed on the}} New Zealand Stock Exchange to determine current practice. The {{purpose of the study}} is to provide a springboard for further research into the intangible area as well as providing an understanding of how New Zealand companies contend with intangible assets, {{in the light of the}} controversy that has surrounded the introduction of the exposure draft, ED- 87 Accounting for Intangible Assets. The study finds that, apart from goodwill, there are a variety of other intangible assets capitalised by New Zealand listed companies and that the majority of these assets are valued at cost. Capitalisation extends across most industry sectors and company size, although a higher proportion of larger than smaller companies capitalise intangible assets. The contribution to asset value made by capitalisation is quite high for some companies, with intangible assets other than goodwill contributing a greater proportion to asset value than goodwill. Although capitalising intangibles reduces the discrepancy between market and book values of equity, capitalising companies still have higher market-to-book ratios than non-capitalising companies, indicating that the market recognises further uncapitalised intangible value. Whilst companies with higher debt levels have a greater tendency to be capitalising companies, there is no evidence to suggest that companies are capitalising simply because of leverage factors. However, with <b>amortisation</b> <b>periods</b> tending to longer rather than shorter time spans (with many companies not amortising at all), companies may well be using amortisation practices to maintain higher asset levels on the balance sheet. The research supports overseas evidence for the value relevance of capitalised intangible assets and also finds that corporate ownership diversity and size can be influential in that value relevance...|$|R
40|$|Accounting for {{goodwill}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} controversial issues in financial reporting. This study provides empirical evidence on whether goodwill amortisation requirement is inappropriate. It analyses the information content of goodwill amortisation in the determination of firm’s market valuation by Emirates Financial Market Listed companies that clearly reported goodwill <b>amortisation</b> over the <b>period</b> 1990 to 2002 inclusive. Evidence suggests that there is a statistically insignificant association between equity market values and goodwill amortisation in the determination of firms’ market valuation, concluding that the UAE market does not perceive goodwill amortisation as having information content when valuing firms, and the use of standardised amortisation requirement may be inappropriate...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} efficiency of thermal insulation is often subject to intense criticism, {{and can be}} controversial. Increasingly, negative reports in the media are casting doubt on the financial justification for adding thermal insulation to buildings. In order to investigate the {{economic efficiency}} of such measures while avoiding miscalculations or pseudo-calculations, an extremely wide range of parameters must be considered. A distinction must be made when renovating old buildings between 'business-as-usual' costs and energy-related costs; the former are incurred because ageing building elements will usually require renovation. The calculations to establish economic efficiency may use the static or dynamic method, but only the latter can account for the changes over time in major calculation parameters (such as energy prices and real interest rate level) over the building's useful life. This useful life is normally a single generation of active service, lasting 30 years. That is long enough for government subsidies and tax amortisation options to change significantly. It is therefore unsurprising, with so many calculation parameters and the change in these over time, {{that the results of}} economic efficiency calculations vary greatly. The <b>amortisation</b> <b>period</b> is normally between 2 and 15 years; it can extend to 30 years, in extreme cases. It will however always fit within a single 30 -year useful life. This requires a rise in the current annual rate of renovation, to at least 3 %...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{solar energy}} facility {{was designed to}} meet {{as much of the}} heating demand in a typical Spanish dwelling as possible. With a view to using the facility during the summer and preventing overheating-induced deterioration of the solar collectors in that season of the year, an absorption chiller was fitted to the system to produce solar-powered air conditioning. The facility operated in solar space heating mode in the winter of 2008 – 2009 and in cooling mode during the summer of 2008. The design was based on a new type of flat plate vacuum solar collectors that delivered higher efficiency than conventional panels. This type of collectors can reach temperatures of up to 110 °C in the summer and up to 70 °C on the coldest winter days. The solar facility comprised a 48 -m 2 (with a net area of 42 m 2) solar collector field, a 25 -kW plate heat exchanger, a 1500 -l storage tank, a 4. 5 -kW (Rotartica) air-cooled absorption chiller and several fan coils. The facility was tested by using it to heat and cool an 80 -m 2 laboratory located in Madrid. As the average area of Spanish homes is 80 m 2, the findings were generally applicable to national housing. The solar facility was observed to be able to meet 65. 3 % of the space heating demand. For air conditioning, the system covered 46 % of the demand, but with high indoor temperatures. In other words, the collector field was found to be able to air condition only half of the home (40 m 2). Lastly, the savings in CO 2 emissions afforded by the use of this facility compared to conventional air conditioning were calculated, along with its <b>amortisation</b> <b>period.</b> These results have been extrapolated calculating the potential energy savings and emissions reduction for all the Spanish households.

40|$|Numerous {{analyses}} {{have been}} performed to quantitatively link carbon stock change caused by land-use change (CSC-LUC) to consumption of agricultural products, but results differ significantly, even for studies focussing on the same region or product. This {{is due to the}} different focuses and interpretations of the links between direct drivers and underlying causes of CSC-LUC, which can be translated into differences in key functions, i. e. specific methods, algorithms and parameters embedded in the analysis. Using the example of Indonesian palm oil production (often associated with CSC-LUC), this paper carries out a meta-analysis of 12 existing studies, determines the different settings for the key functions embedded in consumption-based CSC-LUC studies and discussed their implications for policymaking. It identifies the underlying reasons of adopting different settings within the eight key functions and their advantages and trade-offs. Examples are the way of determining how deforestation is linked to oil palm, and the inclusion of non-agriculture and non-productive drivers in the accounting to weight their roles in CSC-LUC in comparison to palm oil consumption. Following that, the quantitative results from the selected studies were processed and harmonised in terms of unit, allocation mechanism, allocation key and <b>amortisation</b> <b>period.</b> This resulting in ranges of 0. 1 - 3. 8 and - 0. 1 - 15. 7 tCO 2 /t crude palm oil for historical and projection studies, respectively. It was observed that CSC-LUC allocated to palm oil is typically lower when propagating effects and non-agricultural or non-productive drivers were accounted for. Values also greatly differ when marginal and average allocation mechanisms were employed. Conclusively, individual analyses only answer part of the question about CSC-LUC drivers and have their own strengths and weaknesses. Since the context can be very different, using quantitative results from a single study for accounting purposes in policymaking is not recommended. Instead, insights from different studies should be combined, e. g. the relative role of logging and oil palm or the contribution to CSC-LUC in regional and global perspectives...|$|E
