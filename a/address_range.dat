It is used by Elections Canada to generate electoral district maps, and by Statistics Canada for census activities. The maintenance costs from the 2000 general election to 2005 was $16.6 million, requiring 34 full-time employees.|$|E
25|$|The AllCard, an add-on memory {{management}} unit for XT-class computers, allowed normal memory to be mapped into the A0000-EFFFF (hex) <b>address</b> <b>range,</b> giving up to 952 KB for DOS programs. Programs such as Lotus 1-2-3, which accessed video memory directly, needed to be patched to handle this memory layout. Therefore, the 640 KB barrier was removed {{at the cost of}} hardware compatibility.|$|E
25|$|One {{technique}} used on early IBM XT computers was to install additional RAM into the video memory <b>address</b> <b>range</b> {{and push the}} limit up {{to the start of}} the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA). Sometimes software or a custom address decoder was required for this to work. This moved the barrier to 704 KB (with MDA/HGC) or 736 KB (with CGA).|$|E

25|$|Both the PPE and SPE are RISC {{architectures}} with a fixed-width 32-bit instruction format. The PPE {{contains a}} 64-bit {{general purpose register}} set (GPR), a 64-bit floating point register set (FPR), and a 128-bit Altivec register set. The SPE contains 128-bit registers only. These {{can be used for}} scalar data types ranging from 8-bits to 64-bits in size or for SIMD computations on a variety of integer and floating point formats. System memory addresses for both the PPE and SPE are expressed as 64-bit values for a theoretic <b>address</b> <b>range</b> of 264 bytes (16 exabytes or 16,777,216 terabytes). In practice, not all of these bits are implemented in hardware. Local store addresses internal to the SPU (Synergistic Processor Unit) processor are expressed as a 32-bit word. In documentation relating to Cell a word is always taken to mean 32 bits, a doubleword means 64 bits, and a quadword means 128 bits.|$|E
25|$|When {{rules are}} broken several steps are {{commonly}} taken. First, a warning is usually given; this is commonly {{in the form}} of a private message but recent development has made it possible for it to be integrated into the software. Subsequent to this, if the act is ignored and warnings do not work, the member is – usually – first exiled from the forum for a number of days. Denying someone access to the site is called a ban. Bans can mean the person can no longer log in or even view the site anymore. If the offender, after the warning sentence, repeats the offense, another ban is given, usually this time a longer one. Continuous harassment of the site eventually leads to a permanent ban. In most cases, this means simply that the account is locked. In extreme cases where the offender – after being permanently banned – creates another account and continues to harass the site, administrators will apply an IP address ban or block (this can also be applied at the server level): If the IP address is static, the machine of the offender is prevented from accessing the site. In some extreme circumstances, IP <b>address</b> <b>range</b> bans or country bans can be applied; this is usually for political, licensing, or other reasons. See also: Block (Internet), IP address blocking, and Internet censorship.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, PCI {{configuration}} space provides {{access to}} 256 bytes of special configuration registers per PCI device. [...] Each PCI slot gets its own configuration space <b>address</b> <b>range.</b> The registers are used to configure devices memory and I/O address ranges they should respond to from transaction initiators. [...] When a computer is first turned on, all PCI devices respond only to their configuration space accesses. The computer's BIOS scans for devices and assigns Memory and I/O address ranges to them.|$|E

2500|$|This {{performs}} a read from I/O space. [...] All 32 {{bits of the}} read address are provided, so that a device may (for compatibility reasons) implement less than 4 bytes worth of I/O registers. [...] If the byte enables request data not within the <b>address</b> <b>range</b> supported by the PCI device (e.g. a 4-byte read from a device which only supports 2 bytes of I/O address space), it must be terminated with a target abort. [...] Multiple data cycles are permitted, using linear (simple incrementing) burst ordering.|$|E
2500|$|The Navy was {{authorized}} by the Pentagon to put the LRASM into limited production as an operational weapon in February 2014 as an urgent capability stop-gap solution to <b>address</b> <b>range</b> and survivability problems with the Harpoon and to prioritize defeating enemy warships, which has been neglected {{since the end of}} the Cold War but taken on importance with the modernization of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army Navy. [...] The Navy will hold a competition for the Offensive Anti-Surface Warfare (OASuW)/Increment 2 anti-ship missile as a follow-on to LRASM to enter service in 2024.|$|E
50|$|A classful {{network is}} a network {{addressing}} architecture {{used in the}} Internet from 1981 until the introduction of Classless Inter-Domain Routing in 1993. The method divides the address space for Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) into five address classes by <b>address</b> <b>range.</b> Classes A, B, C are networks of three different network sizes, i.e. number of hosts for unicast addresses. Class D is for multicast. The class E <b>address</b> <b>range</b> is reserved for future or experimental purposes. Under classful networking, the subnet mask was implied by which <b>address</b> <b>range</b> (class) the address occupied and {{did not need to}} be specified separately.|$|E
50|$|Generally, VLANs {{within the}} same {{organization}} will be assigned different non-overlapping network <b>address</b> <b>ranges.</b> This is not a requirement of VLANs. There is no issue with separate VLANs using identical overlapping <b>address</b> <b>ranges</b> (e.g. two VLANs each use the private network 192.168.0.0/16). However, {{it is not possible}} to route data between two networks with overlapping addresses without delicate IP remapping, so if the goal of VLANs is segmentation of a larger overall organizational network, non-overlapping addresses must be used in each separate VLAN.|$|R
