5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of two {{commonly}} used <b>asking</b> price strategies on house sales prices. In particular, we compare a dynamic <b>asking</b> price, where the seller adjusts her <b>asking</b> price over time as she fails to sell her property, with a static <b>asking</b> price, where the seller sets an <b>asking</b> price and sticks to it until the property is sold. While we show this comparison to be ambiguous from a theoretical perspective, our empirical study, using a comprehensive dataset of the properties sold in the greater Sydney region in 2011, indicates that properties with a dynamic <b>asking</b> price sold, on average, for approximately 1. 9 per cent less than properties with a static <b>asking</b> price. In addition, we show that, controlling for the <b>asking</b> price strategy, the duration of sale has {{a significant impact on}} sales prices...|$|R
