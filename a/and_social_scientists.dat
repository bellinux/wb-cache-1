25|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, Bihar has lagged far behind other Indian states {{in terms of}} social and {{economic}} development. Many economists <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>scientists</b> claim that this {{is a direct result of}} the policies of the central government, such as the Freight equalisation policy, its apathy towards Bihar, lack of Bihari sub-nationalism, and the Permanent Settlement of 1793 by the British East India Company. The state government has, however, made significant strides in developing the state. Improved governance has led to an economic revival in the state through increased investment in infrastructure, better health care facilities, greater emphasis on education, and a reduction in crime and corruption.|$|E

500|$|On March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Ryan {{released}} a report titled , asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended {{and that there is}} little evidence that these efforts have been successful. In the report, Ryan advances the argument that federal antipoverty programs suffer from defects that [...] "penalize families for getting ahead" [...] and that [...] "the complex web of federal programs and sudden drop-off in benefits create extraordinarily high effective marginal tax rates," [...] both of which [...] "reduce the incentive to work". At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs. In an appendix titled [...] "Measures of Poverty", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements [...] " [...] implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand existing programs or to create new ones." [...] According to an article in the Fiscal Times, several economists <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>scientists</b> whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research.|$|E

500|$|Using data {{derived from}} {{interviews}} conducted in 1969 and 1970 with {{subjects in the}} San Francisco Bay Area, Bell et al. attempted to test explanations of sexual orientation put forward by psychoanalysts <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>scientists.</b> They found that while homosexual men {{were more likely than}} heterosexual men to have felt especially close to their mothers, this had almost no effect on the development of male homosexuality. Poor father-son relationships appeared to be weakly connected to male homosexuality. Homosexual women were more likely than heterosexual women to describe their relationships with their mothers as negative, and to have detached or hostile fathers, but only the latter factor seemed significant. In both sexes, but especially in men, homosexuality was connected to [...] "Childhood Gender Nonconformity", which was a measure partly of behavior more typical of the opposite sex and partly of subjective feelings of masculinity and femininity. Sexual abuse and labeling by others played no significant role. Bell et al. concluded that psychoanalytic explanations of sexual orientation are inadequate. They suggested that while bisexuality is subject to influence by social and sexual learning, the development of heterosexuality and homosexuality may have a biological basis, possibly influenced by hormonal factors. They hoped that demonstrating a biological basis to homosexuality would have beneficial effects such as increasing tolerance of gay people.|$|E
500|$|Devra G. Kleiman {{reviewed}} {{the work for}} Signs. She called it [...] "a remarkable attempt to explain the evolution of social behavior and social systems in animals by a synthesis of several disciplines within biology", but noted {{that it had been}} severely criticised by some biologists <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>scientists.</b> She observed that [...] "it gives less attention to the environmental control of behavior" [...] than to genetics. But [...] "Wilson's ultimate sin" [...] was to include the final chapter, [...] "unfortunately titled 'Man'", attracting [...] "the wrath of those who would deny the influence of biology on human behavior because of its political and social connotations." [...] She called this a pity, since while his attempt to include humans in his analysis was [...] "admittedly weak and premature", the general principles were correct – for instance, she argued, it was useful to know the genetic relatedness of individuals when assessing social interactions. She considered Wilson [...] "nonrigorous and biased in his application of theory in certain areas". His biases included over-representation of insects, genetics, and the dominance of male mammals over females: Wilson had further exaggerated a bias from an ethology literature written mainly by males. Conversely, he had undervalued co-operative behaviour among mammals, except where it concerned males, ignoring the fact that, Kleiman argued, genetically related females were the core of most mammal societies. Wilson's book was in her view valuable as a framework for future research, but premature as a [...] "Synthesis".|$|E
500|$|Bell et al.′s {{objective}} was to test the explanations of how people become heterosexual or homosexual proposed by psychoanalysts <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>scientists,</b> to provide a firm scientific basis to thinking about sexual development and definitively refute mistaken theories. They wrote that the most notable proposed explanations of homosexuality were psychoanalytic theories attributing it to a failure to resolve Oedipal conflicts. In their view, theories {{about the origins of}} sexual orientation had usually not been rigorously tested prior to their study, partly because of the stigma associated with homosexuality and partly because some of the theories, including those advanced by psychoanalysts, use concepts which are hard to [...] "pin down and operationalize." [...] Bell et al. anticipated that psychologists and psychoanalysts would object to their work on methodological grounds, such as that no attempt was made to access unconscious material, or that the interviews, which lasted only a few hours as opposed to the hundreds of hours involved in an analysis, could never reveal what truly occurred in someone′s childhood. They argued, however, that the fact that their data was not obtained from clinical sources was a strength, that attempting to access unconscious material risks selective interpretation of the data, and that [...] "if the differences between homosexual and heterosexual patterns of development are really as great as psychoanalytic theory claims" [...] then such differences would be reflected to at least some extent in the reports of their respondents.|$|E
