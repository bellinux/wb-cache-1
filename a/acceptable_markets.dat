40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of storage conditions on the sensory quality, colour and texture of fresh-cut cabbage during the addition of ascorbic acid, citric acid and calcium chloride. Ascorbic acid maintained the overall quality for 14 days at 0 ℃ and 7 days at 5 ℃; no difference, however, was observed regarding browning of cut surface compared to the control sample at both storage temperatures. Calcium chloride maintained the overall quality and cut surface browning for 14 days at both storage temperatures. It was also found that citric acid 1 % can be used for minimally processed cabbage. Soaking with citric acid helped retain the color and increased the overall acceptance and organoleptic quality of fresh cut cabbage; it reduced browning of the cut surface and protected against formation of black specks. Citric acid treatment combined with low temperature storage (0 ℃) prolonged the shelf life of minimally processed cabbage for 22 days, time sufficient for <b>acceptable</b> <b>marketing</b> of the product.

Textile mills prefer that ginned lint be cleaned at gins with only one saw-type lint cleaner, but many gins use two stages of saw lint cleaning to obtain higher grades. Experiments were conducted to study the characteristics and efficiency of flow-through air-type lint cleaners operating under commercial gin conditions. Comparisons were also made to a controlled-batt saw-type lint cleaner that followed the air-type lint cleaner. One air-type lint cleaner was only 25 % as effective at cleaning {{as one of the}} saw-type lint cleaners. However, the air-type cleaners caused less fiber damage than the saw-type lint cleaners. Information from the field study will be used to (i) advise cotton ginners on the proper use of air-type lint cleaners and (ii) plan new studies to develop air-type lint cleaners that better supplement lint cleaning with only one saw-cylinder cleaner and ensure <b>acceptable</b> <b>market</b> return. Experiments were conducted at three commercial gins to study the characteristics and efficiency of flow-through air-type lint cleaners operating under standard field conditions. Overall, one air lint cleaner gave a cleaning efficiency of 9 % compared to 36 % for one saw lint cleaner following an air lint cleaner. However, the air-type cleaners caused less fiber damage than the saw-type cleaners. Although textile mills prefer that ginned lint be cleaned at gins with only one saw-type lint cleaner, many gins use two stages of saw lint cleaning to obtain higher grades.

Two hundred and forty chicks were allocated randomly into 4 experimental groups according to a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement.

While the degree of tolerance is ultimately an arbitrary value—because the full information necessary to make a non-arbitrary decision is never forthcoming—decision making can be informed by theory, existing information, and where gaps in information lie.

While the topic of the regulation of modern biotechnology has been the subject of much debate in the EU and globally, there appears to be little discussion of zero tolerance.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{process design}} for butanol fuel production using lignocellulosic biomass through thermochemical route {{has been carried}} out and developed. The process design is based on an extensive literature survey and analysis for the potentials of variable feedstocks including energy crops as well as residual and waste materials of biomass, possible production routes and the state of corresponding technologies. The designed process is simulated using Aspen Plus and consists of the following 5 major steps: biomass drying, autothermal gasification with entrained flow gasifier, gas cleanup and conditioning, higher alcohol synthesis over a modified methanol catalyst and alcohol separation. To enhance the product yields, a portion of the generated methane and other hydrocarbons is reformed through autothermal reforming to produce additional syngas and recycled together with unreacted syngas. Through the process optimization, a final product yield of 6232. 5 kg/h of butanol fuel is obtained, which contains 88. 2 wt. % of isobutanol and 10. 7 wt. % of propanol. A heat integration based on pinch analysis is carried out and an optimized heat exchanger network has been developed, resulting in an energy-efficient process which requires no external hot utilities and only small part of power from grid. An overall plant efficiency of 60. 9 % is achieved. Based on the simulation results from Aspen Plus, an economic evaluation is carried out to estimate the net production costs of butanol fuel, which turns out to have a specific net production cost of 2. 25 €/L. Still the NPC is much higher than the <b>acceptable</b> <b>market</b> fuel price. A sensitivity analysis is conducted, finding out that the variation of investment cost of entrained flow gasifier, cost of raw biomass and cost of maintenance labor has the most significant impact on the net production costs.

40|$|The purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the meaning of dark and memorial tourism better, as well as to create basic preconditions for relatively new concept of tourism in Croatia, as dark and memorial tourism is well defined subject internationally. Design – The theoretical background of the topic is been presented, and further institutional support for the development of memorial tourism. The special focus is given to analysis of the factors that influence the implementation of memorial tourism in area of regional economic development strategy according to the principles of triple helix but also quintuple helix cooperation – this type of tourism rely on support from the institutions, official tourism associations and local communities. Methodology/approach – Recent scientific literature analyzed in the paper (memorial tourism, dark tourism, thanatourism, phoenix tourism) present new advances and research results in the field of memorial tourism as theoretical reflection of good (best) international practice. It determines the views of the authors referring to the new trends of modern tourism consumers. Vukovar-Srijem County as a space of political and cultural importance allows, through its touristic production and consumption, for a ritual space that exists outside of time (“heritage that hurts”, “life-changing points of shock”, Stone, 2014). After identifying and analysing both the existing resources of the region and institutional requirements for potential development of memorial tourism a management proposal will be made for the development of a new concept of tourism in Croatia. Findings – According to the data of the Ministry of War Veterans of the Republic of Croatia (2013), up to May 18, 2011, 143 mass graves have been found in the Republic of Croatia, most of them in Vukovar-Srijem County. Inadequate cooperation between the tourism stakeholders and university sector, at regional i. e. national level and veterans’ associations as the main drivers of development of memorial centres resulted in inadequately developed tourism product. Originality of the research – In the paper marketing is used as a mechanism to achieve strategic objectives of destination regions and thus, should be guided by the policies for regional development. The triple helix and quintuple helix innovation paradigm is based on the integration of commercialization, empirical knowledge, public good and civil society. To facilitate the development of memorial tourism, it is recommended to strengthen the cooperation with scientific institutions both in regional and national level in order to establish the facts and prevent further dissemination of occasionally false information about war time events and as a return measure suggest an <b>acceptable</b> <b>marketing</b> mix of memorial tourism product.
