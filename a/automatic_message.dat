There is a software based SMS system, where {{the school principal}} and a few parents received an <b>automatic</b> <b>message</b> the day less than 50 percent or {{a large number of}} school children were served mid-day meal. And this SMS was generated on basis of information on mid-day meal feed by teacher in-charge of the scheme into an online monitoring system.

40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} a two-week {{deployment}} of a peer-to-peer, mobile, location-enhanced messaging service. This study is specifically aimed at investigating the need for and effectiveness of automatic location disclosure mechanisms, the emerging strategies to achieve plausible deniability, and at understanding how place and activity are used to communicate plans, intentions and provide awareness. We outline the research that motivated this study, briefly describe the application we designed, and provide details of the evaluation process. The results show a lack of value of <b>automatic</b> <b>messaging</b> functions, confirm the need for supporting plausible deniability in communications, and highlight the prominent use of activity instead of place to indicate one’s location. Finally, we offer suggestions {{for the development of}} social mobile applications. ...|$|R

50|$|On Judee Burgoon’s study, she {{suggested}} classifications of non verbal codes. First, Non-verbal codes are characterized as analogic. These non verbal signs are categorized {{not only as}} discrete signs rather gradual which are continuous and forms a spectrum of range. Second, it feature some as iconic. These codes show resemblance of the object being symbolized. Third, certain codes promote universal meaning. This feature that some codes have attached universal interpretations that are common to all regardless of intercultural differences. Fourth, Codes enable simultaneous transmission. With the different parts and actions of the body, different messages can be concurrently sent at once. Fifth, non-verbal codes arouse <b>automatic</b> <b>messages.</b> Lastly, nonverbal codes are transmitted intrisictively. More often, these codes are impulsively discharged to covey a message.|$|R

40|$|The {{causes of}} road {{accidents}} lead to emergency communication between vehicular nodes. It {{is true that}} the on-the-spot messaging helps in rescuing victim’s life. The establishment of unprepared communication across vehicular nodes is possible with the intervention of <b>automatic</b> <b>messaging.</b> This leads to active research in data dissemination methods using heterogeneous devices. In this paper, the data dissemination in VANETs is done by Sensors, RFID(Radio Frequency Identification) tags, Bluetooth technology and from people passing over the roads. The communication across VANET nodes is simulated using RFID tags, the sensors available in the Android mobiles and the Bluetooth available in Android mobiles. This provides ease in communication across VANET nodes. The Web Server transmits this information to VANET nodes using WAVE(Wireless Access Vehicular Environment) protocol. The data collection and transmission across VANET is through Web Server(Middleware). Since collection of data is from different sources, Web Server plays crucial role in reception and transmission of messages across VANET nodes. In this paper, the communication methodology is optimized using ABC(Artificial Bee Colony) algorithm and Ant Colony algorithm. The gain of the solution is cross-verified using Least Square Fitting method and Polynomial regression for evaluating the accuracy of transmission of messages by different means...|$|R
