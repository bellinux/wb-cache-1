5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, he arranged the repatriation of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures {{as a metaphor for the}} reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation <b>and</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E
5|$|In his 1928 {{paper on}} the species, Lowe thought that the Inaccessible Island rail was the {{descendant}} of flightless ancestors which had reached Inaccessible Island via a land bridge or sunken continent such as Lemuria. Land bridges were commonly invoked to explain biogeographical distribution patterns before the development <b>and</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> plate tectonics. By 1955 it was understood that the rail was the descendant of ancestors that had flown to Inaccessible Island. It was also realised that {{like all the other}} land birds of the Tristan Archipelago, it had probably reached the island from ancestors in South America.|$|E
5|$|The French {{military}} strategy against Austria {{was for a}} three-pronged invasion to surround Vienna, ideally capturing the city and forcing the Holy Roman Emperor into a surrender <b>and</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> French Revolutionary ideals.

5|$|A {{narrative}} rational for {{the concept}} of Hell {{can be found in}} the Hindu epic, Mahabharata. This narrative ends with Yudhishthira's visit to hell after being offered acceptance into heaven. This journey creates a scene for the audience that helps illustrate the importance of understanding hell as well as heaven before accepting either extreme. This idea provides an essential lesson regarding Dharma, a primary theme within the Mahabharata. Dharma is not a black and white concept, and all people are not entirely good or entirely evil. As such, tolerance is essential in order to truly understand the “right way of living”. We all must understand the worst to truly understand and appreciate the best just as we must experience the best before we can experience the worst. This narrative utilizes the Hindu religion in order to teach lessons on tolerance <b>and</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> one another's faults as well as virtues.|$|E

5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding <b>and</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but in perceptions about relationships.|$|E

The sentence was carried out the same day. The death sentence, according to German law, resulted in the loss of all orders and honorary signs.|$|E

5|$|When {{the emperor}} died without officially {{appointing}} a successor, his widow, the empress dowager, had the sole right to appoint {{one of the}} late emperor's surviving sons or relatives to the position. Most often the successor chosen in this fashion was a minor, thus the empress dowager served as regent over the government. A high-status male relative, usually a father or brother, would assume control of the Imperial Secretariat. Even when an emperor reached his majority and became an active ruler, he often sought the advice <b>and</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the empress dowager on policy decisions; she also {{had the right to}} override his decisions. The empress dowager was protected by the Minister of the Guards, yet if her faction—the consort clan— was removed from power, he was then responsible for keeping her under house arrest.|$|E
