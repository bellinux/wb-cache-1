40|$|In the Amazon Basin, {{within a}} {{landscape}} of infertile soils, fertile Anthrosols of pre-Columbian origin occur (Amazonian Dark Earths or terra preta de Indio). These soils are characterized by high amounts of charred organic matter (black carbon, biochar) and high nutrient stocks. Frequently, they were considered as sign for intensive landscape domestication by way of sedentary agriculture and as sign for large settlements in pre-Columbian Amazonia. Beyond the archaeological interest in Amazonian Dark Earths, they increasingly receive attention because {{it is assumed that}} they could {{serve as a model for}} sustainable agriculture in the humid tropics (terra preta nova). Both questions lack information about the pre-Columbian practices which were responsible for the genesis of Amazonian Dark Earths. It has often been hypothesized that deposition of faeces could have contributed to the high nutrient stocks in these soils, but no study has focussed on this question yet. We analyzed the biomarkers for faeces 5 beta-stanols as well as their precursors and their 5 <b>alpha-isomers</b> in Amazonian Dark Earths and reference soils to investigate the input of faeces into Amazonian Dark Earths. Using Amazonian Dark Earths as example, we discuss the application of threshold values for specific stanols to evaluate faeces deposition in archaeological soils and demonstrate an alternative approach which is based on a comparison of the concentration patterns of 5 beta-stanols with the concentration patterns of their precursors and their 5 <b>alpha-isomers</b> as well as with local backgrounds. The concentration patterns of sterols show that faeces were deposited on Amazonian Dark Earths. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Several novel {{compounds}} {{with the}} non-linear optical chromophore 2 -amino- 5 -nitropyridine (2 A 5 NP) and Keggin polyoxoanions (<b>alpha-isomers),</b> having the general formula (2 A 5 NP) (m) H-n[XM 12 O 40]center dot xH(2) O, M = Mo, W, were synthesised. Compounds were obtained with X = P, n = 3, m = 3 and 4 and X = Si, n = m = 4 (x = 2 - 6). Thus, {{for each of}} the anions [PMo 12 O 40](3 -) and [PW 12 O 40](3 -) two different compounds were obtained, with the same anion and organic counterpart but with a different stoichiometric ratio. These presented different charge transfer properties and thermal stability. All compounds were characterised by spectroscopic and analytical techniques. The single crystal X-ray diffraction structure of (2 A 5 NP) (4) H- 3 [PMo 12 O 40]center dot 2. 5 H(2) O center dot 0. 5 C(2) H(5) OH showed that the water solvent molecules and the organic chromophores are assembled via infinite one-dimensional chains of hydrogen bonds with formation of open channels, which accommodate [PMo 12 O 40] 3 - and ethanol solvent molecules...|$|E
