The soils <b>of</b> the <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gallery</b> Forest, Transition Forest and Savana stricto sensu presented medium structure, high acidity with pH between 4. 5 and 5. 0 and high aluminum contents. The structural survey all over the patch presented 1, 347 individuals distributed into 39 families, 77 genera and 102 species. The family Fabaceae stood out by the greatest richness of species followed by the families Myrtaceae, Lauraceae and Rubiaceae. The species Protium spruceanum and Myrsine umbellata were superior in all the phytosociological parameters, respectively, for all the <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>Gallery</b> Forest and Savana stricto sensu. In the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> transition, the species Copaifera langsdorffii reached the highest values <b>of</b> basal <b>area</b> and absolute dominance; however, as regards to absolute density and cover value was the species Myrsine umbellata.

In many cases (though not all) their analysis requires nothing more than basic topics from geometry, number theory and graph theory and as such they are very well suited for a wide audience [2].

40|$|Rapid {{development}} in {{the upper reaches of}} the Mekong River, in the form of construction of large hydropower dams and reservoirs, large irrigation schemes, and rapid urban development, is putting water resources under stress. Recent studies have concluded that these devel-opments will lead to flow alterations in the Mekong River. These flow alterations would threaten the sensitive ecosystems downstream, particularly Tonle Sap River, Tonle Sap Lake, its floodplain, and its gallery forest and protected areas, by changing the flood-pulse system of the lake. This article estimates the changes in parameters of the Tonle Sap flood pulse due to the aforementioned flow alterations. The impacts on the flooded <b>area</b> and loss <b>of</b> <b>gallery</b> forest and protected areas were analyzed using geographic information system–based methods. Rela-tively small rises in the dry-season lake water level would permanently inundate disproportionately large <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> floodplain, rendering it inaccessible to floodplain vegeta-tion and eroding the productivity basis of the ecosystem. It is highly important to maintain the natural hydrological pattern of the Mekong River, particularly the dry-season water levels, to preserve Tonle Sap Lake’s ecosystem productivity...|$|R

Beyond this initial obstruction are paraphernalia suggestive {{of a rock}} performance: a tangle of cables, tall set of speakers, and a subwoofer. Various spatial interventions stretch across the <b>area</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gallery.</b> Another stud construction—in which Lloyd has embedded two overlapping wooden cutouts, among many strewn about the gallery—extends toward a rear wall <b>of</b> the <b>gallery.</b> Running {{across the top of}} the back wall is a banner, which rounds the corner of the room and stretches across the length of the adjacent windows. Aurally, one hears a dog barking and a cover of the 1936 Fred Astaire song, “We Saw the Sea”—relating the exhibition’s soundtrack to her playfully embellished dog photos and stenciled anchors, Lloyd uses sound not as diegetic but as associative and symbolic. Though it fills the space, the soundtrack in fact originates from Mile High Club (2017). Projected low on the floor and at a small scale, Mile High Club turns Lloyd’s lens on an airport runway as seen through a plane window, exploring a romanticized notion of arrivals and departures. Emphasizing texture, activating every part <b>of</b> the <b>gallery</b> space, stimulating yet confusing one’s hearing, and obstructing natural pathways, Lloyd’s installation renders viewing an active and physiological experience, upending cinema’s paralysis of the viewer and singular focus on the screen.
