5|$|P. l. sinhaleyus, {{known as}} the Sri Lanka lion, appears to have become extinct around 39,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> is only known from two teeth found in {{deposits}} at Kuruwita. Based on these teeth, P. Deraniyagala erected this subspecies in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Probably due to {{increased}} convergence rates of the Nazca and South America plates for the past 28 million years, a phase of strong volcanic activity commenced in the Andes 25 million years <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> is likely that this phase persisted without interruption until today.|$|E

5|$|Blue {{whales are}} {{rorquals}} (family Balaenopteridae), {{a family that}} includes the humpback whale, the fin whale, Bryde's whale, the sei whale, and the minke whale. The family Balaenopteridae {{is believed to have}} diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti as long ago as the middle Oligocene (28 Ma <b>ago).</b> <b>It</b> is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.|$|E
5|$|Differences in songs, {{genetics}} and morphology {{suggests that the}} Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> {{is likely that the}} initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of São Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the British Antarctic Survey {{reported}} a volcanic eruption under the Antarctica ice sheet 2,200 years <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> {{is believed to}} be that this was the biggest eruption in Antarctica in the last 10,000 years. Volcanic ash deposits from the volcano were identified through an airborne radar survey, buried under later snowfalls in the Hudson Mountains, close to Pine Island Glacier.|$|E

5|$|Pinker also {{speaks about}} {{evolutionary}} psychology in the podcast {{and believes that}} this area of science {{is going to pay}} off.

5|$|The Toba {{eruption}} (the Toba event) {{occurred at}} what is now Lake Toba about 75000±900 years <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> was the last {{in a series of}} at least four caldera-forming eruptions at this location, with earlier calderas having formed around 788000±2200 years ago. This last eruption had an estimated VEI=8, making it the largest known explosive volcanic eruption within the last 25 million years.|$|E
5|$|The olive {{appears to}} come from the region of Persia and Mesopotamia, at least 6,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> spread from there to nearby areas, and has been {{cultivated}} since the early Bronze Age (up to 3,150 BC) in southern Turkey, the Levant, and Crete. The ten countries with the largest harvests (in 2011) are all near the Mediterranean (Portugal being the tenth largest): together, they produce 95% of the world's olives.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Although The Volcano is {{estimated}} to have last erupted 150years <b>ago,</b> <b>it</b> {{is one of the}} five volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province that have recorded seismicity since 1985. Others include Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events) and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating that some Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are probably active, with significant potential hazards. The seismic activity corresponds both with some of Canada's recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes that have had major explosive activity throughout their history, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica is geologically varied, {{dating from}} the Precambrian era, with some rocks formed more than 3billion years <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> is {{composed}} of a metamorphic and igneous platform which {{is the basis of}} the continental shield. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as sandstones, limestones and shales laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the Transantarctic Mountains. In coastal areas such as Shackleton Range and Victoria Land some faulting has occurred.|$|E

5|$|Green Lake formed {{initially}} as {{a northern}} inlet of San Antonio Bay. As the Guadalupe River shifted westward about 2,500 years <b>ago,</b> <b>it</b> deposited silt, developing a delta that prograded into San Antonio Bay. Around 2,200years ago the delta discharge extended completely across the bay, severing the northern extension from the system, which formed present-day Green Lake. Pottery and burial grounds {{found in the}} area suggest a presence of Karankawa Indians {{at the time of}} formation. Middens uncovered north of the lake contained shells from the brackish water-species of rangia clams (rangia cuneata).|$|E
5|$|In Mesoamerica, wild {{teosinte}} {{was transformed}} through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize, more than 6,000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>It</b> gradually spread across North America {{and was the}} major crop of Native Americans {{at the time of}} European exploration. Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of locally domesticated squash and beans, while cocoa, also domesticated in the region, was a major crop. The turkey, {{one of the most important}} meat birds, was probably domesticated in Mexico or the U.S. Southwest.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} habitats of {{this species}} were the semi-arid savanna, thornveld, and light woodland typical of southern Africa. When settled agriculture arrived in its range about a thousand years <b>ago,</b> <b>it</b> adapted to cultivated land, and since the arrival of settlement, it has moved into towns. The Cape sparrow prefers habitats with an annual rainfall of less than , though in desert areas it is usually found near watercourses or watering holes. While it occurs in urban centres, it prefers parks, gardens, and other open spaces, and has a low reproductive success in more built-up areas.|$|E

5|$|The seventh episode {{features}} Stéphane Quême, {{otherwise known}} as DJ Falcon, who spoke of first meeting Daft Punk when the duo began recording their debut album Homework. Quême noted that the group's sound had changed since their debut, and that each of their albums had had a distinct influence. He also felt that the recording of Random Access Memories was such that a producer could potentially sample a track from {{it in the same}} way that Daft Punk themselves had sampled older records in their previous albums. Quême concluded that the duo were always sincere and although their first single was released 20 years <b>ago,</b> <b>it</b> still felt modern.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a {{geological}} formation known as the Blue Lias. This consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210–195million years <b>ago).</b> <b>It</b> {{is one of the}} richest fossil locations in Britain. The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.|$|E
5|$|Through {{studies of}} the present cloud {{structure}} and geology of the surface, combined {{with the fact that}} the luminosity of the Sun has increased by 25% since around 3.8billion years <b>ago,</b> <b>it</b> is thought that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion years ago was more like that of Earth with liquid water on the surface. The runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and the rise of the levels of greenhouse gases that followed. Venus's atmosphere has therefore received a great deal of attention from those studying climate change on Earth.|$|E
