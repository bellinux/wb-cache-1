She felt very tenderly towards him.|$|R

60|$|Such is {{the plight}} of honest John Bull at present, yet for all this the old fellow's spirit is <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> and <b>as</b> gallant <b>as</b> ever. If you drop the least {{expression}} of sympathy or concern, he takes fire in an instant; swears {{that he is the}} richest and stoutest fellow in the country; talks of laying out large sums to adorn his house or buy another estate; and with a valiant swagger and grasping of his cudgel longs exceedingly to have another bout at quarter-staff.|$|R
5000|$|Elaith Craulnober is {{described}} <b>as</b> a <b>tall</b> elven noble with sharp, handsome features and a graceful build.

40|$|In {{the novel}} The Stringer, Perla Coughlin has {{evacuated}} Pittsburgh following a biological attack. Now, at a Red Cross Shelter in Ohio, she slowly strings a racket <b>as</b> she tells a volunteer about her past, Pittsburgh 2 ̆ 7 s past, {{and what might}} lay ahead for both. Characters grapple with their ignorance toward environmental warning signs, the hidden costs of technology, and the disquieting ways in which apocalypses reveal 2 ̆ 2 who we really are. 2 ̆ 2 The first-person novel relies heavily on the epistolary tradition <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> Oulipean conventions of form and structure. Tennis serves <b>as</b> a unifying force amongst the four main characters, and the 2010 U. S. Census provides the vehicle through which terrorists launch their plot. The novel aims at a return toward Pittsburgh, but returning home is easier said that done. The city and its industries have been fundamentally changed. Personal secrets {{have been brought to}} light. Perla 2 ̆ 7 s fierce loyalty to her city makes forgiveness <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> task <b>as</b> clawing her way back to Pittsburgh...|$|R
50|$|On 11 March 2011 at 2:46 p.m. local time, {{the town}} was badly damaged by the tsunami caused by the 2011 Tohoku-Pacific Great earthquake. The tsunami was <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> 10 m <b>as</b> it hit the town, {{destroying}} the majority of homes in Shobutahama and Hanabuchihama, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> washing away or severely damaging many houses and buildings in the other coastal neighborhoods. The town estimates that over 1,000 houses were destroyed or damaged beyond use. The wave reached over 2 km inland, flooding the fields in front of Koyo Junior High School and Shiomidai and scattering the debris of the homes from Shobutahama. Approximately 95% of the town's rice fields were also flooded with seawater.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{living species}} is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri): on average adults are about 1.1 m tall and weigh 35 kg. The {{smallest}} penguin species {{is the little}} blue penguin (Eudyptula minor), also known <b>as</b> the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 cm tall and weighs 1 kg. Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's rule). Some prehistoric species attained enormous sizes, becoming <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> or <b>as</b> heavy <b>as</b> an adult human. These were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, {{and at least one}} giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly warmer than today.|$|R
25|$|The {{rebuilding}} of the exterior in 1882–1883 (south elevation) and 1896 (east elevation), {{prompted by the}} demolition of buildings adjacent to {{the south side of}} the chapel to allow North Street to be widened, involved replacing the stucco with red brick, enlarging the pediment and giving the new south elevation a similar appearance. It is neither <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> nor <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> the east side (facing Prince's Place), and has no pediment, but was otherwise very similar until the alterations of 1995 changed the entrance area and added more glass to make more of the interior visible from the street. The most significant feature of Arthur Blomfield's work on the exterior was the tall, red-brick clock tower. This has some flintwork and a hipped slate roof. The tower has four clock faces, each in a terracotta insert.|$|R
60|$|In the {{concluding}} scene the deputy lieutenant's uniform {{made a great}} figure, {{with the addition of}} the long-breasted waistcoat, a white scarf, and the white cockade, adorning Alex, who, with a boot-jack under his arm, looked <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> and <b>as</b> rigid <b>as</b> he possibly could, with a very low bow, which was gracefully returned by a royal personage in a Scottish bonnet, also bearing the white cockade, a tartan scarf, and the blue ribbon. Altogether, Prince Charles Edward and the Baron of Bradwardine stood confessed; the character was solemnly read, and the shoe pulled off, or supposed to be, <b>as</b> the lower screen still remained to cut off the view; and then the Baron indulged in a lengthy yawn and stretch, while Prince Charlie, skipping into the midst of the audience, danced round Mr. Langford, asking if he had guessed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Time enough, my dear lady, time enough. Let her {{enjoy life}} while she can. I {{am not in}} favor of making a young kitten behave like an old tabby; every {{creature}} in nature is joyful and frolicsome while it is young. She is <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> and <b>as</b> straight <b>as</b> any of her friends of the same age, and looks more healthy; she will tame down in time, and I dare say walk and look <b>as</b> prim and demure <b>as</b> they do. I was watching them the other day when there was a party of them up here, and I thought the difference was all to her advantage. She looked a natural, healthy girl; they looked like a set of overdressed dolls, afraid to move or to talk loud, or to stretch their mouths when they smile; very ladylike and nice, no doubt, but you will see Millicent will throw them into the shade when she is once past the tomboy age. Leave her alone, Mrs. Cunningham; a girl is not like a fruit tree, that wants pruning and training from its first year; it will be quite time to get her into shape when she has done growing." ...|$|R
