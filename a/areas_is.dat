5|$|A {{disparity}} in access to maternal care between {{rural and urban}} populations {{is one of the}} ramifications of a highly concentrated urban medical system. According to Government of India National Family Health Survey (NFHS II, 1998-1999) the maternal mortality in rural <b>areas</b> <b>is</b> approximately 132 percent the number of maternal mortality in urban areas.|$|E
5|$|Coverage {{in rural}} <b>areas</b> <b>is</b> unusually low, given {{the level of}} {{economic}} development and sector development. Using a broad definition of access, based on the WHO definition of an improved water source, access in rural areas in Colombia was 71%, while it was 81% in Honduras - a considerably poorer country - and 89% in Ecuador, also a poorer country than Colombia.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the species from {{becoming}} extinct have had modest success. Pallid sturgeon are actively being raised in a dozen hatcheries and the offspring are being released back to the wild every year. To better understand pallid sturgeon behavior, researchers have implanted radio transmitters to track their movements and help identify possible spawning areas. Federal and state agencies are working together to improve habitat by restoring spawning areas since restoration of these <b>areas</b> <b>is</b> required if the species is {{to survive in the}} wild.|$|E

5|$|In the Pacific, {{migration}} {{patterns are}} poorly characterized. Although some fin whales are apparently present year-round in the Gulf of California, {{there is a}} significant increase in their numbers in the winter and spring. Southern fin whales migrate seasonally from relatively high-latitude Antarctic feeding grounds in the summer to low-latitude breeding and calving areas in the winter. The location of winter breeding <b>areas</b> <b>is</b> still unknown, since these whales tend to migrate in the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba's economy {{relies heavily}} on agriculture, tourism, energy, oil, mining, and forestry. Agriculture is vital and is found mostly in the {{southern}} half of the province, although grain farming occurs {{as far north as}} The Pas. Around 12 percent of Canadian farmland is in Manitoba.

5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around {{six years to}} reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15–30years. For {{a large part of}} its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban <b>areas</b> <b>is</b> subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{wildlife}} {{importance of the}} area, {{much of what is}} now the SSSI has been protected in nature reserves, starting in 1912 when Charles Rothschild bought Blakeney Point and donated it to the National Trust, which has managed it since. A 2005 survey at six North Norfolk coastal sites (Snettisham, Titchwell, Holkham, Morston Quay, Blakeney and Cley) found that 39per cent of visitors gave birdwatching as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7million day visitors and 5.5million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Titchwell Marsh (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds), Cley Marshes (Norfolk Wildlife Trust) and Holkham National Nature Reserve each attract 100,000 or more visitors annually. The SSSI ownership outside the listed <b>areas</b> <b>is</b> a mixture of private land and areas owned by the National Trust or wildfowling associations which are not actively managed as nature reserves.|$|E
5|$|Between {{two thirds}} and three {{quarters}} of the population live in urban areas. Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years. Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years. This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use. However, {{from the beginning of the}} 21st century, the population growth in urban <b>areas</b> <b>is</b> higher than in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Croatian air {{pollution}} levels reflect {{the drop in}} industrial production recorded in 1991 {{at the onset of}} the Croatian War of Independence—pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of desulfurized fuels has led to a 25% reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in NOx emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of unleaded petrol reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. Air quality measurements indicate that the air in rural <b>areas</b> <b>is</b> essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Croatia are energy production (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase of GHG emissions is 3%, remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of ozone depleting substances was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015.|$|E

5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential <b>areas,</b> <b>is</b> the most detrimental {{activity on the}} distribution of these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed because it will not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} gray wolves recolonized the Bow Valley in Banff National Park. They had been absent for 30 years due to {{systematic}} predator control hunting {{which began in}} 1850. Wolves filtered back to Banff and recolonized one zone of the Bow Valley in 1985 and another in 1991. A high level of human use surrounding a third zone at Banff townsite has deterred the wolves from that area. The wolves are important in controlling elk populations and improve {{the balance of the}} ecosystem. A routine park study to monitor the wolves in Banff has now grown into the Southern Rockies Canine Project – the largest wolf research project in North America. The estimated wolf population in Banff National Park and the surrounding <b>areas</b> <b>is</b> now 60–70 animals.|$|E
5|$|Incorporated {{municipalities}} in Florida may {{be called}} cities, towns, or villages, {{but there is no}} legal distinction between the different terms.

However, 94% of the population lives in metropolitan areas. Of the remaining 6%, many live in smaller cities and towns, thus the actual number of residents living in truly rural <b>areas</b> <b>is</b> small.
