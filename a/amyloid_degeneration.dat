40|$|A {{translational}} aging rat {{model for}} chronic aluminum (Al) neurotoxicity mimics human Al exposure by ingesting Al, throughout middle age and old age, in equivalent amounts to those ingested by Americans from their food, water, and Al additives. Most rats that consumed Al in an amount {{equivalent to the}} high end of the human total dietary Al range developed severe cognitive deterioration in old age. High-stage Al accumulation occurred in the entorhinal cortical cells of origin for the perforant pathway and hippocampal CA 1 cells, resulting in microtubule depletion and dendritic dieback. Analogous pathological change in humans leads to destruction of the perforant pathway and Alzheimer's disease dementia. The hippocampus is thereby isolated from neocortical input and output normally mediated by the entorhinal cortex. Additional evidence is presented that Al is involved in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, <b>amyloid</b> plaques, granulovacuolar <b>degeneration,</b> and other pathological changes of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The shared characteristics indicate that AD is a human form of chronic Al neurotoxicity.

40|$|The {{secretory}} sorting receptors carboxypeptidase E (CPE) and secretogranin III (SgIII) critically activate peptidic messengers and targeting them at {{the regulated}} secretory pathway. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), {{the wide range of}} changes includes impaired function of key secretory peptidic cargos such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neuropeptides. Here, we analyzed CPE and SgIII in the cerebral cortex of AD patients and transgenic mice. In the normal human cortex, a preferential location in dendrites and perikarya was observed for CPE, whereas SgIII was mainly associated with axons and terminal-like buttons. Interestingly, SgIII and CPE were consistently detected in astroglial cell bodies and thin processes. In AD cortices, a strong wide accumulation of both sorting receptors was detected in dystrophic neurites surrounding amyloid plaques. Occasionally, increased levels of SgIII were also observed in plaque associate-reactive astrocytes. Of note, the main alterations detected for CPE and SgIII in AD patients were faithfully recapitulated by APPswe/PS 1 dE 9 mice. These results implicate {{for the first time the}} sorting receptors for regulated secretion in <b>amyloid</b> β-associated neural <b>degeneration.</b> Because CPE and SgIII are essential in the process and targeting of neuropeptides and neurotrophins, their participation in the pathological progression of AD may be suggested. © 2012 The Authors; Brain Pathology © 2012 International Society of Neuropathology.

40|$|The human retina is a {{thin layer}} of tissue on the inner back wall of the eye, {{containing}} millions of photoreceptor cells that receive and combine visual information. The retina sends visual information to the superior colliculus of the brain through the optic nerve. Because the retina ranks as one of the highest energy-consuming systems in the body, it requires a constant and abundant oxygen supply from the blood. Therefore, the retina is relatively susceptible to damage induced by oxidative stressors. Excessive oxidative stress is a key contributing factor in the pathophysiology of retinal disorders such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinopathy, which can lead to visual loss or complete blindness. Clinical {{studies have shown that the}} progression of retinal diseases can be slowed down by dietary treatment with antioxidant compounds such as vitamins, carotenoids, zinc, and phenolic phytochemicals. Coffee is one of the most frequently consumed beverages worldwide and its popularity continues to increase. Although coffee is rich in phenolic compounds and is the main contributor of dietary antioxidant intake in the diet, its protective effect against retinal degeneration has never been studied. In these studies, we employed several approaches to examine the protective effect of phenolic compounds in coffee on the retina. Specifically, the studies presented here investigated (i) the effects of coffee extracts and chlorogenic acid, a major phenolic compound in coffee, on retinal degeneration and (ii) the effects of phenolic acid metabolites formed after coffee consumption on retinal degeneration. The results showed that chlorogenic acid and coffee extracts could significantly reduce the apoptosis induced by hypoxia or optic nerve crush stress in the retina. In addition, coffee metabolites, especially chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and dihydrocaffeic acid, could reach the eye and protect the retina against hypoxia and optic nerve crush in vivo. Moreover, we show that extracts of Indian gooseberry, which is widely consumed in Asia as an ingredient in traditional medicine, juice, and cosmetics, has a retinal protective effect against <b>amyloid</b> beta-induced neuronal <b>degeneration.</b> Collectively, these findings suggest that coffee and Indian gooseberry consumption may help to prevent retinal degeneration. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R

On the other hand, the anomalous effects of cytokines and trophic factors share in common the activation of tau hyperphosphorylation patterns. In this context, a neuroimmunological approach to AD becomes relevant. When glial cells that normally provide neurotrophic factors essential for neurogenesis are activated by a set of stressing events, they overproduce cytokines and NGF, thus triggering altered signaling patterns in the etiopathogenesis of AD. A solid set of discoveries has strengthened the idea that altered patterns in the glia-neuron interactions constitute early molecular events within the cascade of cellular signals that lead to neurodegeneration in AD. A direct correlation has been established between the Ab-induced neurodegeneration and cytokine production and its subsequent release. In effect, neuroinflammation is responsible for an abnormal secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that trigger signaling pathways that activate brain tau hyperphosphorylation in residues that are not modified under normal physiological conditions. Other cytokines such as IL- 3 and TNF-a seem to display neuroprotective activities. Elucidation of the events that control the transitions from neuroprotection to neurodegeneration should be a critical point toward elucidation of AD pathogenesis...|$|R

Alzheimer's disease is the most significant cause of dementia in the elderly population. The rapid cognitive decline characteristic of this illness, coupled with the lack of a cure and a projected doubling of incidence within the next half century, has placed an impetus on research that focuses on developing early diagnostic tools. Earlier detection {{during the course of the}} disease may allow opportunities for the development of preventative and/or pharmaceutical measures that can possibly attenuate the progression or even prevent disease pathology for occurring. This paper outlines the current knowledge on the causes and diagnosis of AD in order to ascertain the most effective protocol for identifying pre-symptomatic individuals with the disease. One such method is to first select those at the highest risk of developing AD, and then performing periodic neuroimaging and cognitive assessments to ascertain the earliest manifestation. High-risk individuals include those with a family history of AD and/or other neurodegenerative disorders, in addition to those who already exhibit genetic markers for the disease, such as the Apolipoprotein Eε 4 allele and the mutated protein Tau. Subjects who present with increased levels of cardiovascular risk factors for stroke, particularly hypertension and diabetes, are also at high risk for developing vascular dementia, which is another significant cause of AD. Disease incidence increases exponentially with advancing age. Consequently, individuals past the age of 65 who possess any combination of the above risk factors fall within the highest risk group. Advances in neuroimaging techniques and technology, like Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), have allowed researchers to pinpoint the earliest pathological characteristics of AD, which includes cortical <b>degeneration,</b> <b>amyloid</b> plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. However, notwithstanding the recent discovery of the Pittsburg Compound B tracer used in PET, AD diagnosis via neuroimaging remains possible only when the pathological features are already present. Neuropsychological assessments, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, are frequently used to assess the cognitive decline of patients with AD. Recent enhancements within the scoring of these tests, which has allowed for the incorporation of qualitative data, has given fruitful results and hopeful directions for diagnosing AD before pathogenesis occurs. However, due to the failure of clinical trials in discovering a cure, continued research into the realms of diagnosis and prevention of AD is of paramount importance in order to combat the impending epidemic...|$|R

Serum protein fractions and protein fractions of the tissue of the inflammatory skin at each stage of inflammation were determined by means of filterpaper electrophoresis and by using Tiselius 2 ̆ 7 apparatus.

40|$|The results above {{reported}} lead to {{the conclusion}} that while in the degenerating cells chemical changes are taking place tending toward a diminution of the hexon bases as a whole, they affect the arginin especially. One may picture the process either as a partial or as a complete breaking down of certain proteid. material more or less rich in hexon bases, leaving behind. proteid matter poorer in bases. The meaning of these changes is, however, obscure, and with the limited number of known facts bearing upon the subject, it would seem idle even to attempt to formulate an hypothesis to explain them. Certain work of other investigators is, however, suggestive in this connection. Kossel and Dakin, for instance, as illustrated by their work upon the simple proteid body clupein, found that a partial destruction of the proteid molecule, involving the arginin group, is brought about by a ferment furnished by the animal organism. When subjected to the hydrolytic action of a mineral acid, clupein yields arginin in considerable abundance. But if the clupein is first acted upon by the ferment arginase found in the liver, and then subjected to acid hydrolysis, the yield of arginin is appreciably diminished. Among the cleavage products in the latter instance are the components of arginin, namely, omithin and urea. It would seem, therefore, as if the ferment had loosened the union between the omithin and urea in the arginin group, so that upon subsequent hydrolysis a diminution of arginin resulted. In the cases studied by me, {{it may be that the}} conditions were favorable for some such ferment action as that above described, and hence the relatively low yield of arginin. No attempt, however, was made to ascertain if omithin were present in the urine. Its presence there would seem not wholly unlikely when one considers the diminished power of oxidation of the phosphorus-poisoned cell, although Thompson has shown that arginin or omithin when administered to a healthy dog as food or by hypodermic injection is eliminated for the most part as urea, no ornithin being found. There might seem to be a conflict between this view and the results recently published by Wohlgemuth, but it must be borne in mind that the influences at work causing the breaking down of the proteid molecule are probably quite diverse in character. Wohlgemuth has recently shown for the first time that a diamino acid may actually find its way into the urine in phosphorus poisoning. He found arginin in the urine not only in rabbits poisoned with phosphorus but also in a patient suffering from phosphorus poisoning. On the other hand, he was unable to find lysin in the urine. This fact is of especial interest in view of the evidence set forth in this paper that the arginin base is lost to the proteid molecule more rapidly than the lysin base. The correspondence between the findings in the liver and in the urine is thus a close one. How much of the arginin liberated from the proteid molecule may find its way into the urine is of course uncertain. It seems reasonable to suppose that a portion of the base is acted upon by the arginase ferment in the manner already described. Of the seventeen to eighteen cleavage products of the proteid molecule thus far isolated, the hexon bases are among the most stable. One or more of these bases have been found in practically all proteid matter thus far investigated; in fact arginin is so uniformly present that Kossel has made the suggestion that it is the kernel of the proteid molecule. At all events, the question may be asked, whether, if the influences at work in the altered liver tissue were of a general character causing a diminution of the hexon bases, the monoamino acid groups would not suffer even a greater diminution; and since the pathological condition is undoubtedly associated with impaired oxidation, their presence should not be expected in the urine. As a matter of fact, Ignatowski found considerable quantities of monoamino acids in the urine of patients suffering from gout, pneumonia, and leukaemia, though under normal conditions no monoamino acids were found in the urine, indeed, not even after the subcutaneous injection of glycokoll. Furthermore, the loosening of the amino acids from the proteid molecule is suggested by the fact that Taylor found such acids in the liver of a patient who died from a hepatic disease of obscure etiology, but which he was inclined to attribute to chloroform poisoning. Taylor found not only leucin and tyrosin in the liver, but also arginin, a fact not without interest in view of the diminished arginin content found in the livers of the chloroformed dogs after acid hydrolysis. Moreover, the falling off of the hexon bases under the conditions studied seems quite in accordance with some results recently reported by Levene. He has shown that certain cleavage products obtained by the action of mineral acids upon self-digested pancreas, spleen, and liver, are much diminished when compared with the products obtained from the fresh glands. The lysin and arginin of the digested liver, for example, showed a diminution of over 50 per cent. It is now well established that in course of the process of aseptic autolysis, the proteids of the liver cell undergo decomposition into simpler substances, and Jacoby showed that during life autolysis may go on in portions of the liver in which the circulation has been hindered. But of greater significance still in this connection, is the observation made by Jacoby on the autolytic changes in the liver during phosphorus poisoning. He found that when the normal liver substance is permitted to autolyse the solution of the liver substance is a slow one. On the other hand, under similar conditions the liver of a phosphorus-poisoned animal undergoes rapid and almost complete solution. The difference in the behavior of the normal and damaged liver points to an increase of normal ferment action in the case of the poisoned organ. It thus seems reasonable to suppose that in phosphorus poisoning we have during life an exaggerated breaking down of the proteid molecule associated with an over-action of certain ferments, and among them probably arginase. The pathological process in the liver during life may, therefore, be thought of as proceeding in the same general direction as the process of post-morten autolytic decomposition. By means of further studies along lines indicated in this paper, it should be possible to gain a deeper insight into numerous pathological processes. The changes in <b>amyloid</b> <b>degeneration</b> are among those which promise to be better understood through the application of the new methods of chemical analysis. Moreover, it cannot be doubted that pharmacology as well as toxicology has much to gain from a study of what happens to the proteid molecule under the influence of poisons...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is {{characterized}} by the deposition of congophilic material within the walls of small to medium-sized blood vessels of the brain and leptomeninges. The incidence of CAA increases with aging, and in its most severe stages, the vascular amyloid causes a breakdown of the blood vessel wall which results in spontaneous, often recurrent, lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. CAA is estimated to account for four to twenty percent of all nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhages. Besides this major complication, extensive CAA has been associated with ischemic white matter damage with progressive dementia, perivascular inflammation, and secondary vasculitis. CAA occurs as a sporadic disorder in the elderly and in association with Alzheimer's disease (AD) with virtually all AD patients showing some degree of vascular amyloid in addition to parenchymal plaques. There are also familial forms of CAA such as hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type (HCHWA-D). The vascular amyloid in these disorders mainly consists of β -amyloid peptide (Aβ) that is produced by proteolytic cleavage from its precursor, which is the β -amyloid precursor protein (APP). The major Aβ species that is deposited in the vasculature is Aβ 40, while parenchymal amyloid is mainly composed of Aβ 42. One major difficulty in studying CAA is that it can be definitely diagnosed only postmortem. Moreover, spontaneous CAA occurs only in old primates and dogs, both of which are not practical models to study the pathogenesis and therapy of CAA. Rodents do not spontaneously develop CAA. The purpose of this thesis was to provide useful model systems to study the pathomechanism of vascular amyloid formation and associated pathology. To this end we generated and used mice that are transgenic for human genes bearing mutations that are well known to cause either hereditary Aβ -CAA or classical familial AD. In a first study we analyzed CAA and CAA-associated pathological changes in APP 23 transgenic mice. These mice overexpress human APP bearing the Swedish K 670 N/M 671 L double mutation, a typical early-onset AD-causing mutation, {{under the control of the}} neuron-specific Thy- 1 promoter. In addition to parenchymal amyloid plaques, APP 23 mice show consistent amyloid within leptomeningeal, neocortical, hippocampal, and thalamic vessel walls. Both CAA frequency and severity significantly increase with aging, demonstrating that not only more vessels are affected, but also that the amyloid burden of individual vessels increases with the progression of amyloid deposition. Cerebrovascular <b>amyloid</b> causes <b>degeneration</b> of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In severely affected vessels, SMCs are completely replaced by the amyloid. Similar to humans, amyloid depositing APP 23 mice develop spontaneous hemorrhages, some of them being recurrent. The bleedings are associated with amyloid-laden vessels and therefore, their anatomical distribution appears very similar to that of CAA. In aged mice, a quantitative analysis revealed a positive correlation between hemorrhages and CAA. Interestingly, no significant relationship between hemorrhages and total amyloid load was observed. Occasionally, CAA-associated vasculitis is seen in animals with extensive vascular amyloid. In a second study, we generated transgenic mice that express human APP E 693 Q under the control of the same neuron-specific Thy- 1 promoter (APPDutch mice) that has been used in APP 23 mice. In HCHWA-D patients, the APP E 693 Q Dutch mutation causes severe CAA with recurrent cerebral hemorrhagic strokes often leading to death early in their fifties, or to dementia in patients that survive the strokes. In contrast to AD patients that show parenchymal amyloid plaques, HCHWA-D patients exhibit few parenchymal amyloid deposits. Similar to HCHWA-D, aged APPDutch mice show extensive Aβ deposits mainly within the walls of leptomeningeal vessels followed by cortical vessels. Parenchymal Aβ deposits are mostly absent. In severely affected vessels, the SMCs are completely displaced by the amyloid. In regions with CAA, fresh and old hemorrhages are observed, and activated perivascular microglia and reactive astrocytes are found. To examine the mechanism that leads to the almost exclusive vascular amyloid formation in APPDutch mice, we compared the mice with transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type (wt) human APP using the same neuronal promoter (APPwt mice). As they age, APPwt mice develop parenchymal plaques with limited vascular amyloid deposits. A biochemical analysis of Aβ 40 and Aβ 42 levels revealed significant higher Aβ 40 : 42 ratios in amyloid depositing and pre-depositing APPDutch mice compared to APPwt mice. To demonstrate that the high Aβ 40 : 42 ratio in APPDutch mice is linked to the almost exclusive vascular amyloid deposition, we crossed APPDutch mice with mice that overexpress human presenilin- 1 bearing the G 384 A mutation (PS 45 mice) that is known to dramatically increase the production of Aβ 42. Strikingly, young APPDutch/PS 45 double-transgenic mice develop massive diffuse and compact parenchymal amyloid with only very little CAA. Thus, shifting the Aβ 40 : 42 ratio towards Aβ 42 is sufficient to redistribute the amyloid pathology from the vasculature to the parenchyma. A third series of experiments using neurografting techniques was performed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the initiation of cerebral amyloidosis in vivo. Cell suspensions of transgenic APP 23 and wild-type B 6 embryonic brain tissue were injected into the neocortex and hippocampus of both APP 23 and B 6 mice, respectively. In wild-type hosts, APP 23 grafts did not show amyloid deposits up to 20 months after grafting. Interestingly, transgenic and wild-type grafts in young APP 23 hosts develop amyloid plaques as early as three months after grafting. Although the majority of the amyloid is of the diffuse type, some compact and congophilic amyloid plaques are observed in the wild-type grafts. These congophilic amyloid lesions are surrounded by neuritic changes and gliosis, comparable to the amyloid-associated pathology that has previously been described in APP 23 mice. These results support the importance of neuronally secreted Aβ for the development of cerebral amyloidosis which can be initiated distant from the site of Aβ production, a finding that supports the observation of the above mentioned APPDutch mouse model. In summary, we demonstrate that APP 23 and APPDutch mice recapitulate CAA and CAAassociated pathology observed in humans and thus are valuable models for studying the human disease. Our results stress the importance of neuronally secreted Aβ for the development of CAA and emphasize the Aβ 40 : 42 ratio as an important factor in determining parenchymal versus vascular amyloid deposition. The understanding that different Aβ species can drive amyloid pathology in different cerebral compartments not only provides insights into the pathomechanism of sporadic and familial CAA but also has implications for current anti-amyloid therapeutic strategies...|$|R
