5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) {{stares up}} at an old mansion when two {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning to enter the house.

5|$|Madeleine was {{on holiday}} from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, her two-year-old twin siblings, {{and a group}} of family friends and their children. She <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>twins</b> had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a {{restaurant}} 55 metres (180ft) away. The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine's mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given arguido (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal's attorney general archived the case in July 2008 {{because of a lack of}} evidence.|$|E

By converting 27 of 29 save opportunities prior to the All-Star break, Nathan was selected as a reserve player for the American League in the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Nathan finished the year with 39 saves and a career best 1.33 ERA. He also had a career high six blown saves and surrendered his first career walk-off home run to Victor Martinez on September 16.

5|$|In Game 2, Koufax pitched six innings, {{giving up}} two runs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twins</b> won the Game 5–1 and took an early 2–0 {{lead in the}} series. The Dodgers fought back in Games 3 and 4, with wins by Claude Osteen and Drysdale. With the Series tied at 2 to 2, Koufax pitched a {{complete}} game shutout in Game 5 for a 3–2 Dodgers lead as the Series returned to Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium for Game 6. The Twins won Game 6 to force a seventh game. Starting Game 7 on just two days of rest, Koufax pitched through fatigue and arthritic pain. Despite giving up on his curveball {{early in the game}} after failing to get it over for strikes in the first two innings and pitching the rest of the game relying almost entirely on fastballs, he threw a three-hit shutout to clinch the Series. The performance earned him his second World Series MVP award. Koufax also won the Hickok Belt a second time, the first time anyone had won the belt more than once. He was awarded Sports Illustrated magazine's Sportsman of the Year award.|$|E

25|$|Met Stadium {{was officially}} {{abandoned}} when the Vikings <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twins</b> {{moved to the}} Metrodome in January 1982 and the Kicks folded after the 1981 soccer season.

After the rubble was cleared, the lot sat vacant for several years, although the nearby Met Center continued to provide entertainment for hockey fans.|$|E

25|$|However, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, {{operator}} of the Metrodome, won an injunction requiring the Twins to play there in 2002.

In the collective bargaining agreement signed with the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) in August 2002, contraction was prohibited {{until the end of the}} contract in 2006. By that time, the Expos had become the Washington Nationals <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twins</b> had made sufficient progress towards the eventual building of a new baseball-specific stadium that contraction was no longer on the agenda.|$|E
