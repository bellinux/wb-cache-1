At stud, Awesome Again has sired many stakes winners, {{including}} Paynter, who placed second in the 2012 Belmont Stakes and won the 2012 Haskell Invitational; Ghostzapper, who was 2004 American Horse of the Year and a 2004 Breeders' Cup winner; and Game On Dude, two-time {{winner of the}} Santa Anita Handicap. Oxbow is almost a full brother to Paynter; the two horses are out of full sisters. Oxbow's older full brother, Awesome Patriot, won the 2011 Alydar Stakes. Oxbow's younger full brother, Expect <b>a</b> <b>Lot,</b> <b>is</b> in race training. Oxbow's dam Tizamazing was bred back to Awesome Again in 2013, and in June 2013 was confirmed to be in foal.|$|E

25|$|The {{group of}} diffeomorphisms of a manifold. Quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>is</b> {{known about the}} group of diffeomorphisms of the circle. Its Lie algebra is (more or less) the Witt algebra, whose central {{extension}} the Virasoro algebra (see Virasoro algebra from Witt algebra for a derivation of this fact) is the symmetry algebra of two-dimensional conformal field theory. Diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds of larger dimension are regular Fréchet Lie groups; very little about their structure is known.|$|E
25|$|Another most {{important}} {{property of the}} heterostyly system is physiological. If thrum pollen is placed on a thrum stigma, or pin pollen on a pin stigma, the reproductive cells are incompatible and relatively little seed is set. Effectively, this ensures out-crossing, as described by Darwin. Quite <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>is</b> now known about the underlying genetics; the system is controlled {{by a set of}} closely linked genes which act as a single unit, a super-gene. All sections of the genus Primula have heterostyle species, altogether 354 species out of 419. Since heterostyly is characteristic of nearly all races or species, the system is at least as old as the genus.|$|E

They are also cathemeral (active both {{day and night}} {{throughout}} the year), a trait seen in some other members of its genus. [...] Research has suggested that metabolic dietary-related needs are the leading factor behind this behavior, although the specific hours of this activity pattern can shift based on lunar luminosity and seasonal changes in the photoperiod (day length). [...] Previous studies had ruled out effects of predators on the expression of this trait, and instead pointed to fruit availability and fiber intake as more important factors.|$|E

500|$|Reviewing the Game Boy Advance {{release in}} 2002, Craig Harris of IGN wrote that Yoshi's Island was both the console's best {{platformer}} {{as well as}} [...] "the best damn platformer ever developed". While acknowledging the game's roots in the Super Mario series, he said the game created enough gameplay ideas to constitute its own franchise. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that the game's story was also interesting as the origin story for the Mario brothers. Harris felt that the FX2 sprite-changing effects gave the game [...] "life" [...] and that the Game Boy Advance cartridge could handle the effects just as well. He added that Yoshi's morphing abilities and sound effects were designed well. Levi Buchanan of IGN said the game struck the right balance of tutorial by trial and error. IGN's Harris also noted a few Game Boy Advance-specific issues: framerate drop in areas where <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>is</b> happening onscreen, camera panning problems due to the screen's lower resolution, and a [...] "poor" [...] implementation of the [...] "dizzy" [...] special effect on the handheld release. Critics wrote that the [...] "coloring book"-style graphics held up well. IGN's Harris felt {{it was the best}} of the Super Mario Advance games. Of the similar version for the Wii U, Watts of Nintendo Life also noticed the framerate issues and problems resulting from the screen's closer crop, which were [...] "not enough to ruin the game, but ... noticeable". Edge felt that game's only disappointment was the linearity of its overworld following the exploratory Super Mario World and that the sequel would [...] "inevitably ... have less impact" [...] in comparison.|$|E
