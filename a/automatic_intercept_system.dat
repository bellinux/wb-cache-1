50|$|Fault {{injection}} {{can take}} many forms. In the testing of operating systems for example, fault injection is often performed by a driver (kernel-mode software) that <b>intercepts</b> <b>system</b> calls (calls into the kernel) and randomly returning a failure {{for some of the}} calls. This type of fault injection is useful for testing low level user mode software. For higher level software, various methods inject faults. In managed code, it is common to use instrumentation.

50|$|A {{major feature}} of the system was its ability to run {{programs}} that were designed to run on IBM's mainstream operating system (MVS). This was accomplished using an MVS emulator that <b>intercepted</b> <b>system</b> calls at the Supervisor Call instruction (SVC) level. Most third-party applications ran in this mode. Rather than write {{their own version of}} an application, the MUSIC/SP developers would usually start from the MVS version and rebuild it to run in MVS emulation mode. Since the MVS emulation was a very limited subset of the real thing, the applications generally ran more efficiently on MUSIC/SP.|$|R

40|$|A {{radiological}} groundwater plume {{was discovered}} {{to be discharging}} into a surface stream and portions of the storm drain network at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). A CERCLA removal action was initiated to address the discharges. The plume {{was found to be}} migrating 65 degrees oblique to the overall hydraulic gradient and was identified only after historic data were analyzed and field tests were performed under the working hypothesis of stratabound flow and transport. A detailed geologic and hydrologic analysis was performed that accurately predicted the 3 -dimensional plume configuration from a single point datum where significantly elevated contaminant levels were found in a bedrock core hole. Subsequent sampling found that direct discharges of contamination existed in the stream only in the location of the predicted stratum. The affected storm drain outfall discharges were suspected to be the major contributors to {sup 90 }Sr surface water risk from ORNL. Thus, the selected removal action focused on eliminating the known seepage to the storm drain network. <b>Intercept</b> <b>system</b> operations reduced the total surface water {sup 90 }Sr flux by about 90 %. Ongoing investigations seek to identify the source of the plume with the hope that the <b>intercept</b> <b>system</b> may eventually be deactivated. However, the efficiency of the system exceeded expectations and demonstrated that a good understanding of the hydrodynamics is a prerequisite to success. The relatively trouble free operation of the system also indicates that simple technologies can serve as effective measures to address immediate problems...|$|R
