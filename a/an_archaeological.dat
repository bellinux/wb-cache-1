5|$|The Burial Council's core {{contention}} is the city's decision to conduct <b>an</b> <b>archaeological</b> {{survey of the}} rail line's route in phases, meaning construction on {{a majority of the}} line will be complete by the time the survey in the Kakaako area is performed, which in turn increases the likelihood that any remains discovered will be moved instead of being allowed to remain in situ. In response to the Burial Council's concerns, the city agreed to begin conducting <b>an</b> <b>archaeological</b> survey of the area in 2010, two years earlier than originally planned. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources later signed the city's programmatic agreement on January 15, 2011, over the continuing concerns of the Burial Council.|$|E
