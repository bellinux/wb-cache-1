This paper deals with investigation on the challenges in the implementation of Maintenance <b>and</b> <b>Operation</b> Blueprint Plan for Iskandar Malaysia among five local authorities in Iskandar Malaysia. A total of 25 respondents have been selected and interviewed. The data have been analyzed qualitatively. Base on the interview, the results show that there are challenges to implement maintenance <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> blueprint in local authority immovable asset maintenance management which are no clear direction from the top management to implement the Maintenance <b>and</b> <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia, lack of staff to implement the Maintenance <b>and</b> <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia, did not have enough time to implement the Maintenance <b>and</b> <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia and the high cost required to implement the Maintenance <b>and</b> <b>Operation</b> Blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia. This article can serve as a foundation for future studies in critical success factors to implement immovable asset maintenance <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> blueprint. A future study investigating critical success factors to implement immovable asset maintenance <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> blueprint would be very interesting to produce a new approach for successful blueprint implementation...|$|R

Along with Båtsfjord Airport and Vardø Airport, Svartnes, Hasvik Airport was one of three regional airports in Finnmark with government-subsidized routes which did not receive state operating grants. In December Widerøe articulated that Hasvik Airport did not meet the demands for future operation as it lacked proper instruments and did not have an asphalt runway. Widerøe stated that with the introduction of the Dash 8 they would {{no longer be able to}} serve the airport. Additional navigation aids were installed in 1993 and the runway was asphalted in 1995, subsequently resulting in Dash 8 services being introduced. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership <b>and</b> <b>operations</b> of the airport from 1 January 1997.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{market design}} <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> within the empirical context of CO 2 markets. Six case studies are presented which describe business interactions during the design <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> of the Kyoto Protocol, the European Emissions Trading Scheme and the United Kingdom's Carbon Reduction Commitment. The case studies were developed through participant observation between October 2006 and June 2010. The research developed {{a conceptual framework}} {{for the study of}} CO 2 market design <b>and</b> <b>operation.</b> Network-level aspects of CO 2 market design <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> were captured by exchange, representational and normalising practices. Macro-level aspects of CO 2 market design <b>and</b> <b>operation</b> were captured by technical, temporal and uncertainty based considerations. The conceptual framework was used to analyse the six cases, exploring why CO 2 markets have not yet significantly influenced businesses' behaviour. Ibis research should help businesses and regulators to' better understand the challenges faced during CO 2 market design <b>and</b> <b>operation.</b> Market based approaches to environmental protection are receiving increasing interest in the marketing literature.
