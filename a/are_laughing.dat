25|$|In {{addition}} to masks depicting humans and animals, other masks {{deal with the}} fantastic, abstract and supernatural. In the Nahua community of Zitlala, Guerrero, the mask for a ceremonial jester is red, with lizards {{on the cheek and}} sometimes the nose. Masks to indicate the indigenous in the Tastoanes dance often originally had scorpions painted on them, but evolved to include hooked noses and other grotesque features. Today the noses are made of wood and images of bikini-clad women are painted on. Skull masks have their origins in the pre Hispanic period. The depiction of death in pre Hispanic Mexico was not fearful but rather part of life. Skull masks represent death still, and can be basic white or with fanciful decorations. Some are serious and others <b>are</b> <b>laughing.</b> Some masked characters represent abstract concepts such as time and the Seven Deadly Sins.|$|E

[...] Two types of sexual harassment have gain widespread fame in the workplace and are being addressed. [...] The first revolves around a woman being fired, or demoted due to a refusal to offer sexual favors to her superior. [...] This is called retaliatory. [...] The second revolves around an environment that is denigrating to female workers, including sexual comments, lewd pictures, or inappropriate actions by male co-workers in the workplace. [...] This is called environmental. [...] Despite these being addressed, due to ambiguities in the legal framework, these types of harassment can be hard to enforce. [...] Women are bringing it to the public's attention through attempts to speak out against the injustice, however, many remain silent, fearing they will be fired if they speak out. [...] This hurts their performance, undermining the idea of equality in the workplace. [...] Sexual harassment can be a double edged sword in the workplace however. [...] Some women reported that men who are caught sexually harassing female co-workers <b>are</b> <b>laughing</b> stocks. [...] Based on the Japanese idea of shame, some men, especially in large corporations, avoid sexual harassment at all costs to preserve their position. [...] Also, the opinions of men can vary greatly from department to department. [...] Women harassed in one department can meet with no resistance after being transferred. [...] Men's opinions of women in Japan vary greatly, primarily due to their experiences with women.
