40|$|Continental slope {{sedimentation}} is in generally {{driven by}} climate and the oceanographic setting <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>margin.</b> This work compares slope {{architecture of the}} glaciated Scotian Slope to the nonglaciated northern Argentine slope. On the Scotian Slope, a new seismic stratigraphy was used to identify variations in patterns of slope sedimentation. The Early Quaternary is characterized by few mass transport deposits (MTDs) and deposition occurs at the lower slope, whereas towards the younger glaciated sequence, much larger MTDs characterize slope sedimentation. On the Argentine Slope, sedimentation patterns are driven by along- and downslope processes. At times of large Pleistocene storm events at the shelf break, sediment may be supplied to the slope from the shelf. By comparing these slope systems, general ideas of slope deposition were developed. Glaciations have a severe impact on slope systems compared to non-glaciated margins and compared to glaciated slopes during pre-glacial times...|$|E
40|$|Early Paleozoic {{orogenesis}} {{has been}} recognized along the southern African (Saldanian orogeny) and East Antarctic (Ross orogeny) sectors of the Gondwana paleo- Pacific margin. However, {{the absence of a}} contemporaneous orogenic event in the Ellsworth Mountains of West Antarctica, once a contiguous part of this margin, has resulted in their geology being considered enigmatic. In this contribution, widespread, detailed structural studies from all stratigraphic levels of the Ellsworth Mountains allow their tectonic evolution to be reassessed. Geochemical, stratigraphic, and structural data indicate that the Middle to Upper Cambrian Heritage Group developed in a continental rift basin. Multiple observations of the crucial end-Cambrian contact between this rift sequence and the overlying Crashsite Group reveal the contact to be regionally conformable; there are localized outcrop-scale unconformities. Furthermore, structural continuity can be demonstrated across this key boundary, thus precluding the possibility of an end-Cambrian orogenic event. The entire stratigraphic succession was affected by two post-Permian phases of deformation. D 1 structures are locally developed and superimposed by the main dextral transpressive D 2 Permian−Triassic Gondwanian deformation event. D 2 is succeeded by an episode of extension orthogonal to orogenic strike. Recent geochronological data on the early Paleozoic evolution of the Cape fold belt reveal a strong tectonostratigraphic correlation with the Ellsworth Mountains, indicating that this sector of the Gondwana paleo-Pacific margin was affected by Middle to Late Cambrian rifting. A new tectonic model is proposed for the southwestern paleo-Pacific margin of Gondwana that accounts for the presence of rifting <b>along</b> <b>a</b> <b>margin</b> otherwise dominated by active subduction. ...|$|E

40|$|Conservation buffers, such as filter {{strips and}} {{riparian}} forest buffers, are widely prescribed {{to improve and}} protect water quality in agricultural landscapes. These buffers intercept field runoff and retain some of its pollutant load before it reaches a waterway. A buffer typically is designed to have uniform width <b>along</b> <b>a</b> field <b>margin</b> and to intercept runoff that flows uniformly to it. However, spatial analysis of field conditions and runoff patterns indicate that more runoff is likely to flow to some locations <b>along</b> <b>a</b> field <b>margin</b> than to others which can substantially limit a buffer 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness. We propose that precision conservation, the use of precision spatial information, technologies, and procedures to implement conservation practices, {{can be used to}} improve the design of buffers and ensure their effectiveness. Precision conservation can integrate detailed landscape data with mathematical models in a geographic information system. We can then analyze spatial patterns of runoff and design variable-width buffers that precisely match the needs of every location <b>along</b> <b>a</b> waterway. Greater cost of precision conservation is offset partly by greater water-quality benefit from each acre of buffer.

50|$|The {{geosyncline}} {{concept was}} first {{developed by the}} American geologists James Hall and James Dwight Dana in the mid-19th century during the classic studies of the Appalachian Mountains.

The geosynclinal hypothesis was further developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century and at that time was widely accepted as an explanation for the origin of most mountain ranges until its replacement by the subduction zone and continental collision orogenies of plate tectonics in the 1960s. Although the usage varied over the following 100 years, a geosyncline is still basically a large linear deepening basin <b>along</b> <b>a</b> continental <b>margin</b> which becomes deformed and then uplifted in parts as a mountainous region.|$|R

The nature of sediments can change remarkably <b>along</b> <b>a</b> passive <b>margin,</b> due to interactions between carbonate sediment production, clastic input from rivers, and alongshore transport.

The thick layers of sediment gradually thin with increasing distance offshore, depending on subsidence of the passive margin and the efficacy of offshore transport mechanisms such as turbidity currents and submarine channels.|$|R

This sequence prescribes the subsurface structural styles in the area.

40|$|Abstract The Ellsworth Mountains, first mapped {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Campbell Craddock, pose critical geological enigmas, solved and unsolved. The isolation of the mountains, their abrupt structural terminations and Paleozoic stratigraphic affinities are explained by rotation from the cratonic margin during Gondwanaland breakup. The mechanism remains obscure. The absence of intense folding associated with the Cambro-Ordovician Ross orogeny can be ascribed to local extension <b>along</b> <b>a</b> subducting <b>margin.</b> Yet tantalizing questions regarding possible Precambrian connections to Laurentia remain, and the cause of the post-Permian Gondwanide folding is controversial. The elevation (~ 5000 m) is high for an early Mesozoic fold belt. Thermal uplift could have been initiated during Jurassic-Cretaceous block rotation and Weddell Sea opening and continued into the Cenozoic. The history of glaciation provides input for models of ice loading and unloading. Measurements of present-day uplift test these models and help assess change in the mass of the ice sheet and hence in global sea level...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores empirically how {{external factors}} {{can influence the}} organizational structure of firms and how the structure a firm chooses can affect worker outcomes. The first chapter examines how a policy reform affected the organizational choices of firms. The MINER Act of 2006 resulted in increased scrutiny and penalties for underground coal mining operations relative to surface operations. In turn, this changed the incentives for coal preparation facilities to own these mines. Particularly, markets most affected by the reform saw an increase in ownership <b>along</b> <b>an</b> extensive <b>margin</b> and markets already integrated saw <b>a</b> decrease <b>along</b> <b>an</b> intensive <b>margin.</b> I argue these results reflect the competing incentives created by the policy. The increased riskiness of shut downs and flows in production resulted in preparation plants integrating {{with at least one}} mine to assure a basic level of supply. The increased regulatory liability of ownership induced by the new regulatory structure resulted in a countervailing force, reducing the intensity of integration in markets that were integrated prior to the reform. The second chapter (with David Weil) studies the prevalence of contractor utilization in the mining industry. Outsourcing of tasks has increased significantly in the underground coal mining industry over the last two decades. We hypothesize that the market and organizational incentives facing contractors increase the likelihood of injuries and fatalities to their workforce. Our results suggest increased risk exposure for mines with high contractor utilization. These findings have important implications for enforcement and public policies and extend the evidence of the adverse impact of forms of subcontracting on health and safety to the mining sector. Finally, the third chapter provides a case study of two major actors in the industry, Alpha Natural Resources and Massey Energy Company. It looks at the ownership choices the two companies have made in the past decade. Looking at these different decisions allows for the identification of contract operations that are of concern from a regulatory standpoint in this industry. This paper provides a blueprint for future research in determining the prevalence of these particular contracting arrangements in US coal mining...|$|R
