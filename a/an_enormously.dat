5|$|The {{defeat at}} Marathon barely touched the vast {{resources}} of the Persian empire, yet for the Greeks it was <b>an</b> <b>enormously</b> significant victory.

5|$|This pan-Germanic Empire was {{expected}} to assimilate practically all of Germanic Europe into <b>an</b> <b>enormously</b> expanded Reich. Territorially speaking, this encompassed the already-enlarged German Reich itself (consisting of pre-1938 Germany proper, Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Alsace-Lorraine, Eupen-Malmedy, Memel, Lower Styria, Upper Carniola, Southern Carinthia and German-occupied Poland), the Netherlands, the Flemish part of Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, at least the German-speaking parts of Switzerland and Liechtenstein.|$|E

The complex design includes several sets of individual figures, both clothed and nude, which allowed Michelangelo to fully demonstrate his skill in creating a huge variety of poses for the human figure and which have provided <b>an</b> <b>enormously</b> influential pattern book of models for other artists ever since.|$|E

5|$|For the Persians, the two {{expeditions to}} Greece {{had been largely}} successful; new territories had been added to their empire and Eretria had been punished. It was only a minor setback that the {{invasion}} had met defeat at Marathon; that defeat barely dented the enormous resources of the Persian empire. Yet, for the Greeks, it was <b>an</b> <b>enormously</b> significant victory. It {{was the first time}} that Greeks had beaten the Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.|$|E
5|$|In some legends, Marko's wonder {{horse was}} a gift from a vila. A Serbian story says that {{he was looking for a}} horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not move him. He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Šarac. He became <b>an</b> <b>enormously</b> {{powerful}} horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a vilas advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark give it <b>an</b> <b>enormously</b> strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony fishes (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, greeneyes, lanternfishes, bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake mackerels, deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes {{a wide variety}} of other animals, including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including other sharks and whales. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony fishes are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males {{are more likely to have}} full stomachs than females for unknown reasons.|$|E
60|$|Religion {{is still}} very strong. I went into many churches, where I saw {{obviously}} famished priests in gorgeous vestments, and <b>a</b> congregation <b>enormously</b> devout. Generally {{more than half the}} congregation were men, and among the men many were soldiers. This applies to the towns {{as well as to the}} country. In Moscow I constantly saw people in the streets crossing themselves.|$|R
40|$|Preceded by Slovak-related shorts, Slovak filmmaking {{started with}} the 1921 feature Jánošík (dir. Jaroslav Jerry Siakeľ) funded by the Slovak-American company Tatra Film from Chicago. Subsequent films mostly focused on {{folklore}} (including another feature about Jánošík in 1935, dir. Martin Frič) and newsreels until topics concerning World War II and the onset of communism launched a period of increased production, but also struggle with censorship. The Sun in a Net (dir. Štefan Uher, 1962) helped launch the Czechoslovak New Wave (Prague New Wave, Czech New Wave), and The Shop on Main Street (dir. Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos, 1964) became the first Central European film to receive an Oscar. The 1960 s also saw socially committed and experimental filmmaking, which was reduced during the following decade of more restrictive censorship. The 1980 s brought <b>a</b> <b>enormously</b> popular blockbusters, some of which combined popular appeal with cultivated content, while others foreran {{the collapse of communism}} by accommodating pop culture and seeking ticket sales...|$|R

Main campaigns have centered around opposing tuition fee increases, increasing student financial assistance, and advocating for greater uptake of open educational resources (OER). In addition to this, the Society has campaigned for student-dominated university decision-making, academic freedom, improved student services, social democracy, women's rights, gay rights, First Nations, the disabled, and international students.

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this work is to use traditional Folk Puppets (called Kathputli in Hindi) to make {{the process of learning}} more socially acceptable. Children are the key learners in rural society and provide a channel for their parents to learn modern technology. This channel is especially significant when the parents are illiterate or s emi-literate. In our current work with children in rural areas using simple robotic programming tools 1, even lower-end programming systems such as LEGO Mindstorms are <b>a)</b> <b>enormously</b> expensive for <b>a</b> family whose monthly income is about $ 20, and b) alien in u sage and construction, and are difficult for the parents to accept. The Kathputli is envisaged as a low-cost, culturally familiar platform whereby digital technology can become more acceptable to village elders. Using it, the child is able to show the prin ciples of programming through the story enactment behavior of puppets, and in the process, demonstrate the validity of the programming that she learns. Also, the child is herself more motivated, for her programs move real objects instead of manipulating ab stract notions that are inside the computer...|$|R

25|$|In {{response}} to the punk fashion of the mid-late 1970s, there was {{a throwback to the}} late 1950s Ivy League style.

Popular preppy clothing for men included Oxford shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, polo shirts with popped collars, khaki slacks, argyle socks, dress pants, Hush Puppies Oxford shoes, brogues, suspenders, seersucker or striped linen suits, corduroy, and cable knit sweaters that were often worn tied around the shoulders.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} and economic chaos of the late 1980s and early 1990s soon erupted into {{the disintegration of the}} Warsaw Pact and the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In 1985, the Soviet military had about 5.3 million men; by 1990 the number declined to about four million. At the time the Soviet Union dissolved, the residual forces belonging to the Russian Federation were 2.7 million strong. Almost all of this drop occurred in a three-year period between 1989 and 1991.|$|E
