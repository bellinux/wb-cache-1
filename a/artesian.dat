5|$|Electricity in {{the island}} is {{supplied}} by a 0.326 MW diesel power plant of the Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO). However, electricity service is only available in early morning, from 4:00 to 6:00a.m. and at night, from 5:00 to 11:00p.m., due to limited fuel supplies. As for water supply, potable water for drinking and washing comes from water pumps, <b>artesian</b> wells, springs, and rainwater collection tanks in individual homes. The island has access to cellular phone and Internet service through Smart and Globe. Terrestrial and cable television service are also available.|$|E
5|$|In the late-19th century, the Sleaford {{area was}} a major barley {{producer}} and by the 1880s, Sleaford was a stop on railway lines connecting the town to Boston, Grantham, Bourne, Spalding and Lincoln. These qualities made the town desirable {{for the production of}} malt, a crucial ingredient in beer production. The brewers Bass, Ratcliffe and Gretton Ltd were attracted to the town and in 1880 proposed a new malting complex there, which would consolidate malting closer to the barley source and reduce costs by up-scaling production. Drilling in 1892 revealed suitable <b>artesian</b> water sources under Sleaford; plans were submitted nine years later and over 13 acres of land off Mareham Lane was purchased; work started in 1901 and was complete by 1907.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment {{continued}} to rise, {{and by the}} end of his tenure, Ross requested that parents first communicate with his office before sending their sons to the school. The increase in students necessitated an improvement in facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an <b>artesian</b> well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees.|$|E
5|$|Canalisation of the River Slea {{began in}} the 1790s. Canals in England were {{constructed}} from the 1760s to make inland trade easier; Sleaford's businessmen were keen {{to benefit from the}} improved communication they allowed. Sleaford Navigation opened in 1794. It facilitated the export of agricultural produce to the Midlands, and the import of coal and oil. Mills along the Slea benefited and wharves were constructed around Carre Street. Between 1829 and 1836 the navigation's toll rights increased in value by 27 times. The railways emerged in the 19th century as an alternative to canals and arrived at the town in 1857, when a line from Grantham to Sleaford opened. It made agricultural trade easier and improved communication, but led to the decline of the Navigation Company. Income from tolls decreased by 80% between 1858 and 1868; it made its first loss in 1873 and was abandoned in 1878. The town's rural location and transport links meant that the late 19th century saw the rise of two local seed merchants: Hubbard and Phillips, and Charles Sharpe; the former took over the Navigation Wharves, and the latter was trading in the US and Europe by the 1880s. The railway, Sleaford's rural location and its <b>artesian</b> wells, were key factors {{in the development of the}} 13-acre Bass & Co maltings complex at Mareham Lane (1892–1905).|$|E
5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for <b>artesian</b> springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E
25|$|In {{downtown}} Olympia, {{efforts to}} preserve the use of <b>artesian</b> water at the one remaining public well has been the mission of H2Olympia: <b>Artesian</b> Well Advocates. In 2011, the city of Olympia committed $50,000 towards improvements of an <b>artesian</b> well, located {{in a parking lot}} that was recently purchased by the city. Renovations at the <b>artesian</b> well were completed in late 2011, including surface improvements, solar lighting, and a raised area to fill bottles. In Spring of 2012, sea-themed mosaic artwork created by community members was also installed {{at the site of the}} well.|$|E
25|$|The town assumed {{its present}} name in 1903, after the {{discovery}} of an <b>artesian</b> aquifer in the area; <b>artesian</b> wells for agriculture flourished in the area until the aquifer became significantly depleted in the 1920s. The city was officially incorporated in 1905.|$|E
25|$|After leaving swimming, Okamoto {{moved to}} the United States for several years, where he studied geology and {{business}} administration and started a company drilling <b>artesian</b> wells.|$|E
25|$|By {{comparing}} {{the age of}} groundwater obtained {{from different parts of}} the Great <b>Artesian</b> Basin, hydrogeologists have found it increases in age across the basin. Where water recharges the aquifers along the Eastern Divide, ages are young. As groundwater flows westward across the continent, it increases in age, with the oldest groundwater occurring in the western parts. This means that in order to have travelled almost 1000km from the source of recharge in 1 million years, the groundwater flowing through the Great <b>Artesian</b> Basin travels at an average rate of about 1 metre per year.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Carns began homebrewing {{kombucha}} using Olympia's <b>artesian</b> well water. Friends and houseguests loved it, and in 2007 {{she began}} bottling commercially {{under the name}} Magic Kombucha, and is selling wholesale to local restaurants and stores.|$|E
25|$|The Great <b>Artesian</b> Basin {{situated}} in Australia {{is arguably the}} largest groundwater aquifer in the world (over 1.7 million km²). It plays a large part in water supplies for Queensland and remote parts of South Australia.|$|E
25|$|Within {{months of}} {{becoming}} premier, Bjelke-Petersen encountered his first controversy over allegations of conflict of interest. In April 1959, while still a backbencher, {{he had paid}} £2 for an Authority to Prospect, giving him the right to search for oil over 150,000km2 near Hughenden in far north Queensland. The next month he incorporated a company, <b>Artesian</b> Basin Oil Co. Pty Ltd, {{of which he was}} sole director and shareholder, and the same day entered an agreement to sell 51% of the company's shares to an American company for £12,650. The following day he sought the consent of Mines Minister Ernie Evans to transfer the oil search authority to <b>Artesian</b> for £2; the consent was given a week later.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Artesia was {{established}} upon {{the completion of}} the Artesia School District on May 3, 1875. It was named for the many flowing <b>artesian</b> wells in the area, which made the village ideal for farming and agriculture.|$|E
25|$|It sits {{on top of}} an <b>artesian</b> well; {{built in}} 1911. However, no record of its {{construction}} can be found. Although it may have once been a smaller wooden tower, to qualify for historic designation in California, factual documentation must be presented.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 1894, the Towson Water Company laid wooden pipes and {{installed}} fire hydrants that were connected to an <b>artesian</b> well near Aigburth Vale. On November 2, 1894, Towson was supplied with electric service through connection with the Mount Washington Electric Light and Power Company.|$|E
25|$|The {{churches are}} also a {{significant}} engineering feat, given {{that they are all}} associated with water (which fills the wells next to many of the churches), exploiting an <b>artesian</b> geological system that brings the water {{up to the top of}} the mountain ridge on which the city rests.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{permanent}} rivers or bodies of water, streams and groundwater, desalinated seawater and very scarce surface water must supply the country's needs. In eastern Arabia and in the Jabal Tuwayq, <b>artesian</b> wells and springs are plentiful. In Al Ahsa a number of large, deep pools are constantly replenished by <b>artesian</b> springs {{as a result of}} underground water from the eastern watershed of the Jabal Tuwayq. Such springs and wells permit extensive irrigation in local oases. In the Hijaz, wells are abundant, and springs are common in the mountainous areas. In Najd and the great deserts, watering places are comparatively fewer and scattered over a wide area. Water must be hoisted or pumped to the surface, and even where water is plentiful, its quality may be poor.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, the Griffiths Brothers at Toowoomba {{manufactured}} windmills of the American pattern from 1876, {{with the}} trade name Southern Cross Windmills in use from 1903. These became {{an icon of}} the Australian rural sector by utilizing {{the water of the}} Great <b>Artesian</b> Basin. Another well-known maker was Metters Ltd. of Adelaide, Perth and Sydney.|$|E
25|$|The Great <b>Artesian</b> Basin {{in central}} and eastern Australia {{is one of the largest}} {{confined}} aquifer systems in the world, extending for almost 2 million km2. By analysing the trace elements in water sourced from deep underground, hydrogeologists have been able to determine that water extracted from these aquifers can be more than 1 million years old.|$|E
25|$|The {{depth of}} ground water in Quezon ranges from 80–120 feet {{for most of}} the barangays with the {{exemption}} of Barangay Barucboc where contact may be made within 40–60 feet. Based from the survey conducted by the municipal government, there are 406 pitcher type wells, 100 jetmatic pump wells, 30 baby <b>artesian</b> wells, 1,305 individual faucet (level III), 235 deep wells and 7 natural spring reservoirs.|$|E
25|$|Uriah White, an Asbury Park pioneer, {{installed}} the first <b>artesian</b> well water system. As many as 600,000 {{people a year}} vacationed in Asbury Park during the summer season in the early years, riding the New York and Long Branch Railroad from New York City and Philadelphia to enjoy the mile-and-a-quarter stretch of oceanfront Asbury Park. By 1912, The New York Times estimated that the summer population could reach 200,000.|$|E
25|$|After {{the sack}} of Rome {{at the end}} of 1527 Pope Clement VII took refuge in Orvieto. To ensure that the city would be {{sufficiently}} supplied with water {{in the event of a}} siege, he gave orders for the digging of the now famous <b>artesian</b> well Pozzo di San Patrizio (1528–1537). For added security, the pope ordered that a second well be dug to supply the fortress alone.|$|E
25|$|A {{confined}} aquifer is an aquifer that is overlain by a relatively impermeable layer of rock or substrate {{such as an}} aquiclude or aquitard. If a {{confined aquifer}} follows a downward grade from its recharge zone, groundwater can become pressurized as it flows. This can create <b>artesian</b> wells that flow freely without the need of a pump and rise to a higher elevation than the static water table at the above, unconfined, aquifer.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{water for}} {{irrigation}} comes from two main sources, river systems and underground aquifers. Major river systems used for irrigation in Australia include the Murray-Darling system, the Ord River in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and many rivers {{along the east}} coast of Australia. This includes the Burdekin River Irrigation Area in North Queensland where irrigation is used during the dry season for double-cropping. A major source of ground water in Australia is the Great <b>Artesian</b> Basin.|$|E
25|$|The {{site was}} {{surveyed}} by CORF (Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées), the Maginot Line's {{design and construction}} agency; Lembach was approved for construction in July 1931. The gros ouvrage was intended to receive a second 75mm gun turret in a second phase of construction, never pursued. Due to its compact arrangement, Four-à-Chaux did not receive an electrified internal rail system; the garrison pushed carts on the rails between the blocks. The fort also features an <b>artesian</b> well.|$|E
25|$|Under a {{commission}} form of government, the city made improvements in sanitation, particularly {{the construction of}} an innovative sewer system designed by George E. Waring, Jr.. This removed the breeding grounds of the mosquito vector. It is likely that survivors' acquired immunity from the 1870s epidemics contributed more to lesser fatalities from the disease in future years. In 1887, a source of abundant and pure <b>artesian</b> water was found beneath the city, which guaranteed its water supply and aided its recovery.|$|E
25|$|Corn, wheat, hay, soybeans, and oats are all typical crops, {{and most}} of the villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a grain elevator. Irrigation water is {{available}} from the South Platte, the Arkansas River, and a few other streams, and also from subterranean sources, including <b>artesian</b> wells. However, heavy use of ground water from wells for irrigation has caused underground water reserves to decline. As well as crop agriculture, eastern Colorado hosts considerable livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.|$|E
25|$|The city {{installed}} a revolutionary sewer system and upgraded sanitation and drainage to prevent another epidemic. Pure water from an <b>artesian</b> well {{was discovered in}} the 1880s, securing the city's water supply. The commissioners developed an extensive network of parks and public works {{as part of the}} national City Beautiful movement, but did not encourage heavy industry, which might have provided substantial employment for the white working-class population. The lack of representation in city government resulted in the poor and minorities being underrepresented. The majority controlled the election of all the at-large positions.|$|E
25|$|Águas de São Pedro {{is popular}} for its mineral waters, {{as its name}} indicates. There are three fountains in the municipality: Fonte Juventude (Youth Fountain), Fonte Gioconda (Gioconda Fountain), and Fonte Almeida Salles (Almeida Salles Fountain), all with a much higher {{mineralization}} than most other Brazilian mineral springs. Of these three, only the last two have a natural outcrop, as the Juventude fountain water comes from the <b>artesian</b> well at an old oil exploration site. The water in the Fontanário Municipal (Municipal Fountain) is potable, and for baths, there is the Spa Thermal Dr. Octavio Moura Andrade, the municipal bath house.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the new site as a whole required some of the existing Grade II structure of the hospital to be demolished. This was allowed on the account that these parts were not of significant architectural or historical interest to justify preserving. However, the south boundary wall (a registered ancient monument) had to undergo some renovation work {{to make it sound}} again. The old <b>artesian</b> well was considered an important Victorian artifact and was left intact. This required the foundations of the new unit to be built a little further to the south than originally intended.|$|E
25|$|The {{provision}} of kindling and wood, from {{the forests of}} the parish and from the hinterland of the Serra de Santa Bárbara, was an important economic activity until {{the last part of}} the 20th century, making Terra Chã a principal community of woodsmen on the island. The fabrication and {{provision of}} axes and sawmills, which reached appreciable dimensions, occupied an important part of the population of the parish. Wood would be transported by bull carts to the centre of Angra for sale, or prepared in <b>artesian</b> sawmills located in the hinterlands, before being sent to town to be used in construction, or carpentry.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture employs about 40% of Morocco's workforce. In {{the rainy}} {{sections}} of the northeast, barley, wheat, and other cereals can be raised without irrigation. On the Atlantic coast, where there are extensive plains, olives, citrus fruits, and wine grapes are grown, largely with water supplied by <b>artesian</b> wells. Morocco also produces {{a significant amount of}} illicit hashish, much of which is shipped to Western Europe. Livestock are raised and forests yield cork, cabinet wood, and building materials. Part of the maritime population fishes for its livelihood. Agadir, Essaouira, El Jadida, and Larache are among the important fishing harbors.|$|E
25|$|As mayor, he paid {{particular}} attention to the elementary education of children by improving and renovating school buildings, constructing additional school structures, health centers, barangay halls and playgrounds in all the barangays and providing <b>artesian</b> wells to areas with low water supply. He relocated some 1,800 squatter families out of San Juan to Taytay, Rizal, at no cost. He was also the first mayor to computerize assessment of the Real Estate Tax in the Municipal Assessor's Office. When Corazon Aquino assumed the presidency in 1986, all elected officials of the local government were forcibly removed and replaced by appointed officers-in-charge, including Estrada.|$|E
25|$|In 1908 the {{southwest}} corner of Tulare County had abundant water from wells drilled into the then-shallow water table. The <b>artesian</b> wells and water mains laid throughout the residences during and since 1912 were controlled by Allensworth Rural Water Company, a state corporation. But water problems began developing in 1912 and by 1914 had become serious. The declining water tables throughout the area and increasing problems with alkali salts helped to doom the community. As the original settlers moved away, the land values declined, some of the houses were left empty, and others were rented or sold.|$|E
25|$|Citrus {{in central}} Florida did well until the Great Freeze of 1894-5. Many growers {{abandoned}} their groves entirely, but Mead recognized that below ground <b>artesian</b> water {{at a constant}} 70 degrees might provide relief from frost and allow citrus trees to survive freezing temperatures. His engineering background led him to postulate that overhead water irrigation of the trees hanging with fruit could keep the fruit protected from damage at 32° within an ice cocoon regardless of how low the mercury fell. He successfully covered an acre of oranges, installed a pump and irrigation system, and proved the concept, the first known description of a technique still used today.|$|E
25|$|The {{hotel was}} built on a plot of land, next to the Savoy Theatre, that Carte {{originally}} purchased to house an electrical generator for the theatre (built in 1881), {{which was the first}} public building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity. The construction of the hotel took five years and was financed by the profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan partnership, particularly from The Mikado. It was the first hotel in Britain lit by electric lights and the first with electric lifts. Other innovations included private, marble, en-suite bathrooms in the majority of its 268 rooms; constant hot and cold running water in each room; glazed brickwork designed to prevent London's smoke-laden air from spoiling the external walls; and its own <b>artesian</b> well.|$|E
