40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Forest soils {{contain a}} {{substantial}} portion of global terrestrial carbon stores. Forest management can influence the soil carbon pool and how soil organic matter functions. The long-term productivity of forests is an ongoing goal where land managers utilize biomass and timber. A site-specific understanding of intensively managed forests can ensure <b>achievements</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>goal.</b> Within a managed forest in the western Oregon Cascades, treatments were installed to harvest three levels of biomass, with and without compaction, to monitor impacts to growing season characteristics of Douglas-fir roots. Soil temperature and moisture conditions were continuously monitored from 10 to 100 cm depth, and three sources of soil respiration were measured monthly for two years immediately following treatments. Negligible differences in the length of growing season were detected, however the daily- 10 cm average, maximum, and diel flux of soil temperatures significantly increased by 1. 5, 2. 7, and 2. 5 °C, respectively, with increasing biomass harvesting. Organic matter removal strongly influenced growing season soil characteristics down to a 100 cm depth. Diel temperature flux at 100 cm for the least and most impacted treatments were 5. 7 and 7. 8 °C, respectively, a magnitude equivalent to seasonal shifts in soil temperature at the same depth. In spite of favorable temperature and moisture conditions with less organic matter left on the surface, soil respiration was moderately higher on bole only harvests. A priming effect may explain why these sites with more surface biomass, although significantly cooler, had the highest rates of soil respiration. The combination of increased temperatures throughout the soil profile after forest harvesting, and higher additions of dissolved organic matter from forest residuals, could have an impact on deep soil carbon. These responses have implications for long-term nutrient cycling that have yet to be elucidated for deeper soils; but this should be considered when land managers are planning forest fertilization and rotation lengths...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{underlying}} themes of self-expansion is that individuals have a very basic motive to self-expand. Self-expansion is the desire to enhance an individual's potential efficacy. [...] Motivational models often refer to self-efficacy as one's belief that they are competent and can achieve specific goals. [...] However, within the self-expansion model, potential efficacy is used instead as it only refers to obtaining resources that will make goal attainment possible. <b>Achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>goal</b> is a secondary concern. According to the self-expansion model we increase potential efficacy by creating close relationships, which in turn, increases material and social resources, perspectives and identities. Some examples of resources include the following: social support, possessions, information, and friendship networks. Perspectives are the way we appreciate the world and ascribe causal explanations for people's behaviours. Identities refer to a person's memories and characteristics. Self-expansion is not consciously motivated. A person does not explicitly attempt {{to be part of}} a close relationship for the sole intention of increasing physical and psychological resources.|$|E

For this purpose, age-related changes in globin phenotypes of circulating human erythroid cells were examined from 5 umbilical cords, 99 infants, and 5 adult donors. Unexpectedly, an average of 95 % of the cord blood erythrocytes and reticulocytes expressed HbA and the adult beta-globin gene, as well as HbF and the gamma-globin genes. The distribution of hemoglobin and globin gene expression then changed abruptly due {{to the expansion of}} cells lacking HbF or gamma-globin mRNA (silenced cells). In adult reticulocytes, less than 5 % expressed gamma-globin mRNA. These data are consistent with a “switching” model in humans that initially results largely from gamma- and beta-globin gene coexpression and competition during fetal development. In contrast, early postnatal life is marked by the rapid accumulation of cells that possess undetectable gamma-globin mRNA and HbF. The silencing phenomenon is mediated by a mechanism <b>of</b> cellular replacement. <b>This</b> novel silencing pattern may be important for the development of HbF-enhancing therapies...|$|R
