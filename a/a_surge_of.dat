5|$|According to IndieWire in May 2017, Amblin Television and Warner Bros. Animation are in {{the early}} stages of {{developing}} a reboot of Animaniacs. The interest in the reboot was driven by <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> popularity for the show when it was made available on Netflix in 2016, plus numerous successful projects that have revived interest in older shows, such as Fuller House.|$|E

5|$|Between 1907 and 1917, the League for Women's Equal Rights was {{the most}} {{important}} feminist organization in Russia. Like the Russian Women's Mutual Philanthropic Society, it was focused on education and social welfare, but it also pushed for equal rights for women, including suffrage, equal inheritance, and an end to passport restrictions. The 1917 Revolution, catalyzed in part by women workers' demonstrations, generated <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> membership in the organization. In the same year, because of the society's continued lobbying, Russia became the first major world power to grant women the right to vote.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold was {{exhausted}} and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at Ruby and Iditarod. Construction of the Alaska Railroad caused <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> economic activity and allowed heavy equipment to be brought in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous gold dredges were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s {{as the price of}} gold rose during the Great Depression. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a staging area for construction of military depots during World War II and {{the first decade of the}} Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The Discovery Expedition {{was planned}} during <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> {{international}} {{interest in the}} Antarctic regions {{at the turn of}} the 19th and 20th centuries. A German expedition under Erich von Drygalski was leaving at about the same time as Discovery, to explore the sector of the continent south of the Indian Ocean. The Swedish explorer Otto Nordenskiöld was leading an expedition to Graham Land, and a French expedition under Jean-Baptiste Charcot was going to the Antarctic Peninsula. Finally, the Scottish scientist William Speirs Bruce was leading a scientific expedition to the Weddell Sea.|$|E
5|$|The first filmed {{scenes of}} Iris were shot in Akita, Japan on March 10, 2009. Lee Byung-hun's {{popularity}} in Japan caused the series and its production to gain immediate notability in the country. Lee's filming was often shadowed by fans, beginning with thousands greeting him at Akita Airport upon his arrival. Due to several pivotal {{moments of the}} series being filmed in the prefecture, Akita soon experienced <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> Korean tourists going on tours tailored to followers of the show. The crew went on to shoot in Japan for three weeks and left the country on March 28.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Chickasaw horse, bred by the Chickasaw Indians using horses captured from De Soto's expedition, became extinct {{after being}} used to create the Florida Cracker Horse and having some influence on the Quarter Horse. Some sources still use the Chickasaw name to describe the Florida Cracker Horses of today. In the 1970s there was <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> interest in recreating the Chickasaw using horses bearing strong resemblances to the original breed, but this has since died out and the breed association no longer exists.|$|E

5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the feminist movement connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} {{was related}} to a large low-pressure system across the central United States that intensified on February28 while over Kansas, and a cold front moved across the region, providing the lift needed to allow the storms to develop. In addition, <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> very moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and warm temperatures across {{the south side of}} the storm helped feed the storms. Temperatures were in the 70s°F (low 20s°C) in some areas to the south, while the mercury was below freezing on the north side. The dewpoints were in the 60°F (16°C) range as far north as southeastern Kansas, which provided extra fuel.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, Romanticism {{initiated}} <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> {{enthusiasm for}} all things Greek, including Greek mythology. In Britain, new translations of Greek tragedies and Homer inspired contemporary poets (such as Alfred Lord Tennyson, Keats, Byron and Shelley) and painters (such as Lord Leighton and Lawrence Alma-Tadema). Christoph Gluck, Richard Strauss, Jacques Offenbach and many others set Greek mythological themes to music. American authors of the 19th century, such as Thomas Bulfinch and Nathaniel Hawthorne, held that the study of the classical myths was essential to the understanding of English and American literature. In more recent times, classical themes have been reinterpreted by dramatists Jean Anouilh, Jean Cocteau, and Jean Giraudoux in France, Eugene O'Neill in America, and T. S. Eliot in Britain and by novelists such as James Joyce and André Gide.|$|E

5|$|Drifting {{generally}} northward, {{the disturbance}} slowly organized within {{a region of}} low to moderate wind shear and favorable outflow aloft. The circulation was enhanced by <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> westerly winds to the south. At 06:00UTC on June29, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression. Following further organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert that day at 22:30UTC with the system located about 345km (215mi) northeast of Pohnpei. Convection steadily deepened over the center and banding features began consolidating around the periphery. On June30, the JMA upgraded the cyclone to Tropical Storm Chan-hom. The JTWC assessed Chan-hom to be slightly weaker at this time, initiating it as a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia {{possesses}} 673 {{airports in}} 2013, ranging from grand international airports to modest unpaved airstrips on remote islands or inland interior areas located throughout the archipelago. In November 2011, Indonesia {{had more than}} 230 conventional airports, most of them operated by Transportation Ministry technical operation units and state-owned PT Angkasa Pura I & II. Major airports are managed by Angkasa Pura; Angkasa Pura I operates 13 airports in Eastern Indonesia, while Angkasa Pura II operates 13 airports in Western Indonesia. After the 2000 aviation deregulation, Indonesian airports endured <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> passengers, especially catalyzed by the advent of low-cost carriers. According to the Indonesian Transportation Ministry, 9 of the 13 airports managed by PT Angkasa Pura I have exceeded their passenger capacity.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{damage was}} {{generally}} minor. There were {{no reports of}} wind damage, although tropical storm-force winds affected the northern coast of Tamaulipas. A newspaper in Mexico reported up to 24inches (600mm) of precipitation across much of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon; this figure is in dispute, however, as the rainfall database maintained by Mexico's National Weather Service shows the maximum amount to lie under 20inches (508mm). The heavy rainfall from the storm filled nearly half the reservoirs in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas, which were almost empty due to drought conditions in the region. As a result, dozens in southern Nuevo Leon were forced to evacuation their homes. Rains from Gabrielle flooded streets and destroyed bridges and highways in northern Mexico. No storm surge recordings were taken in Mexico, although it is estimated by the National Hurricane Center that <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> a few feet took place {{to the north of}} the track. Six fatalities were reported in Mexico as a result of Gabrielle.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} end of the American Revolution in 1783, <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> westward {{migration}} into Central and Western New York began. At the time, most travel west of the Albany area was by water. While rudimentary roads were laid out following the Mohawk River, there were no major land routes west of Fort Schuyler (present day Utica), except for an old east–west Iroquois trail that was a simple foot path. By the late 1780s many companies began to set up their operations in the new settlements in the Central and Western New York. As a result, there was a clamor for the building of a main road running west from Utica.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{began to}} re-arm and recruit after August 1969. In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA. Both were {{supported}} {{by the people of}} the Free Derry area. Meanwhile, relations between the British Army and the nationalist community, which were initially good, deteriorated. In July 1971 there was <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops. The government introduced internment on 9 August 1971, and in response, barricades went up once more in the Bogside and Creggan. This time, Free Derry was a no-go area, defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA. From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army, and the Provisionals began a bombing campaign in the city centre. As before, unarmed 'auxiliaries' manned the barricades, and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Emilia reached the southwestern United States. In {{southern}} Arizona, <b>a</b> <b>surge</b> <b>of</b> {{moisture from the}} storm produced scattered thunderstorms, including one severe thunderstorm in Santa Cruz County. The cell dropped heavy rainfall and large hailstones in {{a short amount of}} time; one location reported hail of 1.75inches (44.5mm) in diameter. The rainfall, which totaled several inches in some areas, caused flash flooding, with 8inches (205mm) of floodwater reported at one location along Interstate 19. Thunderstorms in Graham County produced a wind gust of 64mph (103km/h) at the airport in Safford. Unsettled conditions persisted across Arizona for about a week. In southern California, the storm dropped light rainfall, which assisted firefighters in containing a wildfire.|$|E
