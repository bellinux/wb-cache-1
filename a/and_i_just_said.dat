So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E
500|$|With the Station to Station {{sessions}} {{completed in}} December 1975, Bowie started {{work on a}} soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth with Paul Buckmaster as his collaborator. Bowie expected to be wholly responsible for the film's music but found that [...] "when I'd finished five or six pieces, I was then told that if I would care to submit my music along with some other people's... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Shit, you're not getting any of it". I was so furious, I'd put so much work into it." [...] Notwithstanding, Harry Maslin argued that Bowie was [...] "burned out" [...] and could not complete the work in any case. The singer eventually collapsed, admitting later, [...] "There were pieces of me laying all over the floor". In the event, only one instrumental composed for the soundtrack saw the light of day, evolving into [...] "Subterraneans" [...] on his next studio album, Low.|$|E
500|$|Hutchings {{introduced}} Drake to the 25-year-old American producer Joe Boyd, {{owner of}} the production and management company Witchseason Productions. The company was, at the time, licensed to Island Records, and Boyd, {{the man who had}} discovered Fairport Convention and been responsible for introducing John Martyn and The Incredible String Band to a mainstream audience, was a significant and respected figure on the UK folk scene. He and Drake formed an immediate bond, and the producer acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career. A four-track demo, recorded in Drake's college room in the spring of 1968, led Boyd to offer a management, publishing, and production contract to the 20-year-old, and to initiate work on a debut album. According to Boyd:In those days you didn't have cassettes—he brought a reel-to-reel tape [...] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And I called him up, and he came back in, and we talked, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'd like to make a record." [...] He stammered, [...] "Oh, well, yeah. Okay." [...] Nick was a man of few words.In a 2004 interview, Drake's friend Paul Wheeler remembered the excitement caused by his seeming big break, and recalled that the singer had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge.|$|E

5000|$|Medine {{started the}} Man Repeller blog in May 2010 as a hobby, {{blogging}} from her parents' {{apartment on the}} Upper East Side. The idea for the blog came {{during a trip to}} Topshop with friend Rachel Strugatz, now an online editor at Women's Wear Daily. Medine recalled, [...] "We were laughing at how everything was so man-repelling: acid-washed harem pants and enormous shoulder pads, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'That's it!

5000|$|As {{revealed}} in The Face magazine during 1986, the inspired [...] "Weak in The Presence" [...] catch phrase originally came to Michael Ward as a joke.

5000|$|John Travolta {{was chosen}} to do the voice work for Bolt. Despite a history of turning down voice over offers for {{animated}} characters, he agreed to provide the voice for Bolt as he, according to the actor himself, [...] "indicated as the right character". In an interview with CBS, Travolta {{explained that he was}} intrigued with Bolt's personality after reading the script. [...] "When I read this script and saw this character, so guileless, so kind of naive and fun <b>and</b> touching <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> to myself; maybe this is the one to do". When recording the dialog for Bolt the animators would film Travolta's facial expressions and use them when sketching the storyboard and animating Bolt's mimics. Travolta took inspiration from his performance from earlier action films such as Broken Arrow and Face/Off, mixing it up with a certain naiveté and guilelessness suitable for Bolt's character.|$|R
6000|$|No! let me write honestly. Her eyes betrayed her, {{her voice}} betrayed her, while {{she said her}} parting words. What I saw, what I heard, was no longer {{within the limits of}} doubt.

5000|$|Gordon {{began to}} think he might be gay while {{attending}} middle school. In April 2014, Gordon came out {{to his family and}} teammates. He subsequently chose to come out publicly later in 2014, becoming the first openly gay men's basketball player in Division I. Gordon <b>said</b> [...] "I <b>just</b> didn't want to hide anymore, in any way ... I've been waiting and watching for the last few months, wondering when a Division I player would come out, <b>and</b> finally <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'Why not me?'". He further said that Jason Collins' becoming the first openly gay player in the National Basketball Association inspired him to come out. Gordon's family was mixed in their responses to his coming out. He received praise from Collins and Michael Sam, who became the first openly gay player in the National Football League. Students organized a rally in support of Gordon, occurring on April 16, which drew over 1,500 supporters. Five members of the Westboro Baptist Church were on hand to protest against Gordon. Later that year, he became the first openly gay player in Division I to play in a men's basketball game. In 2016, he became the first openly gay man to play in the March Madness tournament.|$|R

5000|$|In {{terms of}} the actual meaning behind the song, Ferguson told Blues & Soul: [...] "It's {{basically}} talking about how we get so concerned about stuff like money and cars that it overtakes our lives and we forget what's really important is FAMILY. I mean, I actually remember the day I wrote it with Eg White. Something had upset me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was like 'You know, people just forget what's important'... <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> literally <b>just</b> <b>said</b> 'It's not your money, it's not your car - it's LOVE!' - and straightaway we were both like 'Oh, we've got a SONG here!'!... <b>And,</b> while <b>I</b> know it sounds cheesy, I genuinely do think those sentiments are TRUE!

I had too much going on with my own stuff <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "No". No need to be going away for months on end, away from home, away from family.

[...] She waited for his contrition, but proceeded without it, in a somewhat meeker strain: [...] "Lily couldn't get her things at Pazienti's, and we {{had to go to the}} Merceria for them. Then of course the nearest way home was through St. Mark's Square. I made Lily go on the Florian side, so as to avoid the officers who were sitting at the Quadri, and we had got through the square and past San Moïsè, as far as the Stadt Gratz. I had never thought of how the officers frequented the Stadt Gratz, but there we met a most magnificent creature, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'What a splendid officer!' when she gave a sort of stop and he gave a sort of stop, and bowed very low, and she whispered, 'It's my officer.' I didn't dream of his joining us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't think he did, at first; but after he took a second look at Lily, it really seemed as if he couldn't help it. He asked if he might join us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't say anything." ...|$|R
