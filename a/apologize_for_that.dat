500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard it. If you can read lips, it's a little bit harder, and I <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> That's a thing that you won't hear from me again. I hope I didn't offend anybody outside the circle that we trust." ...|$|E
2500|$|For years afterwards, Frazier {{retained}} his bitterness towards Ali {{and suggested}} that Ali's battle with Parkinson's syndrome {{was a form of}} divine retribution for his earlier behavior. In 2001, Ali apologized to Frazier via a New York Times article, saying [...] "In a way, Joe's right. I said {{a lot of things in}} the heat of the moment that I shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called him. I <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> I'm sorry. It was all meant to promote the fight". Frazier reportedly [...] "embraced it", though he later retorted that Ali only apologized to a newspaper, not to him. He said: [...] "I'm still waiting [...] to say it to me." [...] To this Ali responded: [...] "If you see Frazier, you tell him he's still a gorilla." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2016, Fox News host Greg Gutfeld {{injected}} {{himself into}} the Chili Peppers/Patton feud taking shots at the Chili Peppers and Kiedis after Flea posted video of him and Koko the gorilla. Gutfeld said, [...] "As most musicians know, this is a vast improvement over the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the worst band on the planet. The ape is better than Anthony Kiedis. By the way, the ape is 45, which is half the age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More, don't ever forget it." [...] After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying [...] "Two days ago I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet. I {{received a lot of}} flack from fans all over the world. What I meant to say was the Red Hot Chili Peppers [...] the worst band in the universe. I’d like to <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> confusion. I want to explain {{that we live in a}} binary universe," [...] he continued. [...] "You're either a Faith No More fan, or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. You cannot love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis, because they are two different people. You have to love Mike Patton, you cannot love Anthony Kiedis. So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe, because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe." [...] Flea responded to Gutfeld's comments a few days later saying [...] "I remember seeing a poll recently that said people who watch Fox News knew less about world affairs than people who watch no news at all. It's clearly a funny program. It doesn't faze me, not really. I heard that. It's funny. I don't care. They're all welcome to hate us. God bless 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{misunderstood}} me, Marian. I neither boasted, nor threatened, nor taunted. I {{have even}} <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> moment's irritation. If you cannot forgive such a trifle, you yourself can {{have very little}} generosity." ...|$|R
50|$|In October 2010, Levin {{worked with}} Carl Paladino and {{prepared}} an anti-gay statement which Paladino read in {{part in the}} Orthodox Jewish community, which made national news. Paladino later <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> statement, causing Levin to withdraw his support from Paladino.|$|R
5000|$|Although his {{fighting}} tactics {{were very}} dirty (thumbing the {{opponents in the}} eye or punching in banned areas), he was also known <b>for</b> always <b>apologizing</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> to his opponent. [...] "He had a body like a wire, a mind like a chess player, a quick wit and a splendid smile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> beforehand. Well, {{that first}} night I saw a young man looking very anxious, very uncomfortable, and very weak. The second time--and not very long after--I saw him well dressed, {{lounging}} like any other young man on a Sunday afternoon, and I believed that he took the liberty of bowing to me then because I had once looked at him under a misapprehension." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> third shot of mine, {{which was}} infamous, for I {{committed}} a similar fault to that against which I warned you, sir, {{and did not}} fire far enough ahead. However, it may serve to show your attendant {{the difference between the}} tail of a pigeon and an oak leaf," [...] and I pointed to one of the feathers of the poor bird, which was still drifting to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will answer}} to any gentleman that calls me to account," [...] Mark said, in a ringing voice, [...] "but I don't {{meet a man}} who has been {{expelled}} from White's for cheating, and who I have no doubt is well stocked with cards at the present moment, in readiness for the victim that he is next going to meet after the plucking of Mr. Cotter has been done. Now, gentlemen, search him and see if I am wrong; if I am I will <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> part of my accusation." ...|$|E
50|$|Apologies (few): Don't {{apologize}} {{more than}} once for what one has done ineffectively or <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> something <b>that</b> was ineffective.|$|R
50|$|Kim Dae-Eun of South Korea {{withdrew from}} {{competition}} {{before the final}} started, but the information did not get in time to Eugen Spiridonov of Germany, who thus missed the final and only 23 gymnasts {{took part in the}} competition. The organizers officially <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> to the German Gymnastics Union already during the final.|$|R
60|$|Meantime the well-connected but rustic Mills {{had been}} busy {{lighting}} his briar and the distinguished Captain sat smiling to himself. I was horribly vexed and <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> intrusion, {{saying that the}} fellow was a future great sculptor and perfectly harmless; {{but he had been}} swallowing lots of night air which had got into his head apparently.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will now}} {{tell you what}} induced me to secure you for myself. It was not natural affection; I did not love you then, and I knew {{that you would be}} a serious {{encumbrance}} to me. But, having brought you into the world, and then broken through my engagements with your mother, I felt bound to see that you should not suffer for my mistake. Gladly would I have persuaded myself that she was (as the gossips said) the fittest person to have charge of you; but I knew better, and made up my mind to discharge my responsibility as well as I could. In course of time you became useful to me; and, as you know, I made use of you without scruple, but never without regard to your own advantage. I always kept a secretary to do whatever I considered mere copyist's work. Much as you did for me, I think I may say with truth that I never imposed a task of absolutely no educational value on you. I fear you found the hours you spent over my money affairs very irksome; but I need not <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> now: you must already know by experience how necessary a knowledge of business is to the possessor of a large fortune.|$|E
5000|$|After a fine save from a {{very close}} shot by Nándor Hidegkuti, he was {{described}} by the sports reporter Herbert Zimmermann with the words [...] "Toni, you're a football God". He later had to <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> comment because the church complained about the comparison of a football player with God.|$|E
5000|$|On April 21, 2008, he {{resigned}} and stated: [...] "We, including myself, have caused troubles {{to the nation}} with the special probe; I deeply <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> and I'll take full responsibility for everything, both legally and morally." [...] On December 29, 2009, the South Korean government moved to pardon Lee Kun-hee.|$|E
5000|$|... "After my fight, I was excited, and so I did {{something}} rude <b>that</b> I should <b>apologize</b> <b>for.</b> But <b>that</b> showed just how excited I was over that fight." ...|$|R
25|$|A second {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} the award {{was the fact that}} eight months before Banting's and Best's paper, the Romanian physiologist Nicolae Paulescu had reported the discovery of a pancreas extract that he dubbed pancrein, which lowered blood glucose concentration. Banting and Best even cited him in their paper, but misinterpreted his findings, purportedly because of an error in translation from French. Best publicly <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> mistake many years later.|$|R
2500|$|Instead {{of getting}} a better deal, they signed Will Clark instead (for $30 million and five years), causing Palmeiro to call him a [...] "low life", though he later <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> saying <b>that.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mayor Elkins {{has stated}} {{publicly}} that he defends {{the use of}} the cameras and admits they generate revenue. In a 2016 interview with Cleveland Scene, he stated [...] "We have 120-some-thousand cars traveling through this community every day," [...] he says, [...] "and no matter how aggressive we were, we just couldn't control speeds. This is a safety issue. Now, do I recognize that they generate revenue? Absolutely. Do I <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that?</b> No." [...] (Especially, Elkins says, because on I-77, where the speed limit is 60 mph, citations aren't issued until a vehicle hits 74 mph.)" ...|$|E
5000|$|On August 24, 2014, Cipriano called CNN faking as San Francisco police department's public {{information}} officer Adam Sure during the station's coverage of the 2014 South Napa earthquake. His explanation for the earthquake was, [...] "because of the early morning, {{because it was so}} early in the morning most people were at their homes when it happened, and what we believe is this was a rumbling from Howard Stern's butt crack." [...] Reporter Christi Paul responded to the call: [...] "Alright, obviously that is not who we expected it was to be, we <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> so early in the morning." ...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{his life}} and career, Walker has had a strong and {{consistent}} position against abortion. In 2010 Walker told {{the editorial board of}} the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel he opposed abortion, without exception for rape or incest. Regarding his stance on abortion, he has stated: [...] "I don't <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> but I don't focus on that; I don't obsess with it." [...] In a TV ad during his 2014 campaign for re-election Walker stated that he is [...] "pro-life", and pointed to legislation he signed that leaves [...] "the final decision to a woman and her doctor". In August 2015, he criticized the notion that abortion is necessary {{to save the life of}} the mother in certain cases, calling it a [...] "false choice." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> any {{inconvenience}} <b>that</b> this cancellation {{may have}} caused, {{and we thank}} you in advance for your understanding." ...|$|R
60|$|BROADBENT [bustling {{into the}} room, and {{taking off his}} damaged {{motoring}} overcoat, which he put down on the sofa]. Well, that's over. I must <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> making <b>that</b> speech, Miss Doyle; but they like it, you know. Everything helps in electioneering.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1980s Falwell {{said that}} {{sanctions}} against the apartheid regime of South Africa would result in what, he felt, would be a worse situation, such as a Soviet-backed revolution. He drew the ire of many when he called Nobel Peace Prize winner and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu a phony [...] "as far as representing the black people of South Africa". He later <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> remark and claimed that he had misspoken. He also urged his followers to buy up gold Krugerrands and push U.S. [...] "reinvestment" [...] in South Africa.|$|R
5000|$|For years afterwards, Frazier {{retained}} his bitterness towards Ali {{and suggested}} that Ali's battle with Parkinson's syndrome {{was a form of}} divine retribution for his earlier behavior.

5000|$|On the August 24 {{edition of}} The 700 Club, Robertson {{asserted}} that he hadn't actually called for Chávez's assassination, {{but that there}} were other ways of [...] "taking him out", such as having special forces carry out a kidnapping. Robertson explicitly denied having used the word [...] "assassination", though the word [...] "assassinate" [...] was present in his initial statement. Later that day, he issued a written statement in which he said, [...] "Is it right to call for assassination? No, and I <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> statement. I spoke in frustration that we should accommodate the man who thinks the U.S. is out to kill him". However, he continued to justify his original stance on the potential threat Chávez posed to U.S. interests, even reiterating his support for Chavez's assassination on the February 2, 2006 edition of Hannity and Colmes, replying [...] "Not now, but one day, one day, one day," [...] when asked whether Robertson wanted Chavez taken out.|$|E
5000|$|The chorus in {{the play}} {{is made up of}} men of Lemnos. [...] In In Aeschylus' play, the men of Lemnos had not visited Philoctetes {{throughout}} his entire ten year time on the island. [...] Philoctetes told the chorus his backstory of being abandoned by the Greeks. Dio considered Aeschylus' approach of having a chorus that had never visited Philoctetes but not <b>apologizing</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> more straightforward than Euripides' approach of an apologetic chorus. [...] In Sophocles' Philoctetes, Lemnos is uninhabited, making the decision of the Greek commanders to maroon Philoctetes there even more heartless.|$|R
6000|$|The other made {{a decent}} show of resistance, but finally {{accepted}} the offer, saying: [...] "You certainly are white to me. I want to <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> making <b>that</b> attempt to sneak away that night--I {{had a powerful}} good reason for not staying any longer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Most of that {{audience}} {{took a long}} while to warm up to Joel's energetic show, something that had never happened in other countries he had performed in. According to Joel, each time the fans were hit with the bright lights, anybody {{who seemed to be}} enjoying themselves froze. In addition, people who were [...] "overreacting" [...] were removed by security. It was during this concert that Joel, enraged by the bright lights, flipped his piano and snapped a microphone stand while continuing to sing the current part of the set. He later <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> incident.|$|R
5000|$|Concerns {{expressed}} by Senators Feinstein and Pryor concerning the Senate's preogative in confirming U.S. Attorney nominations in early January were followed up by hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 6, 2007 called by Senator Schumer (D, New York) with Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty as witness.McNulty underscored that the seven were fired for job performance issues, and not political considerations.McNulty later called Senator Schumer by telephone to <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> inaccurate {{characterization of the}} firings, however.At least six of the seven had recently received outstanding job performance ratings. McNulty testified that Bud Cummins, the U.S. Attorney for Arkansas, was removed to install {{a former aide to}} Karl Rove and Republican National Committee opposition research director, the 37-year-old Timothy Griffin.Cummins, apparently, [...] "was ousted after Harriet E. Miers, the former White House counsel, intervened on behalf of Griffin."In subsequent closed-door testimony on April 27, 2007 to the committee, McNulty said that days after the February hearing, he learned that White House officials had not revealed to him White House influence and discussions on creating the list.|$|E
5000|$|In 1988, Brennaman and Nuxhall {{appeared}} before National League President Bart Giamatti at the NL office, in New York City {{in regards to}} accusations that Brennaman incited the crowd to cause a delay of game after an altercation between Reds manager Pete Rose and umpire Dave Pallone. After Rose was ejected from the game and Brennaman criticized Pallone during the live radio broadcast, fans littered the field with debris, leading to a game delay. Brennaman {{had this to say}} regarding the incident."I still maintain we were right", Brennaman said. [...] "I'll never <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> They accused us of inciting a riot. I don't think we did then and I don't think we did now."On June 12, 2007, Brennaman made an on air apology during the Cincinnati Reds Radio Network broadcast for a comment he had recently made comparing an upcoming road trip to the Bataan Death March. The Reds, who at the time held the worst record in the National League, were set to face the Oakland Athletics, the Seattle Mariners and Philadelphia Phillies on the road trip.|$|E
5000|$|After the December 16, 2006 {{game against}} the Atlanta Falcons, Falcons cornerback DeAngelo Hall claimed that Owens spat in his face after a play early in the game. Game {{officials}} and reporters were unaware of the incident and Owens was not asked about it until his post-game interview with the NFL Network, when he confirmed it. Owens said, [...] "I got frustrated and I <b>apologize</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> It was a situation where he kept hugging me and getting in my face. He {{had a lot of}} words, I didn't. I just wanted to come and prove I’m not a guy to be schemed with." [...] Hall said that he lost all respect for Owens. When made aware that Hall was saying Owens did it deliberately, Owens said that it was an accident that occurred while they were in each other's face, talking trash. Despite no video evidence, the NFL fined Owens $35,000 for the incident. After initially refusing to take a phone call from Owens, Halls was convinced by Deion Sanders to speak with Owens two days after the incident and later stated that they [...] "cleared it all out." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, Turner accused Israel of terror: [...] "The Palestinians are {{fighting}} with human suicide bombers, that's all they have. The Israelis ... they've {{got one of}} the most powerful military machines in the world. The Palestinians have nothing. So who are the terrorists? I would make a case that both sides are involved in terrorism." [...] He <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> and the remarks in 2011 about the 9/11 hijackers, but also defended himself: [...] "Look, I'm a very good thinker, but I sometimes grab the wrong word ... I mean, I don't type my speeches, then sit up there and read them off the teleprompter, you know. I wing it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a February 2007 {{appearance}} on Meet the Press, Edwards told Tim Russert, [...] "over time, when I reflected on what I thought {{was going to}} be necessary going forward, to have some moral foundation to work on issues like poverty and genocide, things that I care deeply about, I could no longer defend this vote. It was pretty simple. And I got to the place I felt like I had to say it and had to say it publicly. And so— what? — a year — {{a year or so ago}} I did that." [...] He subsequently <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> military authorization vote.|$|R
5000|$|On March 9, 2017, Full Frontal <b>apologized</b> <b>for</b> saying <b>that</b> Kyle Coddington, {{a writer}} for OUTSET {{magazine}} at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) who was undergoing chemotherapy for brain cancer, had [...] "Nazi hair". The show said they were unaware of his condition and donated to his medical expenses on GoFundMe. Coddington refused to accept their apology.|$|R
