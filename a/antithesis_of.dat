5|$|Caudillos like Facundo Quiroga are seen, at the {{beginning}} of the book, as the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> education, high culture, and civil stability; barbarism was like a never ending litany of social ills. They are the agents of instability and chaos, destroying societies through their blatant disregard for humanity and social progress.|$|E
5|$|Balzac was a legitimist; in many ways, {{his views}} are the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Victor Hugo's {{democratic}} republicanism. Nevertheless, his keen insight regarding working-class conditions {{earned him the}} esteem of many Socialists and Marxists. Engels declared that Balzac was his favorite writer. Marx's work Das Kapital also makes constant reference to the works of Balzac and urged Engels to read Balzac's work The Unknown Masterpiece.|$|E
5|$|Devasena {{is often}} {{described}} as the daughter of Indra, the king of the devas. She is betrothed to Kartikeya by Indra, when he becomes the commander-in-chief of the gods. In south-Indian accounts, Devasena is generally depicted as an <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Valli, her co-wife; together they complete the god. Devasena is generally depicted with Kartikeya and often is also accompanied by Valli.|$|E
2500|$|Naloxegol (Naloxegol is only {{peripherally}} {{active as}} it does not cross the blood-brain barrier in sufficient quantities to be centrally active. As such, it can be considered the <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> loperamide.) ...|$|R

50|$|In Sartre's seminal work, the Critique of Dialectical Reason, it {{is shown}} how the {{essential}} dualism of Marx {{corresponds to a}} heightened synthesis, referring to totality, which is the monism that grounds the theses and <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> Marxism.|$|R
5|$|The {{format of}} this wave of pirate radio was {{influenced}} by Radio Luxembourg and American radio stations. Many followed a top 40 format with casual DJs, making UK pirate radio the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> BBC radio at the time. Spurred on by the offshore stations, landbased pirate stations took to the air on medium wave at weekends, such as Radio Free London in 1968.|$|E
5|$|In his {{comic book}} appearances, the Joker {{is portrayed as}} a {{criminal}} mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.|$|E
5|$|The Vedic goddess Nirriti is {{associated}} with death, decay, bad luck, anger, and need. Hymns emphasize offerings to keep her away. Like Nirriti, Dhumavati {{is associated}} with unpromising things and hardship. Jyestha, also an early Hindu goddess, has similarities in iconography with Dhumavati. Like Dhumavati, she is dark, ugly and {{is associated with}} the crow. Jyestha is described as being unable to tolerate any auspiciousness. Also like Dhumavati, Jyestha dwells in quarrels, inauspicious places, and has a bad temper. Lakshmana Desika, the commentator on the Saradatilaka-Tantra, identifies Dhumavati with Jyestha. Both Alakshmi, the sister and <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Lakshmi (Shri), the goddess of wealth, luck and beauty, and Dhumavati are described as old, carrying a broom and having a crow banner. Both symbolize hunger, thirst, need, and poverty.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} {{research on}} the semantic structure <b>of</b> <b>antitheses.</b> The thesis being proposed is that the defining quality <b>of</b> <b>antitheses</b> was implemented by the Syrian church father Ephrem as a rhetoric technique to enhance the power of arguments in his hymns. Examples are being investigated to explain the function <b>of</b> <b>antitheses</b> in the surface structure {{of some of his}} arguments...|$|R
40|$|Following a {{trajectory}} of the virtual/material dichotomy as it stems from a classicist position of a mind/body and male/female split, I propose feminist theory as a potent tool to effectively analyze the artistic implications of virtual materiality. Obfuscation, bedlam, redundancy – these qualities, redolent of humanity, are typically considered the <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> insight. The chaotic can be an impetus for relinquishing conceits of specialization...|$|R
5|$|Viswanathan (T. S. Balaiah) is an arrogant, money-minded {{estate owner}} {{who lives in}} a {{bungalow}} called Chinnamalai Estate near Pollachi. His son Chellappa (Nagesh) is an aspiring filmmaker; Chellappa is the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> his father and voices his displeasure at his father's arrogance. Viswanathan also has two daughters; Kanchana (Kanchana) and Nirmala (Rajasree). Kanchana is in love with her college mate Vasu (R. Muthuraman), the son of a rich Chennai-based businessman Sachidanandam (V. S. Raghavan). The sisters return home after completing their education in Chennai. One day while out sightseeing, a battered car driven by their father's young, rebellious estate manager Ashok (Ravichandran) bumps into their car. The sisters quarrel with Ashok and are annoyed by his insolence. At their home, they force Viswanathan to dismiss Ashok. Infuriated, Ashok pitches a tent overlooking their bungalow and begins a strike to get his job back. Nirmala accidentally drops a bucket of water on Ashok's head, hurting him. Feeling guilty, she visits Ashok's tent to apologise and they fall in love.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the {{development}} team chose Tokyo as the main setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of Megami Tensei II, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as Violence Jack, Devilman, and Fist of the North Star. Kichijōji was decided to be the game's starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived in or near the area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, {{with the rest of the}} building feeling like a ghost town. This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use wire-frame models, but the Super Famicom's limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.|$|E
25|$|F.C. Baur (1792–1860) {{proposed}} that John was solely {{a work of}} synthesis of thesis-antithesis according to the Hegelian model—synthesis between the thesis of Judeo-Christianity (represented by Peter) and the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Gentile Christianity (represented by Paul). He also cited in the epistles a synthesis with the opposing dualist forces of Gnosticism. As such, he assigned a date of 170 to the Gospel.|$|E
50|$|Unger {{contends that}} this theory of self solves two central {{problems}} with which Knowledge and Politics is concerned: first, it offers {{an outline of}} an alternative to liberalism (and its metaphysical emphasis on transcendence) and also to the <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> liberalism, the various systems emphasizing immanence (principally, the welfare-corporate state and socialism). Second, it offers {{a new way of}} understanding the situation of modern society.|$|R
2500|$|Related to, but {{not entirely}} {{equivalent}} to akem manah, are other terms that express similar ideas. The first is aka mainyu [...] "evil spirit" [...] or [...] "evil instrument," [...] which in the Gathas is contrasted with spenta mainyu [...] "bounteous spirit," [...] the instrument through which Ahura Mazda realized ("with his thought") creation. The other term is angra mainyu [...] "destructive spirit," [...] which in Zoroastrian tradition {{is the epitome of}} evil, but in the Gathas is the other absolute <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> spenta mainyu.|$|R
50|$|A {{religious}} ground motive (RGM) is {{a concept}} in the reformational philosophy of Herman Dooyeweerd. In his book Roots of Western Culture Dooyeweerd identified four great frameworks or value-systems that have determined human interpretations of reality with formative power over Western culture. Three of these are dualistic and may be described {{in the terms of}} Hegelian dialectic as <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> opposite poles of reference that are eventually resolved by synthesis, only for the synthesis to draw out, inexorably, a new opposing pole and so a new antithesis.|$|R
25|$|Near Kirkhill outside Stewarton {{are several}} farms having the name 'Kilbride' in their title. Bride - an anglicization of Brìghde, Brìd or Saint Brigid - was {{originally}} the Celtic Goddess {{linked with the}} festival of Imbolc, {{the eve of the}} first of February. She was the goddess of Spring and was associated with healing and sacred wells, therefore the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> the Carlin or Cailleach.|$|E
25|$|The first, {{introduced}} by the priest Chōgen, was based on Song Dynasty architecture and represented the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> the simple and traditional wayō style. The Nandaimon at Tōdai-ji and the Amida Hall at Jōdo-ji are the only extant examples of this style. Originally called , because {{it had nothing to}} do with India it was rechristened by scholar Ōta Hirotarō during the 20th century, and the new term stuck. Ōta derived the name from Chōgen's work, particularly Tōdai-ji's Daibutsuden.|$|E
25|$|Diane Holloway, Cox News Service (April 20, 2001) — The {{music is}} big-band smooth, {{the cars are}} shiny with tail fins and the {{dialogue}} is snappy, almost musical. At times conversations sound like fingers rhythmically popping. … The <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> today's gritty cop dramas, A's new Nero Wolfe series is slick and classy. Nobody spinning the dial will mistake the lavish sets, fabulous period costumes and moody lighting for NYPD Blue. The camera doesn't jiggle; it glides.|$|E
50|$|Blackheart later concocts {{a scheme}} to bring Hell to Earth and steal {{the souls of the}} planet's residents. As part of the plan, he takes human form and runs an {{operation}} in Las Vegas that sees him create several clones of X-23 and bond them to genetically created symbiotes. After Ghost Rider accidentally transports Hell to Las Vegas, Blackheart is confronted by the Ghost Rider, Venom, Red Hulk, and X-23, and summons four creatures that represent the <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> the four and sets them against the heroes.|$|R

25|$|Dews play {{a crucial}} role in the cosmogonic drama of the Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian view of {{creation}} completed in the 12th century. In this text, the evil spirit Ahriman (the middle Persian equivalent of Avestan Angra Mainyu) creates his hordes of dews to counter the creation of Ormuzd (Avestan Ahura Mazda). This notion is already alluded to in the Vendidad (see Younger Avestan texts above), but only properly developed in the Bundahishn. In particular, Ahriman is seen to create six dews that in Zoroastrian tradition are the <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> the Amahraspands (Avestan Amesha Spentas).|$|R
25|$|In {{a society}} that was {{beginning}} to consider women as men's equals, Nazi policies constituted a setback, forcing women from political life. The Nazis' policies pertaining to women were one aspect of their efforts to stem what they viewed as the decadence of the Weimar Republic. In their eyes, the Weimar regime, which they perceived as having a Jewish character, in effect appeared as feminized, as well as tolerant of homosexuality the veritable <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> German virility.|$|E
25|$|During {{the history}} of slavery in the United States, most African Americans styled their hair {{in an attempt to}} mimic the styles of the {{predominantly}} white society in which they lived. Afro-textured hair, characterized by its tight kinks, has been described as being kinky, coarse, cottony, nappy, or woolly. These characteristics represented the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> the European American standard of beauty, and led to a negative view of kinky hair. As a result, the practice of straightening gained popularity among African Americans.|$|E
25|$|Beatty succeeded Admiral John Jellicoe as {{commander-in-chief}} of the Grand Fleet {{and received}} promotion to the acting rank of admiral in December 1916. With his dashing style, {{he was the}} <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> his predecessor. Beatty's marriage was failing disastrously at the time, {{and the result was}} to be a decade-long love affair between Beatty and Eugénie Godfrey-Faussett, wife of Captain Bryan Godfrey-Faussett. Under Beatty's command the Grand Fleet maintained its dominance of the North Sea {{until the end of the}} War.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to ancient}} music {{historian}} Theodore Burgh, [...] "If {{we were able}} to step into the [...] [...] [...] biblical period, we would find a culture filled with music [...] [...] [...] where people used music in their daily lives." [...] "Such music was capable of expressing a great variety of moods and feelings or the broadly marked <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> joy and sorrow, hope and fear, faith and doubt. In fact, every shade and quality of sentiment are found in the wealth of songs and psalms and in the diverse melodies of the people." ...|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{the earlier}} system of Lord Herbert of Cherbury which {{relied on the}} notion of innate ideas, Tindal's system was based on the {{empirical}} principles of Locke. It assumed the traditional deistic <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> external and internal, positive and natural, revelations and religions. It starts from the assumptions that true religion must, from the nature of God and things, be eternal, universal, simple and perfect; that this religion can consist of nothing but the simple and universal duties towards God and man, the first consisting in the fulfilment of the second—in other words, the practice of morality.|$|R
25|$|When {{the funeral}} service has ended, the mourners {{come forward to}} fill the grave. Symbolically, this gives the mourners closure as they observe, or {{participate}} in, the filling of the grave site. One custom is for all people present at the funeral to take a spade or shovel, held pointing down instead of up, to show the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> death to life and that this use of the shovel is different from all other uses, to throw three shovelfuls of dirt into the grave.|$|E
25|$|A takkanah is an {{enactment}} which (1) revises {{an ordinance}} {{that no longer}} satisfies {{the requirements of the}} times or circumstances, or which (2), being deduced from a Biblical passage, may be regarded as new. It is, therefore, the <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> the Gezerah. Takkanot were framed even in the time of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, those of unknown origin being ascribed to earlier leaders, and they have been promulgated at all subsequent periods of Jewish history. The term is applied also to the institution provided for in the enactment.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> {{this theory}} {{has also been}} suggested as a possibility: that the speech shows not that Margaret is losing control, but that she is completely in control of herself and her emotions. This theory is most noticeable in how director Jane Howell had Julia Foster act the part in the 1981 BBC Television Shakespeare adaptation. Here, Margaret uses her speech to vent her intense emotions, not to contain them. The far ranging metaphors and classical allusions are her way of letting go of her pent up rage and emotion, her disdain for Henry and her inherent passion.|$|E
50|$|White was an historian, but {{had also}} earned a master's degree at Union Theological Seminary {{and was the}} son of a Calvinist {{professor}} of Christian Ethics, and considered religion integral to the development of Western technology. From his Technology and Invention in the Middle Ages of 1940, through his Dynamo and Virgin Reconsidered of 1958, to his Medieval Technology and Social Change (Oxford University Press, 1962), his work refuted the assumption that the Middle Ages were too preoccupied with theology and/or chivalry to concern themselves with technology, the assumption behind Henry Adams' <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> Virgin vs. dynamo, but widespread elsewhere as well.|$|R
5000|$|Michael McKeon, for example, {{brought a}} Marxist {{approach}} {{to the history of}} the novel in his 1986 The Origins of the English Novel. McKeon viewed the novel as emerging as a constant battleground between two developments of two sets of world view that corresponded to Whig/Tory, Dissenter/Establishment, and Capitalist/Persistent Feudalist. The [...] "novel," [...] for him, is the synthesis of competing and clashing theses and <b>antitheses</b> <b>of</b> individual novels. I.e. the [...] "novel" [...] is the process of negotiation and conflict between competing ideologies, rather than a definable and fixed set of thematic or generic conventions.|$|R
