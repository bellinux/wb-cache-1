40|$|In literature, many feature {{types and}} {{learning}} algorithms are proposed for document classification. However, an extensive and systematic {{evaluation of the}} various approaches has not been done yet. In order to investigate different text representations for document classification, we have developed a tool which transforms documents into feature-value representations suitable for standard learning algorithms. In this paper we investigate seven document representations for German texts based on n-grams and single words. We compare their effectiveness in classifying OCR texts and the corresponding correct <b>ASCII</b> <b>texts</b> in two domains: business letters and abstracts of technical reports. Our {{results indicate that the}} use of n- grams is an attractive technique which can even compare to techniques relying on a morphological analysis. This holds for OCR texts as well as for correct <b>ASCII</b> <b>texts...</b>|$|R

25|$|Because many {{encodings}} {{have only}} a limited repertoire of characters, they are often only usable to represent text in a limited subset of human languages. Unicode {{is an attempt to}} create a common standard for representing all known languages, and most known character sets are subsets of the very large Unicode character set. Although there are multiple character encodings available for Unicode, the most common is UTF-8, which has the advantage of being backwards-compatible with ASCII; that is, every <b>ASCII</b> <b>text</b> file is also a UTF-8 text file with identical meaning. UTF-8 also has the advantage that it is easily auto-detectable. Thus, a common operating mode of UTF-8 capable software, when opening files of unknown encoding, is to try UTF-8 first and fall back to a locale dependent legacy encoding when it definitely isn't UTF-8.|$|E
