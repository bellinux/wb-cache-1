40|$|Eight {{years of}} ozone {{measurements}} retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Microwave Limb Sounder, {{both on the}} EOS Aura satellite, have been assimilated into the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS- 5) data assimilation system. This study thoroughly evaluates this <b>assimilated</b> <b>product,</b> highlighting its potential for science. The impact of observations on the GEOS- 5 system is explored by examining the spatial distribution of the observation-minus-forecast statistics. Independent data are used for product validation. The correlation coefficient of the lower-stratospheric ozone column with ozonesondes is 0. 99 and the bias is 0. 5 %, indicating {{the success of the}} assimilation in reproducing the ozone variability in that layer. The upper-tropospheric assimilated ozone column is about 10 % lower than the ozonesonde column but the correlation is still high (0. 87). The assimilation is shown to realistically capture the sharp cross-tropopause gradient in ozone mixing ratio. Occurrence of transport-driven low ozone laminae in the assimilation system is similar to that obtained from the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) above the 400 K potential temperature surface but the assimilation produces fewer laminae than seen by HIRDLS below that surface. Although the assimilation produces 5 - 8 fewer occurrences per day (up to approximately 20 %) during the three years of HIRDLS data, the interannual variability is captured correctly. This data-driven <b>assimilated</b> <b>product</b> is complementary to ozone fields generated from chemistry and transport models. Applications include study of the radiative forcing by ozone and tracer transport near the tropopause...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} summarized ongoing work {{on improving}} {{the representation of}} ozone in the GEOS Data Assimilation Systems. Data from two EOS Aura sensors was used: the total column ozone from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and high vertical resolution stratospheric profiles from Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS, version 3. 3). As several previous studies have demonstrated, assimilation of this data can constrain the stratospheric and tropospheric ozone columns with relatively good accuracy. However, {{the representation of the}} vertical structures in the troposphere and near tropopause region is often deficient. Since both these layers of the atmosphere are critical {{to the understanding of the}} radiative forcing as well as the ozone budget in the troposphere, current work will focus on improving the <b>assimilated</b> <b>product</b> between the surface and the 50 hPa pressure level. The discussion included recent steps that have been taken towards refining the treatment of ozone in GEOS- 5. Impacts of improved tropospheric chemistry model were discussed including the introduction of efficiency factors ("averaging kernels") for OMI total ozone, and direct assimilation of radiances from the MLS instrument. In particular, advantages and challenges involved in assimilating limb radiances rather than retrieved product were discussed. This work is, in part, a preparation for a planned reanalysis of the EOS Aura data from 2005 to present...|$|E
40|$|Organizations in Europe, Australia, and the United States have {{recently}} broadened constituent assimilation activities beyond that water vapor, {{which has been}} assimilated for years in the numerical weather prediction community. Many of these activities have focused on ozone, with some efforts focused on the entire suite of reactive constituents that control the ozone distribution. This talk will draw from results from the near real-time ozone data assimilation system being run by NASA's Data Assimilation Office. This system utilizes ozone observations from both the TOMS and the SBUV instrument to generate global synoptic maps of ozone. The initial application of this product is to provide ozone fields {{to assist in the}} atmospheric corrections' that are necessary for the retrieval of information from other NASA instruments. The validation of the ozone assimilation system shows that the <b>assimilated</b> <b>product</b> agrees well with independent HALOE and ozonesonde observations. This suggests that the product is of sufficient quality to be extended to other applications. This talk will enumerate these other applications and present initial results from exploratory research. The applications being considered include estimates of tropospheric ozone, provision of ozone fields for interactive retrievals, use of analysis increments from the assimilation to evaluate model performance, and development of long-term consistent three-dimensional global ozone fields. The results from the exploratory studies are promising, and help demonstrate how assumptions made in the p development of the ozone assimilation impact the other applications. For instance, RMS errors in the current product are large near the tropopause, which is sensitive to the specification of vertical correlation functions, which in turns impacts the amount of ozone analyzed to be in the troposphere. How these sensitivities impact the different applications will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The new stretched-grid {{design with}} {{multiple}} (four) {{areas of interest}}, one at each global quadrant, is implemented into both a stretched-grid GCM (general circulation model) and a stretched-grid data assimilation system (DAS). The four areas of interest include: the U. S. /Northern Mexico, the El Nino area/Central South America, India/China, and the Eastern Indian Ocean/Australia. Both the stretched-grid GCM and DAS annual (November 1997 through December 1998) integrations are performed with 50 km regional resolution. The efficient regional down-scaling to mesoscales is obtained {{for each of the}} four areas of interest while the consistent interactions between regional and global scales and the high quality of global circulation, are preserved. This is the advantage of the stretched-grid approach. The global variable resolution DAS incorporating the stretched-grid GCM has been developed and tested as an efficient tool for producing regional analyses and diagnostics with enhanced mesoscale resolution. The anomalous regional climate events of 1998 that occurred over the U. S., Mexico, South America, China, India, African Sahel, and Australia are investigated in both simulation and data assimilation modes. Tree <b>assimilated</b> <b>products</b> are also used, along with gauge precipitation data, for validating the simulation results.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the characteristics of}} source and sink for super hybrid rice and how to coordinate its source-sink relationships for high-yielding cultivation. It is known that super hybrid rice possesses a higher net photosynthetic rate than non-hybrid rice because of its higher grain-leaf area ratio, better stornata traits and less midday depression. However, the sink of super hybrid rice remains large due to its large and numerous spikelets. Furthermore, the relocation of assimilates is smooth in super hybrid rice because of its well-developed vascular structure. However, due to the very large sink of super hybrid rice, it is relatively inefficient in supplying of <b>assimilate</b> <b>products</b> to spikelets, in particular to inferior spikelets. Therefore, reducing the discrepancy between source and sink in super hybrid rice is essential for developing high-yielding cultivation. This can only be achieved by planting cultivars adapted for local environments, raising strong seedling, setting up populations with a high photosynthetic efficiency for increasing the supply of source, and improving the field management in filling stages to the duration of supply of photosynthate to grains...|$|R
40|$|The {{assimilation}} of observations of atmospheric constituents naturally divides into two major pieces. The {{first is the}} {{assimilation of}} trace gases whose variability is related to atmospheric motions. The second is the assimilation of trace gases which are sharply influenced by chemical exchange between different constituents.

In this research we show a different use for PCA technique {{as a tool for}} data fusion. PCA as a data fusion technique is performed over the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data, studying dust storms to better serve their identification. The multi-angle viewing capability of MISR is used to enhance our understanding of the Earth’s environment that includes climate particularly of atmosphere and of land surfaces. In this research the multi angle MISR images clearly show a dust storm over the Liaoning region of China as well as parts of northern and western Korea on April 8, 2002. PCA is used to combine the obtained information from the different angle views and frequency bands of MISR datasets.

40|$|The {{assimilation}} of measurements from the stratosphere and mesosphere {{is becoming increasingly}} common as the lids of weather prediction and climate models rise into the mesosphere and thermosphere. However, {{the dynamics of the}} middle atmosphere pose specific challenges to the {{assimilation of}} measurements from this region. Forecast-error variances can be very large in the mesosphere and this can render assimilation schemes very sensitive to the details of the specification of forecast error correlations. An example is shown where observations in the stratosphere are able to produce increments in the mesosphere. Such sensitivity of the assimilation scheme to misspecification of covariances can also amplify any existing biases in measurements or forecasts. Since both models and measurements of the middle atmosphere are known to have biases, the separation of these sources of bias remains a issue. Finally, well-known deficiencies of assimilation schemes, such as the production of imbalanced states or the assumption of zero bias, are proposed explanations for the inaccurate transport resulting from assimilated winds. The inability of assimilated winds to accurately transport constituents in the middle atmosphere remains a fundamental issue limiting the use of <b>assimilated</b> <b>products</b> for applications involving longer time-scales...|$|R

In this study, vitellogenesis during oogenesis in the oocytes occured by way of endogenous autosynthesis and exogenous heterosynthesis. Of two processes of vitellogenesis during oogenesis, the process of endogenous autosynthesis involved the combined activity of the Golgi complex, mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum. whereas the process of exogenous heterosynthesis involved endocytotic incorporation of extraovarian precursors at the basal region of the oolema of the early vitellogenic oocytes prior {{to the formation of}} the vitelline coat. It is assumed that the follicle cells were involved in the development of previtellogenic and early vitellogenic oocytes and appear to play an integral role in vitellogenesis in the early and late vitellogenic oocytes by endocytosis of yolk precursors, and also they were involved in oocyte degeneration by <b>assimilating</b> <b>products</b> originating from the degenerated oocytes, thus allowed the transfer of york precursors needed for vitellogenesis (through phagocytosis by phagolysosomes after spawning).

To clarify the mechanism to mitigate the cost of reproduction, contributions of foliar and non-foliar photosynthetic products to seed production were examined in a spring ephemeral Gagea lutea. Leaf growth, foliar and non-foliar photosynthetic activities, and total <b>assimilated</b> <b>products</b> were compared among reproductive-intact, floral-bud removal and vegetative plants. Translocation of current photosynthetic products to individual organs was quantified by 13 CO 2 -trace experiment. Bulb growth was compared between hand-pollination and floral-bud removal treatments. Finally, seed set was compared between intact, leaf-clipping and bract-clipping treatments. Fruit-forming plants retained leaves longer than vegetative and floral-bud removal plants, but the assimilative contribution of extended leaf longevity was negligible. Carbon supply by bract photosynthesis was large enough for fruit development, while carbon supply by fruit photosynthesis was offset by the high respiration loss. Foliar photosynthetic products were largely transported to bulbs, while translocation to reproductive functions was negligible. Because the floral-bud removal increased the bulb growth, lack of reproduction could lead to more storage. The leaf-clipping {{had no effect on}} seed production, while the bract-clipping significantly reduced the seed production. Therefore, current photosynthesis of leafy bracts might be a major carbon source for fruit development.

The current system tends to overestimate {{the amount of}} lower stratospheric ozone. This is a region where ozone {{plays a key role}} in the forcing of climate. A biased ozone field in this region will adversely impact calculations of the stratosphere-troposphere exchange and, when used as a first guess in retrievals, the values determined from satellite observations. Since these are all important applications of <b>assimilated</b> ozone <b>products,</b> effort is being directed towards reducing this bias. The SBUV ozone data have a coarse vertical resolution with increased uncertainty below the ozone maximum, and TOMS provides only total ozone columns. Thus, the assimilated ozone in the lower stratosphere, and its vertical distribution in particular, are only weakly constrained by the incoming SBUV and TOMS data. Consequently, the assimilated ozone distribution should be sensitive to changes in inputs to the statistical analysis scheme. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the assimilated lower stratospheric ozone fields to changes in the TOMS error-covariance modeling and the SBUV data selection has been investigated. The use of a spatially correlated TOMS error covariance model led to improvements in the product. However, withholding the SBUV/ 2 data for the layer between 63 and 126 hPa typically degraded the product, a result which vindicates the use of this layer ozone product, despite its known errors.

The Data Assimilation Office (DAO) at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has been exploring the use of tropical rainfall and total precipitable water (TPW) observations from the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) and the Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I) instruments to improve short-range forecast and reanalyses. We describe a " 1 + 1 "D procedure for assimilating 6 -hr averaged rainfall and TPW in the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Data Assimilation System (DAS). The algorithm {{is based on a}} 6 -hr time integration of a column version of the GEOS DAS, hence the " 1 + 1 "D designation. The scheme minimizes the least-square differences between the observed TPW and rain rates and those produced by the column model over the 6 -hr analysis window. This 1 +lD scheme, in its generalization to four dimensions, is related to the standard 4 D variational assimilation but uses analysis increments instead of the initial condition as the control variable. Results show that assimilating the TMI and SSM/I rainfall and TPW observations improves not only the precipitation and moisture fields but also key climate parameters such as clouds, the radiation, the upper-tropospheric moisture, and the large-scale circulation in the tropics. In particular, assimilating these data reduce the state-dependent systematic {{errors in the}} <b>assimilated</b> <b>products.</b> The improved analysis also provides better initial conditions for short-range forecasts, but the improvements in forecast are less than improvements in the time-averaged assimilation fields, indicating that using these data types is effective in correcting biases and other errors of the forecast model in data assimilation...|$|R
40|$|A {{meteorological}} {{case study}} {{for the impact of}} inertia-gravity waves on surface meteorology is presented. The large-scale environment from 17 to 19 December 1999 was dominated by a poleward breaking Rossby wave transporting subtropical air over the North Atlantic Ocean upward and north-eastward. The synoptic situation was characterized with an upper tropospheric jet streak passing Northern Europe. The unbalanced jet spontaneously radiated inertia-gravity waves from its exit region. Near-inertial waves appeared with a horizontal wavelength of about 200 km and an apparent period of about 12 h. These waves transported energy downwards and interacted with large-scale convection. This configuration is simulated with the nonhydrostatic Fifth-Generation Mesoscale Model. Together with simplified runs without orography and moisture it is demonstrated that the imbalance of the jet (detected with the cross-stream ageostrophic wind) and the deep convection (quantified with the latent heat release) are forcing inertia-gravity waves. This interaction is especially pronounced when the upper tropospheric jet is located above a cold front at the surface and supports deep frontal convection. Weak indication was found for triggering post-frontal convection by inertia-gravity waves. The realism of model simulations was studied in an extended validation {{study for the}} Baltic Sea region. It included observations from radar (DWDPI, BALTRAD), satellite (GFZGPS), weather stations (DWDMI) and <b>assimilated</b> <b>products</b> (ELDAS, MESAN). The detected spatio-temporal patterns show wind pulsations and precipitation events at scales corresponding to those of inertia-gravity waves. In particular, the robust features of strong wind and enhanced precipitation near the front appeared with nearly the same amplitudes as in the model. In some datasets we found indication for periodic variations in the post-frontal region. These findings demonstrate the impact of upper tropospheric jet-generated inertia-gravity waves on the dynamics of the boundary layer. It also gives confidence to models, observations and assimilation products for covering such processes.

Evapotranspiration (ET), the sum {{of water}} lost to the {{atmosphere}} from the soil surface through evaporation and from plant tissues via transpiration, is a vital component of the water cycle. Accurate measurements of ET are required for the global water and energy cycles. However, ET varies {{in time and space}} and is difficult to estimate as it depends on many interacting processes. At the local scale, ET may be accurately estimated from detailed ground observations. At the regional scale sufficient ground observations will never be available and instead spatially. Remote sensing data provide us with spatially continuous information over vegetated surfaces, which supply the frequent lack of ground-measured variables and parameters required to apply the local models at a regional scale. Optical remote sensing data are strongly affected by atmospheric condition, so the uncertainty also exists in the estimation of ET with remote sensing. In this work, we develop a data assimilation scheme to improve the estimation of ET. The common land model (CoLM) is adopted as model operator to simulate the temporal variation of ET. Ensemble Kalman filter algorithm is chosen as data assimilation algorithm. The scheme can dynamically <b>assimilate</b> MODIS land <b>products</b> such as land surface temperature (LST) and leaf area index (LAI). The scheme is tested by automatic weather station (AWS) and flux tower data obtained from Xiaotangshan station in China. The results indicate that <b>assimilating</b> MODIS land <b>products</b> can improve the estimation of ET...|$|R
40|$|Global reanalyses {{currently}} contain significant {{errors in}} the primary fields of the hydrological cycle such as precipitation, evaporation, moisture, and the related cloud fields, especially in the tropics. The Data Assimilation Office (DAO) at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has been exploring the use of rainfall and total precipitable water (TPW) observations from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) and the Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I) instruments to improve these fields in reanalyses. The DAO has developed a " 1 + 1 "D procedure to assimilate 6 -hr averaged rainfall and TPW into the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Data Assimilation System (DAS). The algorithm {{is based on a}} 6 -hr time integration of a column version of the GEOS DAS. The " 1 + 1 " designation refers to one spatial dimension plus one temporal dimension. The scheme minimizes the least-square differences between the satellite-retrieved rain rates and those produced by the column model over the 6 -hr analysis window. The control variables are analysis increments of moisture within the Incremental Analysis Update (IAU) framework of the GEOS DAS. This 1 + 1 D scheme, in its generalization to four dimensions, is related to the standard 4 D variational assimilation but differs in its choice of the control variable. Instead of estimating the initial condition {{at the beginning of the}} assimilation cycle, it estimates the constant IAU forcing applied over a 6 -hr assimilation cycle. In doing so, it imposes the forecast model as a weak constraint in a manner similar to the variational continuous assimilation techniques. We present results from an experiment in which the observed rain rate and TPW are assumed to be "perfect". They show that assimilating the TMI and SSM/I-derived surface precipitation and TPW observations improves not only the precipitation and moisture fields but also key climate parameters directly linked to convective activities such as clouds, the outgoing longwave radiation, and the large-scale circulation in the tropics. In particular, assimilating these data types reduce the state-dependent systematic {{errors in the}} <b>assimilated</b> <b>products.</b> The improved analysis also leads to a better short-range forecast, but the impact is modest compared with improvements in the time-averaged fields. These results suggest that, in the presence of biases and other errors of the forecast model, it is possible to improve the time-averaged "climate content" in the assimilated data without comparable improvements in the short-range forecast skill. Results of this experiment provide a useful benchmark for evaluating error covariance models for optimal use of these data types...|$|R

The major area of interest with enhanced regional resolution used in different SG-DAS experiments includes a rectangle over the U. S. with 50 or 60 km horizontal resolution. The analyses and diagnostics are produced for all mandatory levels from the surface to 0. 2 hPa.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will include}} results from data assimilation simulations using the NASA-developed Land Information System (LIS). Using the ensemble Kalman filter in LIS, two satellite-based soil moisture {{products from the}} AMSR-E instrument were assimilated, one a NASA-based product and the other from the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). The domain and land-surface forcing data from these simulations were from the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase- 2, over the period 2002 - 2008. The Noah land-surface model, version 3. 2, was used during the simulations. Changes to estimates of land surface states, such as soil moisture, as well as changes to simulated runoff/streamflow will be presented. Comparisons over the NLDAS domain will also be made to two global reference evapotranspiration (ET) products, one an interpolated product based on FLUXNET tower data {{and the other a}} satellite- based algorithm from the MODIS instrument. Results of an improvement metric show that <b>assimilating</b> the LPRM <b>product</b> improved simulated ET estimates while the NASA-based soil moisture product did not...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies at}} the Global Hydrology and Climate Center (GHCC) {{have shown that the}} {{assimilation}} of land skin temperature (LST) tendencies into a mesoscale model can significantly improve short-term forecasts of near surface air temperature and moisture. Derived land surface products from the GOES satellites were used in these studies to provide high spatial and temporal resolution information about the spatial and temporal variability of the land surface forcing simulated in the model. In the model assimilation studies, LST was derived using a split window technique using the 11 and 12 pm channels found on the GOES- 8 Sounder. These studies used a constant surface emissivity of 0. 98 for both channels. However, this emissivity assumption over the land {{does not take into account}} emissivity variations due to varying terrain characteristics and differences between channels. These emissivity variations are seen to be significant as indicated by emissivity products from the polar orbiting MODIS instrument channels similar to the GOES- 8 Sounder channels mentioned above. MODIS is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. In an attempt to improve the emissivity assumptions used in the GOES Sounder LST retrieval procedure, the incorporation of MODIS high spatial resolution (1 km) emissivity measurements into the LST procedure is being explored. This paper intercompares the LST retrievals from the GOES- 8 Sounder using a constant emissivity assumption with those using MODIS retrieved emissivities. The effects of MODIS emissivities on the LST retrievals are discussed. Potential improvements in model forecasts using <b>assimilated</b> LST <b>products</b> incorporating MODIS emissivities are also examined...|$|R
40|$|It is {{challenging}} to <b>assimilate</b> the evapotranspiration <b>product</b> (EP) retrieved from satellite data into land surface models (LSMs). In this paper, a perturbed ensemble Kalman filter (PEKF) and a trous wavelet transform (AWT) integrated method are proposed {{to implement the}} evapotranspiration assimilation. In this method, the AWT is used to decompose the EPs into multiple channels since it is very powerful in fusing high frequency spatial information of multisource data, and then the Kalman filter is performed in the AWT domain. The proposed method combines {{the advantages of the}} PEKF that is capable of accommodating model error and observation error, and the AWT can effectively perform multiresolution fusion. Assimilation experiment conducted with the Noah model and the EP retrieved from the MODIS data shows that the proposed method performs better than the traditional ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and PEKF methods. The analysis results fit well with the evapotranspiration observation at two field sites with different land surface conditions. These indicate that the proposed method is promising for assimilating regional scale satellite retrieved EP into LSMs...|$|R

40|$|The <b>assimilated</b> ozone <b>product</b> {{from the}} Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA- 2), {{produced}} at NASAs Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) is summarized. The reanalysis begins in 1980 {{with the use}} of retrieved partial-column ozone concentrations from a series of Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer (SBUV) instruments on NASA and NOAA spacecraft. Beginning in October 2004, retrieved ozone profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and total column ozone from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASAs EOS Aura satellite are assimilated. While this change in data streams does lead to a discontinuity in the assimilated ozone fields in MERRA- 2, making it not useful for studies in decadal (secular) trends in ozone, this choice was made to prioritize demonstrating the value NASAs high-quality research data in the reanalysis context. The MERRA- 2 ozone is compared with independent satellite and ozonesonde data, focusing on the representation of the spatial and temporal variability of stratospheric and upper-tropospheric ozone. The comparisons show agreement within 10 (standard deviation of the difference) between MERRA- 2 profiles and independent satellite data in most of the stratosphere. The agreement improves after 2004, when EOS Aura data are assimilated. The standard deviation {{of the differences between the}} lower-stratospheric and upper-tropospheric MERRA- 2 ozone and ozonesondes is 11. 2 and 24. 5, respectively, with correlations of 0. 8 and above. This is indicative of a realistic representation of the UTLS ozone variability in MERRA- 2. After 2004, the upper tropospheric ozone in MERRA- 2 shows a low bias compared to the sondes, but the covariance with independent observations is improved compared to earlier years. Case studies demonstrate the integrity of MERRA- 2 analyses in representing important features such as tropopause folds...|$|R
