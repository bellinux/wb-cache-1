5|$|Thirty poems {{attributed}} to Narihira {{were included in}} the early 10th-century Kokinshū, and many more in later anthologies, but the attributions are dubious. Ki no Tsurayuki mentioned Narihira in his kana preface to the Kokinshū as one of the Six Poetic Geniuses—important poets of <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age.</b> He was also included in Fujiwara no Kintō's later Thirty-Six Poetic Geniuses.|$|E
5|$|At least 40% {{of people}} with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have a positive family history, suggesting {{that some people are}} genetically predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration. HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the condition, and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form of the condition, and at <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> than is typical.|$|E

5|$|Orphaned {{children}} {{were given the}} right to choose their own guardians at age 14. At 16, males became eligible for military duty and were also considered adults for legal purposes, such as standing trial for crimes. Age 21 was the youngest at which a male could become a freeman, though for practical purposes this occurred some time in a man's mid-twenties. Twenty-one was the assumed age of inheritance, as well, although the law respected the rights of the deceased to name <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> in his will.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the trinucleotide repeat {{accounts}} for 60% {{of the variation in}} the age symptoms appear and the rate they progress. A longer repeat results in <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> of onset and a faster progression of symptoms. Individuals with more than sixty repeats often develop the disease before age 20, while those with fewer than 40 repeats may not ever develop noticeable symptoms. The remaining variation is due to environmental factors and other genes that influence the mechanism of the disease.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E

He remembered seeing rich paintings in churches in Czechoslovakia, which fuelled his later passion for Russian icons.|$|R

25|$|Regarding {{types of}} jobs, {{women who work}} in {{nurturing}} professions such as teaching and health generally have children at <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age.</b> It is theorized that women often self-select themselves into jobs with a favorable work–life balance in order to combine motherhood and employment.|$|E
25|$|Hybridisation {{has been}} immensely {{successful}} in combining the best aspects of different species to give plants which flower at <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> than the parent species, {{as well as}} having more impressive flowers.

25|$|Zimmerman's mother, Cheryl, was {{diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis in 1995, and has needed to use a wheelchair since 2000. Zimmerman has cited his mother's condition as a substantial formative influence on his development, saying that it forced him {{to grow up and}} assume responsibilities at <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> than most children. He also founded the ziMS Foundation, which is dedicated to treating and curing multiple sclerosis.|$|E
25|$|This system {{dates from}} the Middle Ages, when {{the study of the}} liberal arts took seven years. In the late Middle Ages most {{students}} joined their university at <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> than is now usual, often when aged only 14 or 15. The basic university education in the liberal arts comprised the Trivium (grammar, rhetoric and dialectic) and the Quadrivium (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy and music), and typically took seven years of full-time study.|$|E
25|$|Marleau was the {{youngest}} player in the 1997 draft class, and he debuted immediately {{at the start of}} the 97–98 season. This conceptually makes him {{the youngest}} player to ever play in the NHL (in the modern draft era it would be impossible to debut at <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> than Marleau, as he was born on the last day of the draft cut-off, and debuted immediately in the first game of the next season).|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the mentioned health risks (like unwanted pregnancies and infection transmissions), other risks {{have been associated with}} early sexual activity. For example, a recent study (2017) found that those who start having sex at <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> have higher risks of: not using a condom; not having good memories of that first experience; and having had that relationship for non-autonomous reasons (such as partner pressure, peer pressure or the influence of substance use). This article also summarizes other risks (found in previous studies) associated with earlier sex: having an increased number of sexual partners or of casual sexual partners; perpetrating or being a victim of forced sex; engaging in paid sex; depression and behavior problems.|$|E
25|$|About 75% of paragangliomas are sporadic; the {{remaining}} 25% are hereditary (and {{have an increased}} likelihood of being multiple and of developing at <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age).</b> Mutations of the genes for the succinate dehydrogenase, SDHD (previously known as PGL1), SDHA, SDHC (previously PGL3) and SDHB {{have been identified as}} causing familial head and neck paragangliomas. Mutations of SDHB {{play an important role in}} familial adrenal pheochromocytoma and extra-adrenal paraganglioma (of abdomen and thorax), although there is considerable overlap in the types of tumors associated with SDHB and SDHD gene mutations. Paragangliomas may also occur in MEN type 2A and 2B. They are seen in at a higher incidence in people living at high altitude. Other genes related to familiar paraganglioma are SDHAF2, VHL, NF1, TMEM127 and MAX.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{documentary}} America the Beautiful explores how {{the fashion}} and beauty industries {{are contributing to}} the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses {{a wide range of}} topics like plastic surgery, dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young middle-school aged girls were portrayed {{in the beginning of the}} film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting to see themselves as ugly at <b>an</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>age</b> than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.|$|E
