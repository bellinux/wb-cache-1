5|$|Lutosławski's {{formidable}} technical developments {{grew out}} of his creative imperative; that he left a lasting body of major compositions is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> his resolution of purpose {{in the face of}} the anti-formalist authorities under which he formulated his methods.|$|E
2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> its popularity, {{the novel}} went through four {{immediate}} editions.

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the character's {{enduring}} popularity, Irish bookmakers humorously {{began collecting}} bets on whether Dougal would succeed Pope John Paul II upon his death. The odds were 1,000-1 (better odds than some genuine candidates), and some small stakes were actually received.|$|R

5|$|Bowen and the Spurs {{bounced back}} {{and won the}} NBA title in 2005, {{defeating}} the Detroit Pistons. The Spurs could not win back-to-back titles, however, and bowed out 4–3 in a seven-game series against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Playoffs. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> his controversial style of play, Bowen picked up a $10,000 NBA fine for kicking Ray Allen in the back during a March 2006 game.|$|E
5|$|Camelot Software Planning spent between {{twelve and}} {{eighteen}} months developing Golden Sun, {{which is considered}} {{a long time for}} a handheld video game; the finished product was described as <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game {{a few weeks before the}} release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.|$|E
5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game {{up to this}} point in the season: he threw three interceptions and was held to only 84 yards rushing. This marked the first time that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they accomplished this feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E
50|$|Being {{born on a}} {{small island}} close to the Malaysian Royal Navy based in Lumut, Dr. Zambry has a special rapport with the Malaysian Navy. <b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the special camaraderie, the Malaysian of Armed Forces Council has conferred him with the Honorary First Admiral status in 2010.|$|R
2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> Brooks' influence, fellow {{critic and}} former teacher John Crowe Ransom calls Brooks [...] "the most {{forceful}} and influential critic of poetry that we have" [...] (qtd. in Singh 1991).

5|$|The cathedral {{has been}} a focus of Mexican {{cultural}} identity, and is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> its colonial history. Researcher Manuel Rivera Cambas reported that the cathedral {{was built on the}} site sacred precinct of the Aztecs and with the very stones of their temples so that the Spaniards could lay claim to the land and the people. Hernán Cortés supposedly laid the first stone of the original church personally.|$|E
5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the mere fact that St. Jerome responded to the idea is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|While Bobby Dodd was a {{determined}} competitor, he cared deeply {{for those who}} played for him. Unlike some other coaches, {{he did not believe}} in winning at any costs; he truly believed that {{the most important aspect of}} college football was the college football player. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation.|$|E

50|$|The house {{stands at}} an {{elevation}} of 16 ft above sea level but is still the second-highest site on the island. It was originally built in 1851 by Asa Tift, a marine architect and salvage wrecker, in a French Colonial estate style, out of limestone quarried from the site. <b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> its construction and location, it survived many hurricanes, and the deep basement remained, and still remains, dry.|$|R

5|$|Zahir {{allowed the}} Franciscan {{community}} of Nazareth to build churches in 1730, 1741 and 1754 on sites Christians associated with Jesus's life. He allowed the Greek Orthodox community to build St. Gabriel's Church over a ruined Crusader church in Nazareth, and in 1750 they enlarged St. George's Church. The largest Christian community in Acre, the Melkites, built the largest {{church in the}} city, St. Andrew's Church, in 1764, while the Maronites built St. Mary's Church for their congregation in 1750. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the prosperity that the Christians enjoyed under Zahir's rule, no further churches were built {{under the auspices of}} Zahir's less tolerant successors.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of medieval {{buildings}} remain standing in the town. St Denys' Church and St Botolph's in Quarrington date to the 12th and 13th centuries respectively, while Sleaford's half-timbered vicarage is 15th century. St Denys' Church is noted for its tracery and its stone broach spire {{is one of the}} oldest in England. Cogglesford Mill is the only remaining watermill in town and is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the economic importance of the River Slea from the late-Saxon period onwards. The Bishops of Lincoln used the medieval town as a base, constructing the now-ruined Sleaford Castle, and as a means of extracting produce and wealth through demesne farming and by granting a market and limited freedoms to the town. As a result, the oldest areas are the market place and the four roads which meet there: Northgate, Southgate, Eastgate and Westgate; many 18th and 19th century buildings are found in this area.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the teachings of Tenrikyo's foundress Oyasama became popular throughout Japan. In the following decades, the most devoted followers coalesced around Oyasama's residence in rural Nara, which she had perceived as the birthplace of the world, or Jiba. The six villages surrounding the Jiba slowly became filled with Tenrikyo ministers, mystics, and evangelists, and the area was urbanized. A popular international school (now Tenri University) and Tenri Central Library, built by followers, were also attracting a variety of people to the area. It was around this time that Tenrikyo's Second Shinbashira (community leader) Shōzen Nakayama conceived of creating a grand construction project as <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the loyalty of Oyasama's followers.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the title}} win, Chapman kept faith with his squad, making only one new signing – outside right Joey Williams – as they {{successfully}} defended their League title in 1924–25. Huddersfield started brightly but a poor run of form in October and November (in part {{caused by an}} injury to goalkeeper Ted Taylor) saw them drop to ninth at one point. Taylor was replaced by new signing Billy Mercer and a resurgence in form saw Huddersfield climb the table, regaining top spot with a 5–0 win over Arsenal in February, and eventually finishing two points clear of runners-up West Bromwich Albion. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> Chapman's philosophy of relying on a strong defence, {{it was the first}} time a title-winning side had gone through a season without conceding more than two goals in any match.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, Constantinople was {{undergoing}} expansion. The cosmopolitan {{character of the}} city was being reinforced by the arrival of Italian merchants and Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. The Venetians, the Genoese, and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with Byzantium via Constantinople. These maritime traders stimulated demand in the towns and cities of Greece, Macedonia, and the Greek Islands, generating new sources of wealth in a predominantly agrarian economy. Thessaloniki, the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair that attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls. In Corinth, silk production fuelled a thriving economy. All this is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the success of the Komnenian Emperors in securing a Pax Byzantina in these heartland territories.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 John Betjeman made a {{television}} film called A Poet Goes North {{in which he}} gave his opinion on the changing architecture of Leeds. Betjeman described the constant sound of falling Victorian architecture. Betjeman also lambasted British Railways House (now City House) saying it blocked all the light out to City Square and was only <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> money and had no architectural merit of its own. Betjeman also praised Leeds Town Hall in the film. The film, which was never broadcast at the time, was preserved by Leeds Civic Trust and has been restored by the Yorkshire Film Archive. It was screened {{as part of the}} Leeds International Film Festival in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Situated on an oxbow in the Ohio River, {{the city}} is often {{referred}} to as the [...] "Crescent Valley" [...] or [...] "River City". <b>As</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the Ohio's grandeur, early French explorers named it La Belle Riviere ("The Beautiful River"). The area has been inhabited by various cultures for millennia, dating back at least 10,000 years. Angel Mounds was a permanent settlement of the Mississippian culture from 1000 AD to around 1400 AD. The city was founded in 1812.|$|R

50|$|Released {{three years}} later, Your Love Means Everything was <b>an</b> instant <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> {{the fruits of}} Kosten's ongoing sonic experimentation, {{as well as his}} skill at {{creating}} an environment in which inspiration strikes his collaborators.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, the American Institute of Architects {{condemned}} the bombardment of the city's buildings. The Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments, {{in conjunction with}} UNESCO, found that, of the 824 buildings in the Old Town, 563 (or 68.33 percent) {{had been hit by}} projectiles during the siege. Of these 563, nine buildings had been completely destroyed by one of several major fires that occurred during the siege. In 1993, the Institute for the Rehabilitation of Dubrovnik and UNESCO estimated the total cost for restoring public, private, and religious buildings, streets, squares, fountains, ramparts, gates, and bridges at $9,657,578. By the end of 1999, over $7,000,000 had been spent on restoration. It is <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the resilience of the ancient walls that more buildings in the old town were not destroyed during the bombardment; the ancient walls in fact were more effective at resisting modern weaponry than contemporary structures in the city's periphery.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic period Motul de San José {{was located}} between two {{mutually}} hostile powers, the great city of Tikal {{to the north}} and the breakaway kingdom of Petexbatún to the southwest, which had become a vassal of Tikal's implacable enemy Calakmul. In Mesoamerica, such border states as Motul de San José became centres of political activity as they tried to manipulate the shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage. This {{seems to be the case}} at Motul de San José with its rich ceramic tradition being <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> the politically motivated banqueting that took place in the city. In the 8th century, although Motul de San José was the capital of the Ik polity, the aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within the political hierarchy of the state while remaining subordinate to the ruling lord of the capital city.|$|E
5|$|On the hardwood, {{the veteran}} Robertson still proved {{he was a}} {{valuable}} player. Paired with Abdul-Jabbar, two more division titles with the Bucks followed in the 1971–72 and 1972–73 season. In Robertson's last season, he helped lead Milwaukee to a league-best 59–23 record and helped them to reach the 1974 NBA Finals. There, Robertson {{had the chance to}} end his stellar career with a second ring. The Bucks were matched up against a Boston Celtics team powered by an inspired Dave Cowens, and the Bucks lost in seven games. As <b>a</b> <b>testament</b> <b>to</b> Robertson's importance to the Bucks, in the season following his retirement the Bucks fell to last place in their division with a 38–44 record in spite of the continued presence of Abdul-Jabbar.|$|E
