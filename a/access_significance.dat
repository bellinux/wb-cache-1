40|$|Even {{though a}} number of studies have {{examined}} the implementation of National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Ghana, its equity and <b>access</b> <b>significance</b> in relation to community perspective has not been assessed nationally. We looked at the NHIS from the perspective of local communities in focus groups discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews. Qualitative data from nine key informant interviews and seventy-two community respondents in nine focus group discussions were collected. The focus groups took place in seven different communities purposely selected. The data were analysed using thematic network approach. The key informants and focus groups were analysed together. The findings noted a disconnection between NHIS policy and community life. More so, the findings showed an explicit link between equity and access with its impacts on health outcomes. The qualitative results noted lack of voice and understanding as features limiting people from accessing the NHIS facilities. Understanding of equity as a key theme revealed: first, lack of stakeholder engagement and consultation or participation in the NHIS decision making process. Second, the NHIS displayed an overreliance on healthcare and an emphasis on a biomedical approach. Finally, despite being a pro- poor intervention by name, practical management of the NHIS is transmitted down vertical silos from the national level, with the lack of joined-up government at the centre undermining local partnerships. Thus, not only are national expectations being dashed locally, local expectations are dashed nationally. We proposed that community viewpoints should be given higher priority given that NHIS has since its inception been associated with medical treatments and biomedical paradigm. Promoting community participation, understanding and voices should be recognised to shape the future NHIS policy and practice...|$|E

To assess process {{components}} of Young Adults Eating and Active for Health (YEAH), an online intervention in undergraduate {{college students to}} prevent excessive weight gain. ^ Design. This research is a secondary data analysis of YEAH, a randomized controlled trial. YEAH was a 10 -week web-based, stage-tailored intervention focused on nutrition, physical activity, and stress management to prevent excessive weight gain in college students. ^ Setting. College students participated in this web-based intervention with web-based assessments. ^ Participants. Students were from 14 universities, aged 18 – 24 years, body mass index 3 ̆e 18. 5 kg/m². Participants were randomized into intervention and control groups. Intervention group (n= 822) data were analyzed for this study. ^ Main outcome measures. A post evaluation process survey was completed, and ranked how motivating they found different program elements to improve their health. Participants also completed online questionnaires assessing fruit and vegetable consumption, kilocalories from sugar-sweetened beverages, metabolic equivalent minutes per week, perceived stress, and emotional eating. Computer monitoring tracked actual online activity access and viewing. ^ Analysis. Differences in outcomes from baseline to post were assessed by t-test and χ 2. Repeated measures {{analysis of variance was}} used to test for differences across motivation scores and activity <b>access.</b> <b>Significance</b> was set at P 3 ̆c 0. 05. ^ Results. Eating activities were found most motivating, followed by exercise activities, and then stress activities (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Significant increases from baseline to post were found for daily cups fruit and vegetable consumption, perceived stress scores, and MET minutes per week, but were not related to motivation score or access. ^ Conclusions and implications. Motivation score did not appear to relate to behavior outcomes. Results of this process evaluation provide insight into what was evaluated more highly in the college-aged population. ...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 2008 The {{research}} {{reported in}} this thesis investigated factors that predict academic success of African black physiotherapy students. The {{first part of the}} literature review focused on higher education and access into higher education. It refers to the National Plan on Higher Education and the international debate around widening <b>access.</b> <b>Significance</b> within the international literature is that while there has been rapid expansion in higher education numbers {{there has not been a}} parallel increase in participation by underrepresented groups. Most of the literature found on predictors of success indicates that high school performance and aptitude tests are predictors of success. It also indicates that the predictive strength of these variables reduces when race is taken into consideration and in physiotherapy it reduces in the clinical years of study. Non-cognitive variables have also been found to predict success. Although many quantitative studies on prediction of academic success have been performed, it was noted in the literature analysis that there is minimal investigation of predictors of success that have been done in the physiotherapy profession. No recent studies were found that pertain to physiotherapy specifically, and the few studies available were found not to have taken race differences into consideration. Throughout South Africa universities that have physiotherapy programmes admit students on the basis of their high school performance. Some of them use other criteria such as involvement in sports, leadership qualities and community involvement. Moreover, most African black students do not have the opportunity to fulfill these criteria and therefore other factors that may predict academic success were investigated. One hundred and twenty eight graduates (66 black and 62 white) who graduated between 2000 – 2005 from eight universities and six Heads of Physiotherapy Departments participated in the research. For the purposes of this study, graduates who completed the degree in four years or four and a half years were defined as successful and those that completed in five years and above were defined as unsuccessful. The graduates responded to a questionnaire which had two sections: Section A had closed ended questions and Section B had open ended questions. Face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted with Heads of Departments using semistructured interview schedule. The data were subjected first to simple descriptive statistical analysis.

We employ a range of parametric and non-parametric tests to <b>access</b> the <b>significance</b> of CDS abnormal returns {{across a range of}} narrow event windows. We find interest rate cut announcement has an opposite impact on CDS abnormal return across US and UK, QE announcements leads to higher abnormal returns across both samples and fiscal policy announcements is characterized by small positive gain which is short-lived. Daily CDS returns estimated for each firm and aggregated independently provides us the flexibility to test the differential effect on each subsample grouped on the basis of sector, credit quality, firm size and liquidity. We find the effect of policy announcement is different based on the firm idiosyncratic characteristics and without splitting the sample into sub-categories these effects would have been undetected. By splitting the sample we are able to disentangle this differential effect and note inconsistency across US and UK. We also compare abnormal return dynamics pre and post announcement days and note the median return is mostly higher in the post announcement days for US, while this effect is opposite for the UK sample. This may indicate policy announcements in US were more effective in lowering risk in corporate CDS market than those for UK. We also note the effects of firm idiosyncratic variables are mostly evident for abnormal returns following interest rate cuts and QE announcements, while the effect is least for fiscal policy announcements. Furthermore, we reverse the process and test if a particular policy announcement has a significant effect on firms with certain idiosyncratic characteristics. Overall we note the differences in firm idiosyncratic characteristics is mostly associated with liquidity and gearing for interest rate cut, difference in liquidity and firm size related to QE and firm capitalization related to fiscal policy announcements.

40|$|Including {{civil society}} {{organizations}} in the policy process is a distinctive trait of democratic governance. But, while being highly valuable from a democratic point of view, not all civil society organizations are represented in the policy process. This dissertation {{draws attention to the}} role of the government in shaping the representation of civil society {{organizations in the}} Swedish government consultation referred to as the ‘remiss procedure’. The overall aim is to increase empirical and theoretical understanding of civil society organizations’ access to the national Swedish policy process. Drawing on various empirical data sources, it analyzes how access has changed during the second half of the 20 th century, the factors influencing <b>access,</b> and the <b>significance</b> of the <b>access</b> provided by the government. The results are based on four empirical studies, and show that the government has encouraged an increasing number and more diverse types of civil society organizations to be represented in the remiss procedure. In addition, organizations with plenty of resources, such as labor and business organizations, are not overrepresented. However, access is slightly skewed in favor of civil society organizations with an insider position within other access points at national government level, which is consistent with a privileged pluralistic pattern of interest representation. In addition, civil society organizations seem to be invited into an arena for political influence of less relevance. Theoretically, the dissertation moves beyond the neo-corporatist perspective that dominated Swedish research during the second half of the 20 th century by drawing attention to five different theoretical lenses: pluralism, neo-corporatism, political opportunity structures, policy network theory, and resource exchange theory. It concludes that a variety of theories are needed for access to be understood...|$|R

Malignant cells were implanted into the abdominal wall of 42 rats, resulting 7 days later in the growth of a tumour measuring 20 – 25 mm in diameter. There were three control groups: no surgery (n = 6); blunt manipulation of the tumour laparoscopically (n = 6); and blunt manipulation of the tumour at laparotomy (n = 6). Twenty-four rats underwent surgical laceration of the tumour capsule at either laparoscopy (n = 12) or laparotomy (n = 12). All rats were killed 1 week later, and examined for macroscopic evidence of tumour metastasis. The abdominal surgical wounds were excised for independent microscopic examination by a histopathologist. Growth of the primary tumour was greater in rats that had an operation than in unoperated controls, and was greatest after laparotomy. However, wound metastases were five times more likely after laparoscopic tumour laceration than after the same procedure through an open incision (ten of 12 rats versus two of 12, P = 0. 0033). Wound metastases following laparoscopic tumour manipulation are an important and real problem, with significant implications for the application of laparoscopic techniques to excise malignant disease in humans.

Nonetheless, our in silico analysis suggests that, the DNA sequence harbouring the G-allele, located at position − 343, could result in stearic changes in structure, leading to enhanced accessibility of the TFBS at this position (Lou et al. 2012), compared to the A-allele. This variant is located {{in one of the}} negative regulatory elements of the MSMB promoter harbouring the EBOX-CREB two TFBS module. Hence it would be fascinating to study the altered binding of the transcription factors at position − 343 in the presence of G-allele. So far, the functional studies of the MSMB proximal promoter has only been restricted to rs 10993994. In our in silico analysis, the cleavage intensity predicted for rs 10993994 does not suggest significant difference in the DNA–protein binding affinity for the C- and T-alleles. However, {{it has been shown that}} the presence of T- allele at rs 10993994, results in upto 13 % decrease in MSMB promoter activity as compared to the C-allele (Chang et al. 2009). Since this SNP is in a CREB binding site, this decrease in activity could be due to the effect of the marginal decrease in DNA affinity on the CREB activation cascade like protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation (Richards et al. 1996).|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis by publication explores some key aspects of {{the implementation of the}} world’s first government funded human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination program. The work is focused around the HPV vaccination coverage achieved and the initiation of surveillance and evaluation activities for the Australian program. Australia’s National Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Program commenced in April 2007 and was notable as both the world’s first funded program and for its broad target group (providing catch up vaccination for all females aged 12 - 26 years between 2007 - 2009). It remains the world’s most broadly targeted funded catch-up program. As the first country to vaccinate {{a large proportion of the}} population with a prophylactic HPV vaccine, findings from coverage and surveillance data are of international interest and significance. The methods used to monitor and evaluate the program, some of which were developed during the research undertaken in this thesis, are key to providing robust coverage and surveillance data. The {{research in}}dicates that the HPV vaccination catch-up program in Australia achieved a moderately high level of coverage and provides estimates of the extent of under-reporting to the register during the catch up program. The thesis research also addressed some aspects of Australian HPV surveillance, with two main research papers providing a baseline assessment of HPV prevalence pre-vaccination among Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian women and the findings and implications of the investigation of a vaccine safety signal in the Australian program. The {{research in this}} thesis thus provides an important contribution to the evaluation of Australia’s program and to monitoring the ongoing impact of the program, which is of both national and international <b>significance.</b> <b>Access</b> is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|Study Design: A {{prospective}} study to <b>access</b> the <b>significance</b> of preoperative planning simulator for junior surgeons&# 39; training of pedicle screw insertion. Summary of Background Data: Pedicle screw insertion is particularly challenging {{to carry out}} on patients with abnormal spine morphology, especially for the doctors who lack experience. Currently, preoperative planning for pedicle screw insertion is carried out using patient computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans. In addition, there is no projection fluoroscopy provided to the user. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a 3 -dimensional, patient-specific volume rendering combined with the projection fluoroscopy simulator for training junior surgeons with no experience of pedicle screw insertion, and to help identify the role such simulation has in surgical education. Methods: Two junior surgeons with no experience of pedicle screw insertion were trained on the technique through the preoperative planning simulator; the operative time and the position of the pedicle screws were assessed before training (control group 1) and after training (experimental group) and compared with 2 senior spine surgeons with > 10 years&# 39; experience of pedicle screw insertion (control group 2). Results: The time of per pedicle screw insertion was 43. 5 +/- 3. 9 seconds in control group 1, 31. 6 +/- 2. 9 seconds in control group 2, and 50. 8 +/- 3. 7 seconds in experimental group. The relative position of the screw to the pedicle was graded regarding pediclea breach (I, no breach; II, 4 mm). The pedicle breach grading I and II was 20 pedicle screws (20 / 56, 35. 7 %) in control group 1, 54 pedicle screws (54 / 56, 96. 4 %) in control group 2, and 44 pedicle screws (44 / 56, 78. 6 %) in the experimental group. There were significant differences between control group 1 and experimental group in the time of per pedicle screw insertion (P < 0. 001) and the rate of pedicle breach grading I and II (P < 0. 001). There were significant differences between control group 2 and experimental group in the time of per pedicle screw insertion (P < 0. 001) and the rate of pedicle breach grading I and II (P = 0. 004). Conclusions: The simulator offers many helpful features to the surgeon with respect to the surgical trainee learning the basic technique of pedicle screw insertion, using free-hand technique or under the guiding of intraoperative fluoroscopy. The surgical skills of the junior surgeons can be significantly improved through the training of simulator.

40|$|This ethnomusicology-based study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of audio engineers {{on the development of}} Jamaican popular music. An analysis of audio engineering practice from Jamaica's earliest recording studios to present day has shown how audio engineers have understood and used new technologies, adapting and applying them on their own terms, and how this has {{had a profound impact on}} the development of Jamaican music. The thesis provides a new perspective and significant additional information and insights on the formative years of the Jamaican recording industry. This includes the way in which music was consumed, the role of recording studios, the way in which they were <b>accessed</b> and the <b>significance</b> of the first post-mento recordings, categorised into two distinct recorded products of exclusive sound-system acetates and commercial records. Analysis of these products includes the first detailed description of a seminal 1958 recording session that marked a major transition in Jamaican recording models. This thesis demonstrates how emphasised bass and the riddlrn- production method emerged as audio-engineered elements in the Jamaican music-production system. The thesis introduces a new graphical mixing- analysis tool that demonstrates how engineered sounds, rhythms and performance-mixing, based on spontaneity, groove and vibe, became integral parts of that system. This thesis argues that audio engineers and musicians often play the role of producer, but also demonstrates the way in which audio engineering practice became integrated into the work of the multi-role producer. This thesis questions prevalent themes in the literature, such as t~e concept of a 'digital revolution' and argues that this and other claims are not supported by the analysis of actual recording practice, especially when considered in the context of the social, political and economic forces that characterise the music industry in Jamaica. Finally, an ethnographic study and analysis of a recording session, demonstrates how the audio engineer continues to have a profound influence on Jamaican popular music today.

40|$|The thesis {{considers}} the parallel critiques {{of the notion}} of poesis as a mode of subjective power of self-determination in P. B. Shelley and Maurice Blanchot. It explores the terms in which, in the romantic-idealist tradition, the work of art is valorised as the realisation of the subject's <b>access</b> to spiritual <b>significance.</b> The thesis traces one of the sources of Blanchot's notion of modern literature' to his understanding of romanticism. It describes the ways in which Blanchot's notion of the non-romantic essence of romanticism deconstructs the romantic-idealist model of the work of literature as a mode of subjective self-realisation. Blanchot focuses {{on the fact that the}} presence of the critique of this model within the romantic/idealist theorization of the work of literature turns literature into a self-questioning, rather than a self-realizing structure. The idealist framework offers a notion of absolute reflection which significantly extends the model/figure of the autonomous subject. The thesis will argue that, on the evidence of some of Shelley’s prose fragments, the empiricist and sceptical heritage of Shelley' s conception of the mind draws him away from subscribing to such a model, and ultimately leads him to repeal it. The thesis will also argue that a similar undermining of the individual integrity of the subject can be observed in Shelley’s conception of self-identity. The analysis undertaken in the thesis concentrates on how a distinction between the ability to realize the poetical work and a process of self-realization is manifested in the three poems selected for scrutiny, and how this problematic is developed through the individual imaginative quest embodied in the figure of the poet in Alastor. The thesis will also explore the ways in which the ambivalence of the articulations around which the world of sanity and the notion of the accomplished work of literature are organized and dramatized in Julian and Maddalo. The Triumph of Life is then contrasted with the theme of the representative relation of the poet in concord to his community that is offered in A Defence of Poetry. In this poem, the principle of creation is likened to the course of history. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the various political appropriations {{of the work of}} the late- 19 th century poet Stéphane Mallarmé in 20 th century French thought. Our specific focus will be on the writings of Jean-Paul Sartre, the key collaborator of the journal Tel Quel Julia Kristeva, Alain Badiou, and Jacques Rancière. The key concerns of the thesis are to determine how Mallarmé has been constituted as an object of specifically political reflection; what conceptual resources have enabled his writings to be construed as politically significant; and finally in what precise conjunctures, both intellectual and political, his work has been mobilized by the four above-mentioned French intellectuals. Beginning with the work of Sartre, we will explore his career-long dialogue with Mallarmé and seek to clarify the various and, in our view, incompatible estimations he made of the poet’s political significance. In so doing, we will show what it means for Sartre to have at once condemned Mallarmé as an exemplary member of an anti-democratic and nihilistic literary current and to have celebrated him as a proto-existentialist. Next, we turn to the exemplary and sophisticated expression of the journal Tel Quel’s literary theory as presented in the thought of Julia Kristeva and her two key early works, Sèméiôtiké and La Révolution du langage poétique. Exploring in detail her engagement with Mallarmé throughout these two works, we will demonstrate why Mallarmé had to be for the Telquellians at once a privileged point of reference and an object of critique. In our third chapter, we will examine Alain Badiou’s reading of Mallarmé, with a focus on his early work Théorie du sujet and its engagement with Mallarmé during a period of fragility and fatigue for Badiou’s Maoist political and philosophical program. We will also determine the political significance of Mallarmé for Badiou after the publication of his masterwork, L’Etre et l’événement. Finally, in our fourth chapter, we turn to the writings of Jacques Rancière and offer a critical exegesis of his reading of Mallarmé, which he makes {{on the basis of a}} revisionist account of artistic modernity. We will show what precise political signification Rancière accords to Mallarmé, as well as how he revises the entire tradition of political appropriations of the poet. We will close with some brief considerations of Quentin Meillassoux’s recent intervention, which opens up again the question of Mallarmé’s political <b>significance.</b> <b>Access</b> is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{treatment of}} a transient wave theory with complex structural interactions has been investigated in various elastic problems {{as a tool for}} detection and interpretation of material properties by remote sensing methods. These problems are of great importance when attempting to gain information of an enclosed material when there is no direct <b>access,</b> with particular <b>significance</b> in worldwide applications including down hole oil exploration and screening of containers. Here we concentrate on the development of a transient analysis of such elastic wave sensor problems, employing both rigorous analytical and numerical methods. The thesis begins with a model problem of a single elastic solid layer under antiplane deformation. With the availability of analytic solutions, the understanding of the transient response is aided considerably. A forcing piston theory is thus formulated by distributing the original line load formulation over part of the free surface of the layer material. From this we evaluate the transient response of the problem numerically using various receiver sensor outputs, with either the layer thickness or the density of the layer material identified. Along with providing an overview of some of the main techniques used in the later chapters, the model problem introduces an averaging method formulation that develops an approximate form of solution, which is utilised throughout the thesis. The second of these problems presented is a two-dimensional analysis of elastic solid layers enclosing a channel comprising of a stationary and compressible viscous fluid. A forcing piston of a given displacement is applied to both of the free elastic surfaces to create a transient disturbance that propagates throughout the layered structure. If the force is applied with some discrete time-signature, the receiver signal processing mechanism is the measurement of the surface displacement either away from the piston, or at the piston location itself, at a later time. A number of ancillary and mathematical tools have been developed here so that various checks on the calculations can be made. The transient response of the problem is then examined numerically in an attempt to detect variation in the material parameters of the viscous fluid channel enclosed within the elastic layers. The two problems considered later in this thesis concentrate on the separate antiplane displacements and plane strain motions of a partially filled cylinder. This annular structure may be arbitrarily filled anywhere between empty and fully filled in a simple two phase system. The sensor is modelled as a long line load which reduces the problem to a two-dimensional analysis at any cross section of the cylindrical pipe, with displacement measurements made at either the source or elsewhere along the external pipe boundary. The piston theory is again introduced to provide further insight into the response mechanism of the cylinder structure. The transient response of the problem is then evaluated numerically to allow detection and quantitative determination of some characteristic material properties, this being the depth of the partial filling material or the density of the content that is enclosed within the cylinder.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} 4 years, we have {{developed}} a partnership between dance and neuroscience to study the relationships between body space in dance and the surrounding space, and the link between movement and audition as experienced by the dancer. The {{opportunity to work with}} a dancer/choreographer, an expert in movement, gives neuroscientists better <b>access</b> to the <b>significance</b> of the auditory-motor loop and its role in perception of the surrounding space. Given that a dancer has a very strong sense of body ownership (probably through a very accurate dynamic body schema) (Walsh et al. 2011), she is an ideal subject to investigate the feeling of controlling one's own body movements, and, through them, events in the external environment (Moore et al. 2009, Jola et al in press). We conducted several work sessions, which brought together a choreographer/dancer, a neuroscientist, a composer, and two researchers in acoustics and audio signal processing. These sessions were held at IRCAM (Institute for Research and Coordination Acoustic/Music, Paris) in a variable-acoustics concert hall equipped with a Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) sound reproduction system and infrared cameras for motion capture. During these work sessions, we concentrated on two specific questions: 1) is it possible to extend the body space of the dancer through auditory feedback (Maravita and Iriki 2004) ? and 2) can we alter the dancer's perception of space by altering perceptions associated with movements?We used an interactive setup in which a collection of pre-composed sound events (individual sounds or musical sentences) could be transformed and rendered in real time according to the movements and the position of the dancer, that were sensed by markers on her body and detected by a motion tracking system. The transformations applied to the different sound components through the dancer's movement and position concerned not only musical parameters such as intensity, timbre, etc. but also the spatial parameters of the sounds. The technology we used allowed us to control their trajectory in space, apparent distance and the sound reverberation ambiance. We elaborated a catalogue of interaction modes with auditory settings that changed according to the dancer's movements. An interaction mode is defined by different mappings of position, posture or gesture of the dancer to musical and spatial parameters. For instance, a sound event may be triggered if the dancer is within a certain region or if she performs a predefined gesture. More elaborated modes involved the modulation of musical parameters by continuous movements of the dancer. The pertinence at a perceptive and cognitive level of the catalogue of interactions has been tested throughout the sessions. We observed that the detachable markers could be used to create a perception of extended body space, and that the performer perceived the stage space differently according to the auditory feedback of her action. The dancer reported that each experience with the technology shed light on her need for greater awareness and exploration of her relationships with space. Real-time interactivity with sound heightened her physical awareness – as though the stage itself took on a role and became another character...|$|R
