5|$|Four F-111C {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} RF-111C reconnaissance configuration. These aircraft met the RAAF's requirement for aircraft to reinstate its photographic reconnaissance capacity. While the original order for F-111s specified that 18 would be strike variants and six reconnaissance variants, the RAAF later agreed to accept all 24 as strike aircraft and later retrofit six with reconnaissance pallets. In 1971 the USAF dropped plans to fit {{some of its}} F-111s as reconnaissance aircraft, but sold {{the design of the}} reconnaissance pallet to Australia for $3 million. At this time the RAAF decided to fit the pallet to four rather than six aircraft. The reconnaissance pallet contains four cameras and <b>an</b> <b>infrared</b> linescanner unit and is fitted in the F-111's weapons bay. The RF-111Cs retained their strike capability.|$|E
5|$|In a study {{published}} in December 2000, the star's diameter was measured with the Infrared Spatial Interferometer (ISI) at mid-infrared wavelengths producing a limb-darkened estimate of 55.2±0.5milliarcseconds (mas)—a figure entirely consistent with Michelson's findings eighty years earlier. At the time of its publication, the estimated parallax from the Hipparcos mission was 7.63 ± 1.64mas, yielding an estimated radius for Betelgeuse of 3.6AU. However, <b>an</b> <b>infrared</b> interferometric {{study published}} in 2009 announced that the star had shrunk by 15% since 1993 at an increasing rate without a significant diminution in magnitude. Subsequent observations suggest that the apparent contraction may be due to shell activity in the star's extended atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the order made by the Luftwaffe, the German Navy's Marineflieger also received 112 of the IDS variant in the anti-shipping and marine reconnaissance roles, again replacing the Starfighter. These equipped two wings, each with a nominal strength of 48 aircraft. The principal anti-ship weapon was the AS.34 Kormoran anti-ship missile, which were initially supplemented by unguided bombs and BL755 cluster munitions, and later by AGM-88 HARM anti-radar missiles. Pods fitted with panoramic optical cameras and <b>an</b> <b>infrared</b> line scan were carried for the reconnaissance mission.|$|E

5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving <b>an</b> <b>infrared</b> telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater {{on the far side of}} the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E

5|$|With export {{interest}} from Brazil, Japan, and Italy {{serving as a}} source of encouragement to continue development of the Harrier II, McDonnell Douglas commenced work on a night-attack variant in 1985. With the addition of <b>an</b> <b>infrared</b> sensor and cockpit interface enhancements, the 87th production single-seat AV-8B became the first Harrier II to be modified for night attacks, leaving the McDonnell Douglas production line in June 1987. Flight tests proved successful and the night attack capability was validated. The first of 66 AV-8B(NA)s was delivered to the USMC in September 1989. An equivalent version of the AV-8B(NA) also served with the RAF under the designation GR7; earlier GR5 aircraft were subsequently upgraded to GR7 standards.|$|E
5|$|Forrest Mims was {{interested}} in science and electronics as a youth and even built an analog computer while in high school. Mims graduated from Texas A University in 1966 (major in government with minors in English and history) then became a commissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force. While serving in Vietnam as an intelligence officer, Mims continued his model rocket hobby. At Texas A, Mims developed <b>an</b> <b>infrared</b> obstacle-sensing device and he experimented with it at the Saigon School for Blind Boys and Girls. Launching model rockets in an area accustomed to rocket attacks and working with blind children resulted in {{a story in the}} military newspaper, Stars and Stripes. This caught the attention of an Air Force Colonel, who arranged for Mims to be assigned to the Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB even though Mims lacked an engineering degree.|$|E
5|$|Gordon {{is written}} {{as having a}} genius-level intellect and {{naturally}} possessing a photographic memory. She is described by Gail Simone as the most intelligent member of the Batman family and among all characters having operated out of Gotham City. Prior to the character's career as a vigilante, Barbara Gordon developed many technological skills, including vast knowledge of computers and electronics, expert skills as a hacker, and graduate training in library sciences. Like Batman, Barbara Gordon originally used {{a wide variety of}} computer electronics and gadgets during her early adventures as Batgirl. These included <b>an</b> <b>infrared</b> scanner built into the cowl of her costume, various bat-inspired weaponry, and the Batcycle. According to Gail Simone, Oracle maintains control over the twelve technologically advanced satellites that were created by Lex Luthor during his tenure as President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Later {{variants}} of the Z model were developed. The Z-6 {{was to be}} a reconnaissance aircraft, although it was only built as a prototype. During the war only a few were converted from existing combat variants. The type was selected for weather check flights. It was identical to the Z-1/Z-2 variants, but offensive armament was omitted and extra fuel cells fitted. This increased the fuel load to 2,890 l (578 Imperial Gallons). As flights required higher altitude, the oxygen supply was increased from 20 to 24 bottles. For long-range flights over water, the larger dinghy of the Z-5 with its updated emergency escape equipment was mandatory during operations. The Z-6s were also used for night fighter operations. Some of the few converted Z-6s had the Ju 88C-6 nose installed and were equipped with machine guns and cannons. The nose proved to be unsatisfactory, and it was redesigned. In the tip of the new nose was <b>an</b> <b>infrared</b> spotlight which was soon made redundant after the introduction of Lichtenstein radar which was fitted to some of the Z-6.|$|E
5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA was not designed with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as <b>an</b> <b>infrared</b> telescope.|$|E
5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in the early Universe approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily <b>an</b> <b>infrared</b> instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E
