50|$|The {{long and}} short heads of the biceps femoris each branch off into 5 <b>attachment</b> <b>arms</b> as they course {{distally}} in the knee. In the posterolateral corner, the long head has 3 important anatomic <b>attachments.</b> The direct <b>arm</b> <b>attachment</b> is on the posterolateral fibular styloid, the anterior arm lateral to the FCL and the lateral aponeurotic arm on the posterior and lateral portion of the FCL. The short head of the biceps also has 3 important arms in the posterolateral corner. The capsular arm attaches to the posterolateral capsule {{as well as the}} fibula, just lateral to the styloid and provides a strong attachment to the capsule, lateral gastrocnemius tendon, and capsuloosseus layer of the IT band. The fabellofibular ligament is actually a thickening of the capsular arm of the biceps femoris as it runs distally to the fibula. The direct arm attaches to the posterior and lateral aspect of the fibular styloid. The anterior arm attaches to the tibia at the same site as the mid-third lateral capsular ligament and is often injured in Segond fractures. Injuries to the biceps femoris tendons have been reported in patients with anterolateral-anteromedial rotatory instability.|$|R

The shapes of the wrist-guard are stereotyped and common forms exhibit a narrowed 'waist' and curved cross-section (presumably so they fit the arm better).|$|R
40|$|ISBN 978 - 1 - 4244 - 4398 - 7 International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a mechanical modeling of membrane systems applicable to micromachined microphones requiring a low stiffness constant. We have recently developed a single-chip electrodynamic microphone in a CMOS MEMS technology. The microphone {{consists of a}} suspended square membrane of 1. 4 mm side, 3 µm thick and 10 µg, and two concentric inductors. This suspended moving membrane is fixed to the substrate with 4 <b>attachments</b> <b>arms.</b> In order to achieve a desired flat frequency response characteristic, covering the entire acoustic band, several attachment designs are presented, studied and compared. These designs include crab-leg, meander, U-spring and serpentine forms. We have found that for comparable dimensions, the U-spring form presents the highest compliance and the meander type is the stiffest...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown (Hines, M., and J. J. Blum, Biophys. J., 1984, 46 : 559 - 565) that passive moment-bearing links do not {{contribute}} appreciable twist resistance to an axoneme nor do they cause appreciable twisting in response to internal shear forces. We now examine the contribution of active moment-bearing links such as dynein arms to the generation of twist within an axoneme. The dynein model used causes distal sliding of the adjacent doublet by a force dependent on the angle of <b>attachment</b> of the <b>arms.</b> <b>Attachment</b> of the <b>arms</b> occurs at a specified angle relative to the angle of minimum potential energy. The steady state shape consistent with the forces applied by the attached dyneins is computed. It is shown that the twist generated in an active region is counterclockwise as viewed from tip to base and therefore accumulates {{at the end of}} the axoneme. For realistic forces and twist resistances, cumulative twist should not exceed a few degrees...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the kinematic analysis of a quick return mechanism, there is a dynamic analysis present. At certain lengths and <b>attachments,</b> the <b>arm</b> of the mechanism can be evaluated and then adjusted to certain preferences. For example, {{the differences in the}} forces acting upon the system at an instant can be represented by D'Alembert's principle. Depending on the structural design of the quick return mechanism, the law of cosines can be used to determine the angles and displacements of the arm. The ratio between the working stroke (engine) and the return stroke can be simplified through the manipulation of these concepts.|$|R
50|$|Drill Arm: An <b>arm</b> <b>attachment</b> that {{consists}} of a rocket-boosted oversized drill. Unfortunately, such a weapon is in reality quite impractical as it is basically a massive gyroscope, and is incredibly difficult to wield due to the torque it produces. However, the pilots eventually develop the skill to make limited use of this weapon, and it is later seen in several scenarios where other weapons are unavailable.|$|R
50|$|Improper set-up {{of these}} wheels meant either {{a lack of}} tone, or—usually {{in the case of}} over-eager amateur or {{impatient}} guitarists—too harsh a tone caused by wheels being forced too tightly against the strings. This improper set-up resulted in a quick wearing down of the wheels for which there were no replacements—the wheels were not removable from the <b>arm</b> <b>attachments.</b> This was true of both guitar and bass units.|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes, robots {{that were}} not {{originally}} Swiss army bots have had their weapons changed or altered on the fly, typically due to malfunctions.

40|$|Aneuploidy {{in human}} eggs {{is the leading}} cause of {{pregnancy}} loss and Down's syndrome. Aneuploid eggs result from chromosome segregation errors when an egg develops from a progenitor cell, called an oocyte. The mechanisms that lead to an increase in aneuploidy with advanced maternal age are largely unclear. Here, we show that many sister kinetochores in human oocytes are separated and do not behave as a single functional unit during the first meiotic division. Having separated sister kinetochores allowed bivalents to rotate by 90 degrees on the spindle and increased the risk of merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Advanced maternal age led to an increase in sister kinetochore separation, rotated bivalents and merotelic <b>attachments.</b> Chromosome <b>arm</b> cohesion was weakened, and the fraction of bivalents that precociously dissociated into univalents was increased. Together, our data reveal multiple age-related changes in chromosome architecture that could explain why oocyte aneuploidy increases with advanced maternal age...|$|R
50|$|Knot Buster: An <b>arm</b> <b>attachment</b> {{specifically}} designed by Rika Domeki to strike and destroy a Heterodyne's Fractal Knot, the weak {{point of the}} creatures. It is a claw with an integral explosive-propelled pile driver, far more practical and controllable than the Drill Arm. One simply targets the Heterodyne's Fractal Knot, latches onto it with the claw and triggers the pile driver, impaling it. This weapon was only used once by Dai-Guard before being claimed by the Army for use by its own robot, Kokubogar, but was destroyed soon afterward.|$|R

A few other designs were done before Tsuburaya would approve the final look that was ultimately used in the film. The suit was given two separate masks and two separate pairs of arms. Long arm extensions which contained poles inside the arms for Hirose to grab onto and with static immovable hands was used for long shots of Kong, while short human length arms were added to the suit for scenes that required Kong to grab items and wrestle with Godzilla. Besides the suit with the two separate <b>arm</b> <b>attachments,</b> a meter high model and a puppet of Kong (used for closeups) were also built.

50|$|Knot Punisher: Like the Knot Buster, it is {{designed}} to strike the Fractal Knot of the Heterodyne. Unknown to the Army, Domeki designed the Knot Buster merely as a prototype for this weapon. Where the Knot Buster is a single <b>arm</b> <b>attachment,</b> the Knot Punisher utilizes both arms. One arm utilizes the same pile driver-claw utility of the Knot Buster, but instead of an explosive charge, it is driven by a torque-less counter-rotating dual flywheel attached to the other arm. The flywheel is spun up in advance, the Heterodyne's Fractal Knot is grasped with the claw, and the flywheel is inserted into the pile driver's gear port, firing the spike and impaling the knot. The flywheel itself {{can be used as a}} melee weapon, as it is quite sturdy and possesses a greater radius than the arm and more stability than the drill arm. The downsides with this system is that Dai-Guard cannot pick anything up with it in place, (aside from using the claw), and it takes a considerable amount of time to install the equipment prior to battle.|$|R
40|$|Purposes:To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} using the single-joint Hybrid Assistive Limb® robot (HAL) to assist with shoulder flexion-extension in healthy adults, and to assess {{the capacity of the}} HAL to analyze the bioelectrical signals of muscle activity for shoulder flexion-extension. Methods:This cross-sectional feasibility study included six healthy adult men with no impairment in shoulder motion. The single-joint HAL was fixed to a custom-designed platform and upper <b>arm</b> <b>attachment,</b> and aligned 3 cm below the acromion process. Vital signs, shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain were evaluated before and after the shoulder elevation exercise performed with and without the HAL. Activity of selected muscles of the shoulder was recorded using a wireless superficial electromyography device. Shoulder movement was captured using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Results:The HAL supported smooth flexion-extension of the arm at the shoulder joint, with no negative effects on vital signs, shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain. The HAL decreased muscle activity levels, with a 55 % decrease in trapezius muscle activity. The upward rotation angle of the scapula was significantly lower with the HAL at 120 ° of shoulder flexion. Conclusion:The single-joint HAL provided safe and effective assistance to scapular plane shoulder flexion-extension among healthy adults...|$|R

50|$|Unlike most robotic {{platforms}} {{that place}} {{an emphasis on}} mobility, MATILDA places an emphasis on function. Keeping this in mind, associates at Mesa Inc. identified specific UGV applications that it wanted to have present in their assembly. These applications included: target surveillance, explosive device neutralization, material pickup and transport, weapon transport and firing, and law enforcement. Mesa Inc. wanted to implement these applications into an efficient low cost solution. In order to achieve their vision, associates at Mesa Inc. consistently refined platform weight ratios until they finally achieved a design that both fundamentally fit their vision and expanded the tasks that UGV's could accomplish. Mesa Inc. associates also had specific obstacles that they wanted their robot {{to be able to}} overcome such as stair climbing, payload transporting, great battery life, tunnel navigation, video camera, and manipulator arm capabilities. In order to make the assembly applicable to national defense, Mesa Inc. associates built different models of the MATILDA. This was to make sure the robot helps each form of security's specific needs. Mesa Inc. also wanted to let the assembly be open-ended, meaning that users could attach any attachments they needed. In order to achieve this, Mesa Inc. built the robot to be compatible with an assortment of <b>attachments</b> like manipulator <b>arms,</b> saws, claws, and cameras.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the distal}} {{borders of the}} incision, the semitendinosus and {{gracilis}} tendons are found beneath the sartorius muscle fascia. The distal tibial attachment of the sMCL can be found under these identified tendons, making up {{the floor of the}} pes anserine bursa, 6 cm distal to the joint line. Once identified, the remaining soft tissue is removed from the attachment site. An eyelet pin is then drilled through attachment site transversely through the tibia, making sure the starting point is located at the posterior aspect of the site to ensure better biomechanical outcomes. Over the eyelet pin, a 7-mm reamer (6 mm considered in smaller patients) is reamed to a depth of 25 mm. Once prepared, attention is directed to preparing the reconstruction tunnel for the tibial attachment of the POL. Above the anterior <b>arm</b> <b>attachment</b> of the semimembranosus muscle tendon, the tibial attachment of the central arm of the POL is identified. This attachment is exposed by making a small incision parallel to the fibers along the posterior edge of the anterior arm of the semimembranosus tendon. Once exposed, an eyelet pin is drilled through the tibia toward Gerdy’s tubercle (anterolateral tibia). After verifying the correct anatomic eyelet pin placement, a 7-mm reamer is used over the pin to drill a tunnel depth of 25 mm.|$|R
