40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Lingjuan Wang.) Ammonia {{is a very important}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutant.</b> Agricultural <b>activities,</b> livestock production in particular, have been reported to be the largest contributor of ammonia emissions into the atmosphere. Accurate estimation of ammonia emission rate from individual operations or sources is important and yet a challenging task for both regulatory agencies and animal producers. The overall research objective {{of this study was to}} develop an emission model which can be used to estimate ammonia emission from broiler litter. In the reported model, the ammonia flux is essentially a function of the litter's total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) content, moisture content, pH, and temperature, as well as the Freundlich partition coefficient (Kf), mass transfer coefficient (KG), ventilation rate (Q), and emission surface area (A). A dynamic flow-through chamber system and a wind tunnel were designed to measure ammonia fluxes from broiler litter. The dynamic flow-through chamber experiments evaluated the reported model with various litter samples under a constant temperature and wind profile. The wind tunnel experiments evaluated the reported model under various temperatures and wind profiles. Regression sub-models were developed t...|$|R

They are particularly used for the abatement of volatile organic compounds and {{for the removal of}} aromatic, polyaromatic and polychlorinated air pollutants like furans and dioxins. Here, mixed oxide catalysts are formed by non-hydrolytic condensation of chloride precursors with diisopropyl ether in non-aqueous medium. Calcination was applied to provoke the migration of the vanadium oxide toward the surface of the anatase particles, leading to well-spread vanadia species. The materials are made of mesoporous spherical particles of a few microns, themselves constituted by the aggregation of 10 - 25 nm sized particles. Their chemical composition is precisely controlled. The samples are characterized by ICP-AES, N- 2 -physisorption, XRD, XPS, SEM and TOF-SIMS. Their performances as total oxidation catalyst are evaluated in the deep oxidation of benzene, chosen as a model <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutant.</b> The <b>activity</b> of the materials compares well with that of catalysts prepared by classical wet impregnation. Along with the V surface concentration, the environment in which V surface species are located is identified as a key parameter. The superior activity of polymeric species as compared to isolated ones is shown. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion is a {{commonly}} observed deterioration mechanism in metallic bridges, resulting in {{loss of material}} with time, which may lead to impaired performance and premature in-service failures. A number of factors are known to influence the initiation and subsequent rate of corrosion in metallic bridges, including climatic parameters such as relative humidity and temperature, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> (e. g. SO 2) and high airborne salinity. These factors and their interactions may have a detrimental influence on the rate of corrosion. Alterations of the exposure conditions, for instance due to climate change or/and adoption of government policies related to the levels of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants,</b> are likely to influence the long-term corrosion rates in metallic bridges. This paper presents a methodology, based on reliability analysis, for the time-dependent risk assessment of corroding metallic railway bridges, considering the impact of long-term changes in climatic and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutant</b> variables. The evolution of variables related to the deterioration process (e. g. climatic parameters, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants,</b> etc) and bridge resistance variables are treated as random using suitable distributions. The time evolution of the probability of failure of the bridge is quantified through Monte Carlo simulation and this is then extended into risk by considering the consequences of bridge failure. The procedure is demonstrated through a case study using a steel railway bridge. Results are presented for the moment-capacity limit state of the bridge, considering a number of emission scenarios based on UKCP 09 climate projections and assumed changes in the concentrations of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Venice Lagoon {{is exposed}} to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> from {{industrial}} <b>activities,</b> thermoelectric power plants, petrochemical plants, incinerator, domestic heating, ship traffic, glass factories and vehicular emissions on the mainland. In 2005, construction began on the mobile dams (MOSE), one dam for each channel connecting the lagoon to the Adriatic Sea as a barrier against high tide. These construction works could represent an additional source of pollutants. PM 10 samples were taken on random days between 2007 and 2010 at three different sites: Punta Sabbioni, Chioggia and Malamocco, located near the respective dam construction worksites. Chemical analyses of V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, Sb, Tl and Pb in PM 10 samples were performed by Inductively coupled plasmaquadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS) and results were used to identify the main aerosol sources. The correlation of measured data with meteorology, and source apportionment, failed to highlight a contribution specifically associated to the emissions of the MOSE construction works. The comparison of the measurements at the three sites showed a substantial homogeneity of metal concentrations in the area. Source apportionment with principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) showed that a four principal factors model could describe the sources of metals in PM 10. Three of them were assigned to specific sources {{in the area and}} one was characterised as a source of mixed origin (anthropogenic and crustal).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{estimate}} correlation between <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> {{and the number}} of children admissions by respiratory disease in the year 2001. METHODS: this is an ecological study of time series. The data on the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> were obtained at CETESB and the data on hospital admissions were obtained at the Medical Archive Service of the Taubaté University Hospital, in Taubaté. In order to study the correlation of pollutants concentration values between themselves and with the admissions, the Pearson correlation technique was utilised. The relative risks for admission by respiratory disease were estimated comparing the quartiles of the pollutant agents with values of the first quartile. The adopted statistical significance was alpha = 5 %. RESULTS: one hundred and fifty eight children were admitted with respiratory disease in the year 2001 (30 % of annual admissions). The pollutants were correlated between themselves. There was a positive correlation between the number of admissions and the concentrations of sulphur dioxide and particulate material. There was an increase of 25 % in the admission risk when comparing the fourth and the first quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: there was positive correlation between admission by respiratory disease and the concentration of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants...</b>|$|R

But how is it actually with the reverse, i. e. the climate's impact on {{air pollutants}}? The aim with our degree thesis {{is to try to}} find out if different weather factors, statistically seen, promotes <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> and particles in the air and vice versa. We got access to data on air pollutants and weather factors that was registered during year 2007 at Femmanhusets air pollutant and weather station in Gothenburg. In order to do a statistical investigation of these data, and to be able to analyze if it occurs relations of various kind, we used the statistics program SPSS. In SPSS we worked with correlation, regression and multiple linear regressions in order to get our statistical relations between <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> and weather conditions. Our results showed that ozone is the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutant</b> that is most weather sensitive and ozone has also proven to have the strongest connections to the weather factors. Also nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are considerably influenced by the weather, however not in equally big extent as ozone. Sulphur dioxide and PM 10 is on the other hand influenced in a low extent and it is in these cases difficult to say if the weather actually has any influence at all. Wind speed was, apart from sulphur dioxide and PM 10, the weather factor that were strongest correlated to the remaining <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants.</b> The relative humidity and the air pressure were the two factors that overall gave the weakest connections to the pollutants. As a conclusion, we can say that our results can be seen as an indication to the public about how sensitive people should minimize their time outdoors in the inner city on cold and calm days. It is when these weather conditions occur that the highest concentrations of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants,</b> statistically seen, can be found. However, this does not apply for ozone. For ozone, they should instead be aware on sunny and windy days as it, statistically seen, is days where high concentrations of ozone can be found in the air...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThrough many interactions, the {{composition}} and {{chemistry of the atmosphere}} are inherently connected to the climate system since <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> initiate chemical reactions affecting the climatically important compounds such as greenhouse gases. Therefore, when considering climate–chemistry interactions in the atmosphere, it is not only important to study the emissions of the climate compounds, but also to consider the chemical processes and the distribution of the compounds in the atmospheric regions by assessing their atmospheric sources and fates and determining their lifetimes. A considerable amount of kinetic studies has been carried out in this field. Consequently, progressive improvements in the database for reactions involving <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> and the quantification of their atmospheric lifetimes are made. This is fundamental to understanding the relationship between the budget and the trends of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> and thus, their impact on the climate. This issue is an essential step helping to develop effective control strategies and to establish appropriate legislations in order to prevent the emission of pollutants and to protect the atmosphere. In this respect, this paper focus on the impact of the gas phase chemistry on the climate and briefly presents the future changes in the Mediterranean climate. The major kinetic methods used in this field in laboratory studies are then reviewed and emphases on their limitations are indicated...|$|R

It reviews the current state of air pollution issues, evaluates the extensive measurements of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> and their effects, and {{provides a}} synthesis of current understanding. The review focuses on the main causes of acid deposition, eutrophication, ground level ozone and heavy metal pollution in the UK, namely sulphur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH 3), aerosols (particulate matter), heavy metals, nitric acid (HNO 3) and ozone (O 3). A summary of the current European status is included to provide a wider perspective for the assessment. Emissions of primary pollutants contributing to transboundary air pollution have changed substantially during the last 30 years, mainly in response to international control measures such as the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), and the EU National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD) which set ceilings for the emissions of key <b>atmospheric</b> <b>pollutants</b> including sulphur dioxide (SO 2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and ammonia (NH 3) for European Community Member States, which the UK had to achieve by 2010.
