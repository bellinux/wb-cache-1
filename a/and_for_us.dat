25|$|The theory {{contains}} only one half {{the explanation of}} man's origins and needs spiritualism to carry it through and complete it. For while this ascent on the physical side has been progressing through myriads of ages, the Divine descent has also been going on – man being spiritually an incarnation from the Divine {{as well as a}} human development from the animal creation. The cause of the development is spiritual. Mr. Darwin's theory does not in the least militate against ours – we think it necessitates it; he simply does not deal with our side of the subject. He can not go lower than the dust of the earth for the matter of life; <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> the main interest of our origin must lie in the spiritual domain.|$|E

Emphasizing that the final goal of Christian life is to be transformed, or [...] "transfigured", into Christ he stated that the rosary helps believers come closer to Christ by contemplating Christ. He stated that the rosary unites us with Mary's own prayer, who, in the presence of God, prays with us <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> and stated that: [...] "To recite the rosary is nothing other than to contemplate with Mary the face of Christ." ...|$|E

Mac Powell's vocal range spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The lyrics to the song {{have been described as}} being from the perspective of God, although the members of Third Day have described them differently; David Carr, the drummer for Third Day, described the lyrics as [...] "crying out to God and calling out his name", while Mac Powell described them as [...] "kind of a prayer. It's about when people are going through hard times and going through struggles that we've gotta call out to someone, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> as people of faith it's calling out to God and hearing his voice... and for someone else it could be a friend or a family member that you've gotta reach out to kind of help share those burdens you go through".

500|$|While {{in prison}} LaRouche {{released}} {{claims that he}} was tortured {{as part of an}} assassination attempt. LaRouche ran two political campaigns from prison: for Virginia's 10th Congressional District in 1990 <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> President in 1992. One of his cellmates during his incarceration at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Minnesota was televangelist Jim Bakker. Bakker later devoted a chapter of his book, I Was Wrong, to his experience with LaRouche. Bakker described his astonishment at LaRouche's detailed knowledge of the Bible. According to Bakker, LaRouche received a daily briefing each morning by phone, often in German, and {{on more than one occasion}} LaRouche had information days before it was reported on the network news. Bakker also wrote that his cellmate was convinced that their cell was bugged. In Bakker's view, [...] "to say LaRouche was a little paranoid would be like saying that the Titanic had a little leak." [...] LaRouche also befriended Richard Miller, a former FBI agent and fellow inmate who was imprisoned on espionage charges. LaRouche was paroled in 1994 after serving five years of the 15-year sentence, the normal schedule for parole at that time. LaRouche commented later that [...] "...in effect, George H. W. Bush put me in the jug, and Bill Clinton got me out".|$|E

The city's Music and Entertainment {{division}} had initially denied permission to Gaga for playing inside the venue citing {{that it was}} for [...] "public safety concerns". Don Pitts from the division said that the venue being in close proximity with a parking lot was the reason they had to cancel Gaga's application. On March 6, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Gaga would indeed play at the venue. Tickets were sold to the fans through different competitions and challenges. Randal Lane from Forbes reported that the concert would support Gaga's Born This Way Foundation and charity events, but nevertheless opined that [...] "the way they're doling out the tickets is still crass". The concert was criticized when artist Millie Brown vomited a green liquid over Gaga during the performance of [...] "Swine" [...] from Artpop.

500|$|The band's overall {{low profile}} in 2008 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} due to them spending time working on their second album. However, in December 2008, Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems. Added to this, the collapse of Pinnacle, their distribution company, denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom. Their blog entry stated that [...] "these are strange times for everyone, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> in the music industry {{there has been a lot}} of uncertainty. It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time." [...] After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director, Delorentos announced their break-up on 17 February 2009. The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to [...] "do other things". A MySpace entry stated: [...] "It's with a very heavy heart that we have to let you know that Ronan has decided to leave the band. He feels its best for him to move on and do other things. The three of us will still be making music and will let you know about what happens next". However, they still planned to record their second album, believed to be titled You Can Make Sound, in March 2009 – it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year – and play [...] "a gig or two" [...] as part of a farewell tour. The band's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork. Reaction to the split was generally one of shock – The Kinetiks were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced, Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show, whilst blogger UnaRocks, John Walshe of State, Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band's sound. On 22 April 2009, the band announced they would not split after all, citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason. Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had [...] "knocked us out of our stride" [...] and had led to him considering his future.|$|E
