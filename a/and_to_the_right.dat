5|$|A star remains {{near its}} initial {{position}} on the main sequence until {{a significant amount of}} hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.|$|E

5|$|NY185 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY9N and NY22 in Crown Point. The route progresses eastward as a two-lane highway named Bridge Road. Heading {{away from the}} western terminus, there is {{a fork in the}} road: to the left is NY185, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> is a road to a housing development. Most of NY185 runs along the lowlands around Lake Champlain, making curves at intersections, and heading on relatively flat elevations. As the highway approaches the lake, it makes a curve to the north. There, it intersects with County Route48 (Lake Road) and begins to follow the lake shore.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September 1977, an Interconair Britannia 253G {{was on a}} ferry flight, on {{approach}} to Shannon Airport severe vibration was experienced at a height of 300 feet. The {{approach to}} runway 24 was abandoned and an overshoot was commenced. The aircraft continued to sink and collided with the ground short <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the runway. The Britannia aircraft bounced, the right wing broke off. The aircraft then skidded and caught fire.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ionization}} energy is the energy {{it takes to}} remove one electron from an atom, the second {{ionization energy}} is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738kJ/mol {{and the second is}} 1450kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. Ionization energy becomes greater up <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the periodic table.|$|E

5|$|A Ricci {{painting}} of the Last Supper was above the main altar, which was dedicated to Jesus the Redeemer; in 1662, a fresco of the Madonna was moved there. The Ardicini cardinals had the image painted on the facade of their palace in Borgo Sant'Angelo, and it was venerated by the local people because {{of a number of}} miracles attributed to her intercession. On the altar was an African-marble tabernacle by Giovanni Battista Ciolli, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the entrance was a holy water font presented to the church in 1589 by Francesco Del Sodo (a member of the archconfraternity). The church was the burial place of several people, whose tombstones adorned the floor; among them were the son and mother-in-law of Pirro Ligorio and Battista Gerosa, son of the Oratory of San Sebastiano architect Antonio Gerosa.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the figure, and as {{originally}} described by , Rule 184 {{may be used to}} model deposition of particles onto a surface. In this model, one has a set of particles that occupy a subset of the positions in a square lattice oriented diagonally (the darker particles in the figure). If a particle is present at some position of the lattice, the lattice positions below <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> and below and {{to the left of the}} particle must also be filled, so the filled part of the lattice extends infinitely downward to the left and right. The boundary between filled and unfilled positions (the thin black line in the figure) is interpreted as modeling a surface, onto which more particles may be deposited. At each time step, the surface grows by the deposition of new particles in each local minimum of the surface; that is, at each position where it is possible to add one new particle that has existing particles below it on both sides (the lighter particles in the figure).|$|E
5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads into the cell which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E

5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E
5|$|Headed by Saint Peter, the Apostles {{are dressed}} in white robes and sit on two facing benches set below Christ <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups {{gathered}} at {{each side of the}} benches. A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They hold his cross and {{are dressed in}} white amice and albs, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue dalmatic vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets. The two angels on either side of Christ bear the symbols of the crucifixion already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and crown of thorns, the angel on the right a sponge and nails.|$|E
5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} indices (n,m) is used instead. The indices {{refer to}} equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring. Taking the origin as carbon number 1, the a1 unit vector may be {{considered}} the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3, and the a2 unit vector is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5. (See the upper {{right corner of the}} diagram at right.) To visualize a CNT with indices (n,m), draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60° angle to the a1 vectors, then add the vectors together. The line representing the sum of the vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting one end to the other. In the diagram at right, Ch is a (4,2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

5|$|Individual {{athletes have}} {{also used the}} Olympic stage to promote their own {{political}} agenda. At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two American track and field athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who finished first and third in the 200metres, performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand. The second-place finisher, Peter Norman of Australia, wore an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos. In response to the protest, IOC president Avery Brundage told the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team. The USOC opted for the former. During the same Olympics, Czechoslovakian gymnast Věra Čáslavská announced her protest to the Soviet-led invasion of her home country after controversially receiving Silver on the Beam and a shared Gold on the Floor. During the Soviet anthem, Čáslavská turned her head down <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of the Soviet flag {{in order to make}} a statement over the invasion and the Soviet influence of the sport of Gymnastics. Returning home, Čáslavská was made an outcast by the Soviet government and was banned from competition and travelling.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April, the Germans invaded Greece and {{advanced}} {{so rapidly that}} their forces quickly threatened to outflank the New Zealand positions. On 9 April the 4th Infantry Brigade was withdrawn and began moving south to the Servia Pass. Here, the 18th Battalion was positioned in the hills above the town of Servia <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of 19th Battalion, which was defending the pass itself. From 11 April, Stukas mounted air raids on the New Zealand positions before the Germans brought artillery to bear two days later as their ground forces approached. It was during an artillery barrage on 15 April that the battalion suffered its first fatality of the war. The same day, the 18th Battalion fended off initial probing attacks by elements of the 9th Panzer Division but were unable to prevent the Germans from occupying Servia.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium is an {{actinide}} {{which is}} positioned in {{the periodic table}} {{to the left of}} uranium <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals. The estimated shear modulus of protactinium {{is similar to that of}} titanium. Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air. Protactinium easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, but not with alkalis.|$|E
5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff bounced to the Clemson two-yard line {{before it}} was {{returned}} to the Clemson 12-yard line. An incomplete pass on first down {{was followed by a}} first-down pass to Gardner at the 22-yard line. Dantzler then completed a pass to Watts at the 34-yard line for another first down. After an incomplete pass, Dantzler scrambled for a first down at the Clemson 47-yard line, where he completed a 17-yard pass to Robinson as time ticked below one minute remaining. From the Tech 36-yard line, Dantzler completed a pass to Gardner at the Tech 29-yard line. After a time out with 33 seconds remaining, Dantzler threw an incomplete pass. This was followed by another incomplete pass, and Clemson converted the first down with a pass to the Tech 24-yard line. An incomplete pass on first down was followed by another on second down. Following the play, there was only eight seconds left on the clock, and coach Bowden ordered Hunt into the game to attempt a 41-yard field goal. The kick was short <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> and Clemson turned the ball over with two seconds remaining. Vick took a knee to run the final seconds off the clock, and Virginia Tech entered halftime with a 2110 lead.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as either the left-hand wing of a since dismantled diptych, or as the front piece of a double-sided panel. Art historian Erwin Panofsky suggests that the Washington Saint George and the Dragon of 1432–35 {{is the most likely}} opposite wing. In that work, St. George, facing inwards <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> slays the dragon before a Libyan princess. Although the pairing might seem incongruous, his Madonna Standing is widely thought to have been attached with the St. Catherine of Alexandria in Vienna. In both panels, the saints face inwards and are within fully realised landscapes. In contrast, in both left-hand panels, the Madonna and Child are positioned frontally (although eye contact is avoided) and isolated within cold grisaille architectural spaces.|$|E
