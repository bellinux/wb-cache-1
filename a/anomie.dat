5|$|As the society, Durkheim noted {{there are}} several {{possible}} pathologies {{that could lead to}} a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are <b>anomie</b> and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. By <b>anomie</b> Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term <b>anomie</b> meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} his books, such as The Day of the Owl (Il giorno della civetta) and Equal Danger (Il contesto), {{demonstrate}} how the Mafia manages to sustain itself {{in the face of}} the <b>anomie</b> inherent in Sicilian life. He presented a forensic analysis of the kidnapping and assassination of Aldo Moro, a prominent Christian Democrat, in his book The Moro Affair.|$|E
25|$|João das Regras became {{notable for}} {{supporting}} {{the claims of the}} grand-master of the Order of Aviz, João I to the throne of Portugal during the 1383–1385 Crisis, a period of civil war and <b>anomie</b> in the Portuguese history that began with the death of king Fernando I of Portugal — who left no male heirs — and ended with the accession to the throne of João I. During that period, several pretenders to the Portuguese throne arose and das Regras became notable for refuting the arguments of every one of them without mentioning the name of João I at the Cortes of Coimbra.|$|E
25|$|Ristovski also {{intended}} {{the film to}} portray social conditions in post-independence Macedonia, depicting it as a society plagued by <b>anomie,</b> violence and corruption. He saw these conditions {{as part of a}} larger regional unease whose history included civil conflict in former Yugoslav territories. Critics have similarly interpreted the film as an allegory of these social and regional concerns. In this context, Marko's transition from victimhood to criminality embodies the cycle of violence endemic in such conditions, while his failed hopes serve as a cautionary warning against the dangers of empty idealism in such situations. One critic saw Paris' bullet in Marko's chess set (see figure on the right) as a metaphor for the threat of violence ever-present in their world.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dialogue}} between transhumanism and faith was a one-day conference {{held at the}} University of Toronto in 2004. Religious critics alone faulted the philosophy of transhumanism as offering no eternal truths nor {{a relationship with the}} divine. They commented that a philosophy bereft of these beliefs leaves humanity adrift in a foggy sea of postmodern cynicism and <b>anomie.</b> Transhumanists responded that such criticisms reflect a failure to look at the actual content of the transhumanist philosophy, which, far from being cynical, is rooted in optimistic, idealistic attitudes that trace back to the Enlightenment. Following this dialogue, William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist of religion, conducted a pilot study, published in the Journal of Evolution and Technology, suggesting that religious attitudes were negatively correlated with acceptance of transhumanist ideas and indicating that individuals with highly religious worldviews tended to perceive transhumanism as being a direct, competitive (though ultimately futile) affront to their spiritual beliefs.|$|E
500|$|Many synth-pop musicians {{had limited}} musical skills, {{relying on the}} {{technology}} to produce or reproduce the music. The result was often minimalist, with grooves that were [...] "typically woven together from simple repeated riffs often with no harmonic 'progression' to speak of". Early synth-pop {{has been described as}} [...] "eerie, sterile, and vaguely menacing", using droning electronics with little change in inflection. Common lyrical themes of synth-pop songs were isolation, urban <b>anomie,</b> and feelings of being emotionally cold and hollow.|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} the midtempo piece [...] "I Just Want to Have Something to Do", which {{contains}} lyrics pertaining to ambivalence and <b>anomie.</b> In the song, Joey manages to rhyme [...] "Second Avenue" [...] with [...] "chicken vindaloo". The next track, [...] "I Wanted Everything", {{is compared to}} Merle Haggard's song [...] "If We Make It Through December", being called its [...] "punk counterpart" [...] by Rock: A Canadian Perspective author Larry Starr. [...] "Questioningly" [...] is a ballad focusing on failing relationships and heartbreak. [...] "Don't Come Close" [...] uses elements which can also be heard in country music, such as twang.|$|E
500|$|Alkan's later {{correspondence}} {{contains many}} despairing comments. In {{a letter of}} about 1861 he wrote to Hiller: [...] "I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do... no one to devote myself to. My situation makes me horridly sad and wretched. Even musical production has lost its attraction for me for I can't see the point or goal." [...] This spirit of <b>anomie</b> may have led him to reject requests in the 1860s to play in public, or to allow performances of his orchestral compositions. However, {{it should not be}} ignored that he was writing similarly frantic self-analyses in his letters of the early 1830s to Masarnau.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{score is}} {{composed}} by Petri Alanko. The soundtrack features the song [...] "War" [...] by Poets of the Fall, from the band's fourth studio album, Twilight Theater. Sam Lake {{said that the}} song [...] "...is a prominent part of the Alan Wake soundtrack and the theme also links strongly to the game's storyline." [...] Poets of the Fall also perform two original songs, [...] "Children of the Elder God" [...] and [...] "The Poet and the Muse", under the name Old Gods of Asgard. The band wrote the ending theme to Remedy's previous game, , called [...] "Late Goodbye", {{which is based on}} a poem written by Lake. [...] "War", however, was not written specifically for Alan Wake. [...] "Haunted" [...] by Poe plays {{at the end of the}} second episode. [...] "Space Oddity" [...] by David Bowie plays over the end credits. <b>Anomie</b> Belle's [...] "How Can I Be Sure" [...] is featured in the third episode. [...] "Coconut" [...] by Harry Nilsson is played several times during game. On 20 July 2010 an official soundtrack consisting of 18 tracks was released.|$|E
500|$|Punk rock {{lyrics are}} {{typically}} frank and confrontational; {{compared to the}} lyrics of other popular music genres, they frequently comment on social and political issues. Trend-setting songs such as the Clash's [...] "Career Opportunities" [...] and Chelsea's [...] "Right to Work" [...] deal with unemployment and the grim realities of urban life. Especially in early British punk, a central goal was to outrage and shock the mainstream. The Sex Pistols' [...] "Anarchy in the U.K." [...] and [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] openly disparaged the British political system and social mores. Anti-sentimental depictions of relationships and sex are common, as in [...] "Love Comes in Spurts", written by Richard Hell and recorded by him with the Voidoids. <b>Anomie,</b> variously expressed in the poetic terms of Hell's [...] "Blank Generation" [...] and the bluntness of the Ramones' [...] "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue", is a common theme. Identifying punk with such topics aligns with the view expressed by V. Vale, founder of San Francisco fanzine Search and Destroy: [...] "Punk was a total cultural revolt. It was a hardcore confrontation with the black side of history and culture, right-wing imagery, sexual taboos, a delving into it {{that had never been}} done before by any generation in such a thorough way". The controversial content of punk lyrics led to some punk records being banned by radio stations and refused shelf space in major chain stores.|$|E
500|$|Superunknown {{received}} positive reviews. Q said, [...] "Soundgarden dealt in unreconstructed heavy rock: a heavy guitar sound, depth-charge drumming... Yet Superunknown {{also includes}} more measured moments". Rolling Stone magazine's J. D. Considine {{was impressed by}} the record's range and, despite criticizing [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] and [...] "Half", he said [...] "at its best, Superunknown offers a more harrowing depiction of alienation and despair than anything on In Utero". Jon Pareles of The New York Times credited the band with trying to transcend conventional heavy metal: [...] "Superunknown actually tries to broaden its audience by breaking heavy-metal genre barriers that Soundgarden used to accept." [...] In Entertainment Weekly, David Browne wrote, [...] "Soundgarden is pumped and primed on Superunknown, and they deliver the goods." [...] He praised it as a [...] "hard-rock milestone – a boiling vat of volcanic power, record-making smarts, and '90s <b>anomie</b> and anxiety that sets a new standard for anything called metal." [...] Ann Powers from Blender said that [...] "guitarist Thayil helps create the stoner-rock template", and that it [...] "stands as Soundgarden's masterpiece". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, who had [...] "mocked" [...] Soundgarden's [...] "conceptual pretentions for years", still felt their foredooming, pessimistic lyrics lacked much substance, but said they had improved composing, arranging, and producing on an album that was [...] "easily the best—most galvanizing, kinetic, sensational, catchy—Zep rip in history". In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Steve Huey wrote, [...] "It's obvious that Superunknown was consciously styled as a masterwork, and it fulfills every ambition." [...] It received a nomination in the Best Rock Album category for the 1995 Grammy Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Mos Def {{released}} his solo debut album Black on Both Sides in October 1999, also through Rawkus.

Around {{this time he}} {{also contributed to the}} Scritti Politti album <b>Anomie</b> & Bonhomie.|$|E
2500|$|Sociology {{examines}} {{value at}} a social level using theoretical constructs such as value theory, norms, <b>anomie,</b> etc. [...] One value system suggested by social psychologists, broadly called Terror Management Theory, states that human meaning {{is derived from}} a fundamental fear of death, and values are selected when they allow us to escape the mental reminder of death.|$|E
2500|$|Strain theory, {{also known}} as Mertonian <b>Anomie,</b> {{advanced}} by American sociologist Robert Merton, suggests that mainstream culture, especially in the United States, is saturated with dreams of opportunity, freedom, and prosperity—as Merton put it, the American Dream. Most people buy into this dream, {{and it becomes a}} powerful cultural and psychological motivation. Merton also used the term <b>anomie,</b> but it meant something slightly different for him than it did for Durkheim. [...] Merton saw the term as meaning a dichotomy between what society expected of its citizens and what those citizens could actually achieve. [...] Therefore, if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of those dejected will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it. Others will retreat or drop out into deviant subcultures (such as gang members, or what he calls [...] "hobos").|$|E
2500|$|Albert K. Cohen tied <b>anomie</b> {{theory with}} Freud's {{reaction}} formation idea, suggesting that delinquency among lower class youths is {{a reaction against}} the social norms of the middle class. [...] Some youth, especially from poorer areas where opportunities are scarce, might adopt social norms specific to those places that may include [...] "toughness" [...] and disrespect for authority. [...] Criminal acts may result when youths conform to norms of the deviant subculture.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the initial}} success of trip hop in the mid-1990s, notable [...] "post-trip-hop" [...] artists include Bowery Electric, Esthero, Morcheeba, Sneaker Pimps, <b>Anomie</b> Belle, Alpha, Jaianto, Mudville and Cibo Matto and Lamb. These artists {{incorporated}} trip hop into other genres, including ambient, soul, IDM, industrial, dubstep, breakbeat, drum and bass, acid jazz, and new-age. The first printed {{use of the}} term [...] "post-trip hop" [...] was in an October 2002 article of The Independent, and was used to describe the band Second Person.|$|E
2500|$|A related {{contemporary}} ideology, consumerism, {{which encourages}} the personal acquisition {{of goods and}} services, also drives globalization. [...] Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of consumer education into school curricula. Social activists hold materialism is connected to global retail merchandizing and supplier convergence, war, greed, <b>anomie,</b> crime, environmental degradation, and general social malaise and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by postconsumers, with the strategic emphasis on moving beyond addictive consumerism.|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, certain mentalities {{take longer}} to change. The issue of virginity at {{marriage}} {{and the influence of}} religious preachers castigating on Middle Eastern television networks the Western way of life {{played an important role in}} this debate. The hijab, little in use, made its appearance in the 2000s as a return to a mythical Arab Islamic authenticity, the influence of foreign television networks and the context following the attacks on September 11, 2001 could constitute a complementary explanation. As for the jurist, Yadh Ben Achour Achour, he explained in [...] "Politics, Religion and Law in the Arab World" [...] (1992) that [...] "The Tunisian woman is still entangled in too many archaisms and suffers too violently the effects of social <b>anomie</b> to be able to benefit fully from Bourguiba's reforms." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's fourth studio album, 1994's Superunknown, {{proved to}} be the band's {{breakthrough}} album. Upon its release in March 1994, Superunknown debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album launched several successful singles, including [...] "Spoonman" [...] and [...] "Black Hole Sun", and brought Soundgarden international recognition. Superunknown achieved quintuple platinum status in the United States, triple platinum status in Canada, and gold status in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Rolling Stone gave Superunknown four out of five stars. Reviewer J.D. Considine said Superunknown [...] "demonstrates far greater range than many bands manage in an entire career." [...] Considine criticized [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] and [...] "Half", stating that the former is [...] "not a very good song" [...] while the latter [...] "is the virtual definition of a B-side." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said that [...] "Superunknown actually tries to broaden its audience by breaking heavy-metal genre barriers that Soundgarden used to accept." [...] He added that [...] "Soundgarden ... want something different from standard heavy metal." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A, saying [...] "Soundgarden is pumped and primed on Superunknown, and they deliver the goods." [...] He praised it as a [...] "hard-rock milestone—a boiling vat of volcanic power, record-making smarts, and '90s <b>anomie</b> and anxiety that sets a new standard for anything called metal." [...] The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 1995. Two singles from Superunknown, [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] and [...] "Spoonman", won Grammy Awards, and the music video for [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] won a MTV Video Music Award and a Clio Award.

5000|$|As {{an older}} variant, the Webster 1913 Dictionary reports {{use of the}} word <b>anomie</b> as meaning [...] "disregard or {{violation}} of the law" [...] but <b>anomie</b> as a social disorder is {{not to be confused with}} anarchy.

Some anarcho-primitivists like 'Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski argue that complex societies, particularly industrial and post-industrial societies, directly cause conditions such as <b>anomie</b> by depriving the individual of self-determination and a relatively small reference group to relate to, such as the band, clan, or tribe.|$|E

50|$|Merton's {{theory of}} {{deviance}} {{is derived from}} Durkheim's idea of <b>anomie.</b> It is central in explaining how internal changes can occur in a system. For Merton, <b>anomie</b> means a discontinuity between cultural goals and the accepted methods available for reaching them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anomie</b> theory, {{seeks to}} {{understand}} normlessness, where society provides little moral guidance to individuals. Sociologist Emile Durkheim observed that social periods of disruption in greater <b>anomie</b> and {{higher rates of}} suicide and crimes. Merton theorizes that <b>anomie</b> (normative breakdown) and some forms of deviant behavior derive largely from a disjunction between “culturally prescribed aspirations” of a society and “socially structured avenues for realizing those aspirations. In The Division of Labor in Society, Durkheim described <b>anomie</b> as one result of an inequitable division of labour within the society. Broadly speaking, then, during times of great upheaval, increasing numbers of individuals’ ‘cease to accept the moral legitimacy of society,” as sociologist Anthony R.
