40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} how to apply pointer analysis to a wide variety of compiler applications. We are not presenting a new pointer analysis. Rather, we focus on putting two existing pointer analyses, points-to analysis and connection analysis, to work. We demonstrate that the fundamental problem is that one must be able to compare the memory locations read/written via pointer indirections, at different program points, and one must also be able to summarize the ef-fect of pointer references over regions in the program. It is straightforward to compute read/write sets for indirections involving stack-directed pointers using points-to informa-tion. However, for heap-directed pointers we show that one needs to introduce the notion of <b>anchor</b> <b>handles</b> into the connection analysis and then express read/write sets to the heap with respect to these <b>anchor</b> <b>handles.</b> Based on the read/write sets we show how to extend tra-ditional analyses like common subexpression elimination, loop-invariant removal and location-invariant removal to in-clude pointer references. We also demonstrate the use of our information on more advanced techniques such as array dependence testing and program understanding. We have implemented our techniques in our McCAT C compiler, and we demonstrate examples of applying our methods on a set of pointer-intensive C benchmarks, as well as present con-crete empirical data on the improvements achieved. ...|$|R

2500|$|In the mid-1970s, oil {{companies}} began {{drilling in the}} Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea. In order to overcome the relatively short operating window of drillships during the ice-free season (100 to 110 days a year) and the water depth limitations of artificial dredged islands, Gulf Canada Resources began developing an Arctic drilling system consisting of two mobile drilling units: a Mobile Arctic Caisson (MAC) that could be submerged and filled with gravel to form an artificial drilling island in waters up to [...] in depth and a floating Conical Drilling Unit (CDU) designed for drilling in water depths between [...] while afloat. These units, each capable of completing one exploration well per year, would be supported by four Arctic Class 4 vessels: two large icebreakers providing 24-hour ice management and standby services on the drilling site and two smaller icebreaking vessels responsible for <b>anchor</b> <b>handling</b> and supply runs between the drilling rigs and coastal bases. By 1982, both drilling units and all four icebreaking vessels were under construction in Canada and Japan for BeauDril, Gulf Canada's drilling subsidiary, and the company had committed itself to a billion-dollar exploration program between 1983 and 1988.|$|E

40|$|Pointer {{analysis}} {{has recently been}} a subject of active research. The focus of most techniques is on: (1) estimating the targets for stack-directed pointers, (2) computing relationships between heap-directed pointers, or (3) developing faster or more space-efficient algorithms. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to actually using the results of pointer analysis for compiler optimizations. This thesis addresses the problem of how to apply pointer analysis information to a wide variety of compiler applications. That is, once the pointer relationships are computed, what can we do with this information? How do we put pointer analysis to work?We have used the pointer analyses implemented in the framework of the McCAT C compiler as the basis of our study. These analyses include, points-to analysis for stack-directed pointers, and connection and shape analyses for heap-directed pointers. We demonstrate that the fundamental problem is that one must be able to compare the memory locations read/written via pointer indirections, at different programs points, and one must also be able to summarize the effect of pointer references over regions in the program. It is straightforward to compute read/write sets for indirections involving stack-directed pointers using points-to information. However, for heap-directed pointers we show that one needs to introduce the notion of <b>anchor</b> <b>handles</b> into the connection analysis and then compute read/write sets to the heap with respect to these <b>anchor</b> <b>handles.</b> Based on the read/write sets we show how to extend traditional optimizations like common subexpression elimination and loop-invariant removal to include pointer references. In the same vein, we propose a novel optimization called location-invariant removal. We also demonstrate the use of our information on more advanced techniques such as array dependence testing and program understanding. We have implemented our techniques in the McCAT C compiler, and we demonstrate examples of applying our methods on a set of pointer-intensive C benchmarks, as well as present concrete empirical data on the improvements achieved. We also present techniques to use pointer analysis information for detecting parallelism in C programs with recursive data structures. In addition to the read/write sets, we use shape analysis information and data structure access paths for dependence testing. The dependence tests are specifically tailored for detecting three parallelism patterns that frequently arise in C programs. These patterns include, function calls that access disjoint sub-pieces of tree-like data structures, pointer-chasing loops that traverse list-Eke data structures, and array-based loops which operate on arrays of pointers pointing to disjoint data structures. To identify loop parallelism, we introduce special tests for identifying loop-carried dependences in the context of recursive data structures. We have implemented the tests in the framework of the McCAT C compiler, and present experimental results for a set of C benchmark programs to evaluate their effectiveness...|$|R

50|$|The purely {{mechanical}} {{ship operation}} aspect of marine engineering has some relationship with naval architecture. However, whereas naval architects {{are concerned with}} the overall design of the ship and its propulsion through the water, marine engineers are focused towards the main propulsion plant, the powering and mechanization aspects of the ship functions such as steering, <b>anchoring,</b> cargo <b>handling,</b> heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical power generation and electrical power distribution, interior and exterior communication, and other related requirements. In some cases, the responsibilities of each industry collide and is not specific to either field. Propellers are examples of one of these types of responsibilities. For naval architects a propeller is a hydrodynamic device. For marine engineers a propeller acts similarly to a pump. Hull vibration, excited by the propeller, is another such area. Noise control and shock hardening must be the joint responsibility of both the naval architect and the marine engineer. In fact, most issues caused by machinery are responsibilities in general.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mobile IPv 6 enables {{mobile node}} to roam transparently in any network. It shows good {{performance}} for macro mobility {{but it is}} not proper for supporting micro mobility because of large latency. Accord-ingly, IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) mobileip WG(Working Group) suggests Fast Handover Protocol and HMIPv 6 (Hierarchical Mo-bile IPv 6) for micro mobility management. However, HMIPv 6 has some problems of scalability if the mobility <b>anchor</b> point <b>handles</b> too many mobile nodes, and fast handover protocol has problem that mobile node can not send an L 3 packet once it has started an L 2 handover. So exist-ing protocols currently do not support a suitable handover mechanism to allow a fast moving mobile node to change its point of attachment from one network to another. In this paper, we propose a fast handover mech-anism to use mobility prediction table over wireless LAN for fast moving mobile node. We evaluated packet loss in our proposed mechanism us-ing mobility prediction with various fast handover schemes. Simulation results show effectiveness of our scheme. ...|$|R
