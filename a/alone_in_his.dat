5|$|The game {{centers on}} a boy who dreams of flying while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed.

Assuming {{the role of the}} boy, the player flies through a dream world and manipulates clouds to solve puzzles. The game was intended to spark emotions in the player that the video game industry usually ignored.|$|E

Farrar was convinced that Green was continuing to drink heavily while {{she should have been}} caring for the children, and he told Green that he knew she had poisoned him and that Social Services might be called to protect the children if she failed to get her life in order. After the last call between Green and Farrar, Farrar watched television <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> apartment until about 12:30, when a neighbor's phone call alerted him to the fire.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt {{was lucky}} during the few gun fights he {{took part in}} from his {{earliest}} job as an assistant police officer in Wichita to Tombstone, where he was briefly deputy U.S. marshal. Unlike his lawmen brothers Virgil and James, Wyatt was never wounded, although once his clothing and his saddle were shot through with bullet holes. According to John H. Flood's biography (as dictated to him by Wyatt Earp), Wyatt vividly recalled a presence that in several instances warned him away or urged him to take action. This happened {{when he was on}} the street, <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, at Bob Hatch's Pool Hall, where he went moments before Morgan was assassinated, and again when he approached Iron Springs and surprised Curly Bill Brocius, killing him.|$|E
5|$|As {{she grew}} older Betsy {{suffered}} from numerous illnesses, the exact natures {{of which are}} not recorded but which {{are known to have}} caused William great concern. William began to become paranoid that Betsy would marry and leave his service, in 1835 going as far as to have her sign an affidavit that she would never leave him. In 1843 his older brother Charles, a successful planter in Java, returned to England after over 30 years abroad. William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles, a suspicion intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine; Charles returned to Java in 1845. In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector Joseph Gillott, one of William's regular customers who owned some of his pictures. Gillott was married with children, and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern. In 1848, William retired to York leaving Betsy <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> London apartment; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement. Betsy did eventually join him in York, and was present at his death.|$|E

5|$|In his Critique of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason <b>alone.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> Critique of Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Scully {{notices that}} Miles (now on life support) has two heartbeats. At the FBI, Kersh unsuccessfully tries to {{convince}} Doggett to stop investigating Mulder's apparent death. A short while later, as Skinner walks down a hallway, rogue agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) activates nanobots {{that he had}} previously placed in Skinner's bloodstream as blackmail. Skinner stumbles in pain, and in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains {{that he has a}} vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hospital bed, Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets a lab report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is now a new being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but does not explain Krycek's demands.|$|E

Mob princess Angelina Veneziano (Diana DeGarmo) arrives in town and develops a crush on Kevin.

Once Angelina leaves town, Chloe and Kevin marry and resume their courtship. The couple join forces with Adam (Michael Muhney) and Chelsea Newman (Melissa Claire Egan) to start a fashion website entitled TagNGrab. The site ends unsuccessfully, leaving Chloe and Kevin in need of money. In a Bonnie and Clyde themed story arc, they steal money to save their house. Their marriage flounders as Kevin continues to steal and lets Chloe spend a night in jail for his crime, and they decide to get a divorce, which particularly affects Delia who adored her stepfather. During this period Chloe develops a fashion line for Jabot's fashion division with her best friend, Chelsea. Months later, Chloe and Kevin decide to start over and begin dating again. On the night of Delia's performance in a play, Billy leaves Delia and her dog, Dash, <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car while purchasing ice-cream. Dash runs off, causing Delia to run after him. Delia is struck down by a car believed {{to be driven by}} Adam, before being rushed to the hospital and dying of her injuries. When she learns of Delia's death from Billy at the hospital, Chloe breaks down and begins lashing out emotionally at Billy and everyone around her.

5|$|Jones was not <b>alone</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> wish to {{get more}} screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character {{to be written into}} more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, and she feels that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E
