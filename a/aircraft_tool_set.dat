The current occupant of the building, Force Control, operates a multipurpose machine shop. At the request of the US Department of Energy (DOE), a team from Oak Ridge National Laboratory conducted an independent radiological verification survey at the former Associate <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Tool</b> and Manufacturing Company Site, Fairfield, Ohio. The survey was performed from February to May of 1995.

40|$|Abstract: In {{airplane}} {{research and}} development, tooling design is desired to be undertaken with airplane product design concurrently {{together with the}} considerations of downstream processes such as manufacturing and assembling. However, so far, collaborative design for <b>aircraft</b> <b>tooling,</b> especially in large-sized one, is difficult. To solve this, a self-adaptive collaborative design method of <b>aircraft</b> <b>tooling</b> based on a natural neuron-endocrine-immunity system, multi-agent and product data management (PDM) technologies has been developed and is presented in this article. Firstly, with the similar working principle of the neuron-endocrine-immunity system model that is able to manage cells and tissues of a human body in a self-adaptive means, a tooling collaborative design model has been developed to enhance the responsiveness and adaptability for changes during aircraft design. Secondly, a collaborative design framework has been proposed by applying the multi-agent and PDM technologies to implement this model. The multi-agent technology focuses on managing the frequent changes, and the PDM {{has been used to}} manage the mass aircraft product design and tooling. This framework incorporates the PDM Client/Server architecture and adopts a federated structure for effective collaboration in terms of unified data sharing, convenient tool wrapping, decentralized control, coordination, etc. Finally, a multi-agent-based prototype system, developed, and testified in an aircraft manufacturing enterprise, is demonstrated for <b>aircraft</b> <b>tooling</b> collaborative design. Case studies show that optimized and re-configurable <b>aircraft</b> <b>tooling</b> design can be achieved {{with the help of the}} developed collaboration framework...|$|R

This paper introduced the interface specifications and hardware connecting methods of handwheel NK 100 AB 2, developed control program based on PMAC (Programmable Multi-Axis Controller) and industrial personal computer, finally achieved the function of axes selecting and the feed rate selecting. Based on the traditional edge detector <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method, an improved <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> method is proposed. The inverted micro milling cutter hilt is used to replace the traditional edge detector, which avoids the opposite reamer error caused by the irregular cutter blade shape, finally, <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> function is achieved through the collecting of electrical signal. The research will provide a useful reference for the {{realization of}} handwheel and <b>tool</b> <b>setting</b> of micro milling machine based on PMAC...|$|R

40|$|Most new {{aircraft}} programs encounter {{the challenge of}} balancing the time required for design optimization with product delivery constraints. The high cost and long lead times of traditional tooling {{makes it difficult for}} aircraft manufactures to efficiently meet ever-changing market demands. The large size, low relative stiffness and high positional tolerances required for aircraft components drive the requirement for rigid fixed tooling to maintain the precision part relationships over time. Use of today’s advance 3 -Dimensional CAD systems coupled with the high accuracy of CNC machines enables the success of the determinate assembly approach for <b>aircraft</b> <b>tooling.</b> This approach provides the aircraft manufacturer significant lead-time reductions {{while at the same time}} it supports enhanced system flexibility. Determinate assembly for <b>aircraft</b> <b>tooling</b> has proven to be highly successful for tooling manufacture on large-scale system such as the A 380 and A 340 - 600 wing assembly projects...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical & Computer EngineeringSteve WarrenHandgrip contractions are a {{standard}} exercise modality to evaluate muscular system performance. Most conventional ergometer systems that collect handgrip contraction data are manually controlled, placing {{a burden on}} the researcher to guide subject activity while recording the resultant data. Further, post-processing tools {{for this type of}} experiment are not standardized within the domain, which requires investigators to process their data with multiple <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> and often create custom <b>tool</b> <b>sets</b> for that purpose. This can make experimental data difficult to compare and correlate, even within the same research group. This thesis presents updates to a hand-forearm ergometer system that automate the control and data-acquisition processes as well as provide a <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> to post process hand contraction data. The automated system utilizes a LabVIEW virtual instrument as the system centerpiece; it provides the subject/researcher interfaces and coordinates data acquisition from both traditional and new sensors. The <b>tool</b> <b>set</b> also incorporates a collection of MATLAB scripts that allow the investigator to post process these data in {{a standard}} way, such as automating the processes of noise floor removal, burst start/stop time identification, and mean/median frequency calculation in electromyograms (EMGs).
