40|$|End-user {{energy demand}} (EUED) in the {{workplace}} is affected by a complex interaction between behavioural, social, technological, regulatory and organisational factors. Designing technology-led interventions to encourage pro-environmental behaviour that acknowledge and support this complexity is a significant challenge. This paper discusses the design and evaluation of an EUED intervention implemented in the corporate infrastructure of <b>a</b> UK university <b>administration</b> <b>department.</b> Two intervention types, group feedback and group goal-setting were implemented. 16 participants were recruited and engaged with a four stage study (baseline, group feedback, group goal setting, and baseline) for a duration of 4 months. This study design allowed us to track clearly any changes in mid-term energy usage behaviour during and beyond intervention. Findings suggest that, surprisingly, participant energy consumption increased during the intervention period compared to baseline conditions. These results demonstrate that simple group-based behaviour change methods can be counter-productive {{in the workplace}}, illustrating the complex and unpredictable nature of intervention in this design space...|$|R

The findings were that employees initially felt positive about being a part of the business process project. During the project, employees actually experienced (a) a lack of training, which employees advised to management was very important to a new process; (b) no definitive assistance and a lack of communication for individual concerns; (c) management 2 ̆ 7 s increased job duties and responsibilities without increased income; and (d) feeling unvalued in employee meetings.

5000|$|Between 1914 and 1920 {{the islands}} began the slow {{transition}} from naval to civilian administration. By 1920 all authority had been {{transferred from the}} Naval Defense Force to the Civil Affairs Bureau which was directly responsible to the Navy Ministry. Initially based in Truk, the Civil Affairs Bureau was moved to Koror in the Palau islands in 1921. The naval garrisons were disbanded {{to comply with the}} terms of the Mandate. In April 1922 a civilian government was established in each of the six administrative districts (Saipan, Palau, Yap, Truk, Ponape and Jaluit) in the form of <b>a</b> civil <b>administration</b> <b>department</b> which still reported to the local naval garrison commander. At the same time a post of Governor of the South Pacific Mandate was created. Governors were mostly admirals or vice-admirals as the administration was initially still the responsibility of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Governor reported directly to the Prime Minister of Japan. After the establishment of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs in June 1929, the Governor reported to the Minister of Colonial Affairs instead. The establishment of the [...] "South Seas Government" [...] or [...] "Nan'yo-Cho" [...] in March 1932 finally put the government of the islands under <b>a</b> purely civilian <b>administration.</b> When the Ministry of Colonial Affairs was absorbed into the Ministry of Greater East Asia in November 1942, the primacy of the Imperial Japanese Navy was again recognized by the appointment of an admiral as the Governor. Furthermore, the six administrative districts were reduced to three in November 1943: North, East, and West.|$|R
