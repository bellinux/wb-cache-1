5|$|Triton's {{rotation}} is tidally locked to be synchronous {{with its}} orbit around Neptune: it keeps one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital plane. At the present time, Triton's rotational axis is about 40° from Neptune's orbital plane, and hence {{at some point}} during Neptune's year each pole points fairly close to the Sun, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> poles of Uranus. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight. Such changes were observed in 2010.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} years of {{production}} (until the Zenit-E of 1967) Zenit camera development coincided with that of the Zorki cameras. The Zenit-S had PC-synchro for external flash units (<b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Zorki-S) and the Zenit-3M also had an RF-sibling, the Zorki-6. For an SLR, the Pentaprism of all classical Zenits was undersize, with the viewfinder showing about two-thirds of the actual frame-size.|$|E
25|$|Six {{movements}} of his Stabat Mater {{were written in}} 1832 by Rossini himself and the other six by Giovanni Tadolini, a good musician who was asked by Rossini to complete the work. However, Rossini composed {{the rest of the}} score in 1841. The success of the work bears comparison with his achievements in opera, but his comparative silence during the period from 1832 to his death in 1868 makes his biography appear <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> narrative of two lives—the life of swift triumph and the long life of seclusion, of which biographers give us pictures in stories of the composer's cynical wit, his speculations in fish mongering, his mask of humility and indifference.|$|E

The Port Authority has stated: [...] "Its structure is designed around a strong, redundant steel moment frame consisting of beams and columns connected {{by a combination of}} welding and bolting.

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Frank Borin, premiered on Yahoo! Music on November 15, 2007. Later that day, {{it was also}} released to iTunes for digital download. According to the behind-the-scenes video, the song features the use of pyrotechnics all throughout the video. When asked about the idea behind the video, Wade said, [...] "The whole concept of this video and just stuff exploding and breaking with my performance to the camera; it's almost like my performance is trying to salvage a relationship together.

He adds, [...] "He hits it [...] very straight and appears {{to hit the ball}} with a very powerful side-foot action, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> technique used in a side-foot pass.

500|$|The {{song was}} met with a polarised {{response}} from critics. PopMatters felt that the song [...] "comes close to sounding too safe, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> band is on autopilot." [...] Several critics felt that the song resembled Coldplay's earlier single [...] "Clocks". MusicOMH commented that [...] "Speed Of Sound, the lead single, has 'Clocks'-like drumming contrasts with synth sequences that remind more of Enya than rock music" [...] and criticised it for sounding [...] "familiar and far older than it is." [...] Pitchfork Media likewise criticised the song's [...] "uncanny resemblance to 'Clocks'" [...] and continued [...] "Certainly, it rarely hurts to stick with what works, {{but this is not}} just a near-exact replica of its successful predecessor; it's also a less memorable song riding a piano hook that has so deeply infiltrated the pop-culture landscape that I've become numb to it." [...] The reviewer did, however, comment that [...] "the track's vocal melody outperforms the one from 'Clocks' by a hair." ...|$|E

[...] She elaborated that [...] "Fembot" [...] is not [...] "really about the future or about space or anything", {{saying that it is}} about the present time.

500|$|An {{unusually large}} amount of in-camera effects {{were used for the}} pilot in place of {{computer}} generated imagery, including [...] "upside-down day"; shots of Haller using his abilities, where multiple takes of debris were filmed in controlled camera movements and then overlayed on shots of Stevens acting on his own; a montage that appears as a single camera movement, pulling [...] "back in slow motion as we see David Haller’s childhood progress"; and a one-shot action sequence—actually filmed in two shots that were later connected with visual effects—that saw the camera mounted on a cable and run down a hill side. Hawley admitted {{that it would be a}} challenge for the series' other directors to maintain this quality of visuals with much less time to film each episode: Hawley had 21 days to film the pilot, but the subsequent episodes were only scheduled 8 days of filming each. Some of these shoots ultimately had to be extended to 10 or 11 days filming to meet Hawley's vision, which he said were [...] "not good calls to have but what are you going to do? It’s a huge show."
