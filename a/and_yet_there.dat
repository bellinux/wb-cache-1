5|$|It is a {{particularly}} poignant melody that should play with an audience's emotions. The mistress clearly {{knew what she was}} doing sleeping with an older man, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> is something expletive about it as well. Eva's bitchiness should be enjoyed by an audience, but they should also be investing in the plight of a young girl's eviction. The narrative of this section is so well structured that it is obvious the journey of the mistress is complete by her exit. This allows the audience to invest in a single moment while also learning more about Eva and Peron's character as they move forward in the story.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{said that}} the {{statutory}} language incorporates all the refinements associated with the language, is a shorthand description of the worker's legal rights. The Court explained that if the petitioner's logic was used, {{there would be no}} stopping point because all contracts would have to spell out every intricacy of every term in the contract. Contracts would thus become massive, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> would be no real benefit from the increase in mass.

25|$|Solon's {{economic}} reforms {{need to be}} understood {{in the context of}} the primitive, subsistence economy that prevailed both before and after his time. Most Athenians were still living in rural settlements right up to the Peloponnesian War. Opportunities for trade even within the Athenian borders were limited. The typical farming family, even in classical times, barely produced enough to satisfy its own needs. Opportunities for international trade were minimal. It has been estimated that, even in Roman times, goods rose 40% in value for every 100 miles they were carried over land, but only 1.3% for the same distance were they carried by ship <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> is no evidence that Athens possessed any merchant ships until around 525 BC. Until then, the narrow warship doubled as a cargo vessel. Athens, like other Greek city states in the 7th Century BC, was faced with increasing population pressures and by about 525 BC it was able to feed itself only in 'good years'.|$|E

25|$|It is {{commonly}} {{said that the}} tune for Kol Nidre is missinai - unchanged since Moses climbed down from Mount Sinai - In the early 17th century, Rabbi Mordechai Jaffe of Prague, known as the Levush, mentioned that all cantors knew a set melody which was traditional for Kol Nidre. Jaffe was actually complaining that the widespread and solid adherence to this melody was hampering his efforts to introduce corrections into the lyrics. <b>And</b> <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> are probably no two synagogues in which the melody is chanted note for note absolutely the same. So marked is the variation {{in the details of}} the melody that a critical examination of the variants shows an approach toward agreement in the essentials of the first strain only, with transformations of the greatest diversity in the remaining strains. These divergences, however, are not radical, and they are no more than are inherent in a composition not due to a single originator, but built up and elaborated by many in turn, and handed on by them in distinct lines of tradition, along all of which the rhapsodical method of the hazzanut has been followed.|$|E

500|$|In mid-May, Woon {{commented that}} an acquitted person {{may not be}} guilty in law, but guilty in fact. Two months later, without {{referring}} directly to these remarks, Judge of Appeal V.K. Rajah wrote in a judgment that such comments could undermine confidence in the courts' verdicts and the criminal justice system, {{which was based on}} the doctrine of the presumption of innocence. The Minister for Law K. Shanmugam was asked in Parliament on 25 August 2008 to clarify the Attorney-General's comments. Shanmugam described the presumption of innocence as an [...] "important and fundamental principle" [...] which the Government was [...] "absolutely committed to upholding". Nonetheless, it was [...] "entirely possible for a person to have committed acts which amount to a crime <b>and</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>there</b> may be no conviction", as the trial process was designed to prove guilt and not innocence. He added: [...] "It is for the courts, and the courts alone, to exercise judicial power and decide the question of guilt, in a trial." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the CD-ROM based Saturn port, EGM {{commented that}} the {{graphics}} are identical to the arcade version but that there are missing sound effects and [...] "unbearable" [...] slowdown when first performing a special move. They rated it the best home version of the game to date but felt that with Mortal Kombat II having considerably aged by this point, any port needed to be near arcade perfect to stand out. Next Generation felt that the Saturn version was arcade perfect, but that the Mortal Kombat series {{as a whole was}} grossly overrated and lacked any gameplay innovations to make it stand out from other fighting games. They summarized that [...] "if you are a fan of the game (and you know who you are), then the Saturn version is everything you can hope for - an arcade-perfect translation - <b>and</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>there</b> is nothing outside of a flashy presentation and a little gore to recommend this game over a million others just like it." [...] Scary Larry of GamePro agreed that the Saturn port [...] "duplicates the arcade version perfectly", but argued that the slowdown and load times make the game frustrating to play. He concluded that the conversion would make a decent holdover until Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 hit the Saturn, but fails to measure up to Mortal Kombat 3 on the PlayStation. Sega Saturn Magazine was extremely disappointed with {{the final version of the}} Saturn port, calling it [...] "much worse than any of the versions seen on the cartridge format," [...] as opposed to the vastly superior pre-release version they had reviewed five months earlier.|$|E

[...] Here Madonna is a more human mother, with divinity only expressed through the halo. [...] The Christ child and Saint John are both children. [...] The painting is more reflective of natural circumstances. <b>And,</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>there</b> is a severity of this Madonna that will ease into a greater naturalness, such as the Alba Madonna slightly later into Raphael's Roman period.|$|E
2500|$|For Alexander {{to marry}} a {{daughter}} of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, <b>and</b> <b>yet</b> <b>there</b> was {{more to it than}} that. Alexander, says Arrian [...] "...wanted to be uncle to Hephaestion's children...". Thus it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.|$|E
2500|$|The {{manner in}} which nurses, physicians, patients, and administrators {{interact}} is crucial for the overall efficacy of a healthcare system. From the viewpoint of the patients, healthcare providers {{can be seen as}} being in a privileged position, whereby they have the power to alter the patients' quality of life. <b>And</b> <b>yet,</b> <b>there</b> are strict divisions among healthcare providers that can sometimes lead to an overall decline in the quality of patient care. When nurses and physicians are not on the same page with respect to a particular patient, a compromising situation may arise.
