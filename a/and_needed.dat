40|$|Background: Complex dentitions {{and decline}} in {{adequate}} oral hygiene in elderly {{may lead to}} poor oral health. This may have impact on their general health, wellbeing and quality of life. With increased longevity, the problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> in oral health of community dwelling elderly lead to changes in oral health care <b>needs.</b> We identified <b>and</b> prioritized problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> in oral health of community dwelling elderly. Methods: The problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> in oral health of community dwelling elderly were elicited during focus groups and interviews. The list of problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> derived thereof was presented to 97 elderly who prioritized these. Results: Overall, older people appeared {{to be satisfied with}} their current oral health, and the maintenance and care for their oral health. Cost of care was identified as a major problem in general. There are differences in current perceived problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> anticipated for the future. Perceived current problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> concern dental care provision and knowledge on oral health of professionals and patients. For anticipated future problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> the importance of daily oral care by caregivers was prioritised, while emphasis was placed on fear of losing autonomy. Conclusion: It is important to take the perspectives and expectations of elderly into account in policy and planning of future oral health care practice, because these differ from the perspectives of dental professionals...|$|R
