25|$|This {{sophisticated}} form of hazing {{was played}} out {{each year in}} September. This elaborate hoax often gained the cooperation of faculty members {{and people in the}} town. During Freshman Week, the first-year students were informed about several student romances on campus through planned gossip. The story went that there was one ardent couple who were constantly together when not in class, but the girl had another upperclassman admirer. The couple argued over the love triangle and it ended in the girl walking off with her new boy. After that, there were public acts that involved the two boys fighting. The affair was <b>all</b> <b>anyone</b> would talk about. Then on a certain pre-arranged night, all freshmen were ordered to stay in their rooms by student governing bodies. At 10 pm, a drunk ex-boyfriend appeared at the men's dorm. He brandished a gun and staggered through the halls in search of his rival. He finally found him in one of the public archways of the building. Soon, several shots rang out and the victim fell to the floor with blood (ketchup) flowing from his mouth. Other upperclassmen took charge, sending confused and panicked freshmen in pursuit of the killer or for a doctor. A town physician would appear and call for an ambulance, only adding to the theatrics of the evening. Most other freshmen were rounded up and sent in groups to nearby hospitals to offer their blood for transfusion, but were left stranded. At the same time, the freshmen girls witnessed the girl in the triangle see the unconscious victim being taken away and go into a fit of hysterics. During the 1930s, a member of the staff was a Justice of the Peace. He presided over a fake hearing in a large classroom where freshman girls tearfully testified to what they thought they saw happen on campus that night. It was during that hearing that the truth was revealed when the three main actors walked into the room, arm in arm. The next day, the freshmen felt young and foolish, but were looking forward to the next year when they were able to play the same prank on new freshmen. The tradition died in 1946, when its last performance narrowly escaped tragedy when some ex-servicemen studying at LVC under the G.I. Bill threatened {{to take care of the}} villain causing trouble between the lovers.|$|E

Not a few but [...] "hundreds of American Communists abetted Soviet espionage in the United States" [...] in the 1930s and 1940s. No modern government had been more thoroughly penetrated. Plus, {{only a tiny fraction}} of the Venona intercepts have been decrypted (about 3%), so no one knows the entire extent of the penetration. <b>All</b> <b>anyone</b> can know for sure is that the Soviet penetration into the United States government was massive.|$|E
500|$|Sorensen {{also felt}} {{that it would be}} strange to see Declan played by Mullally, saying: [...] "Of course it will be strange to see someone playing the part that I started and {{basically}} created, it's been my life. It's not just being Declan at the studio, I get 'Declan' on the street, at restaurants, everywhere. Declan is me so to hand it over is difficult." [...] He also felt humble that viewers thought the character would not be the same played by another actor, adding: [...] "I'm very humbled {{that a lot of people}} think that – I can understand why fans would feel that way because I starred as Declan for the past three years and that's <b>all</b> <b>anyone</b> knows." ...|$|E

Talking about the season finale, Barr said, [...] "S.H.I.E.L.D. does a most excellent job of standing on its own two feet in a way we've never seen it do before. Come the final frame, <b>all</b> <b>anyone</b> – Marvel fan or otherwise – will be asking is when season three begins. The note the show leaves viewers on is one that will make them realize, perhaps for the first time, that the journey of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is not only worth it now, but perhaps always has been." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be what happens in a guy's mind... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was <b>all</b> <b>anyone</b> cared about. That was not what I cared about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E

She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas. Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party," [...] where he has the first dance with April. When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: [...] "Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy. Who's to say what works? You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice, its <b>all</b> <b>anyone</b> can do." [...] At which point Leslie Knope replies [...] "Wait, weren't you married 3 times?" [...] To which Ron replies [...] "My God you're right. I get to burn another effigy." [...] In [...] "Eagleton," [...] Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch, and copies of his favorite movies.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{am not in}} any hurry for men. Norfolk Island {{has given}} me five young fellows from twenty-one to sixteen years of age, who already are very useful. One has been with me a year, another four months. They are given unreservedly into my hands, and already are working well into our school, taking the superintendence of our cooking, e.g., off our hands; with some help from us, they will be very useful at once as helpers on Mota, doing {{much in the way}} of gardening, putting up huts, &c., which will free us for more {{teaching}} work, &c., and they are being educated by us with an eye to their future employment (D.V.) as missionaries. I would not wish for better fellows; their moral and religious conduct is really singularly good- -you know their circumstances and the character of the whole community. But I should be thankful by-and-by to have men equally willing to do anything, yet better educated in respect of book knowledge. No one is ever asked to do what we are not willing to do, and generally in the habit of doing ourselves--cooking, working, &c., &c. But the Melanesian lads really do all this kind of work now. I have sixty mouths to fill here now; and Melanesian boys, told out week by week, do the whole of the cooking (simple enough, of course) for us all with perfect punctuality. I don't think any particular taste for languages necessary at <b>all.</b> <b>Anyone</b> who will work hard at it can learn the language of the particular class assigned to him. Earnest, bright, cheerful fellows, without that notion of [...] "making sacrifices," [...] &c., perpetually occurring to their minds, would be invaluable. You know the kind of men, who have got rid of the conventional notion that more self-denial is needed for a missionary than for a sailor or soldier, who are sent anywhere, and leave home and country for years, and think nothing of it, because they go [...] "on duty." [...] Alas! we don't so read our ordination vows. A fellow with a healthy, active tone of mind, plenty of enterprise and some enthusiasm, who makes the best of everything, and above all does not think himself better than other people because he is engaged in Mission work--that is the fellow we want. I assume, of course, the existence of sound religious principle as the greatest qualification of all. Now, if there be any young persons whom you could wish to see engaged in this Mission now at St. Mark's, or if you know of any such and feel justified in speaking to them, you will be doing a great kindness to me, and, I believe, aiding materially in this work.|$|E
