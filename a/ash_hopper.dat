In 1986, the Ohio Power Company, a subsidiary of American Electric Power (AEP), was awarded cofunding through the CCT program for the Tidd Pressure Fluidized Bed Combustor (PFBC) Demonstration Plant located in Brilliant, Ohio. The Tidd PFBC unit began operation in 1990 and was later selected as a test site for an advanced particle filtration (APF) system designed for hot gas particulate removal. The APF system was sponsored by the DOE Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) through their Hot Gas Cleanup Research and Development Program. A complementary goal of the DOE CCT and METC R&D programs has always been to demonstrate the environmental acceptability of these emerging technologies. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) have focused that commitment toward evaluating the fate of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) associated with advanced coal-based and hot gas cleanup technologies.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScFly ash is {{the major}} waste {{material}} produced by power plants in the combustion of coal to generate electricity. The main constituents of fly ash are Si, Al, Fe and Ca with smaller amount of S, Mn, Na, K, and traces of many other elements such as Co, Cd, As, Se, Zn, Mo, Pb, B, Cu and Ni. Fly ash is usually disposed either by dry or wet disposal methods. These disposal methods have raised major environmental concerns due to the potential leaching of chemical species from the ash heap by ingress of rainfall and brine used to transport the fly ash to the dam. This study focuses on the changes in chemical composition, morphology and mineral phases due to weathering, of coal fly ash co-disposed with brine over 20 years at Sasol Secunda ash dump in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. The design and operation of the Secunda ash dump presupposes that the ash dump may act as a sink for the salts which originated from chemicals used for normal operation in the plants. The majority of these salts come from the brines generated during desalination and raw water regeneration. The {{aim of this study}} is to ascertain if the ash dump could serve as a sustainable salt sink. Samples were drawn along the depth of two drilled cores (S 1 and S 3) from the weathered Secunda ash dump and analysed in conjunction with the fresh (unweathered) Secunda fly ash taken from the fly <b>ash</b> <b>hoppers</b> for comparative analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractive (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry were employed to obtain a detailed morphological, mineralogical and bulk chemical composition of all the samples. Pore water analysis was used to determine the pH, EC and moisture content of fly ash samples. A five step sequential chemical extraction procedure was used to establish the geochemical association of particular elements with various mineral phases. The total acid digestion test was also used to determine the total elemental compositions of the Secunda fly ash samples. The SEM results showed that the fly ashes consist of irregular and numerous spherically shaped particles. Changes (encrustations, etchings and corrosion) in the morphologies of the weathered ash particles were also observed. The XRD results revealed quartz, mullite, lime and calcite as the major mineral phases. Other minerals identified in very minor quantities in the drilled Secunda ash core that were dried prior to analysis were halite, kaolinite, nitratine, bassanite, microline. and hydrophitte. These phases may have formed during sample handling. XRF investigation revealed that the major oxides present in the dumped ash samples were SiO₂, A₂ 2 O₃, CaO, Fe₂O₃, MgO, Na₂O, TiO₂ and the minor elements present were K₂O, P₂O₅, SO₃ and MnO. The sum of the mean values of the % composition of SiO₂, Al₂O₃, and Fe₂O₃ was 70. 19 %, and 72. 94 % for the two drilled ash core samples (S 1 and S 3) respectively, and 78. 67 % for the fresh ash which shows the significant alteration of the Si, Al and Fe content in the ash matrix over time. The fly ash is classified as Class F using the ASTM C 618 standards. The loss on ignition (LOI) which is an indication of unburned carbon or organic content was 4. 78 %, 13. 45 % and 8. 32 % for the fresh ash, drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 respectively. The high LOI values for the drilled ash cores could indicate high hydrocarbon content in the ash dump because of co-disposal practises where hydrocarbon waste are included in the brine stream for disposal on the ash. While the ash samples from the surface appeared dry, moisture content (MC) analysis showed that there is considerable water entrained in the fly ash dump. The fresh ash MC was 1. 8 % while core S 1 ranged from 41. 4 – 73. 2 %; core S 3 ranged from 21. 7 – 76. 4 %. The variations in the MC values can be attributed to uneven flow paths due to inconsistent placement conditions or variations in ambient weather conditions during placement. The fresh fly ash (n= 3) had a pH of 12. 38 ± 0. 15, EC value of 4. 98 ± 0. 03 mS/cm and TDS value of 2. 68 ± 0. 03 g/L, the pH of the drilled ash core S 1 (n= 35) was 10. 04 ± 0. 50, the EC value was 1. 08 ± 0. 14 mS/cm and the TDS value was 0. 64 ± 0. 08 g/L. Core S 3 (n= 66) had pH of 11. 04 ± 0. 09; EC was 0. 99 ± 0. 03 and TDS was 0. 57 ± 0. 01. The changes in pH values can be attributed to the dissolution and flushing out from the dump basic alkaline oxides like CaO and MgO These variations in pH values shows that the fly ash is acidifying over time and metal mobility can be expected under these conditions. The large decrease of EC in the drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 compared to the fresh ash indicated a major loss of ionic species over time in the ash dump. The sequential extraction scheme revealed that the elements Al, Si, Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr, Fe, Mn, Na, K, As, Pb, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ni and Zn are present in Secunda fresh and weathered fly ash and are partitioned between the water soluble, exchangeable, carbonate, iron and manganese, and residual fractions of the coal fly ash. It also showed that the trace elements As, Pb, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ni and Zn do not show permanent association with particular mineral phases as a continuous partitioning between different mineral phases was observed in the weathered drilled core. Generally, all the elements had the highest concentration in the residual fraction. But it was evident that the labile phase (water soluble, exchangeable and carbonate fractions) had fairly high concentrations of Si (± 6. 5 %), Al (± 6. 5 %), Ca (± 10 %), Mg (± 5. 5 %), Ba (± 7. 5 %),Sr (± 7. 5 %), Na (± 12 %) and K (± 12 %) for the Secunda drilled ash core (S 1 and S 3) and fresh fly ash samples. This indicates that these species can leach easily upon water ingress and could pose a danger to the environment. Na and K had the highest concentrations leached out in the labile phase in all the ash samples. The amount of Na leached out of the drilled Secunda ash core in the labile phase was 13. 21 % of 18584. 26 mg/kg in the five geochemical phases of core S 1; and 9. 59 % of 11600. 17 mg/kg in the five geochemical phases of core S 3 while the fresh Secunda fly ash leached out 11. 28 % of 16306. 30 mg/kg of Na in the five geochemical phases. This study provided significant insight into the pore water chemistry, morphology, mineralogy and chemical composition and the elemental distribution pattern of the major and trace elements in the Secunda fly ash and weathered drilled Secunda ashm core S 1 and S 3. Though results from XRF analysis and the sequential extraction scheme shows that Na, K, S, Ca and Mg were slightly captured from the co-disposed brine by the Secunda fly ash, these species were however released in the labile phase. Hence there was no significant retention of these species in the ash dump. The amount of these species retained in the weathered ash were (0. 26 % and 0. 55 %) for Na, (0. 02 % and 0. 34 %) for K, (0. 08 % and 0. 06 %) for S, (0. 94 % and 0. 01 %) for Ca and (0. 37 % and 0. 96 %) for Mg in drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 respectively. This poor retention of Na K, S, Ca and Mg which are major components of Sasol Secunda brine in the drilled ash cores S 1 and S 3 clearly shows the unsustainability of the Secunda fly ash dump as a salt sink...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to evaluate the long-term feasibility of using activated carbon injection (ACI) options to effectively reduce mercury emissions from Texas electric generation plants in which a blend of lignite and subbituminous coal is fired. Field testing of ACI options was performed on one-quarter of Unit 2 at TXU's Big Brown Steam Electric Station. Unit 2 has a design output of 600 MW and burns a blend of 70 % Texas Gulf Coast lignite and 30 % subbituminous Powder River Basin coal. Big Brown employs a COHPAC configuration, i. e., high air-to-cloth baghouses following cold-side electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), for particulate control. When sorbent injection is added between the ESP and the baghouse, the combined technology is referred to as TOXECON{trademark} and is patented by the Electric Power Research Institute in the United States. Key benefits of the TOXECON configuration include better mass transfer characteristics of a fabric filter compared to an ESP for mercury capture and contamination of {{only a small percentage of}} the fly ash with AC. The field testing consisted of a baseline sampling period, a parametric screening of three sorbent injection options, and a month long test with a single mercury control technology. During the baseline sampling, native mercury removal was observed to be less than 10 %. Parametric testing was conducted for three sorbent injection options: injection of standard AC alone; injection of an EERC sorbent enhancement additive, SEA 4, with ACI; and injection of an EERC enhanced AC. Injection rates were determined for all of the options to achieve the minimum target of 55 % mercury removal as well as for higher removals approaching 90 %. Some of the higher injection rates were not sustainable because of increased differential pressure across the test baghouse module. After completion of the parametric testing, a month long test was conducted using the enhanced AC at a nominal rate of 1. 5 lb/Macf. During the time that enhanced AC was injected, the average mercury removal for the month long test was approximately 74 % across the test baghouse module. ACI was interrupted frequently during the month long test because the test baghouse module was bypassed frequently to relieve differential pressure. The high air-to-cloth ratio of operations at this unit results in significant differential pressure, and thus there was little operating margin before encountering differential pressure limits, especially at high loads. This limited the use of sorbent injection as the added material contributes to the overall differential pressure. This finding limits sustainable injection of AC without appropriate modifications to the plant or its operations. Handling and storage issues were observed for the TOXECON ash-AC mixture. Malfunctioning equipment led to baghouse dust hopper plugging, and storage of the stagnant material at flue gas temperatures resulted in self-heating and ignition of the AC in the <b>ash.</b> In the <b>hoppers</b> that worked properly, no such problems were reported.

Phases 3 through 5 consist of 200 -hour hot-gas filter tests under gasification conditions using the TRDU at temperatures of 540 - 650 {degrees}C (1000 - 1200 {degrees}F), 9. 3 bar, and face velocities of 1. 4, 2. and 3. 8 cm/s, respectively. The increased face velocities are achieved by removing candles between each test...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop and evaluate preliminary strength measurement techniques for high temperature candle filter ash deposits. The efficient performance of a high temperature gas filtering system is essential for many of the new thermal cycles being proposed for power plants of the future. These new cycles hold the promise of higher thermal efficiency and lower emissions of pollutants. Many of these cycles involve the combustion or gasification of coal to produce high temperature gases to eventually be used in gas turbines. These high temperature gases must be relatively free of particulates. Today, the candle filter appears to be the leading candidate for high temperature particulate removal. The performance of a candle filter depends on the ash deposits shattering into relatively large particles during the pulse cleaning (back flushing) of the filters. These relatively large particles fall into the <b>ash</b> <b>hopper</b> and are removed from the system. Therefore, these 1247 particles must be sufficiently large so that they will not be re-entrained by the gas flow. The shattering process is dictated by the strength characteristics of the ash deposits. Consequently, the {{objective of}} this research is to develop measurements for the desired strength characteristics of the ash deposits. Experimental procedures were developed to measure Young`s modulus of the ash deposit at room temperature and the failure tensile strain of ash deposits from room temperature to elevated temperatures. Preliminary data has been obtained for both soft and hard ash deposits. The qualifier ``preliminary`` is used to indicate that these measurements are a first for this material, and consequently, the measurement techniques are not perfected. In addition, the ash deposits tested are not necessarily uniform and further tests are needed in order to obtain meaningful average data...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe mineral carbonation, {{a process}} of {{converting}} CO 2 into stable minerals (mineralization), has been studied extensively to capture and store CO 2. However, most of the mineral carbonation studies have been largely investigated at lab scale. Preliminary and pilot scale studies for accelerated mineral carbonation (AMC) were conducted {{at one of the}} largest coal-fired power plants (2120  MW) in the USA by reacting flue gas with fly ash particles in a fluidized bed reactor. In the preliminary experiments, flue gas CO 2 and SO 2 concentrations decreased from 13. 0 to 9. 6 % and from 107. 8 to 15. 1  ppmv, respectively during the first 2  min. of reaction. The flue gas treatment increased mercury (Hg) concentration in fly ash (0. 1 to 0. 22  mg/kg) suggesting that fly ash particles also mineralized flue gas Hg. From these results, we designed and developed pilot scale process skid consisting — a moisture reducing drum (MRD) (0. 9 mΦ× 1. 8 m), a heater/humidifier (0. 9 mΦ× 1. 8 m), and a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) (0. 9 – 1. 2 mΦ× 3. 7 m) to capture and mineralize flue gas CO 2. Flue gas was withdrawn from the stack and was fed to the MRD at about 0. 094  m 3 /s. The MRD and the heater/humidifier pretreat flue gas before it enters the FBR. The MRD captures droplets of water entrained in the flue gas to protect the blower placed between the MRD and the heater/humidifier. The heater/humidifier enables control of flue gas moisture and temperature. Approximately 100 – 300  kg of fresh fly ash was collected from the electrostatic precipitator through <b>ash</b> <b>hopper</b> and placed in the fluidized-bed reactor. The fly ash particles were fluidized by flow of flue gas through a distributor plate in the FBR. The pilot scale studies were conducted at a controlled pressure (115. 1  kPa) by controlling the flue gas moisture content. The flue gas was continuously monitored to measure flue gas CO 2, SO 2 and NOx concentrations by an industrial grade gas analyzer, while the fresh and spent fly ashes were analyzed for calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), sulfur (S), and mercury (Hg) content. The pilot scale study results suggest that an appreciable amount of flue gas CO 2 and significant amounts of SO 2 and Hg can be directly captured (without separation) and mineralized by the fly ash particles...|$|E
