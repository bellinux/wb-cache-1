40|$|In {{this article}} we portray an inquiry into the {{problematic}} impact of the Chinese National Examination system on Chinese chemistry teaching and learning. The inquiry was conducted as a soulful autoethnography, illuminating the first‐hand experiences of a Chinese chemistry teacher struggling to reconcile contradictions between his humanistic ideals (of ‘loose’ teaching) and the technical forces (of ‘strict’ teaching) prevailing in his professional culture. This narrative inquiry yielded a mix of short stories <b>and</b> <b>reflective</b> <b>commentary.</b> In this article, selected stories present vignettes of the teacher's enactment of the national chemistry curriculum at critical periods early in his career. The article demonstrates the value of adopting soulful autoethnogaphy {{as a form of}} professional development, illustrating how multiple modes of inquiry can open up spaces for practical moral reflection (phronesis), soulful attunement (poesis) and contemplative thinking (theoria) which, taken together contribute to a loving praxis of transformative education. Consistent with the narrative representational form of the research, this article has a diachronic storied structure, which mirrors the process of the inquiry...|$|E
40|$|This {{special issue}} revisits and extends prior {{research}} {{work on the}} culture–learning interface. At {{the center of attention}} are the learning cultures of specific classrooms and workplaces as well as the situated identities of the teachers, students and professionals whose varied learning journeys are illuminated and carefully analyzed. The specific conceptual lenses guiding the inquiries are based on the sociocultural and ethnographic approaches to learning. The articles are thematically grouped into four categories, namely (a) inclusive learning communities—diverse modes of participation, (b) identity construction in multicultural classrooms, (c) hybrid learning across professional cultures, and (d) micro-analytic perspectives towards the study of meaning making in collaborative and communal learning activities. In sum, this international collection of empirical studies illuminates the reciprocal process of learning and cultural production in classroom settings and occupational networks. Moreover, it highlights multiple ways of investigating these processes at the local site and demonstrates how the local practices articulate with other communities of practice. The special issue ends by a critical <b>and</b> <b>reflective</b> <b>commentary</b> on the culture–learning interface from the perspective of teachers, students and learning contexts...|$|E

Specific findings suggest that participants may be better placed to comment on programme benefits "some time after completion" (Knight, 2006 : 5) and that participants' expectations of their PGCert programmes decreased over the period of study for the programme (Warnes, 2008 : 4). At the University of Northampton all academic staff new to teaching in H. E are required to successfully complete the PGCTHE {{as a condition of}} employment.

This phenomenological study explored pathways women took to advance in their careers and barriers that prevent more women from gaining senior administrative and leadership roles. Research questions addressed perceived barriers participants faced while trying to advance their careers, mentoring and other support strategies women in higher education employed to help them move up the career ladder, and actions female leaders took in order to help establish gender equity. Dambe and Moorad 2 ̆ 7 s empowerment-based/transformational leadership theory, Vroom 2 ̆ 7 s expectancy theory, and hooks 2 ̆ 7 s feminist theory were used as conceptual frameworks for this study.

40|$|In 1907 in Liverpool a ten {{year old}} boy was {{presented}} with an oboe. The significance of this seemingly ordinary act was to {{change the course of}} oboe playing in Great Britain. The boy’s name was Léon Goossens (1897 - 1988). Seventy years later at one of Goossens’ last solo performances I witnessed how he held a capacity audience spellbound by his playing and reminiscences. My practice-based study reassesses the impact and influence of Léon Goossens and considers his performing strategies (his unique use of tone colour, vibrato, rubato and tempo), his approach to programming and his central {{role in the development of}} the British oboe repertoire. Through a series of my own recordings <b>and</b> <b>reflective</b> <b>commentary</b> I suggest how it is possible to adapt Goossens’ distinctive interpretative ideas within the framework of modern-day performance practices. Two case studies are also presented, the Quintet for Oboe and Strings by Arnold Bax and Six Metamorphoses after Ovid for Solo Oboe Op. 49 by Benjamin Britten, in which I discuss their pedagogical performance traditions and illustrate how, by reflecting Goossens’ strategies, their respective narratives can be reconsidered and communicated more effectively. A thorough analysis of Goossens’ performance practice provides a clear understanding of his musicianship. Additionally the range of works with which he was associated as dedicatee, or as part of premiere performances is catalogued. To place Goossens’ contribution in context, preliminary chapters outline: • The oboe’s status at the turn of the twentieth century revealing polarised attitudes towards the instrument. • The correlation between the oboe’s progressive mechanisation and decline in popularity as a solo instrument during the late nineteenth century. • The advances of the French school of playing supported by the innovative developments of the oboe maker François Lorée (1835 - 1902). • Inconsistencies in previous accounts of Goossens’ biography are clarified. This study offers the modern-day oboist an alternative expressive platform to broaden their range of interpretative possibilities through adapting aspects of Léon Goossens’ style of playing. ...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{concerns}} {{of this study}} are certain aspects of narratorial voice in Eliot's novels, and how, through them, the narrator manoeuvres the reader into positions conducive to the "extension of sympathy" that Eliot wishes to inculcate in her readers, hoping, as she does, that sympathy aroused toward characters in the fictional world will, by extension, carry through to situations and people encountered in daily life. A multi-vocal narrative voice, full of variety of perspective and tone, is deployed to influence the response of the reader, and includes among its devices "engaging" narratorial strategies such as direct address, strategic use of personal pronouns, narrative metalepsis, invitations to the reader to superimpose his or her own "fabula" onto/into the story being read, <b>and</b> <b>reflective</b> prudential <b>commentary</b> that applies equally to the phenomenological world as {{to the world of the}} novel.

40|$|If {{we think}} of artists or photographers, {{it is easy to}} picture them {{carrying}} around large portfolios of their work. A Teaching/Learning Portfolio is very much like that. It’s a coherent set of materials that usually includes samples <b>and</b> connected <b>reflective</b> <b>commentary</b> about the work of teaching. A portfolio is an evidence-based description of one’s approach to teaching- a scholarly argument that presents a case for an instructor’s accomplishments and professional development. Teaching (and Learning) Portfolios help us explore our beliefs about what constitutes effective teaching. They help us answer the question of how we translate those beliefs into positive experiences for our students – in other words how the learning experiences we design expand the thinking and knowledge base of our students. In essence, the portfolio is a statement, with appropriate documentation, of one’s teaching responsibilities, philosophy, goals, methods, and accomplishments as a teacher Portfolios can be developed in hard copy or electronic formats. A typical process-oriented Teaching Portfolio includes major headings such as an instructor’s teaching responsibilities (the “what, when and where”), teaching philosophy (the “why”), and supporting evidence (the “how”).

The aim {{of this study was to}} explore musicians’ perceptions and experiences of using simulated performance environments. Nine conservatory students performed in two simulations, each with interactive virtual elements and vivid environmental cues: a recital with a virtual audience and an audition with virtual judges. Qualitative data were collected through a focus group interview <b>and</b> written <b>reflective</b> <b>commentaries.</b> Thematic analysis highlighted the musicians’ experiences in terms of (1) their anticipation of using the simulations, (2) the process of performing in the simulations, (3) the usefulness of simulation as a tool for developing performance skills and (4) ways of improving simulation training. The results show that while simulation was new to the musicians and individual levels of immersion differed, the musicians saw benefits in the approach for developing, experimenting with and enhancing their performance skills. Specifically, the musicians emphasised the importance of framing the simulation experience with plausible procedures leading to and following on from the performance, and they recognised the potential for combining simulation with complementary training techniques...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The thesis develops new understanding in relation to Outdoor Management Development (OMD). The argument is in three parts. Part One reviews notions of management development within which OMD is conventionally located. It underlines the powerful influence of a modernistic positivistic-objectivist methodological paradigm {{in much of the}} OMD commentary, manifesting itself as an objectivised corporate imperative of optimum effectiveness and efficiency. Complementary critical perspective paradigms are introduced including comments on narrative and social construction. In relation to this context, the argument presents a contemporary set of images sourced from prima facie conceptualisations of the OMD domain. Part Two considers possibilities for revisiting the contextualisation of OMD. This is undertaken through a contemporaneous and diachronic look at OMD. This involves a novel debate on the "origins" of OMD and comments on the neglected influences important to how individuals construct narrative. Certain narrative accounts in OMD writing are reviewed. These are shown to be very influenced by the predominant positivist paradigm. The third and final Part of the argument presents: Methodology, Stories and Conclusion. The debate develops a qualitative participant observer approach that facilitates the writing of narratives that underline the reflexive and deeply personal experience that the research involves. The Stories are accompanied by <b>reflective</b> <b>commentaries.</b> The argument concludes and contributes a number of points. The contemporaneous conceptualisation of OMD is positivistic and this is a consequence of its close association with modernistic perspectives of management thinking. Also, modernistic meta-narratives have been apparent in the historical accounts in the field. Consequently, stoned and narrative accounts have been marginalised but where written they are imbued with positivism also. Bearing the above in mind the thesis writes fresh socially constructive accounts of experiences in OMD contexts <b>and</b> provides <b>reflective</b> <b>commentary</b> on them...|$|R

40|$|While {{social work}} {{is now a}} {{recognised}} profession in 84 countries, it is an area which {{is still in its}} infancy in the developing world. In Vietnam, the process of developing the understanding and practice of social work is unfolding. One recent initiative has been the introduction of vocational qualifications in Care to the Vietnamese system of social services, an initiative with which the authors of this paper were centrally involved. This paper describes the authors' experience of introducing a vocational qualification into two of the country's key sites for care provision, namely Social Protection Centres and Communes (village communities). A new range of social need has been growing in Vietnam, alongside its rapid economic development. Care services such as Social protection Centres and Communes have found themselves under increasing pressure to respond to these needs.

40|$|This thesis seeksto {{investigate}} young people's {{perceptions of}} their own identities and how the media is used to shapetheir conceptions of self, with specific focus on the understandingsheld by young people themselves. The relationship between media and identity is explored through an examination of previous work on ethnic minority representation in the media, and considered in relation to how representations impact upon audience members' formulations of identities and their social worlds. Conceptualisations of the audience, and approaches employed within audience researchare critically evaluated, with particular reference to individuals' media consumption {{in the context of}} lived experience. A discussion of creative and visual methods within social research introduces the methodology undertaken as part of this study. Young people aged 13 to 14, of contrasting class and ethnic backgrounds, drawn from schools across Dorset, Hampshire and London were invited to create identity collages using media materials that expressed'how I see myself' and 'how I think other people seeme', and provided their own interpretations of this work within unstructured interviews. The III identity collages produced <b>and</b> accompanying <b>reflective</b> <b>commentaries</b> formed a body of data upon which the findings of this thesis are based. The analysis reveals that young people view their identities as complex, contradictory and diverse, and demonstrate a reflexive awarenessof their own sense of self as a phenomenon which is personally constructed, continually revised and displayed to others. The study highlights the importance of role models, and how individuals understand their own identities, more strongly than previous studies of young people and the media. It suggeststhat the media functions as a resource young people use to conceptualise and formulate their present identities, as well as articulate possible future selves.

40|$|Prediction {{of violent}} {{recidivism}} {{is an essential}} component of forensic in-patient assessment and treatment. The significant impact of violent recidivism upon individual victims, families and our wider society is clear. In addition, high numbers of re-admission, coupled with potential for prolonged periods of detention following revision of the Mental Health Act, present high financial costs to already limited High Secure services. With unacceptable levels of post discharge violent crime reported, increasing demand is seen for the identification of valid and reliable violence risk markers. However, recent violence risk research appears to have moved towards community follow-up studies, which hold limited utility for improvement of in-patient assessment and treatment. As such, this study set out to conduct violence risk marker research with males with Major Mental Illness in a High Secure hospital. Consideration of the existing violence risk marker research revealed positive yet inconsistent findings with regard to anger and neglect surrounding the study of frontal lobe deficits. The utility of two measures of frontal lobe ability, specifically related to reasoning and decision-making, in addition to anger expression and control, were investigated as violence risk markers for patients with Major Mental Illness. 39 male adult in-patients were assessed using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the second edition of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI- 2). Finally, participants’ scores on the Violence Risk Scale (VRS) were used to quantify predicted risk of violent recidivism. It was hypothesised that poorer performance on the frontal lobe measures, higher anger expression index scores and lower anger control scores, would be associated with higher violence risk scores. In addition, it was hypothesised that poorer performance on the frontal lobe measures would be associated with poorer outward anger control. Finally, it was hypothesised that these frontal lobe and anger variables would be found to be significant predictors of violence risk score. Correlational analysis revealed that the Anger Control-Out and Anger Expression indices from the STAXI- 2, as well as WCST total score, significantly correlated with Violence Risk Scale score in the hypothesised directions. Following linear multiple regression, WCST total score and the Anger Control-Out index score were found to significantly and independently contribute to the subsequent Violence Risk Scale predictive model [F(2, 36) = 8. 175, p <. 01]. Discussion embeds these findings within the context of previous literature. Strengths and limitations of this study are discussed, as well as suggestions made for future research directions. Recommendations are made for new frontal lobe screening procedures, as well as the modification or refinement of existent treatments. Finally, an extended paper is presented in complement to the journal paper. This contains additional information relating to the research context which was beyond the scope of the journal paper. Extended methodological factors are addressed, with additional findings provided. This extended paper concludes with further discussion offered <b>and</b> a <b>reflective</b> <b>commentary</b> drawing focus upon the research process.
