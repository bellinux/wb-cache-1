As {{a solution to this}} problem, speci c information is provided to the driver. The given information are road and tra c conditions, as well as detailed information about the neighboring vehicles. So that C 2 C communications will be necessary to communicate and share data with other vehicles. The development of C 2 C communications is increasing day by day, therefore several projects are and will be established. In Europe for example, there are a mount of projects working in di erent C 2 C communications applications. The aim is {{to reduce the number of}} tra c accidents with advanced preventive systems.

To achieve this objective, Ray-Tracing is used to simulate the wave propagation in order to analyze the di erent radio channel parameters.

40|$|The Cluster fleet {{offers the}} first {{possibility}} of comparing non-thermal terrestrial continuum radiation from similarly equipped nearby observation points. A very rich data set {{has already been}} acquired on the Cluster polar orbit, between 4 and 19 Earth radii geocentric distances, and preliminary analysis {{has been carried out}} on these emissions. We focus in this paper on direction finding performed from all four spacecraft as a means to locate the position of the sources of this continuum radiation. Directions are derived from spin modulation properties, under the usual analysis assumptions of the wave vector of the radiation lying in the plane containing the spin axis and the <b>antenna</b> <b>position</b> <b>at</b> electric field minimum. All the spin axes of the four Cluster spacecraft are aligned perpendicular to the ecliptic, thus the aligned spacecraft antenna spin planes provide redundant 2 -D views of the propagation path of the radiation and source location. Convincing 2 -D triangulation results have been obtained {{in the vicinity of the}} source region. In addition, the out of spin plane component of the wave vector reveals itself to a certain extent through directivity characteristics compared at different distances of the spin plane to the ecliptic. The four case events studied (two of them taken near apogee, the other two near perigee) have confirmed general properties derived from previous observations: trapping in the lower frequency range, radiation escaping into the magnetosheath region in the higher frequency range. All propagation directions are compatible with source positions in the plasmapause region, however, at a significant distance from the equator in one case. Our observations have also revealed new properties, like the importance of small-scale density irregularities in the local amplification of continuum radiation. We conclude that more detailed generation and propagation models are needed to fit the observations...|$|R

The mean height of the transmitter stack was 215 feet, which is why the topmost <b>antenna</b> was <b>positioned</b> <b>at</b> the same altitude in order to produce a reception pattern that was identical to the transmission. A set of motor-driven mechanical switches allowed the operator to select which antenna was active. The output of the selected antenna on all four towers was sent to a single radiogoniometer system (not Watt's own huff-duff solution). By connecting the antennas together in X-Y pairs the horizontal bearing could be measured, while connecting together the upper and lower antennas allowed the same goniometer to be used to measure the vertical angle.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{outlined}} problem, several complementary approaches having the potential to improve multiple moving target tracking in comparison with that of standard methods have been discussed. These approaches include the enhancement of the low-level echo of the targets, the radar <b>antennas</b> <b>positioned</b> <b>at</b> a convenient height, application of the UWB sensor network and, finally, their mutual combinations. As has been shown, each approach can provide some improvement of multiple target tracking. Weak echo enhancement and the proper location of the radar antenna array can be employed also by a single UWB sensor. However, {{the importance of the}} mentioned approaches lies particularly in their complementarity. That is, each approach contributes to the solution of the problem of multiple targets tracking in a different way. The enhancement of the low-level echo of the targets results in the increase of echo-to-clutter and noise ratio and hence better input for the target detectors. On the other hand, the radar antenna array location at the height or slightly above height of the target heads reduces the additional attenuation level due to shielding effect. Finally, the improvement provided by the UWB sensor network application is based on the diversity principle employed for monitoring of the area of interest by a set of properly located sensors. Moreover, these approaches are also implemented in the various successive phases of the mentioned radar signal processing procedure. As we can see, the total improvement of target tracking provided by the combination of all the discussed methods is greater than that of a simple union of the contributions of the particular methods. This statement has been confirmed by the results obtained for scenario 1 and scenario 2. Therefore, it can be concluded that the combination of the enhancement of the low-level echo of the targets, the optimized location of the radar antennas and UWB sensor network application represents a powerful tool for multiple moving persons tracking in a complex environment.|$|R

The results reached by single UWB sensors for such applications {{have shown that}} they are able to detect and track a person very well in a single person scenario. However, in multiple moving person scenarios, the ability of a single UWB sensor to detect several persons is usually significantly reduced. This is caused by a mutual shielding among people. In this paper, we will deal with the mutual shielding effect and its impacts, {{as well as with the}} methods of improving multiple moving person tracking by UWB radars. Firstly, we will provide a comprehensive description of the mutual shielding effect. Then, based on its analyses, we will state three complementary approaches created by the authors of this paper to reduce its impacts. They include an enhancement of the low-level echo of the targets, radar <b>antenna</b> array <b>positioning</b> <b>at</b> a convenient height, UWB sensor network application and, finally, their mutual combinations. The properties of those approaches will be demonstrated by two experimental measurements aimed at through wall tracking of two and three people, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{connected}} vehicle based approach {{to improve the}} throughput at signalized intersections and ultimately increase the mobility of a transportation system. Connected vehicle technology demonstrates tremendous potential for improving safety and mobility, as it enables the real-time sharing of vehicle data, including position, speed, acceleration, etc., not only among vehicles but also between vehicles and infrastructure. The proposed approach takes advantage of such real-time data to develop a strategy that maximizes throughput of an isolated intersection locally. Accordingly, the problem is formulated as a two-step centralized optimization. There are two main processes in this method: optimization for vehicles in motion, and optimization for stopped vehicles. The first step maximizes the intersection throughput of vehicles in motion using advisory acceleration. The second one minimizes the total delay of the stopped vehicles by adjusting the <b>positions</b> <b>at</b> which <b>vehicles</b> stop. A case study is also presented to show {{the efficiency of the}} proposed approach, which improves the traffic flow throughput of an isolated signalized intersection and reduces the total delay of all vehicles...|$|R
