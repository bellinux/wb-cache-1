40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects on plasma nitric oxide and fasting {{glycemia}} in neonates from pregnant rats exposed to cigarette smoke and nicotine, postnatally treated and untreated with vitamin C. Fifteen female Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups of five rats each. Group A was exposed to cigarette smoke in an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>chamber.</b> Group B received 0. 25 mg/kg body weight (BW) of nicotine while Group C served as control. After mating and gestation, litters from each group were randomly subdivided into two groups of 5 neonates each. Group A: A 1 and A 2, Group B: B 1 and B 2, Group C: C 1 and C 2. Groups A 1, B 1 and C 1 received 50 mg/kg BW Vitamin C for 4 weeks after birth while Groups A 2 and B 2 and C 2 did not. Plasma nitric oxide and fasting glycemia were estimated in blood samples obtained from these animals. Results showed that the neonates from animals exposed to cigarette smoke had a significantly higher nitric oxide concentration (21. 00 ± 1. 29 M) than those from not exposed ones (10. 75 ± 2. 95 M) and a significantly lower fasting glycemia (61. 00 + 2. 03 mg/dl) when compared with controls (75. 50 + 3. 73 mg/dl). In contrast, prenatal exposure to nicotine neither {{had a significant effect}} on nitric oxide concentration (12. 50 + 2. 10 M) nor on fasting glycemia (74. 17 + 3. 48 mg/dl) when compared with controls (10. 75 + 2. 95 M) and (75. 50 + 3. 73 mg/dl), respectively. While the effects of cigarette smoke shown here could not be attributed to the pharmacological activity of nicotine, they {{may be related to the}} formation of smoking induced oxidative free radicals, since the administration of an antioxidant as vitamin C reversed them...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Object of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} in detail, in vitro, the isolated mechanical effect of shear stress on an endothelial cells culture in a flow chamber under controlled fluid dynamical conditions. In this work a procedure was set to determine height variations and shear stress distribution over the cultured endothelial cell layer. The topology and the shear stress distribution are computed from µPIV measurements at several measurement planes close to the surface. An <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> flow <b>chamber,</b> suitable for culturing endothelial cells and equipped with an optical access for fluidic investigations, was designed. The µPIV measurements allowed to obtain the velocity fields of several planes parallel to the cell layer. Assuming a no-slip condition at the cell surface exposed to flow, the topography of the layer and the velocity gradient, hence the wall shear stress (assuming that the fluid of culture is Newtonian) can be determined. An optimization of the measurement procedure was performed using Monte-Carlo simulations and an evaluation of the uncertainty of the final measurement system is also presented. Furthermore results are presented from measurements taken on human endothelial cells subjected to a flow induced shear stress of 0. 6 Pa showing the cells topography and the wall shear stress on them...|$|R

All introduced protocols for <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks are based on different assumptions and security requirements, and are consequently suited for specific applications only.

We define two <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network categories, namely mobile <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks (MANETs) and smart sensor network, and discuss all further definitions and observations separately for both implementations. The main contribution of this report is the clear definition of properties, parameters, architectures, security requirements, and authentication models of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. Furthermore, we derive design goals for all protocols to be implemented in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. We also provide an extensive overview of present and future <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network applications, used standards, and proposed solutions. We believe that the authentication of network nodes {{and the establishment of}} secret keys among nodes are both target security objectives in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. The constrained devices and other special properties of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks make achieving those security properties a challenging task.

However, the size of connected <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> component scales linearly with λβ when it is lower than c 1 (λα) with probability nearly 1, which demonstrates a tremendous benefit of using base stations to enhance the connectivity of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> nodes.
