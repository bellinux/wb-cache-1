40|$|A new {{formulation}} of the finite-element method to analyze nonreciprocal waveguides in magneto-photonic crystals (MPCs) is proposed. Accurate solutions of light propagations for two different directions are obtained by the <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>input</b> condition. As numerical examples, {{the performance of a}} waveguide-type optical isolator in MPCs designed by the eigenmode analyses is confirmed by using this method. Subsequently, an effective way to enhance the nonreciprocity of the optical isolator is shown...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{propagation}} of a square wave signal in a quasi-periodically driven Murali-Lakshmanan-Chua (QPDMLC) circuit system. It is observed that signal propagation is possible only above a certain threshold strength of the square wave or digital signal and all the values above the threshold amplitude are termed as 'region of signal propagation'. Then, we extend this region of signal propagation to perform various logical operations like AND/NAND/OR/NOR and hence it is also designated as the 'region of logical operation'. Based on this region, we propose implementing the dynamic logic gates, namely AND/NAND/OR/NOR, which can {{be decided by the}} <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>input</b> square waves without altering the system parameters. Further, we show that a single QPDMLC system will produce simultaneously two outputs which are complementary to each other. As a result, a single QPDMLC system yields either AND as well as NAND or OR as well as NOR gates simultaneously. Then we combine the corresponding two QPDMLC systems in a cross-coupled way and report that its dynamics mimics that of fundamental R-S flip-flop circuit. All these phenomena have been explained with analytical solutions of the circuit equations characterizing the system and finally the results are compared with the corresponding numerical and experimental analysis.

40|$|The heat {{dissipation}} on the lateral {{surface of the}} cyclone chamber working volume with <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>input</b> and output of gases is considered in the present paper {{in contrast to the}} previously executed [1 – 10]. The relative values of input gas flow and the relative diameters of the outlet are different in each of the halves of the working volume. The {{heat dissipation}} by convection to the swirling airflow was studied by the method of variation of the aggregate state of the heating agent – water vapor slightly superheated (at 2 – 3 °С) condensation. Collecting the condensate produced from the work site through a water lock, providing maintaining of constant pressure in the calorimeter. The quantity of heat transmitted during the experiment was determined by the amount of collected condensate. In the experiments on the camera with two-sided asymmetric output relative gas outlet diameter {{on one side of the}} camera varied Relative diameter of the outlet on the other hand remained constant. In the experiences on the camera with the bilateral asymmetrical conditions for the introduction of gases the asymmetry of the introduction of flow was created due to a change in the relative entrance area whoo remained constant. Local heat transfer coefficient was determined for different values dimensionless longitudinal coordinate coinciding with the axis of the chamber, directed toward the outlet, measured from the middle section of the working volume. Еquations for calculation of heat transfer coefficients on the lateral surface of the howling cyclone chambers with unbalanced input and output gases, оbtained in this paper, give the satisfactory agreement of the calculated and experimental data that allows to recommend to their practical application. </p...|$|E

40|$|As {{beings with}} two eyes, humans use {{differences}} in each eye’s image, called disparities, to determine relative depth of visually perceived objects – {{a process called}} stereopsis. When disparities are small, a fused (or single) image is perceived. However, disparities become larger as depth between objects increases, resulting in objects widely separated in depth appearing double, known as diplopia. Blurring both eyes’ images expands the range of disparities for which single vision is experienced, and {{research has shown that}} asymmetrically blurring each eye’s image results in reports of binocular perception that are sharper than the blurrier image but not quite as sharp as the sharper image. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the effect of <b>asymmetrical</b> blur <b>inputs</b> on diplopia thresholds in real-world images, extending the paradigm to fundamental binocular fusion processes not investigated previously. Participants were shown 3 D stimuli, asymmetrically blurred at varying levels, depicting real objects and asked to make judgments about the appearance of diplopia at various depths. We expect that one of three hypotheses will be met: (1) diplopia thresholds will be determined by the sharpest content delivered to one eye; (2) diplopia thresholds will be determined by the blurriest content delivered to one eye; or (3) diplopia thresholds will be determined by a weighted average of the <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>inputs</b> delivered to each eye, occurring at an intermediate point between blurry and sharp content. Overall, diplopia thresholds did not vary with increasing asymmetrical blur, excluding an overall increase in thresholds at the highest asymmetrical blur level, therefore indicating support for the first hypothesis and in line with previous research. Implications of these findings, as well as reasons for this increase, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|High-performance, {{high-frequency}} operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) {{are very}} important elements {{in the design of}} high-frequency continuous-time integrated analog signal processing circuits, because resistors, inductors, integrators, mutators, buffers, multipliers, and filters can be built by OTAs and capacitors. The critical considerations for OTA design are linearity, tuning, frequency response, output impedance, power supply rejection (PSR) and common-mode rejection (CMR). For linearity considerations, two different methods are proposed. One uses cross-coupled pairs (CMOS or NMOS), producing OTAs with very high linearity but either the input range is relatively small or the CMR to <b>asymmetrical</b> <b>inputs</b> is poor. Another employs multiple differential pairs (current addition or subtraction), producing OTAs with high linearity over a very large input range. So, there are tradeoffs among the critical considerations. For different applications, different OTAs should be selected. For consideration of frequency response, the first reported GaAs OTA was designed for achieving very-high-frequency performance, instead of using AC compensation techniques. GaAs is one of the fastest available technologies, but it was new and less mature than silicon when we started the design in 1989. So, there were several issues, such as low output impedance, no P-channel devices, and Schottky clamp. To overcome these problems, new techniques are proposed, and the designed OTA has comparable performance to a CMOS OTA. For PSR and CMR considerations, a fully balanced circuit structure is employed with a common-mode feedback (CMF) circuit used to stabilize the DC output voltages. To reduce the interaction of the operation of CMF and tuning of OTAs, three improved versions of the CMF circuits used in operational amplifiers are proposed. With the designed OTAs, a I GHz GaAs inductor with small parasitics is designed using the proposed procedure to reduce high-frequency effects. Two CMOS high-order, high-frequency filters are designed: one in cascade structure and one in LC ladder form. Also, a 200 MHz third-order elliptic GaAs filter is designed with special consideration of very-high-frequency parasitics. All circuits were fabricated and measured. The experimental results were used to verify the designs...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{an advanced}} Hybrid Two-Phase Loop (HTPL) technology for electronics thermal management. The HTPL combined active mechanical pumping with passive capillary pumping realizing a reliable yet high performance cooling system. The evaporator {{developed for the}} HTPL used 3 -dimensional metallic wick structures to enhance boiling heat transfer by passive capillary separation of liquid and vapor phases. Through the testing using various prototype hybrid loops, it was demonstrated that the hybrid loops were capable of removing high heat fluxes from multiple heat sources with large surface areas up to 135 cm and 10 kW heat load. Because of the passive capillary phase separation, the hybrid loop operation didn’t require any active flow control of the liquid in the evaporator, even at highly transient and <b>asymmetrical</b> heat <b>inputs</b> between the evaporators. These results represent the significant advance over state-of-the-art heat pipes, loop heat pipes and evaporative spray cooling devices in terms of performance, robustness and simplicity...|$|R
40|$|The {{causes of}} able-bodied gait asymmetries are unclear. Mild (1 cm; n = 7). Statistically {{significant}} relationships were observed between LLI and the symmetry coefficient for knee joint moment (r = - 0. 48) and power (r = - 0. 51), and ankle joint moment (r = - 0. 41) and power (r = - 0. 42). Similarly, subjects with relatively large LLI exhibited significantly lower symmetry coefficients for knee joint moment (p = 0. 40) and power (p = 0. 35), and ankle joint moment (p = 0. 40) and power (p = 0. 22) than subjects with relatively small LLI. Degree of bilateral symmetry for knee and ankle joint kinetics {{appears to be}} related to LLI in able- bodied gait. This finding supports the idea that LLI is one cause of able-bodied gait asymmetries. Other factors, however, are also likely to contribute to these gait asymmetries; these may include other morphological asymmetries as well as <b>asymmetrical</b> neuromuscular <b>input</b> to the lower limb muscle...|$|R
50|$|Recent {{research}} (published March 2011) {{relying on}} serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) {{has led to}} identification of the circuitry that influences directional selectivity. This new technique provides detailed images of calcium flow and anatomy of dendrites of both starburst amacrine (SAC) and DS ganglion cells. By comparing the preferred directions of ganglion cells with their synapses on SAC's, Briggman et al. provide evidence for a mechanism primarily based on inhibitory signals from SAC's based on an oversampled serial block-face scanning electron microscopy study of one sampled retina, that retinal ganglion cells may receive <b>asymmetrical</b> inhibitory <b>inputs</b> directly from starburst amacrine cells, and therefore computation of directional selectivity also occurs postsynaptically. Such postsynaptic models are unparsimonious, and so if any given starburst amacrine cells conveys motion information to retinal ganglion cells then any computing of 'local' direction selectivity postsynaptically by retinal ganglion cells is redundant and dysfunctional. An acetylcholine (ACh) transmission model of directionally selective starburst amacrine cells provides a robust topological underpinning of a motion sensing in the retina.|$|R
40|$|An air Brayton solar {{receiver}} (ABSR) is discussed. The ABSR {{consists of}} a cylindrical, insulated, offset plate fin heat exchanger which is mounted at the focal plane of a fully tracking parabolic solar collector. The receiver transfer heat from the concentrated solar radiation (which impinges on the inside walls of the heat exchanger) to the working fluid i. e., air. The hot air would then e used to drive a small Brayton cycle heat engine. The engine in turn drives a generator which produces electrical energy. Symmetrical and <b>asymmetrical</b> solar power <b>input</b> into the ABSR are analyzed. The symmetrical cases involve the baseline incident flux and the axially shifted incident fluxes. The asymmetrical cases correspond to the solar fluxes that are obtained by reduced solar input from {{one half of the}} concentrator or by receiver offset of plus or minus 1 inch from the concentrator optical axis...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} how the histaminergic system is implicated in vestibular compensation, we studied the changes in histidine decarboxylase (HDC; the enzyme synthesizing histamine) mRNA regulation in the tuberomammillary (TM) nuclei of cats killed 1 week, 3 weeks and 3 months after unilateral vestibular neurectomy (UVN). We also used one- and two-step bilateral vestibular neurectomized (BVN) cats to determine whether HDC mRNA regulation depended on the <b>asymmetrical</b> vestibular <b>input</b> received by the TM nuclei neurons. In addition, we analysed the HDC mRNA changes in the TM nuclei and the recovery of behavioural functions in UVN cats treated with thioperamide, a pure histaminergic drug. Finally, we quantified binding to histamine H 3 receptors (H 3 Rs) in the medial vestibular nucleus (VN) {{by means of a}} histamine H 3 R agonist ([3 H]N-α-methylhistamine) in order to further investigate the sites and mechanisms of action of histamine in this structure. This study shows that UVN increases HDC mRNA expression in the ipsilateral TM nucleus at 1 week. This increased expression persisted 3 weeks after UVN, and regained control values at 3 months. HDC mRNA expression was unchanged in the one-step BVN cats but showed mirror asymmetrical increases in the two-step BVN compared to the 1 week UVN cats. Three weeks' thioperamide treatment induced a bilateral HDC mRNA up-regulation in the UVN cats, which was higher than in the untreated UVN group. Binding to histamine H 3 Rs in the MVN showed a strong bilateral decrease after thioperamide treatment, while it was reduced ipsilaterally in the UVN cats. That such changes of the histaminergic system induced by vestibular lesion and treatment may play a functional role in vestibular compensation is strongly supported by the behavioural data. Indeed, spontaneous nystagmus, posture and locomotor balance were rapidly recovered in the UVN cats treated with thioperamide. These results demonstrate that changes in histamine levels are related to vestibular compensation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} whether asymmetry in metric and topological spatial judgments could be attributed to the spatial frequency of the stimulus or the size of the attended receptive field. A left hemisphere advantage has been found for topological judgments and a right hemisphere advantage for metric judgments. This asymmetry has been attributed to <b>asymmetrical</b> processing of <b>input</b> conditions, namely size of attended receptive field (called the attentional bin) and spatial frequency of the stimulus. The larger a stimulus, the higher the proportion of low spatial frequencies, so large stimuli are thought to facilitate the extraction of lower spatial frequencies while small stimuli are thought to facilitate the extraction of higher spatial frequencies. A left hemisphere advantage has been reported for high spatial frequencies and small attentional bins and a right hemisphere advantage has been reported for low spatial frequencies and large attentional bins. A method for pitting asymmetrically distributed input conditions against each other using asymmetrically distributed tasks was developed. Three studies were conducted. In the first study, a lack of hemisphere effects suggested bilateral processing of the stimuli. Using an eye tracker, participants were easily able to saccade to the stimulus as was shown in Experiment 2. In Experiment 3, effective exposure duration was reduced so that unilateral viewing was ensured. Under these conditions, bin size and spatial frequency were not dissociable {{due to a lack of}} hemisphere effects for spatial frequency and because of task dependency for bin size and spatial frequency processing. Although the assumptions of the double double dissociation were not met, asymmetry in spatial judgments under conditions comparable to those used by Kosslyn et al. (1989) was attributable to a right hemisphere advantage for processing through small attentional bins...|$|R
