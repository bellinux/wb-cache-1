5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> were pro-communist.|$|E

In Bulgarian service, {{the submarine}} patrolled the Bulgarian Black Sea coast and had encounters with Russian vessels on several occasions. After the war ended, the submarine was surrendered to France in February 1919 and scrapped at Bizerta in August 1921. However, in July 2011 Viceadmiral Manushev, Commander of the Bulgarian Navy, announced that the submarine, discovered in 2010 at the sea bottom near the town of Varna, is UB-8.

Secretary of Health and Human Services, {{also known}} as the omnibus autism {{proceeding}} (OAP), was a court case involving the family of Michelle Cedillo, an autistic girl whose parents sued the United States government because they believed that her autism was caused by her receipt of both the measles-mumps-and-rubella vaccine ({{also known as}} the MMR vaccine) and thimerosal-containing vaccines. The omnibus proceeding required the petitioners to present three test cases for each proposed mechanism by which vaccines had, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> caused their children's autism; Michelle was the first such case for the MMR-and-thimerosal hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|The US media's {{links to}} Thảo {{have been the}} source of {{historical}} debate. The journalists' reporting of Diệm's authoritarian rule, military failures, and attacks on Buddhists shifted American public opinion and put pressure on Washington to withdraw support for the Ngô family and seek a change of leadership. William Prochnau felt that the fall of Diệm was the biggest influence of the media on American foreign policy in over six decades. Thảo and Phạm Xuân Ẩn had {{been the source of}} much of the media's information. Conservative revisionist historians have accused the media of bringing down Diệm by publishing reports that, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> were based on false data disseminated by communist propagandists to unfairly malign Diệm's rule, which they claim was effective and fair towards the Buddhist majority.|$|E

The names of Kalmashapada's children and the number of generations between Kalmashapada and Dasharatha varies. The Vishnu Purana, the Vayu Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, the Kurma Purana, and the Linga Purana contain a few variations of the names. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> Ashmaka was the son of Kalmashapada, and nine generations lie between Kalmashapada and Dasharatha. The Matsya Purana, the Agni Purana, the Brahma Purana, and the Harivamsa call Kalmashapada's son Sarvakarma (who {{is said to be the}} grandfather of Kalmashapada in the Vishnu Purana, et al.), but agree as to the number of generations with the Vishnu Purana, et al.

5|$|During the {{discussion}} about deregulation, Braathens SAFE considered several possibilities to strengthen itself. In particular, it had discussions with the large European airlines Lufthansa, British Airways and KLM about an alliance, but these were rejected by Braathens SAFE, stating that the agreements were all about getting traffic to the partner's hub. Minister of Transport, Kjell Opseth and director of SAS in Norway, Jan Reinås, both proposed a merger between Braathens SAFE and SAS, {{to ensure that the}} company had a 100% market share on the primary routes before the merger. This would, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> secure that no foreign company could compete with the merged company. The proposal was rejected by Braathens SAFE's management. Still, negotiations started between the companies in 1992, although they were quickly abandoned.

5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious {{explanations}} for Sellis's death, in which the Duke was to blame. Some stories had the Duke cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that the Duke was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards the Duke {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E

The construction of the mosque had not been cleared by the state government. Whether Nagpal was actually involved in the demolition of the wall, and whether she was justified in her actions even if she was, are disputed. Her supporters {{and most of the}} media sources claim that Nagpal did not order the demolition of the wall and was not even present at the site when the incident happened. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> she was targeted due to her campaign against illegal sand-mining, and allegations of Nagpal's involvement in the demolition are false.

A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E
5|$|As the laneway {{meant that}} the playing area was long and narrow, the young boys also {{had to learn to}} play the ball {{straight}} in accordance with orthodox cricket technique. The Harveys played another form of cricket in their concreted backyard (using a marble instead of a ball) that sharpened their reflexes, and a miniature bat. All were right-handed batsmen with the exception of Neil. All the siblings attended the nearby George Street State School and, one by one, the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens.

5|$|No Apatosaurus skull was {{mentioned}} in literature until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. They found that {{though he never}} published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that Apatosaurus had a Diplodocus-like skull. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> many skulls long thought to pertain to Diplodocus might instead be those of Apatosaurus. They reassigned multiple skulls to Apatosaurus based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Even though they supported Holland, {{it was noted that}} Apatosaurus might have possessed a Camarasaurus-like skull, based on a disarticulated Camarasaurus-like tooth found at the precise site where an Apatosaurus specimen was found years before. On October20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first true skull of Apatosaurus was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie. In 1998 it was suggested that the Felch Quarry skull that Marsh had included in his 1896 skeletal restoration instead belonged to Brachiosaurus. In 2011 the first specimen of Apatosaurus where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described. This specimen, CMCVP7180, was found to differ in both skull and neck features from A.louisae, but shared many features of the cervical vertebrae with A.ajax. Another well-preserved skull is Brigham Young University specimen 17096, a well-preserved skull and skeleton, with a preserved braincase. The specimen was found in Cactus Park Quarry in western Colorado.|$|E

Blumenfeld notes the objections that some of his university students raise when discussing Christian privilege as connected with the celebration of Christian holidays.
