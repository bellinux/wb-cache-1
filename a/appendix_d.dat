In comparison with Sandia's programs in technology and mission applications, however, Sandia's programs in fundamental science are small.

6000|$|It {{is known}} to every one that the {{privilege}} of complaint and petition, {{in cases where the}} Nation feels itself aggrieved, itself being the judge, (and who else ought to be, or can be?)--a privilege, the exercise of which implies condemnation of something complained of, followed by a prayer for its removal or correction--not only is established by the most grave and authentic charters of Englishmen, who have been taught by their wisest statesmen and legislators to be jealous over its preservation, and to call it into practice upon every reasonable occasion; but also that this privilege is an indispensable condition of all civil liberty. Nay, of such paramount interest is it to mankind, existing under any frame of Government whatsoever; that, either by law or custom, it has universally prevailed under all governments--from the Grecian and Swiss Democracies to the Despotisms of Imperial Rome, of Turkey, and of France under her present ruler. It must then be a high principle which could exact obeisance from governments at the two extremes of polity, and from all modes of government inclusively; from the best and from the worst; from magistrates acting under obedience to the stedfast law which expresses the general will; and from depraved and licentious tyrants, whose habit it is--to express, and to act upon, their own individual will. Tyrants have seemed to feel that, if this principle were acknowledged, the subject ought to be reconciled to any thing; that, by permitting the free exercise of this right alone, an adequate price was paid down for all abuses; that a standing pardon was included in it for the past, and a daily renewed indulgence for every future enormity.

6000|$|The {{summer days}} passed pleasantly in Heidelberg. We had a skilled trainer, and under his {{instructions}} {{we were getting}} our legs in the right condition for the contemplated pedestrian tours; we were well satisfied with the progress which we had made in the German language, [1. See <b>Appendix</b> <b>D</b> for information concerning this fearful tongue.] and more than satisfied with what we had accomplished in art. We had had the best instructors in drawing and painting in Germany--Haemmerling, Vogel, Mueller, Dietz, and Schumann. Haemmerling taught us landscape-painting. Vogel taught us figure-drawing, Mueller taught us to do still-life, and Dietz and Schumann gave us a finishing course in two specialties--battle-pieces and shipwrecks. Whatever I am in Art I owe to these men. I have something of the manner of each and all of them; but they all said that I had also a manner of my own, {{and that it was}} conspicuous. They said there was a marked individuality about my style--insomuch that if I ever painted the commonest type of a dog, I should be sure to throw a something into the aspect of that dog which would keep him from being mistaken for the creation of any other artist. Secretly I wanted to believe all these kind sayings, but I could not; I was afraid that my masters' partiality for me, and pride in me, biased their judgment. So I resolved to make a test. Privately, and unknown to any one, I painted my great picture, [...] "Heidelberg Castle Illuminated"--my first really important work in oils--and had it hung up {{in the midst of a}} wilderness of oil-pictures in the Art Exhibition, with no name attached to it. To my great gratification it was instantly recognized as mine. All the town flocked to see it, and people even came from neighboring localities to visit it. It made more stir than any other work in the Exhibition. But the most gratifying thing of all was, that chance strangers, passing through, who had not heard of my picture, were not only drawn to it, as by a lodestone, the moment they entered the gallery, but always took it for a [...] "Turner." ...|$|E

40|$|Gas turbine {{performance}} deterioration can {{negatively affect}} overall production capacity of {{power plants and}} cause major economic losses. Gas turbines deteriorate from fouling in the compressor section, and online washing is often applied to recover their performance. The success of online washing depends on site-specific issues, and current systems are inconsistent in use and their effectiveness is difficult to test. The objective of this work {{is to determine the}} fundamental mechanisms of axial compressor performance deterioration and recovery through online washing. Empirical data from online washing of RB 211 - 24 G at an offshore site were analyzed in the initial phase of research. Empirical data from accelerated salt deterioration and online water washing of a GE J 85 - 13 jet engine were unique to this project. First overall compressor deterioration and single stage performance deterioration were measured using inter-stage gas path instrumentation. Secondly, salt deposits were analyzed to characterize the stage surface roughness and fouling distribution. Finally, recovery through online washing was evaluated. Quasi-one-dimensional models were developed for the GE J 85 - 13 to aid in the test data analysis and to verify the applicability of deterioration loss models to fouled compressors. The study shows that detection of compressor deterioration can be hampered by nonlinear sensitivities to fouling. Engine control modes must be accounted for to avoid misreading the deterioration rate and production capacity. Flow rate was found as the most sensitive deterioration parameter in the GE J 85 - 13. Fouling affected all parts of the stage characteristics reducing flow, pressure and head. The models successfully reflected the deterioration mechanisms although the effects of deterioration were under-predicted. This study shows the importance of applying Reynolds corrections to deteriorated compressors. Online washing efficiency is predominantly affected by the water flow rate. Small droplets and low flow rates increase the fouling in the aft stages, and increased injection time cannot compensate for low flow rates. For effective water washing of the entire compressor section the recommended water-to-air ratio is between 0. 8 to 2 %.

Appendix 3 : File containing reference pattern for tet-EF cell Knn analysis described in figure 2. File is in. cls format, for use with the GeneCluster program. Appendix 4 a-d: Files containing reference patterns for small-round cell tumor analysis described in Figure 2. Files are in. cls format, for use with the GeneCluster program. Ewing’s sarcoma (4 a), Burkitt’s lymphoma (4 b), neuroblastoma (4 c), and rhabdomyosarcoma (4 d) patterns are included. Appendix 5 : Excel file containing the tet-EF dataset (from appendix 2) limited to those probes that are also represented on the cDNA microarray of Khan et al., 2001 Appendix 6 : Excel file containing the small-round cell data (of Khan et al. 2001) limited to those cDNAs that are also represented on the Affymetrix U 95 Av 2 microarray. Appendix 7 a-d: Excel files containing list of small-round cell tumor-specific genes as determined by Knn analysis and permutation testing (at the 1 % significance level), as described in appendix 1. The data is the output from the GeneCluster 2. 0 program, and as such includes the values from the permuation analysis. Each file also contains {{the list of the}} equivalent Affymetrix probe names, and additionally contains the list of overlap genes between each small-round cell tumor and the tet-EF cell data, as described in appendix 1. Ewing’s sarcoma (7 a), Burkitt’s lymphoma (7 b), neuroblastoma (7 c), rhabdomyosarcoma (7 <b>d).</b> <b>Appendix</b> 8 : Excel file containing the list of 117 upregulated genes in tet-EF cells following induction of EWS/FLI expression.
