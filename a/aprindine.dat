40|$|Four {{patients}} with supraventricular tachycardia {{associated with the}} Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome were refractory to conventional pharmacological therapy and received <b>aprindine</b> hydrochloride intravenously and orally. Electrophysiological studies disclosed that intravenous <b>aprindine</b> caused increased refractoriness and slowed conduction in the atria, atrioventricular node, ventricles, and accessory pathway. The ability to induce supraventricular tachycardia with timed atrial and ventricular premature stimuli was totally abolished in all 4 patients after intravenous <b>aprindine.</b> Oral <b>aprindine</b> therapy, twice daily thereafter, provided symptomatic relief of the supraventricular tachycardia without significant side effects. <b>Aprindine</b> is useful {{in the management of}} supraventricular tachycardia associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White and may offer significant advantages over currently available therapy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aprindine,</b> {{a potent}} {{anti-arrhythmic}} agent, occasionally seems responsible for agranulocytosis. In order to study its potential haematological toxicity, 3 different in vitro tests were used: (a) {{the capacity of}} human and mice bone marrow to incorporate tritiated thymidine (3 HTdR), (b) the capacity of stimulated human blood lymphocytes to incorporate 3 HTdR and (c) the capacity of human granulocyte-macrophage stem cells to form colonies in agar. For all these tests <b>aprindine</b> {{was found to be}} toxic at concentrations close to the clinical therapeutic serum concentration.

It was examined in the same tests in parallel with the study af <b>aprindine.</b> Moxaprindine also exhibited haematological toxicity in the tests but at a significantly higher concentration, approximately twice that of <b>aprindine.</b> Assuming that these in vitro tests are relevant to the in vivo haematological toxicity, moxaprindine could be considered a clinically safer anti-arrhythmic agent than <b>aprindine.</b> Comparative StudyJournal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Using the whole-cell {{voltage clamp}} technique, {{the effect of}} <b>aprindine</b> on Na+/Ca 2 + {{exchange}} current (INCX) was examined in guinea-pig single cardiac ventricular myocytes and CCL 39 fibroblasts expressing a dog cardiac Na+/Ca 2 + exchanger (NCX 1). INCX was recorded by ramp pulses from the holding potential of − 60 [*]mV with the external solution containing 140 [*]mM Na+ and 1 [*]mM Ca 2 +, and the pipette solution containing 20 [*]mM Na+, 20 [*]mM BAPTA and 13 [*]mM Ca 2 + (433 [*]nM free Ca 2 +). External application of <b>aprindine</b> suppressed INCX in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC 50 values of outward (measured at 50 [*]mV) and inward (measured at − 100 [*]mV) INCX components were 48. 8 and 51. 8 [*]μM with Hill coefficients of 1. 3 and 1, respectively. Intracellular application of trypsin via the pipette solution did not change the blocking effect of <b>aprindine,</b> suggesting that <b>aprindine</b> {{does not affect the}} exchanger from the cytoplasmic side. <b>Aprindine</b> inhibited INCX of a mutant NCX 1 with a deletion of amino acids 247 [*]–[*] 671 in the large intracellular domain between the transmembrane segments 5 and 6 in a similar manner to that of the wild-type, suggesting that the site of <b>aprindine</b> inhibition is not in the large intracellular domain of NCX 1. A kinetic study indicated that <b>aprindine</b> was cooperatively competitive with KB-R 7943, another inhibitor of NCX and that <b>aprindine</b> was a competitive inhibitor with respect to external Ca 2 +. We conclude that <b>aprindine</b> may modestly inhibit INCX in a therapeutic range of concentrations (around 2. 5 ∼ 6. 9 [*]μM) possibly at an external or intra-membranous site of the exchanger...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{mechanisms}} by which the class Ib antiarrhythmic drug <b>aprindine</b> shows efficacy against atrial fibrillation (AF), we {{examined the effects of}} the drug on the repolarizing K+ currents in guinea-pig atrial cells by use of patch-clamp techniques. We also evaluated the effects of <b>aprindine</b> on experimental AF in isolated guinea-pig hearts. <b>Aprindine</b> (3 [*]μM) inhibited the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK) with little influence on the inward rectifier K+ current (IK 1) or the Ca 2 + current. Electrophysiological analyses including the envelope of tails test revealed that <b>aprindine</b> preferentially inhibits IKr (rapidly activating component) but not IKs (slowly activating component). The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-operated K+ current (IK. ACh) was activated by the extracellular application of carbachol (1 [*]μM) or by the intracellular loading of GTPγS. <b>Aprindine</b> inhibited the carbachol- and GTPγS-induced IK. ACh with the IC 50 values of 0. 4 and 2. 5 [*]μM, respectively. In atrial cells stimulated at 0. 2 [*]Hz, <b>aprindine</b> (3 [*]μM) per se prolonged the action potential duration (APD) by 50 ± 4 %. The drug also reversed the carbachol-induced action potential shortening in a concentration-dependent manner. In isolated hearts, perfusion of carbachol (1 [*]μM) shortened monophasic action potential (MAP) and effective refractory period (ERP), and lowered atrial fibrillation threshold. Addition of <b>aprindine</b> (3 [*]μM) inhibited the induction of AF by prolonging MAP and ERP. We conclude the efficacy of <b>aprindine</b> against AF may be at least in part explained by its inhibitory effects on IKr and IK. ACh...|$|E

The present study aimed to investigate the electrophysiological mechanisms of the combined effects of bepridil and <b>aprindine.</b> MethodsSubjects consisted of 6 dogs without and 6 dogs with atrial rapid pacing (ARP) carried out at 400 bpm for 2 weeks. Bepridil was administered for 1 week in both groups (ARP dogs were administered bepridil in the second week). The electrophysiological effects of the intravenous administration of <b>aprindine</b> (1 mg/kg) were evaluated {{before and after the}} administration of bepridil. ResultsIn non-paced dogs, the atrial effective refractory period (AERP) became longer after the administration of bepridil (from 151 ± 10 ms to 170 ± 7 ms, p< 0. 05); however, no additional AERP prolongation was observed after the acute administration of <b>aprindine.</b> In ARP dogs, the AERP shortened with ARP for a week, and tended to lengthen after the administration of bepridil (from 93 ± 5 ms to 118 ± 9 ms, p= 0. 08). In these dogs, the acute <b>aprindine</b> administration did not prolong the AERP before the administration of bepridil, although it did after the administration of bepridil (from 118 ± 9 ms to 142 ± 8 ms, p< 0. 01).

40|$|Background: Approximately {{one-third of}} the {{patients}} undergoing cardiovascular surgery reportedly experience paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) during the postoperative period. However, the usefulness of antiarrhythmic drugs for preventing postoperative AF recurrence in the Japanese population has not been extensively studied. Methods: From a total of 118 patients who developed postoperative paroxysmal AF between April 2009 and March 2011, 72 patients (45 men, mean age 68 ± 8 years) requiring treatment for postoperative AF due to symptoms lasting ≥ 30  min were enrolled to prospectively investigate the efficacy of oral bepridil (100  mg/day, n= 37) or <b>aprindine</b> (40  mg/day, n= 35).

40|$|Intracellular {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} from rabbit atria, cardiac Purkinje cells and papillary muscles {{before and after}} exposure to various concentrations of indecainide. The effects of <b>aprindine</b> also were studied in the atrial preparations. Both drugs depressed the maximum rate of depolarization (MRD) in a dose-related manner, indecainide being approximately ten times more potent than <b>aprindine.</b> <b>Aprindine</b> caused a dose-related bradycardia, but indecainide had no significant effect on sinus node frequency. Indecainide had a dose-related negatively inotropic effect in normal, half-normal and twice-normal extracellular calcium concentrations. Indecainide shortened action potential duration (APD) in atrium and Purkinje cells but prolonged APD to 50 % repolarization in ventricular muscle. The actions of indecainide were extremely persistent. No significant recovery of MRD was observed after pauses in stimulation of up to 16 s. Indecainide {{had no effect on}} effective refractory period (ERP) measured by interpolated premature stimuli. Indecainide is therefore categorized as a Class 1 c antiarrhythmic agent. The effects of both <b>aprindine</b> and indecainide on MRD were increased in hypoxic atria.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to clarify the cardioprotective effects of various class I antiarrhythmic drugs, i. e., <b>aprindine,</b> disopyramide, flecainide, lidocaine, mexiletine, pentisomide and propafenone, on the ischemic heart. Sixty-one adult mongrel dogs were classified into eight groups according to premedication: 1) control group, physiologic saline solution was administered intravenously 25 min before left anterior descending coronary artery ligation; 2) <b>aprindine</b> group, 3 mg/kg body weight of <b>aprindine</b> intravenously; 3) disopyramide group, 2 mg/kg of disopyramide intravenously; 4) flecainide group, 2 mg/kg of flecainide intravenously followed by drip infusion of 100 μg/kg per min; 5) lidocaine group, 2 mg/kg of lidocaine intravenously followed by drip infusion of 100 gmg/kg per min; 6) mexiletine group, 3 mg/kg per min of mexiletine intravenously followed by drip infusion of 15 μ/kg per min; 7) pentisomide group, 5 mg/kg intravenously; and 8) propafenone group, 2 mg/kg intravenously. Arterial blood pressure and electrocardiogram were monitored throughout the experiment. Two hours after coronary occlusion, the heart was excised. Myocardial mitochondria were prepared and mitochondrial function (the respiratory control index and the rate of oxygen consumption in state 111) was measured polarographically. Fractionation of myocardial tissues was performed and the lysosomal enzyme (N-acetyl-β-glucos-aminidase and β-glucuronidase) activities among fractions were measured. No significant hemodynamic changes were observed compared with the control group except for those in the disopyramide and flecainide groups; that is, decrease in heart rate without changes in blood pressure compared with the control group was observed. All antiarrhythmic drugs effectively prevented the development of ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischemia. Two hours of coronary occlusion induced mitochondrial dysfunction and leakage of lysosomal enzymes. In contrast, each antiarrhythmic drug without exception lessened mitochondrial dysfunction and prevented the leakage of lysosomal enzymes concomitantly. These results indicate that class I antiarrhythmic drugs have cardioprotective effects on ischemic myocardium...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{intravenous}} administration of several quinidine-like antiarrhythmic drugs (bunaftine, monochloroacetyl ajmaline, lidocaine, mexiletine, disopyramide, <b>aprindine,</b> diphenylhydantoin, procainamide) on left ventricular performance, evaluated by systolic time intervals (STI), were studied in 100 patients with atherosclerotic heart disease. The STI were measured: the pre-ejection period (PEP), the isometric contraction time (ICT), the left ventricular ejection time (LVET), corrected LVET (LVETc), and the PEP/LVET ratio. The degree of impairment of left ventricular performance was maximal after <b>aprindine</b> and disopyramide administration. This was demonstrated by {{significant increases in}} the PEP, ICT, and PEP/LVET and by significant decreases in LVET and LVETc, in patients in both III-IV and I-II NYHA classes. Bunaftine, monochloroacetyl ajmaline, and lidocaine induced a less marked impairment of myocardial performance, since the PEP, ICT, and PEP/LVET increases were not significant compared to controls in patients in NYHA class I-II, and since no variation of LVET and LVETc were observed. Mexiletine effects on myocardial performance appear to be intermediate between these groups of drugs. Diphenylhydantoin and procainamide, considered separately because of their effects on heart rate and blood pressure which are not possessed by the other drugs, induced significant increases of PEP in NYHA class III-IV patients. However, {{the effects of these}} 2 drugs on myocardial performance may have been underestimated, due to the concomitant hemodynamic effect of these drugs...|$|E
40|$|Long QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS) is {{a disorder}} of the heart's electrical activity that infrequently causes severe ventricular arrhythmias {{such as a}} type of ventricular tachycardia called torsade de pointes (TdP) and ventricular fibrillation, which can be fatal. There have been no previous reports on the time-to-onset for LQTS based on data from spontaneous reporting systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the time-to-onset of LQTS according to drug treatment. We analyzed the association between 113 drugs in 37 therapeutic categories and LQTS including TdP using data obtained from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. For signal detection, we used the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Furthermore, we analyzed the time-to-onset data and assessed the hazard type using the Weibull shape parameter. The RORs (95 % confidence interval) for bepridil, amiodarone, pilsicainide, nilotinib, disopyramide, arsenic trioxide, clarithromycin, cibenzoline, donepezil, famotidine, sulpiride, and nifekalant were 174. 4 (148. 6 - 204. 6), 17. 3 (14. 7 - 20. 4), 52. 0 (43. 4 - 62. 4), 13. 9 (11. 5 - 16. 7), 69. 3 (55. 3 - 86. 8), 54. 2 (43. 2 - 68. 0), 4. 7 (3. 8 - 5. 8), 19. 9 (15. 9 - 25. 0), 8. 1 (6. 5 - 10. 1), 3. 2 (2. 5 - 4. 1), 7. 1 (5. 5 - 9. 2), and 254. 8 (168. 5 - 385. 4), respectively. The medians and quartiles of time-to-onset for <b>aprindine</b> (oral) and bepridil were 20. 0 (11. 0 - 35. 8) and 18. 0 (6. 0 - 43. 0) days, respectively. The lower 95 % confidence interval of the shape parameter β of bepridil was over 1 and the hazard was considered to increase over time. Our study indicated that the pattern of LQTS onset might differ among drugs. Based on these results, careful long-term observation is recommended, especially for specific drugs such as bepridil and <b>aprindine.</b> This information may be useful for the prevention of sudden death following LQTS and for efficient therapeutic planning...|$|E
40|$|Morbidity and {{mortality}} caused by schistosomiasis are serious public health problems in developing countries. Because praziquantel {{is the only}} drug in therapeutic use, the risk of drug resistance is a concern. In the search for new schistosomicidal drugs, we performed a target-based chemogenomics screen of a dataset of 2, 114 proteins to identify drugs that are approved for clinical use in humans that may be active against multiple life stages of Schistosoma mansoni. Each of these proteins {{was treated as a}} potential drug target, and its amino acid sequence was used to interrogate three databases: Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), DrugBank and STITCH. Predicted drug-target interactions were refined using a combination of approaches, including pairwise alignment, conservation state of functional regions and chemical space analysis. To validate our strategy, several drugs previously shown to be active against Schistosoma species were correctly predicted, such as clonazepam, auranofin, nifedipine, and artesunate. We were also able to identify 115 drugs that have not yet been experimentally tested against schistosomes and that require further assessment. Some examples are <b>aprindine,</b> gentamicin, clotrimazole, tetrabenazine, griseofulvin, and cinnarizine.

Methods: The effects of salicylate on class 1 antiarrhythmic agent-induced tonic and phasic block of the Na+ current (INa) of ventricular myocytes and the upstroke velocity of the action potential (Vmax) of papillary muscles were examined by both the patch clamp technique and conventional microelectrode techniques. Results: Salicylate enhanced quinidine-induced tonic and phasic block of INa at a holding potential of − 100 mV but not at a holding potential of − 140 mV; this enhancement {{was accompanied by a}} shift of the h∞ curve in the presence of quinidine in a further hyperpolarized direction, although salicylate alone did not affect INa. Salicylate enhanced the tonic and phasic block of Vmax induced by quinidine, <b>aprindine</b> and disopyramide but had little effect on that induced by procainamide or mexiletine; the enhancing effects were related to the liposolubility of the drugs. Conclusions: Salicylate enhanced tonic and phasic block of Na+ channels induced by class 1 highly liposoluble antiarrhythmic agents. Based on the modulated receptor hypothesis, it is probable that this enhancement was mediated by an increase in the affinity of Na+ channel blockers with high lipid solubility to the inactivated state channels...|$|E
40|$|Human beings {{suffer from}} two {{different}} kinds of fibrillations: one is atrial fibrillation (AF) {{and the other is}} ventricular fibrillation (VF). AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia and VF is the most serious. Pharmacological cardioversion with conventional class I antiarrhythmic drugs is usually little help in terminating long-lasting AF. However, bepridil, a multi-channel blocker, alone or in combination with <b>aprindine</b> restored the sinus rhythm in about 70 % of patients. The average time to conversion was one month, and cardioversion was associated with a significant increase in fibrillation cycle length. After cardioversion, atrial contraction recovered within one week, and sinus rhythm was maintained better than after conventional electrical cardioversion. Pharmacological cardioversion of long-lasting AF with bepridil could become a new therapeutic option targeting remodeled atria. Patients with idiopathic VF have a characteristic J wave and ST elevation along with a lower QT-RR slope and short QT interval at slower heart rates. Although an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the most reliable therapy for idiopathic VF, both bepridil and disopyramide normalized repolarization dynamics (slope of the QT-RR relationship) and reduced the frequency of spontaneous VF episodes and ICD shocks. Pharmacological therapy for cardioversion of persistent AF and prevention of idiopathic VF may {{play a key role in}} improving not only quantity but also quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Background: Class I {{antiarrhythmic}} {{drugs can}} promote {{the organization of}} atrial fibrillation (AF) and sometimes converts AF into atrial flutter (AFL) concomitant with difficulty of rate control. We studied the usefulness of Bepridil, which exhibits a class III-like effect, for class I drug-induced AFL in patients with paroxysmal AF. Methods: The study population consisted of 17 consecutive patients (15 men, mean age 65 ± 8 years) with AFL converted from paroxysmal AF following oral treatment of class IA or IC antiarrhythmic agents including pilsicainide (n = 8), cibenzoline (n = 5), flecainide (n = 2), <b>aprindine</b> (n = 1), and propafenone with cibenzoline (n = 1). After the occurrence of AFL, class I drug was replaced by bepridil with a dose of 100 – 200 mg per day in all patients. Results: After the treatment with bepridil, 15 (88 %) out of the 17 patients restored sinus rhythm after 1 to 68 days (average of 21 days). In 12 (80 %) of the 15 patients, sinus rhythm was maintained {{for an average of}} 23. 6 months (range of 1 to 62 months) follow-up period. Although torsade de pointes was not recognized, a marked QT prolongation (0. 60 sec) was observed in one patient during the administration of bepridil at a daily dose of 200 mg. In this patient, QT interval was normalized (0. 45 sec) after reduction of bepridil to 150 mg daily. Conclusion: Bepridil treatment may be safe and effective for class I drug-induced AFL in patients with paroxysmal AF to restore and maintain sinus rhythm as an alternative therapy for catheter ablation. However, the QT interval must be carefully monitored during this medication...|$|E
40|$|One {{possible}} {{mechanism of}} action of the available K-channel blocking agents used to treat arrhythmias is to selectively inhibit the HERG + MIRP channels, which carry the rapid delayed rectifier outward potassium current (I-Kr). These antiarrhythmics, like sotalol, dofetilide and ibutilide, have been classified as Class III antiarrhythmics. However, {{in addition to their}} beneficial effect, they substantially lengthen ventricular repolarization in a reverse-rate dependent manner. This latter effect, in certain situations, can result in life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes). Selective blockers (chromanol 29313, HMR- 1556, L- 735, 821) of the KvLQT 1 + minK channel, which carriy the slow delayed rectifier potassium current GO, were also considered to treat arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AF). However, I-Ks activates slowly and at a more positive voltage than the plateau of the action potential, therefore it remains uncertain how inhibition of this current would result in a therapeutically meaningful repolarization lengthening. The transient outward potassium current (I-to), which flows through the Kv 4. 3 and Kv 4. 2 channels, is relatively large in the atrial cells, which suggests that inhibition of this current may cause substantial prolongation of repolarization predominantly in the atria. Although it was reported that some antiarrhythmic drugs (quinidine, disopyramide, flecainide, propafenone, tedisamil) inhibit I-to, no specific blockers for I-to are currently available. Similarly, no specific inhibitors for the Kir 2. 1, 2. 2, 2. 3 channels, which carry the inward rectifier potassium current (I-kl), have been developed making difficult to judge the possible beneficial effects of such drugs in both ventricular arrhythmias and AF. Recently, a specific potassium channel (Kv 1. 5 channel) has been described in human atrium, which carries the ultrarapid, delayed rectifier potassium current (I-Kur). The presence of this current has not been observed in the ventricular muscle, which raises the possibility that by specific inhibition of this channel, atrial repolarization can be lengthened without similar effect in the ventricle. Therefore, AF could be terminated and torsades de pointes arrhythmia avoided. Several compounds were reported to inhibit I-Kur (flecainide, tedisamil, perhexiline, quinidine, ambasilide, AVE 0 118), but none of them can be considered as specific for Kv 1. 5 channels. Similarly to Kv 1. 5 channels, acetylcholine activated potassium channels carry repolarizing current (I-KAch) in the atria and not in the ventricle during normal vagal tone and after parasympathetic activation. Specific blockers Of I-KAch can, therefore, also be a possible candidate to treat AF without imposing proarrhythmic risk on the ventricle. At present several compounds (amiodarone, dronedarone, <b>aprindine,</b> pirmenol, SD 3212) were shown to inhibit I-KAch, but none of them proved to be selective. Further research is needed to develop specific K-channel blockers, such as I-Kur and I-KAch inhibitors, and to establish their possible therapeutic value...|$|E
