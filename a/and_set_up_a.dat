5|$|Between the 5th and 8th centuries, new {{peoples and}} {{individuals}} filled the political void left by Roman centralised government. The Ostrogoths, a Gothic tribe, settled in Roman Italy {{in the late}} fifth century under Theoderic the Great (d. 526) <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> kingdom marked by its co-operation between the Italians and the Ostrogoths, {{at least until the}} last years of Theodoric's reign. The Burgundians settled in Gaul, and after an earlier realm was destroyed by the Huns in 436 formed a new kingdom in the 440s. Between today's Geneva and Lyon, it grew to become the realm of Burgundy in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. Elsewhere in Gaul, the Franks and Celtic Britons set up small polities. Francia was centred in northern Gaul, and the first king of whom much is known is Childeric I (d. 481). His grave was discovered in 1653 and is remarkable for its grave goods, which included weapons and a large quantity of gold.|$|E
