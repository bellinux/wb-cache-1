50|$|In 2008 Victor {{launched}} the PL8000 printing calculator. The PL8000 contained many industry firsts including an alphanumeric display, <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>printer,</b> Prompt Logic guides for the user, Loan Wizard, personalized text messages, reprint key, and HELP key. The PL8000 {{was also the}} fastest and quietest printing calculator available at that time.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{development}} and optimization of a fluorometric reaction rate method for {{the determination of}} aluminum is described. Modifications to existing instrumentation permit automatic monitoring and reporting of measurement conditions. Automatic correction of measured analytical signals is provided if monitored parameters deviate from optimum values. A computer controlled standard addition procedure was developed to permit rapid analysis of samples when quenching or strong matrix absorption interferes with normal measurements. The rate of formation of the fluorescent aluminum chelate of 2, 4, 2 ' - trihydroxyazobenzene - 5 ' - sulfonic acid is measured and related to the concentration of aluminum. The technique exhibits a detection limit of 0. 12 ng/mL and a large linear dynamic range over four orders of magnitude. A thorough interference study was conducted and no serious interferences were discovered which would preclude {{the use of the}} method in analyses of natural waters. The technique was successfully applied to an analysis of NBS spinach leaves and to a river water sample. Modifications to the existing fluorometric reaction rate instrument include the addition of a pH probe and meter and a temperature probe and meter interfaced to a KIM microcomputer through a multiplexed analog-to-digital converter. In addition, an automatic injector was modified and installed on the instrument to provide automated standard additions. The existing KIM singleboard microcomputer was enhanced by additional memory, I/O capability and BASIC software plus a CRT terminal and an ASCII serial <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>printer.</b> Separate computer programs were developed for general analyses and for standard addition measurements. Software was developed with the intention of providing a highly automated system in which measurement parameters are monitored and reported and all data collection and manipulation is performed automatically. Software correction of analytical signals is shown to improve measurement precision by a factor of four when reaction mixture temperatures vary over 1. 05 Â°C, and by more than an order of magnitude when reaction mixture pH varies over 0. 28 pH units. Improved measurement accuracy results from software correction of measured signals: a measurement error of 40...|$|E
40|$|Report {{describes}} small {{test set}} which interrogates solar-energy data acquisition systems. Lightweight, portable set includes microcomputer with keyboard, <b>alphanumeric</b> display, <b>printer,</b> cassette recorder/player for storing programs and data, and cable for connection to Site Data Acquisition System (SDAS). Unit is operated by BASIC program and Assembly language. Report is specific to DOE/NASA application yet contains general information {{to assist in}} designing similar units...|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{improvements}} of the 709 {{over the}} previous 704 involved more magnetic core memory and apparently the first use of independent I/O channels. Whereas I/O on 704 is a programmed function of the central processor - data words are transferred to or from the I/O register, one at a time, using a [...] "copy" [...] instruction - the 709 uses the IBM-766 Data Synchronizer, which provides two independently [...] "programmed" [...] I/O channels. Up to three Data Synchronizers can be attached to a 709, each able to control up to 20 IBM 729 tape drives and an IBM 716 <b>alphanumeric</b> line <b>printer,</b> IBM 711 card-reader and 721 card punch. This allows six times as many I/O devices on 709, and allows I/O to proceed on multiple devices while program execution continues in parallel. Up to two IBM 733 Magnetic Drum units, each with 8,192 words of memory, could be attached independently from the Data Synchronizers. The 709 could initially load programs (boot) from card, tape or drum.|$|R
50|$|The {{calculator}} can {{be programmed}} to request input from the user, and output results of calculations to the <b>printer.</b> <b>Alphanumeric</b> text (64 characters total, including space, 0-9, A-Z and 25 punctuation and mathematical symbols) can be output as well as numbers. A limited ability to plot graphs is provided. The printer is also valuable for program development because it can produce a hard copy of the calculator's program including the alphanumeric mnemonics instead of just the numeric codes normally visible on the display, {{as well as a}} dump of the data registers, a trace of the program's execution and other information about the program.|$|R
