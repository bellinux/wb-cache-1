40|$|Background: Hepatitis B and {{schistosomiasis}} {{are most}} prevalent in Africa and Asia, and co-infections of both are frequent in these areas. The immunomodulation {{reported to be}} induced by schistosome infections might restrict immune control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) leading to more severe viral infection. Vaccination {{is the most effective}} measure to control and prevent HBV infection, but there is evidence for a reduced immune response to the vaccine in patients with chronic schistosomiasis japonica. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this paper, we demonstrate in a mouse model that a chronic Schistosoma japonicum infection can inhibit the immune response to hepatitis B vaccine (HBV vaccine) and lead to lower production of <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies,</b> interferon-c (IFN-c) and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2). After deworming with Praziquantel (PZQ), the level of <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> gradually increased and the Th 2 -biased profile slowly tapered. At 16 weeks after deworming, the levels of <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> and Th 1 /Th 2 cytokines returned to the normal levels. Conclusions/Significance: The results suggest that the preexisting Th 2 -dominated immune profile in the host infected with the parasite may down–regulate levels of <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> and Th 1 cytokines. To improve the efficacy of HBV vaccination in schistosome infected humans it may be valuable to treat them with praziquantel (PZQ) some time prior to HBV vaccination...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Vaccination {{with the}} major surface antigen of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBsAg) induces <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> production and level of 10 IU/L is considered protective. It {{has been shown that}} the level of <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> does wane after vaccination. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the persistence of anti-HBs antibodies in healthy Iranian children 10 years after primary vaccination. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 146 children, 10 years after completion of primary hepatitis B vaccination course at birth. The sera were tested for <b>anti-HBs,</b> <b>antibody</b> to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and HBsAg by use of ELISA technique. Results: At 10 years after primary vaccination, 70 (47. 9 %) children had protective levels of antibody (anti-HBs> 10 IU/L) with mean titer of 68. 1 IU/ml. Moreover, 45 (30. 82 %) children were negative for <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody.</b> Distribution of children according to anti-HBs concentration revealed that the proportion of subjects with antibody titer of 0 - 10 IU/L, 10 - 100 IU/L, 100 - 500 IU/L and 500 - 1000 IU/L was 52. 1 %, 24. 6 %, 20. 5 % and 2. 7 %, respectively. All children were negative for HBsAg, although anti-HBc was positive in 11 (7. 5 %) children. There was no difference in the seroprotection rates of males and females. Conclusion: The results of present study show that after 10 years after primary vaccination with recombinant HB vaccine, 47. 9 % of the children had protective levels of <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody.</b> On basis of the HBsAg and anti-HBc results, it seems that effective immunological memory exists in children.

40|$|Background: Three {{doses of}} the investigational AS 02 (v) -adjuvanted {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) vaccine HB-AS 02 {{have been shown to}} induce more rapid seroprotection and higher <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> concentrations in patients with renal insufficiency than four doses of FENDrix (TM) (HB-AS 04), an adjuvanted HBV vaccine licensed in Europe for use in this population. This study evaluated persistence of immune response up to 36 mo after primary vaccination. Results: At Month 36, 89. 5 % of subjects in the HB-AS 02 group and 72. 6 % of those in the HB-AS 04 group had <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> concentrations >= 10 mIU/ml. <b>Anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> concentrations were >= 100 mIU/ml in 82. 9 % and 35. 5 % of subjects, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{standard}} three-dose {{schedule of}} hepatitis B vaccines is frequently not completed, especially in adolescents. A primary study has confirmed the equivalence of a two-dose schedule of an Adult formulation of hepatitis B vaccine [Group HBV_ 2 D] to a three-dose schedule of a Paediatric formulation in adolescents (11 - 15 years) [Group HBV_ 3 D]. This follow-up study evaluated the five year persistence of antibody response and immune memory against the hepatitis B surface (anti-HBs) antigens {{five years after}} completion of primary vaccination. Methods A total of 234 subjects returned at the Year 5 time point, of which 144 subjects received a challenge dose of hepatitis B vaccine. Blood samples were collected yearly and pre- and post-challenge dose to assess <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> concentrations. Results At the end of five years, 79. 5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 71. 7 - 86. 1) and 91. 4 % (95 % CI: 82. 3 - 96. 8) of subjects who received the two-dose and three-dose schedules, respectively had <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL.

40|$|Previously, we {{constructed}} a humanized antibody (HuS 10) that binds {{to the common}} a antigenic determinant on the S protein of HBV. In this study, we evaluated its HBV-neutralizing activity in chimpanzees. A study chimpanzee was intravenously administered with a single dose of HuS 10, followed by intravenous challenge with the adr subtype of HBV, while a control chimpanzee was only challenged with the virus. The result showed that the control chimpanzee was infected by the virus, and thus serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) became positive from the 14 th to 20 th week and actively acquired serum anti-HBc and <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> appeared from the 19 th and 23 rd week, respectively.

40|$|The {{structure}} of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBs) recognized by <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> was analyzed by western blotting using anti-HBs sera obtained from normal subjects, from rabbits immunized with purified HBs and commercially available goat serum. The HBs used had 7 components of 24 K, 27 K, 33 K, 36 K, 39 K, 43 K and 67 - 72 K daltons. Goat anti-HBs serum bound {{all of these}} components, while human and rabbit anti-HBs sera bound only two components (60 K and 54 K daltons), which were hardly visible in the gel even by silver staining. Mixing the 24 K and 27 K components, and the 24 K and 43 K components without reducing reagent produced several polymerized forms of HBs components including 60 K and 54 K polypeptides, which were recognized by anti-HBs rabbit serum. Other combinations of HBs components did not yield any new polymeric forms. Thus, {{it was concluded that}} the formation of <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> in normal subjects might predominantly require an antigenic {{structure of}} polymeric forms of specific combinations of HBs polypeptides, other than previously known antigenic determinants...|$|E

40|$|The surface {{envelope}} protein of hepatitis B virus (HBsAg) stimulates {{the immune system}} to produce <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> and to generate cell-mediated immunity.

The mutation of the A beta molecule seems to affect the immune responses differentially. On the other hand, C 3 H or CBA mice produced <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> after major S protein (pre-S-depleted HBsAg) stimulation, but could not generate the hypersensitivity responses. The pre-S region could circumvent the non-responsiveness of the hypersensitivity response in C 3 H and CBA mice.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, {{we have identified}} endonexin II (E-II) on human liver plasma membranes as a specific, Ca(2 +) -dependent, small hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) -binding protein. In this article, we describe the spontaneous development of <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> in rabbits immunized with native or recombinant human liver E-II and in chickens immunized with the F(ab') 2 fragment of rabbit anti-human liver E-II immunoglobulin G. Anti-HBs activity was not observed in rabbits immunized with rat liver E-II. Cross-reactivity of anti-E-II antibodies to HBsAg epitopes was excluded, since anti-HBs and anti-E-II activities can be separated by E-II affinity chromatography. The existence of an anti-idiotypic antibody is further demonstrated by competitive binding of human liver E-II and this antibody (Ab 2) to small HBsAg, suggesting that Ab 2 mimics a specific E-II epitope that interacts with small HBsAg. In addition, it was demonstrated that <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> developed in rabbits after immunization with intact human liver E-II or in chickens after immunization with F(ab') 2 fragments of rabbit anti-human liver E-II immunoglobulin G recognize the same epitopes on small HBsAg. These findings strongly indicate that human liver E-II is a very specific small HBsAg-binding protein and support the assumption that human liver E-II is the hepatitis B virus receptor protein...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of {{high doses of}} hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine (HB vaccine) were injected {{for the prevention of}} maternal infant transmission of hepatitis in 185 infants whose mothers were hepatitis B carriers. Except for 9 patients who had intrauterine infection before birth, 176 infants recieved the first injection of HBIG within 48 hours after birth. These infants were protected from any perinatal transmission, and later underwent HB vaccination. As a results, the 176 cases were classified into a group of good responders, poor responders and non responders. The good responders were the infants who acquired the <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> easily by vaccination, and the poor or non responders were the infants who had difficulty in producting the <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> inspite of frequent vaccinations. This study was to compare the group of poor or non responders with the group of good responders in terms of some of the cellular immunity. Results: 1) Poor or non responders could be infected with HBV {{due to the lack of}} active immunization. In order to prevent the HBV infection in poor or non responders, continuation of HBIG injection was required every two to three months. 2) In vitro lymphoproliferative responses to PHA-P, Con-A, PWM, PPD or Cytomegalovirus antigen in peripheral lymphocytes were normal in all three groups. The response to HBsAg was significantly decreased in the poor or non responder groups. 3) The effector cells for HBsAg consisted mainly of T lymphocytes. These were classified as the T 4 subset (helper/inducer T) which expressed TAC antigen (IL- 2 receptor) by the stimulation with HBsAg. 4) From these results, the deficient production of the <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> and the low response to in vitro lymphoproliferative activity to HBsAg in poor or non responders were specific immunological dysfunctions for HBsAg...|$|E

40|$|Long-term {{protection}} against hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{is dependent on}} persistence of anti-HBs antibodies and/or strong immunological memory. In this study we evaluated the persistence of anti-HBs antibodies in healthy Iranian children 5 years after primary vaccination and the response to a booster dose using recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. Totally, 81 children who had received primary course of hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 1. 5 and 9 months of age were included in this study. A booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine was administered at 5 years after completion of primary vaccination program. Children were tested for <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> just before administration of booster dose and at 4 weeks after booster vaccination. An 81. 5 % seroprotection rate (anti-HBs > 10 IU/L) was observed 5 years after primary vaccination. After administration of booster dose, 100 % of the children developed protective level of <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibody</b> and geometric mean titer rose from 206 IU/L to 1278 IU/L. These results indicate {{the existence of an}} effective immunological memory over a period of 5 years after primary vaccination with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in healthy Iranian children...|$|E
40|$|A 60 -year-old {{woman with}} end stage liver {{cirrhosis}} caused by genotype 2 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection received an or-thotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The patient was negative for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and {{positive for the}} anti-hepatitis B surface <b>antibody</b> (<b>anti-HBs)</b> prior to and {{one and a half}} months following the OLT. Due to reactivation of hepatitis C, treatment with interferon-alpha and Ribavi-rin started two months following the OLT and resulted in a sustained virological response. We performed a liver biopsy because a biochemical response was not achieved. Surpris-ingly, liver pathology showed HBsAg-positive hepatocytes with a lobular hepatitis feature, which had been negative in the liver biopsy specimen obtained one and a half months post-OLT. High titers of both HBsAg and HBeAg were detected, while <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> were not found. Tests for IgM anti...|$|R
40|$|Objectives : Protective vaccinations are {{the most}} {{effective}} method of prevention of type B virus hepatitis. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine whether in children receiving immunosuppressive therapy due to inflammatory systemic connective tissue diseases the protective concentration of the <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> produced after vaccination against type B virus hepatitis in infancy is maintained. Material and methods : The concentration of <b>anti-HBs</b> <b>antibodies</b> was assessed in the sera of 50 children with inflammatory connective tissue diseases – 37 girls (74 %) and 13 boys (26 %), aged 1. 5 – 17. 5 years – during the immunosuppressive treatment, which lasted at least 6 months. The control group consisted of 50 healthy children – 28 girls (56 %) and 22 boys (44 %) aged 2 – 17 years. All children were vaccinated in infancy with Engerix B vaccine according to the 0 – 1 – 6 months schedule. The antibody concentration of ≥ 10 mIU/ml in patients is regarded as protective. Results: No protective antibody concentrations were found in 25 cases (50 %) in the group of diseased children and only in 2 children in the control group (4 %). Conclusions : The concentration of vaccine-induced antibodies should be assessed in children with inflammatory systemic connective tissue diseases and, in case of the absence of a protective concentration, revaccination should be started. The use of glucocorticosteroids, synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs is no contraindication to vaccination against hepatitis B...|$|R
40|$|The major {{hydrophilic}} region (MHR) {{of hepatitis}} B surface antigen (HBsAg) harbors conformational B-cell epitopes {{and is the}} major target of neutralizing <b>antibodies</b> to HBsAg (<b>anti-HBs).</b> Mutant HBsAg (mtHBsAg) with amino acid substitutions such as G 145 R is known to affect the binding of specific <b>anti-HB</b> <b>antibodies</b> and their detection by conventional diagnostic assays. In the present study, we focused {{on the role of}} the amino acid positions 120 to 123, which are around MHR 2 according to the spectrum of recently identified, naturally occurring mtHBsAg. Strikingly, the amino acid substitution K 122 I abolished the reactivity of HBsAg in all immunoassays tested so far. Also, mtHBsAg G 145 R could be clearly detected with four different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that were based on monoclonal <b>anti-HB</b> <b>antibodies</b> (MAbs) with high affinity. Positive immunofluorescence staining of mtHBsAg K 122 I was achieved only by polyclonal anti-HBs, while all MAbs tested failed. mtHBsAg T 123 N showed a low reactivity in immunoassays and appeared to be secretion defective. The amino acid substitution P 120 T reduced the binding of anti-HBs but did not completely prevent the detection of mtHBsAg by anti-HB MAbs. The testing of naturally occurring mtHBsAg confirmed that the presence of amino acid substitutions within the region of 120 to 123 is strongly associated with impaired detection in immunoassays. In conclusion, MHR 2 is essential for HBsAg antigenicity, a fact that has not been recognized before...|$|R
