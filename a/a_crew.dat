Shackleton Energy Company is building a program to establish operations on the south pole of the Moon to harvest water and supply their Propellant Depots. NASA began to plan to resume crewed missions following the call by U.S. President George W. Bush on 14 January 2004 for <b>a</b> <b>crewed</b> mission to the Moon by 2019 and the construction of a lunar base by 2024. The Constellation program was funded and construction and testing begun on <b>a</b> <b>crewed</b> spacecraft and launch vehicle, and design studies for a lunar base. However, that program has been cancelled in favor of <b>a</b> <b>crewed</b> asteroid landing by 2025 and <b>a</b> <b>crewed</b> Mars orbit by 2035.

5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in <b>a</b> <b>crew</b> is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E
