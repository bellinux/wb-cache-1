5|$|Cycle detection, {{the problem}} of {{following}} a path in a functional graph to find <b>a</b> <b>cycle</b> in it, has applications in cryptography and computational number theory, as part of Pollard's rho algorithm for integer factorization and as a method for finding collisions in cryptographic hash functions. In these applications, ƒ is expected to behave randomly; Flajolet and Odlyzko study the graph-theoretic properties of the functional graphs arising from randomly chosen mappings. In particular, a form of the birthday paradox implies that, in a random functional graph with n vertices, the path starting from a randomly selected vertex will typically loop back on itself to form <b>a</b> <b>cycle</b> within O(√n) steps.

Others have observed that the [...] "Venus Table" [...] in the Dresden Codex, is an accurate ephemeris for predicting Venus positions. Others have also observed a basis for the 260-day cycle in the agricultural cycle of highland Guatemala, which is also about 260 days. Aveni notes that [...] "the average duration between successive halves of the eclipse season, at 173 ½ days, fits into the tzolkin in the ratio of 3 to 2." [...] This may seem contrived, but the Maya did employ the tzolkin to predict positions of Venus and eclipses.|$|R
