25|$|The {{first of}} the new characters, A.C.

500|$|According to Dannemann, by 3 p.m. {{they had}} left the {{apartment}} to use a bank.

He also briefly spoke with his ex-girlfriend Kathy Etchingham, inviting her to visit him at his hotel that evening at 8 p.m.; she declined the invitation due to prior engagements and later admitted that she had [...] "regretted it ever since". Hendrix and Dannemann then went to a Chelsea antiques market, where Hendrix purchased more clothing. After another stop to buy writing paper, which he used to compose his final lyrics, Dannemann and Hendrix drove to his suite at the Cumberland Hotel, meeting Devon Wilson as she walked down King's Road. Hendrix asked Dannemann to stop the car {{so that he could}} get out and talk with Wilson, who invited Hendrix to a party that evening.

500|$|Whitney Phaneuf {{from the}} website HitFix {{described}} {{the scene where}} the singer is seen sweeping the table as [...] "one of her best diva moments". She also interpreted her character as a [...] "scorned" [...] woman and neglected wife. Similar sentiments were offered by Brenna Ehrlich of MTV News who felt that the man's role in the video was a neglectful and possibly cheating lover. Ehrlich went on to describe the mansion seen {{in the beginning of}} the video as Versailles-esque and felt that the singer unveiled her new alter ego, Yoncé, while seen at the party in a bar, flirting with other people. She concluded that despite the [...] "emotional turmoil" [...] featured throughout, the video ended on a hopeful note. John Walker, writing for the same publication, noted the singer managed to show real madness and jealousy, while [...] "smashing up her home out of insecurity". A more mixed review came from Brent DiCrescenzo of the magazine Time Out who wrote in his review, [...] "Walking down the street in <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jacket.</b> A car racing down roads at night.

Consequently, it became the first project from Hollywood Records to be released under the [...] "day-and-date" [...] format, which allowed the project to be released nearly simultaneously worldwide instead of traditionally [...] "staggering" [...] its launch to accommodate [...] "the availability of the artist" [...] internationally. On May 7, Cyrus unveiled the album artwork through her website; it depicts Cyrus dressed in <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jacket,</b> pants, and midriff-baring shirt while standing against a black-and-white background. It was noted for establishing an increasingly provocative public image for Cyrus; her stylist Simone Harouche stated that it was inspired by singer Joan Jett and the band Blondie, and was [...] "basically a strong statement saying in the most simple way, that she can’t be tamed–literally and metaphorically." [...] A deluxe version of the record was simultaneously released, which included the audio disc packaged with the standard version in addition to a bonus DVD that includes previously unseen footage from Cyrus' performance at The O2 Arena during the Wonder World Tour.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins at}} a formal party in which Spears {{seems to be}} looking for someone.

[...] During questioning, Bayliss gets angry and loses his cool with Novoselic slamming the leather-clad, multi-pierced freak against the wall telling him that if he doesn't start giving them some answers, he is gonna slap some cuffs on him, take him downtown and knock him around' whereby Novoselic responds by telling Bayliss, 'If you do that, I might have to kiss you!'. [...] Pembleton calms Bayliss and they leave. [...] While driving, Bayliss claims to be disgusted by the sexual taboos, but Pembleton insists everybody has a darker side and that until Bayliss recognizes his own, his virtues can never truly be tested. Pembleton and Bayliss return to the S fashion store and ask about leather belts with bead patterns matching the marks on Angela's neck. Store owner Tanya (Adrienne Shelly) tells them Angela's neighbor Jeremy (Scott Nielson) has a jacket with a matching belt. After an interrogation, Jeremy confesses to choking and accidentally killing Angela with the belt during quirky and violent (but consensual) sex. As a thank you for solving the case, Tanya brings Bayliss <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> <b>jacket</b> as gift, which he reluctantly accepts. That night, Bayliss visits Baltimore's red light district wearing the jacket, as a way to test himself as Pembleton suggested. He is approached by a prostitute but rejects her, thus passing the test.|$|E
