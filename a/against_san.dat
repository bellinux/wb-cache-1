5|$|In August 2006, Rosický {{was made}} {{captain of the}} Czech Republic {{national}} side, replacing the retiring Pavel Nedvěd {{in advance of the}} UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying process.

The game finished 7–0 to the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wild}} card playoffs, the Giants built a 38–14 3rd-quarter lead <b>against</b> <b>San</b> Francisco. However, the 49ers rallied, scoring a field goal, and three touchdowns to take a 39–38 lead with a minute left in the game. Collins then drove the Giants down to the 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds left, setting up a {{potential}} game winning 41-yard field goal attempt for Matt Bryant. On the final play of the game, 40-year-old long snapper Trey Junkin — {{who had just been}} signed for this playoff game — snapped the ball low, and punter Matt Allen could not spot the ball properly for the attempt. Allen picked the ball up and threw an unsuccessful pass downfield to offensive lineman Rich Seubert as time expired, and the Giants lost 39–38.|$|E
5|$|Josefson {{participated in}} the {{pre-season}} camp with the Devils in September, but was assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Albany Devils after the camp. Josefson was called up to the Devils on 14 October 2010, and made his NHL debut the next day, in a 3–2 victory against Colorado Avalanche at the Prudential Center. Josefson was slashed on {{his left hand and}} later fell on the same hand during the game <b>against</b> <b>San</b> Jose Sharks on 27 October, this caused a ligament in his thumb to tear, and forced him to undergo surgery. At last, Josefson returned from his injury on 7 January 2011, when the Albany Devils played against the Charlotte Checkers. Josefson scored his first NHL goal against Al Montoya of the New York Islanders on 12 March 2011.
