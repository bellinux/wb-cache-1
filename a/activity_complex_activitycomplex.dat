40|$|North-south {{asymmetry}} of sunspot activity {{resulted in}} an asynchronous reversal of the Sun's polar fields in the current cycle. The asymmetry is also observed {{in the formation of}} polar coronal holes. A stable coronal hole was first formed at the South Pole, despite the later polar-field reversal there. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand processes making this situation possible. Synoptic magnetic maps from the Global Oscillation Network Group and corresponding coronal-hole maps from the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope aboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory are analyzed here to study a causal relationship between the decay of <b>activity</b> <b>complexes,</b> evolution of large-scale magnetic fields, and formation of coronal holes. Ensembles of coronal holes associated with decaying active regions and <b>activity</b> <b>complexes</b> are presented. These ensembles take part in global rearrangements of the Sun's open magnetic flux. In particular, the south polar coronal hole was formed from an ensemble of coronal holes that originated after the decay of multiple <b>activity</b> <b>complexes</b> observed during 2014.

40|$|The {{large amount}} of {{magnetic}} flux cycling through an <b>activity</b> <b>complex</b> {{in a period of}} six months suggests that the azimuthal magnetic field in the convective zone of the sun is not less than 3000 Gauss and probably is considerably more. A field of 3 kiloGauss or more has the effect of blocking the convective heat transport, producing a cool shadow above the azimuthal field and causing heat to accumulate below. The incremental weight of the cool shadow is sufficient to overpower the magnetic buoyancy, pressing the field against the bottom of the convective zone. The accumulation of heat underneath produces a thermal relaxation oscillation that erupts to the surface at intervals of the order of a week, supplying the intermittent emergence of magnetic flux observed in the <b>activity</b> <b>complex...</b>|$|R

40|$|Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) binds {{microorganisms}} via {{interactions with}} glycans {{on the target}} surface. Bound MBL subsequently activates MBL-associated serine protease proenzymes (MASPs). A role for MBL in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection had been indicated by previous studies examining MBL levels and polymorphisms in relation to disease progression and response to treatment. We undertook this study to investigate a possible relationship between disease progression and functional MBL/MASP- 1 <b>complex</b> <b>activity.</b> A functional assay for MBL/MASP- 1 <b>complex</b> <b>activity</b> {{was employed to examine}} serum samples from patients with chronic HCV infection, non-HCV liver disease and healthy controls. Intrapatient consistency of MBL/MASP- 1 <b>complex</b> <b>activity</b> levels was assessed in sequential samples from a subgroup of patients. Median values of MBL/MASP- 1 <b>complex</b> <b>activity</b> were higher in sera from patients with liver disease compared with healthy controls. MBL/MASP- 1 <b>complex</b> <b>activity</b> levels correlate with severity of fibrosis after adjusting for confounding factors (P = 0 · 003). MBL/MASP- 1 <b>complex</b> <b>activity</b> was associated more significantly with fibrosis than was MBL concentration.

40|$|Background: Previous studies {{suggested}} that cell energetics are altered by malnutrition. Objective: We hypothesized that nutritional manipulations influence mitochondrial enzyme {{activities of the}} electron trans-port chain in both skeletal muscle and blood mononuclear cells. Design: After a gastrostomy tube was inserted, 44 rats were ran-domly assigned to 1 of 4 experimental groups: control fed (CF; 364 kJ/d for 7 d), hypoenergetic fed (HF; 92 kJ/d for 7 d), hypoenergetic protein refed (HPR; 92 kJ/d for 7 d and then 129 kJ/d for 1 d), and hypoenergetic glucose refed (HGR; 92 kJ/d for 7 d and then 129 kJ/d for 1 d). The protein and glucose contents of the liquid formulas were different for the HPR and HGR groups. After mitochondria were isolated from the soleus muscle, the <b>activities</b> of <b>complexes</b> I–IV were measured spectrophoto-metrically. Because {{of the lack of}} available tissue, only the activ-ity of complex I was measured in the mononuclear cell extract. Results: The recovery of <b>complex</b> <b>activities</b> in the CF and HF groups was not significantly different in the mitochondrial frac-tion of the soleus muscle. Compared with that in the CF group, the <b>activities</b> of <b>complexes</b> I–III in the mitochondrial fraction of the soleus muscle and the <b>activity</b> of <b>complex</b> I in mononuclear cells were significantly lower in the HF group. The <b>activities</b> of <b>complexes</b> I–III in the mitochondrial fraction of the soleus mus-cle and the <b>activity</b> of <b>complex</b> I in mononuclear cells were significantly higher in the HPR than in the HF group. The activ-ity of complex IV was generally not affected by nutritional manipulations.

40|$|Observations {{of the sun}} {{show that}} the {{magnetic}} flux of the large <b>activity</b> <b>complexes</b> emerges in localized sites in brief bursts at intervals of many days or a few weeks. The quantity of flux arriving at the surface suggests that the mean aximuthal field of the sun in the lower convective zone {{is not less than}} 3000 G and may perhaps be considerably more. Such a field inhibits the convective transport of heat. Hence there is a cool shadow on the upper side of the field, and that cool shadow presses downward so hard as to suppress the magnetic buoyancy, forcing the field to remain in the lower convective zone. The accumulation of heat below the field forces intruding fingers of gas up through the field, forming thermal plumes extending up to the visible surface. It is suggested that the process is intermittent, providing a thermal relaxation oscillation with a period of the order of one week. The <b>activity</b> <b>complexes</b> observed at the surface are the consequence of these eruptions of fluid and entrained field from the lower convective zone...|$|R

40|$|The {{postnatal}} {{development of the}} complexes of the electron transport chain in mitochondria isolated from rat brain synaptosomes was investigated. Synaptosomal brain mitochondria were isolated from rats aged 10 - 60 days, and the <b>activities</b> of mitochondrial <b>complex</b> I, complex II-III, complex IV and complex V were measured. There was {{a significant increase in}} the activity of II-III from day 10 to day 15 and complex IV from day 10 to day 21, thereafter the <b>activities</b> of <b>complexes</b> I-III and IV did not change significantly. The <b>activity</b> of <b>complex</b> I did not change significantly during the period 10 - 60 days post partum. In synaptic mitochondria, <b>complex</b> V <b>activity</b> was higher than in non-synaptic mitochondria, whereas the <b>activity</b> of <b>complex</b> I was lower than in non-synaptic mitochondria. These data show that the complexes of the respiratory chain within synaptic mitochondria have activities different from those of non-synaptic mitochondria and may have major implications for the relative susceptibility of mitochondria in different brain cell types to neurotoxins such as MPP+, hypoxic/ischaemic damage and oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>{{activities}}</b> are {{activities that}} are a combination of many simple ones. Typically, {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs) fall in this category. <b>Complex</b> <b>activity</b> recognition is an active area of interest amongst sensing and knowledge mining community today. A majority of investigations along this vein has happened in controlled experimental settings, with multiple wearable and object-interaction sensors. This provides rich observation data for mining. Recently, a new and challenging problem is to investigate recognition accuracy of <b>complex</b> <b>activities</b> in the wild using the smartphone. In this paper, we study the strength of the energy-friendly, cheap, and ubiquitous accelerometer sensor, towards recognizing <b>complex</b> <b>activities</b> in a complete real-life setting. In particular, along the lines of hierarchical feature construction, we investigate multiple higher-order features from the raw sensor stream (x, y, z, t). Further, we propose and evaluate two SVM-based fusion mechanisms (early fusion vs. late fusion) using the higher-order features. Our results show promising performance improvements in recognizing <b>complex</b> <b>activities,</b> w. r. t. prior results in such settings...|$|R
40|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>activity</b> {{recognition}} is challenging {{due to the}} inherent uncertainty and diversity of performing a <b>complex</b> <b>activity.</b> Normally, each instance of a <b>complex</b> <b>activity</b> has its own configuration of atomic actions and their temporal dependencies. We propose in this paper an atomic action-based Bayesian model that constructs Allen's interval relation networks to characterize <b>complex</b> <b>activities</b> with structural varieties in a probabilistic generative way: By introducing latent variables from the Chinese restaurant process, our approach is able to capture all possible styles of a particular <b>complex</b> <b>activity</b> as {{a unique set of}} distributions over atomic actions and relations. We also show that local temporal dependencies can be retained and are globally consistent in the resulting interval network. Moreover, network structure can be learned from empirical data. A new dataset of <b>complex</b> hand <b>activities</b> has been constructed and made publicly available, which is much larger in size than any existing datasets. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets as well as our in-house dataset demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach...|$|R
40|$|<b>Complex</b> <b>activity</b> {{recognition}} is challenging since a <b>complex</b> <b>activity</b> {{can be performed}} in different ways, with each having its own configuration of primitive events and their temporal dependencies. To address such temporal relational variabilities in <b>complex</b> <b>activity</b> recognition, we propose a Bayesian network- based probabilistic generative framework that employs Allen 2 ̆ 7 s interval relation network to represent local temporal dependencies in a generative way. By employing the Chinese restaurant process and introducing relation generation constraints, our framework can characterize these unique internal configurations of a particular <b>complex</b> <b>activity</b> as a joint distribution. Three concrete models are implemented based on our framework. Specifically, {{in this paper we}} improve two of our previous models and provide an enhanced model to handle temporal relational variabilities in <b>complex</b> <b>activities</b> more efficiently. Empirical evalu- ations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our framework. In particular, it is shown that our models are rather robust against errors caused by the low-level predictions from raw signals...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} aglycaemic hypoxia (AH) on the {{activity}} of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes was measured in superfused adult cortical brain slices. After 15 min of AH the <b>activity</b> of <b>complex</b> II-III was significantly reduced (by 45 %) with no change in complex I or IV. Following 30 min of reperfusion the <b>activities</b> of <b>complex</b> II-III and IV were significantly reduced (by 45 % and 20 % respectively). These reductions in enzyme activity were abolished by removing the external calcium or by the addition of N omega-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA) or an analogue of superoxide dismutase (SOD) manganese [III] tetrakis 4 -benzoic acid porphyrin (Mn-TBAP).
