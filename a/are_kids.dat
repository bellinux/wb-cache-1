5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we <b>are.</b> <b>Kids</b> can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted."
