5|$|Several years earlier, Alaska {{politicians}} had {{speculated that}} Gravel {{would have a}} hard time getting both renominated and elected when his first term expired, given that he was originally elected without a base party organization <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to focus on national rather than local issues.|$|E
5|$|The Chalukyan architects {{retained}} features {{from both}} {{northern and southern}} styles. However, in the overall arrangement of the main temple and of the subsidiary shrines, they inclined towards the northern style <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to build one main shrine with four minor shrines, making the structure a panchayatna or five-shrined complex. Chalukyan temples were, almost always, built facing the east.|$|E

5|$|The Imperial {{government}} {{wanted to}} reform the church and appointed a series of well educated, reforming bishops. Although these bishops agreed with the government {{on the need to}} reform, they did not share Pedro II's views on the subservience of the Church to government <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to be influenced by Ultramontanism which emphasised loyalty to the Papacy over loyalty to the civil powers.|$|E
5|$|Before the Georgian era, the Treasury of England {{was led by}} the Lord High Treasurer. By {{the late}} Tudor period, the Lord High Treasurer was {{regarded}} as one of the Great Officers of State <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to be the dominant figure in government: the Duke of Somerset, Lord High Treasurer (1547–1549), served as Lord Protector to his nephew King Edward VI; Lord Burghley, Lord High Treasurer (1572–1598), was the dominant minister among Queen Elizabeth I's ministers; Burghley's son Lord Salisbury succeeded his father as chief minister to Elizabeth I (1598–1603) and later served King James I as Lord High Treasurer (1608–1612).|$|E
5|$|Ethnically, the Middle Colonies {{were more}} diverse {{than the other}} British colonial regions in North America <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to be more {{socially}} tolerant. For example, in New York, any foreigner professing Christianity was awarded citizenship, leading to a more diverse populace. As a consequence, early German settlements in the Americas concentrated in the Middle Colonies region. Indentured servitude was especially common in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York in the eighteenth century, though fewer worked in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|On July 7, {{the morning}} of Beauchamp's {{scheduled}} execution, Anna requested that the guard allow her privacy while she dressed. Anna tried another overdose on laudanum, {{but was unable to}} keep it down. She had smuggled a knife into the cell, and the couple attempted another double suicide by stabbing themselves with it. When they were discovered, Anna was taken to the jailer's home <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to by doctors.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The vessels handled well and had a tight turning radius, but they suffered from weather helm <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to drift while underway. The ships' crew numbered ten officers and 191enlisted men, and later increased to eleven officers and 197enlisted men. The ships carried several smaller boats, including two picket boats, one launch, two yawls, and one dinghy. These were handled with a large derrick that was fitted to the main mast.|$|E
5|$|Wałęsa {{supported}} Poland's {{entry into}} NATO and the European Union, {{both of which}} occurred after his presidency, in 1999 and 2004, respectively. In the early 1990s he proposed {{the creation of a}} sub-regional security system called NATO bis. The concept was supported by right-wing and populist movements in Poland but garnered little support abroad; Poland's neighbors, some of which (e.g. Lithuania), had recently regained independence <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to see the proposal as Polish neo-imperialism.|$|E

5|$|As McKinley's {{professional}} career progressed, so too did his social life blossom as he wooed Ida Saxton, {{the daughter of}} a prominent Canton family. They were married on January 25, 1871, in the newly built First Presbyterian Church of Canton, although Ida soon joined her husband's Methodist church. Their first child, Katherine, was born on Christmas Day 1871. A second daughter, Ida, followed in 1873, but died the same year. McKinley's wife descended into a deep depression at her baby's death and her health, never robust, grew worse. Two years later, in 1875, Katherine died of typhoid fever. Ida never recovered from her daughters' deaths; the McKinleys had no more children. Ida McKinley developed epilepsy around the same time and thereafter disliked her husband's leaving her side. He remained a devoted husband <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to his wife's medical and emotional needs {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Bayt Jibrin {{and all of}} Palestine was conquered by the Ottomans {{after their}} victory over the Mamluks during the 1516 Battle of Marj Dabiq. Bayt Jibrin {{subsequently}} {{became part of the}} nahiya (subdistrict) of Hebron (al-Khalīl), which was part of the sanjak ("district") of Gaza. The Ottomans did not exercise strict control over their territories <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to keep local leaders in their traditional positions as long as they complied with the higher authorities and paid imperial taxes. During Suleiman the Magnificent's reign, in 1552, the destroyed Crusader castle in Bayt Jibrin was partially rebuilt {{in order to protect the}} main road between Gaza and Jerusalem. In 1596, the inhabitants of Bayt Jibrin, consisting of 50 Muslim families, paid taxes on wheat, barley and sesame seeds, as well as goats and beehives.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{favorable}} economic development, the military potential of 16th century Poland was modest {{in relation to}} the challenges and threats coming from several directions, which included the Ottoman Empire, the Teutonic state, the Habsburgs, and Muscovy. Given the declining military value and willingness of pospolite ruszenie, the bulk of the forces available consisted of professional and mercenary soldiers. Their number and provision depended on szlachta-approved funding (self-imposed taxation and other sources) <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to be insufficient for any combination of adversaries. The quality of the forces and their command was good, as demonstrated by victories against a seemingly overwhelming enemy. The attainment of strategic objectives was supported by a well-developed service of knowledgeable diplomats and emissaries. Because of the limited resources at the state's disposal, the Jagiellonian Poland had to concentrate on the area most crucial for its security and economic interests, which was the strengthening of Poland's position along the Baltic coast.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th century, prosperous patrician {{families}} of merchants, bankers, or industrial investors, many of German origin, still conducted large-scale business operations in Europe or lent money to Polish noble interests, including the royal court. Some regions were highly urbanized {{in comparison to}} {{most of the rest of}} Europe. In Greater Poland and Lesser Poland at the end of the 16th century, for example, 30% of the population lived in cities. 256 towns were founded, most in Red Ruthenia. The townspeople's upper layer was ethnically multinational <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to be well-educated. Numerous sons of burghers studied at the Academy of Kraków and at foreign universities; members of their group are among the finest contributors to the culture of the Polish Renaissance. Unable to form their own nationwide political class, many blended into the nobility in spite of the legal obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Imperatritsa Mariya {{proved to}} be very bow-heavy in service <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to ship large amounts of water through her forward casemates. The {{ammunition}} for the forward 12-inch guns was reduced from 100 to 70 rounds each while the 130mm ammunition was reduced from 245 to 100 rounds per gun {{in an attempt to}} compensate for her trim. This did not fully cure the problem, but Imperatritsa Mariya was lost before any other changes could be implemented. This did not fully cure the problem so Volias, as she was known by then, forward pair of 130mm guns were removed while she was fitting out. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya did not suffer from the same degree of trim by the bow by virtue of her greater size and retained her forward guns.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, an {{assembly}} elected Bernardino Rivadavia {{as president of}} the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. This action roused the ire of the provinces, and civil war was the result. Support for a strong, centralized Argentine government was based in Buenos Aires, and gave rise to two opposing groups. The wealthy and educated of the Unitarian Party, such as Sarmiento, favored centralized government. In opposition to them were the Federalists, who were mainly based in rural areas <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to reject European mores. Numbering figures such as Manuel Dorrego and Juan Facundo Quiroga among their ranks, they were in favor of a loose federation with more autonomy for the individual provinces.|$|E

5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|Most Doctor Who episodes {{were made}} on two-inch {{videotape}} for initial broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation. Enterprises used 16mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not. The BBC had no central archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes {{that had been made}} on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little dedicated storage space, <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to place piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, <b>and</b> <b>tended</b> to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, one of the group, Able Seaman George Vince, slid {{over the edge of}} a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory.|$|E
