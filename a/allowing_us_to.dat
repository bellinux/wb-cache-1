Although in the Holofernes picture the figures are smaller and the space less filled, both have the triangular space divided into two zones by a vertical wall, <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see what is happening on both sides of it. There are actually three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, we see him at the table with Esther and the King and get a view of the King on his bed. Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{necessary}} for the seeker to have a correct creed (Aqidah), and to embrace with certainty its tenets. The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued {{to his or her}} credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, envy, and long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).|$|E
25|$|At low luminosities, {{the objects}} to be unified are Seyfert galaxies. The {{unification}} models propose that in Seyfert 1s the observer {{has a direct}} view of the active nucleus. In Seyfert 2s the nucleus is observed through an obscuring structure which prevents a direct view of the optical continuum, broad-line region or (soft) X-ray emission. The key insight of orientation-dependent accretion models {{is that the two}} types of object can be the same if only certain angles to the line of sight are observed. The standard picture is of a torus of obscuring material surrounding the accretion disc. It must be large enough to obscure the broad-line region but not large enough to obscure the narrow-line region, which is seen in both classes of object. Seyfert 2s are seen through the torus. Outside the torus there is material that can scatter some of the nuclear emission into our line of sight, <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see some optical and X-ray continuum and, in some cases, broad emission lines—which are strongly polarized, showing that they have been scattered and proving that some Seyfert 2s really do contain hidden Seyfert 1s. Infrared observations of the nuclei of Seyfert 2s also support this picture.|$|E

In the drama Still Alice, Moore played the leading role of a linguistics professor diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. She spent four months training for the film, by watching documentaries on the disease and interacting with patients at the Alzheimer's Association. Critic David Thomson wrote that Moore was [...] "extraordinary at revealing the gradual loss of memory and confidence", while according to Kenneth Turan she was [...] "especially good at the wordless elements of this transformation, <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> see through the changing contours of her face what it is like when your mind empties out."

500|$|Upon release, Strange Days {{polarized}} film critics. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and described it as [...] "a technical tour de force... The pacing is relentless, and the editing, by Howard Smith, creates an urgency and desperation". He also highlighted the film's astute use of SQUID technology, stating that [...] "Bigelow is able to exploit the idea of what is happening; she forces her audience {{to deal with the}} screen reality, instead of <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> process it as routine 'action.'" [...] In a mixed review, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B-" [...] rating, concluding that Strange Days [...] "has a dazzling atmosphere of grunge futurism, but beneath its dark satire of audiovisual decadence lurks a naggingly conventional underworld thriller." [...] Edward Guthmann of San Francisco Chronicle criticized the film for failing to commentate its violence, saying that [...] "Bigelow's style is so visceral [...] that her movie reminds us of a snuff film, rather than a well-reasoned cautionary tale about our animal instincts." [...] New York magazine writer David Denby stated similar cons and called the rape scene [...] "the sickest sequence in modern movies".|$|E
500|$|Music {{remained}} {{an important element}} in establishing the atmosphere of Halloween III. Just as in Halloween and Halloween II, there was no symphonic score. Much of the music was composed to solicit [...] "false startles" [...] from the audience. The soundtrack was composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth, who had also worked on the score for Halloween II. The score of Halloween III differed greatly from the familiar main theme of the original and its first sequel. Carpenter replaced the familiar piano melody with a slower, electronic theme played on a synthesizer with beeping tonalities. Howarth explains how he and Carpenter composed the music for the third film:The music style of John Carpenter and myself has further evolved in this film soundtrack by working exclusively with synthesizers to produce our music. This has led to a certain procedural routine. The film is first transferred to a time coded video tape and synchronized to a 24 track master audio recorder; then while watching the film we compose the music to these visual images. The entire process goes quite rapidly and has 'instant gratification', <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> evaluate the score in synch to the picture. This is quite an invaluable asset.|$|E

Paul Gitter, senior VP of licensing for Marvel at Disney Consumer Products said that they will build off the success of licensed products for Avengers: Age of Ultron, including a focus on a celebration of Captain America's 75th anniversary, female apparel, healthy living and travel, and on marketing newer characters such as War Machine, Falcon, Vision, Black Widow and Black Panther. [...] "The Avengers team is both aspirational and hugely merchandisable, made up of multiple, unique heroes coming together with amazing skills, cool vehicles and a high tech headquarters," [...] said Gitter. [...] "Captain America: Civil War not only gives us new storytelling for our favorite superheroes, but also introduces new ones <b>allowing</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> expand product lines for kids and fans." [...] As part of the $200 million marketing effort for the film, Harley Davidson created two customized motorcycles for the film, Audi debuted a commercial directed by the Russos featuring unreleased scenes from the film, while Pizza Hut debuted collectible boxes and Kellogg's, Pringles, and Keebler products featured virtual reality experiences. The lead-up to the film's release culminated in a massive online vote across Google, YouTube, and Twitter for either Team Captain America or Team Iron Man.|$|E
