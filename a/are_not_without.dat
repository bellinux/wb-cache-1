About 120 of the church’s 500 members {{were involved in}} the construction of the scenes or playing roles in the production. The damage was estimated at more than US$2,000. Additionally, the use of real animals in living nativity scenes has provoked complaint.|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{can also}} form endohedral {{fullerene}} compounds, where a xenon atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. The xenon atom {{trapped in the}} fullerene can be observed by 129Xe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Through the sensitive chemical shift of the xenon atom to its environment, chemical reactions on the fullerene molecule can be analyzed. These observations <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> caveat, however, because the xenon atom has an electronic influence on the reactivity of the fullerene.|$|E

25|$|Proctor's {{nomenclature}} {{has often}} been criticized, mainly {{because so many of}} his names honored English astronomers, but also because he used many names more than once. In particular, Dawes appeared no fewer than six times (Dawes Ocean, Dawes Continent, Dawes Sea, Dawes Strait, Dawes Isle, and Dawes Forked Bay). Even so, Proctor's names <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> charm, and for all their shortcomings they were a foundation on which later astronomers would improve.|$|E
25|$|In his Historie of Ireland {{completed}} 1571, Edmund Campion gives {{a description}} of the hounds used for hunting the wolves on the Dublin and Wicklow mountains. He says: They (the Irish) <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> wolves and greyhounds to hunt them, bigger of bone and limb than a colt. Due to their popularity overseas many were exported to European royal houses leaving numbers in Ireland depleted. This led to a declaration by Oliver Cromwell himself being published in Kilkenny on 27 April 1652 to ensure that sufficient numbers remained to control the wolf population.|$|E
25|$|When {{treating}} cancer it {{is useful}} to have precise measurements of the total body disease burden. It helps with determining prognostic significance and treatment response. This is normally done using computed tomography (CT scans), positron emission tomography (PET scans) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These medical imaging procedures are expensive and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> their own problems. These imaging techniques are not able to accurately resolve small tumors (≤1cm in diameter). Imaging can also be affected by radiation-induced inflammation and fibrotic changes, making is hard to determine if there is residual tumor or just effects of treatment.|$|E

25|$|However, {{competitive}} markets <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> limitations. Basic {{economic theory}} dictates that for competition to exist, {{a large number}} of market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive markets can lead to market power concentration and market manipulation. In these jurisdictions, the market has been threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share. The case of Enron in California is a prime example. For a competitive market to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.|$|E
25|$|According to Fisher (1970), {{there are}} four phases of decision-making: orientation, conflict, emergence, and reinforcement. As a {{communicative}} approach, the orientation stage is where the members involved are becoming acquainted both with themselves {{as well as the}} problem at hand. The conflict stage is where the problem is analyzed with several possibilities presented to resolve the problem. Upon discussing these possibilities, the emergence phase becomes known when a decision is made about which solution is to be used. The reinforcement stage is the supportive of the decision. These phases <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> objection from many theorists in the field. Morley and Stephenson (1977) claim that such a staged model of decision-making is not so rigid between phases and varies depending upon the types of decisions made.|$|E
500|$|The {{size and}} number of parties each year during Stampede is viewed as an {{indicator}} of Calgary's economic strength. [...] Corporations and community groups hold lavish events throughout the city for their staff and clients, while bars and pubs erect party tents, the largest of which draws up to 20,000 people per day. [...] Paul Vickers, who owns several establishments in the city, estimates that he makes up to 20 percent of his annual revenue during the ten days of Stampede alone. [...] Some parties have become known for heavy drinking and relaxed morals, so much so that one hotel's satirical ad promising to safely store a patron's wedding ring during Stampede was widely viewed as a legitimate offer. [...] The parties <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> consequences, as lawyers have noted a significant increase in divorce filings in the weeks following the Stampede, primarily on claims of infidelity. [...] Clinics see an increase in people seeking testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and Calgary is said to experience an annual baby boom each April– nine months after the event.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with all}} STIs, sex {{partners}} {{of patients who}} have LGV should be examined and tested for urethral or cervical chlamydial infection. After a positive culture for chlamydia, clinical suspicion should be confirmed with testing to distinguish serotype. Antibiotic treatment should be started if they had sexual contact with the patient during the 30 days preceding onset of symptoms in the patient. Patients with a sexually transmitted disease should be tested for other STDs due to high rates of comorbid infections. [...] Antibiotics <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> risks and prophylaxtic broad antibiotic coverage is not recommended.|$|E

The battles tend to be either too hard or too easy. [...] This is mostly attributed to the attainment of the Sommerswerd (a sword forged by gods) in the second book Fire on the Water which drastically increases the wielder's combat abilities. [...] Another reason for {{this would be the}} fact that a player can start with drastically different statistics. [...] Finally, because the books were written to be functional both as a series and as standalone adventures, whether a player would have access to certain special weapons and abilities made difficulty hard to gauge.|$|E

[...] She was provoked by the querrelle des femmes (debate on women): a literary and philosophical debate about the intellectual capacities of women, which focused heavily on the women of her region. In reaction, Erculiani introduced her book with two prefatory letters of dedication in defense of women. Within the first, to Queen Anna of Poland, she wrote, [...] "I don't know what malignant star causes [...] to refuse to recognize greatness, except in the things they accomplish themselves." [...] Within the second, to her readers, Erculiani stated, [...] "It will undoubtedly amaze some that I, a woman, have set myself to write and publish on a subject that {{does not belong to}} women (according to the custom of our age); but...you will find that women <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> the same abilities and virtues as men." ...|$|E
