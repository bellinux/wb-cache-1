40|$|OBJECTIVE Investigation of the {{determinants}} {{associated with}} the intent of involvement of citizens in the cost of upgrading primary health services by payment of an additional fee. METHOD the study was conducted in the period May-July 2009 with 150 participants aged over 18 years who attended the Health Center of Atalanti. Data were collected by personal interview using a questionnaire created for the purpose after an extensive literature review. Data analysis was conducted with the statistical package SPSS 15. 0, using t test, chi square test and logistic regression, with the level of statistical significance set at 0. 05. RESULTS almost half of the participants declared their willingness to participate in cost sharing by paying an extra fee, in order to receive upgraded health services. The factor that appeared {{to play a major role}} in the intent to participate in cost sharing was the type of health insurance. Specifically, participants who were insured by the Social Insurance Institution (IKA) reported being more willing to pay a small additional fee in order to gain upgraded health services, in a percentage of 63 %, and they had a probability of expressing willingness four times higher than that of those insured by any other scheme. People in higher socio-economic groups and younger age groups tended to be more positive. Finally, this study examined the net potential revenues that could be incurred with the introduction of a cost sharing mechanism, which were estimated to be € 184, 107. 4 for the first year and € 186, 357. 4 for the following years. CONCLUSIONS It was confirmed that people in higher socio-economic groups and younger people tend to be more positive about the idea of participating in the cost of primary health care services. It was estimated that net revenues from the application of a cost sharing mechanism would be sufficient to fill some vacant positions with <b>auxiliary</b> <b>doctors,</b> but also to help purchase medical equipment and modernize the building infrastructure of the Health Center. © Athens Medical Society...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the social support networks for families {{for the promotion}} of child development {{from the perspective of the}} Family Health Strategy team. Methods: Qualitative, descriptive research. The subjects were twelve health professionals, three from each of the professional categories working in the health centers studied (nurse, <b>doctor,</b> <b>auxiliary</b> nurse, and community health worker). The data was collected through semi-structured interviews, and analyzed through thematic categorical analysis. Results: The results evidenced three empirical categories: Elements of the social support network; Functions of support for the families; Difficulties and gaps in the social support network for the families. Conclusion: It is considered that the social networks have an important role in the linking of the families, strengthening their potential for healthy child development. It is recommended that health professionals should articulate actions capable of influencing these elements, soas to promote appropriate child development...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To assess tobacco use, {{attitudes and}} {{cessation}} practices among healthcare workers of a municipal health department in southern India. Materials and Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional epidemiologic study to investigate 558 healthcare workers from three groups (<b>doctors,</b> <b>auxiliary</b> nurses and community link workers (LWs)) {{employed by the}} Bangalore city corporation in southern India. Outcomes included self-reported tobacco use status and attitudes (for all workers), and (for doctors) self-report of performance of " 5 -A" tobacco cessation interventions: Asking, advising, assessing, assisting, or arranging follow-up for tobacco control, in their client population. Results: Doctors reported higher tobacco use rates (6. 9 %) compared to LW (2 %) and nurses (95 %). Many doctors reported asking (100 %) and advising (78 %) about tobacco use but much fewer were assessing intention/motivation to quit (24 %), assisting with quitting (19 %), and arranging follow-up for quitting and relapse prevention (9 %). Conclusion: Tailored training in tobacco control would enable doctors, nurses and outreach workers involved in primary healthcare delivery to be better {{equipped to deal with}} a major cause of morbidity and mortality among urban communities in the 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare Workers (HCWs) have {{a higher}} {{frequency}} of TB exposure {{than the general population}} and have therefore an occupational TB risk that infection prevention and control (IPC) measures aim to reduce. HCWs are crucial in the implementation of these measures. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate Mozambican HCWs' perceptions of their occupational TB risk and the measures they report using to reduce this risk. In addition, we explored the challenges HCWs encounter while using these TBIPC measures. Focus group discussion. Analysis according content method. Four categories of HCWs: <b>auxiliary</b> workers, medical (<b>doctors</b> and clinical officers), nurses and TB program staff. HCWs are aware of their occupational TB risk and use various measures to reduce their risk of infection. HCWs find it challenging to employ measures that minimize such risks and a lack of clear guidelines contributes to these challenges. HCWs' and patient behavior further complicate the use of TBIPC measures. HCWs in Mozambique perceive a high occupational risk of TB infection. They report several challenges using measures to reduce this risk such as shortage of material, lack of clear guidelines, insufficient motivation and inadequate training. Robust training with motivational approaches, alongside supervision and support for HCWs could improve implementation of TBIPC measures. Healthcare management should address the areas for improvement that are beyond the individual HCW's contro...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{findings}} of a 1999 nationally representative survey of independent hospices in the UK, focusing on hospice staff and volunteers' experiences of working in hospices. Nineteen of 25 sampled services participated, and these differed little in terms of service provision, size and region from the total sample of 175 services. A response rate of 70 % for randomly sampled hospice staff and volunteers was achieved (n = 504). There were significant intergroup differences (<b>doctors,</b> nurses, nursing <b>auxiliaries,</b> other staff and volunteers) in participants' reported experience of working in the hospice with, for example, doctors being more likely than other groups to feel appreciated and to report receiving adequate support from hospice management. Overall, 31 % of respondents wanted more support from management. Half had considered leaving the hospice (65 % nurses, 60 % other staff, 55 % nursing <b>auxiliaries,</b> 40 % <b>doctors</b> and 37 % volunteers). Nurses who had considered leaving were less satisfied than other nurses with, for example, support from hospice management, {{and less likely to}} feel valued by the hospice. These results raise questions {{about the quality of the}} relationship between hospice trustees, managers and staff, and about the realities of enhancing multiprofessional teamwork in organizations where there are significant differences between staff groups in perception of, and satisfaction with, the working environment. Voluntary hospice trustees and managers face a difficult task in managing and supporting staff whilst also negotiating relationships with the NHS at a time of rapid change, and ensuring hospices' financial viability. Access to high quality leadership programmes may play an important role in ensuring voluntary hospices are characterized by effective, supportive working relationships...|$|R
