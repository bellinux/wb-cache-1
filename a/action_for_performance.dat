40|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{theories}} of action espoused by state-level performance funding advocates and implementers in Indiana, Ohio, and Tennessee. The study found that these espoused theories of action are incompletely articulated, with significant gaps in the specification of policy instruments, desired institutional changes, and possible obstacles and unintended impacts {{that need to be}} countered. Performance funding is conceived largely as stimulating changes in institutional behavior and student outcomes by providing financial inducements and securing institutional buy-in. Less attention is paid to other policy instruments, such as providing information on institutional performance to the colleges and building up the capacity of institutions to engage in organizational learning and change. The states’ espoused theories of <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> funding are, thus, narrower than those for state and federal K- 12 accountability programs, which put much more emphasis on information provision and capacity building. Moreover, the espoused theories of <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> funding in the three states miss important possible obstacles to and unintended impacts of performance funding. This report argues that insufficiently articulating {{the theories of}} <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> funding makes it less likely that it will be successful and avoid undue harm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} coherence {{as a source of}} epistemic justification, particularly the argument that all beliefs must cohere within one’s ‘web of belief’, aka confirmational holism. Confirmational holism runs across a potentially devastating argument that a more coherent set of beliefs resulting from the addition of a belief to a less coherent set of beliefs is less likely to be true than the less coherent set of beliefs. I propose confirmational chorism (CC) to avoid this troubling outcome. CC posits that coherence adds epistemic justification by limited, logically consistent sets of beliefs exhibiting a satisficing degree of strength, inferential and explanatory connection. Limited coherence may resolve the above argument, but raises the need for another kind of justification: coordination (integration across sets of beliefs). Belief coordination requires suppressing some beliefs and communicating other beliefs to ensure convergence on the right <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>performance</b> success. Thus, a belief in any particular context is justified not just because it is reliably formed and coherent, but also because of how it is coordinated between local and holistic goals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Stiction is {{the most}} common problem in {{pneumatic}} control valves, which are widely used in the process industry. Stiction causes fluctuation of process variables, which lowers productivity. Therefore, developing a method to detect stiction and distinguish it from other causes is crucial to help operators take an appropriate <b>action</b> <b>for</b> improving control <b>performance.</b> The present work proposes a valve stiction model and new stiction detection algorithms. Using only two parameters, the proposed model can describe the stiction phenomenon with sufficient accuracy. The usefulness of the proposed detection methods are demonstrated by comparing them with a conventional method. The proposed methods are shown to successfully detect valve stiction, distinguish it from bad tuning or disturbances, and quantify the degree of stiction, by using simulation data sets and real operation data sets of several chemical processes.

Experimental support for a shuttle mechanism in soil-plant systems with FeEDDHA was found: specific metal mobilization only occurred upon FeEDDHA-facilitated Fe uptake. The mobilized metals originated at least in part from the root surface instead of the soil. The results from this study support the existence of a shuttle mechanism with FeEDDHA in soil application.
