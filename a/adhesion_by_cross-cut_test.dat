In the experimental part of this thesis there is a study of a resistance of the coating systems to solvents by the spotting method, which is subsequently then combined with an adhesion experiment of the coating film <b>by</b> the <b>cross-cut</b> <b>test.</b> Those experiments are made according to matching methods in valid version...|$|R
40|$|Coatings {{are used}} to enhance {{appearance}} and assure functional requirements. High performance and cost reduction during vehicle manufacturing are the main requirements, leading to increased use of pre-primed automotive sheet in recent years. Costs may be significantly reduced if the conventional electrophoretic primer is eliminated or its usage reduced. Conductive primers also offer the advantage of welding facility. The behaviour of two conductive pre-primers applied on galvannealed steel was studied and {{compared with that of}} a conventional electrophoretic primer. Before pre-priming a nonchrome pre-treatment was applied. Pre-primer 1 is an organic zinc rich silicate with a low thickness and pre-primer 2 is a very thin water based primer filled with graphite. The behaviour of two finish coat systems was also studied. These finish coats were applied on not primed and pre-primed galvannealed steel sheets. Two activation treatments were used, a conventional zinc phosphate and an experimental one. Finish coat system 1 included a powder intercoat, a waterborne base coat and a clear coat, and finish coat system 2 included the same powder intercoat, a solvent based base coat and a clear coat. Formability capabilities of pre-primers were evaluated through cupping and stone chipping tests. To evaluate corrosion protection, these samples were submitted to a cyclic corrosion test (CCT). Corrosion mechanisms were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with associated X-ray microanalysis by dispersive energy spectrometry (EDS) and by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To evaluate the performance of finish coats, the samples were also submitted to the same cyclic corrosion test, and the paint coating adhesion was evaluated, before and after exposure, <b>by</b> <b>cross-cut</b> <b>test</b> method. Both pre-primers applied with a low thickness seem to be good alternatives to the conventional electrophoretic primers. In agreement with results previously obtained for preprimed electrogalvanized steel substrate, submitted to CCT, electrochemical studies showed that less protection was achieved by primer 2. Regarding finish coats better adhesion was verified for the one with waterborne base coat, a more environmentally convenient system. Both finish coats presented good anticorrosive behaviour, without significant defects on undamaged areas...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} study, we {{investigate}} different surface pretreatments and {{their influence on}} a subsequent surface metallization. A direct liquid injection metalorganic CVD (DLI-MOCVD) process is presented for the low temperature metallization of composites, ultimately aiming at the surface unctionalization of 3 D parts. The process involves the organometallic precursor Cu(I) hexafluoroacetylacetonate 2 -methyl- 1 -hexene- 3 -yne (hfac) Cu(MHY). We determine chemical kinetics of the global deposition reaction and show {{the improvement of the}} adhesion of the Cu films by applying surface pretreatments that etch and/or activate the surface before deposition. To this purpose, gas phase and wet chemical processes are used. Gas phase pretreatments consist either in the use of a remote microwave plasma, an in situ UV oxidation, or in the deposition of acrylic acid/ethylene plasma buffer layer by using an atmospheric pressure cold plasma jet. The liquid phase pretreatment is based on a commercial series of solutions that includes swelling, oxidation, and neutralization steps. The adhesive strength of the Cu films on poly-epoxy and on carbon fiber/poly-epoxy composite surfaces is specifically investigated <b>by</b> scratch and <b>cross-cut</b> <b>testing,</b> and is correlatedwith topographical, chemical, and energetic characteristics of the surfaces prior deposition, investigated by interferometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and wettability measurements through the sessile drop method. Pretreatments result in surface functionalization and topographical changes which significantly increase the surface energy and improve the wettability. In some cases the induced modification of the microstructure of the Cu films is found to be eneficial to the electrical resistivity...|$|R

40|$|Objective — Proatherosclerotic {{adhesion}} of leukocytes to the endothelium is attenuated by NO. As AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) regulates endothelial NO synthesis, we investigated the modulation of adhesion to cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) by AMPK. Methods and Results — HAECs incubated with the AMPK activator, AICAR, or expressing constitutively active AMPK demonstrated reduced TNF &# 945;-stimulated adhesion of promonocytic U- 937 cells. Rapid inhibition of TNF &# 945;-stimulated U- 937 cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>by</b> AICAR was NO-dependent, associated with unaltered cell surface adhesion molecule expression, and reduced MCP- 1 secretion by HAECs. In contrast, inhibition of TNF &# 945;-stimulated U- 937 cell <b>adhesion</b> <b>by</b> prolonged AMPK activation was NO-independent and associated with reduced cell surface adhesion molecule expression. Conclusions — AMPK activation in HAECs inhibits TNF &# 945;-stimulated leukocyte <b>adhesion</b> <b>by</b> a rapid NO-dependent mechanism associated with reduced MCP- 1 secretion and a late NO-independent mechanism whereby adhesion molecule expression, in particular E-selectin, is suppressed. We investigated the functional effects of AMPK activation in cultured human endothelial cells.

Such performant anticorrosive protection systems were exposed in situ – marine and alpine environment - and in parallel, aiming to simulate the severe climatic actions through laboratory accelerated environments - neutral salt fog, condensation and temperature variations. The graphical representation and the interpretation of the adhesion to the steel surface by means of the variation of the class into which the paint was framed after performing the <b>cross-cut</b> <b>test</b> during the exposure provided information concerning a new possibility to predict the evolution of the degradation of the paint, by means of this characteristic experimentally determined...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{titanium}} oxide layer {{used in a}} dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has to meet two opponent properties to enable high conversion efficiency: a large surface area (for high dye loading) and good connection between TiO 2 grains (for efficient extraction of electrons toward the front contact). In order to meet a trade-off between these criteria a preparation method for TiO 2 paste formulation based on Pechini sol–gel method and commercial nanocrystalline TiO 2 powder has been developed. A series of TiO 2 pastes with different molar ratios between titanium isopropoxide, citric acid and ethylene glycol (1 :X: 4 X) in the paste have been examined. The structure and morphology as well as <b>cross-cut</b> <b>tests</b> of deposited and sintered TiO 2 layers have been analyzed. Results reveal that the paste with X = 8 exhibits the best properties, resulting in an overall con-version efficiency of DSSC under standard test conditions (100 mW/cm 2, 25 C, AM 1. 5 G) up to 6. 6 % for ionic liquid based electrolyte...|$|R
