And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets.

2500|$|The {{majority}} of Karadžić's works were banned from publishing in Serbia and Austria during {{the rule of}} Prince Miloš Obrenović. As observed from a political point of view, Obrenović saw the works of Karadžić as a potential hazard due {{to a number of}} apparent reasons, one of which was the possibility that the content of some of the works, although purely poetic in nature, was capable of creating <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> patriotism and a desire for freedom and independence, which very likely might have driven the populace to take up arms against the Turks. This, in turn, would prove detrimental to Prince Miloš's politics toward the Ottoman Empire, with whom he had recently forged an uneasy peace. In Montenegro, however, Njegoš's printing press operated without the archaic letter known as the [...] "hard sign". Prince Miloš was to resent Njegoš's abandonment of the hard sign, over which, at that time, furious intellectual battles were being waged, with ecclesiastical hierarchy involved as well. Karadžić's works, however, did receive high praise and recognition elsewhere, especially in Russia. In addition to this, Karadžić was granted a full pension from the Tsar in 1826.|$|E
2500|$|His {{address of}} a poem ("Paroles au Maréchal," [...] "Words to the Marshal") to Marshal Philippe Pétain after the defeat of France in 1940, commending Petain for picking up and {{salvaging}} France's broken, wounded body, has been unflatteringly remembered, though it is less a paean to Petain than a patriotic lament over the condition of France. As a Catholic, he could not avoid <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> bitter satisfaction at {{the fall of the}} anti-clerical French Third Republic. However, accusations that he was a collaborationist based on the 1941 poem ignore the fact that support for Marshal Petain and the surrender was, in the catastrophic atmosphere of defeat, emotional collapse and exhaustion in 1941, widespread throughout the French populace (witness the large majority vote in favour of Petain and the dissolution of the Third Republic in the French Parliament in 1940, with support stretching across the political spectrum). Claudel's diaries make clear his consistent contempt for Nazism (condemning it as early as 1930 as [...] "demonic" [...] and [...] "wedded to Satan," [...] and referring to communism and Nazism as [...] "Gog and Magog"), and his attitude to the Vichy regime quickly hardened into opposition.|$|E
2500|$|Scania's long-running and {{sometimes}} intense {{trade relations with}} other communities {{along the coast of}} the European continent through history have made the culture of Scania distinct from other geographical regions of Sweden. Its open landscape, often described as a colourful patchwork quilt of wheat and rapeseed fields, and the relatively mild climate at the southern tip of the Scandinavian Peninsula, have inspired many Swedish artists and authors to compare it to European regions like Provence in southern France and Zeeland in the Netherlands. Among the many authors who have described the [...] "foreign" [...] continental elements of the Scanian landscape, diet and customs are August Strindberg and Carl Linnaeus. In 1893 August Strindberg wrote about Scania: [...] "In beautiful, large wave lines, the fields undulate down toward the lake; a small deciduous forest limits the coastline, which is given the inviting look of the Riviera, where people shall walk in the sun, protected from the north wind. [...] The Swede leaves the plains with <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> comfort, because its beauty is foreign to him." [...] In another chapter he states: [...] "The Swedes have a history [...] that is not the history of the South Scandinavians. It must be just as [...] foreign as Vasa’s history is to the Scanian." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing for La Stampa, Mario Gromo {{argued that}} it was a [...] "film of a certain {{importance}} because of its many intelligent moments, its sound portrayal of provincial life, and because it is the second film of a young director who evidently has considerable talent... The Italian film industry now has a new director and one who puts his own personal ideas before any of the customary traditions of the trade. Fellini's is a fresh approach". [...] "It is the atmosphere that counts most in this unusual film," [...] wrote Francesco Càallari of the Gazzetta del Lunedi, [...] "an intensely human and poetical atmosphere altogether estranged from the provincialism of the setting... Fellini has something to say and he says it with an acute sense of observation... Here is someone apart from the other young directors of post-war Italian cinema. Fellini has a magical touch." [...] First published 31 August 1953 in the Gazzeta del Lunedi (Genoa). After praising Fellini's Venice triumph, Ermanno Contini of Il Secolo XIX outlined the film's weaknesses: [...] "I Vitelloni does not have a particularly solid structure, the story is discontinuous, seeking unity through the complex symbiosis of episodes and details... The narrative, built up around strong emotions and powerful situations, lacks solid organic unity, and at times this undermines the story's creative force, resulting in an imbalance of tone and pace and <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> tedium. But such shortcomings are amply atoned for by the film's sincerity and authenticity." [...] Arturo Lanocita of Corriere della Sera wrote: [...] "I Vitelloni gives a graphic and authentic picture of certain aimless evenings, the streets populated by groups of idle youths... The film is a series of annotations, hints, and allusions without unity... With a touch of irony, Fellini tries to show the contrast between the way his characters see themselves and the way they really are. Despite its weaknesses, the film {{is one of the best}} in recent years." [...] For Giulio Cesare Castello of Cinema VI, the film proved [...] "that Fellini is the Italian film industry's most talented satirist, and an acute observer and psychologist of human behaviour. Like any good moralist, he knows how to give his story a meaning, to provide more than just simple entertainment".|$|E
