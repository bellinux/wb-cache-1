2500|$|The Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway hauled {{iron ore}} in Minnesota. Iron ore is heavy and the DM {{operated}} long trains of ore cars, requiring maximum power. These locomotives were based upon ten 2-8-8-2s that Baldwin had {{built in the}} 1930s for the Western Pacific Railroad. The need for a larger, coal-burning firebox and a longer, <b>all-weather</b> <b>cab</b> led {{to the use of}} a four-wheel trailing truck, giving them the [...] "Yellowstone" [...] wheel arrangement. They were the most powerful Yellowstones built, producing [...] of tractive effort, and had the most weight on drivers so that they were not prone to slipping.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Grand Trunk Western Railway {{purchased}} this 4-8-2 Mountain locomotive (#6039) from Baldwin in 1925. This locomotive burned coal, and had Vanderbilt tenders and {{an enclosed}} <b>all-weather</b> <b>cab.</b> Preserved at Steamtown National Historic Site.|$|E
50|$|Like many {{classes of}} {{specialised}} freight engines on NZR, {{eight of the}} ten BA locomotives were modified to perform shunting duties. This included an <b>all-weather</b> <b>cab</b> fixture on the tender to provide shelter for crews, and second sand domes.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the GS-3, the GS-4 had a dual-{{headlight}} casing (top headlight was a mars light) on {{the silver}} smokebox. Another change was the <b>all-weather</b> <b>cab.</b> It retained the skyline casing atop of the boiler, skirting on the sides, an air horn to supplement the whistle and teardrop classification lights. They carried the orange and red [...] "Daylight" [...] paint scheme.|$|E

5000|$|The GS-5s are {{identical}} in appearance to the GS-4s, {{the only difference}} being the roller bearings that gave the locomotive a smoother ride and added weight. 4458 had roller bearings from the Timken Company and 4459 used SKF brand roller bearings. They had a silver smokebox with a dual-headlight casing (top headlight was a mars light), and an enclosed, <b>all-weather</b> <b>cab.</b> It retained the skyline casing {{on the top of}} the boiler, skirting on the sides, an air horn (for use at speeds due to being louder than the whistle which was rarely if ever used on the main line) and teardrop classification lights. They received the orange and red [...] "Daylight" [...] paint scheme. The GS-5's were designed for high-speed passenger service on Southern Pacific's premier passenger trains, the Coast Daylight, San Joaquin Daylight and Sunset Limited. In later years they were painted black and had their side skirting removed for easier maintenance. The GS-5s were considered the best of the GS series and ended their careers on Southern Pacific's San Joaquin Valley line.|$|E
