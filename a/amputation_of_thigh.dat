40|$|AIMS: We report {{three cases}} of {{skeletal}} muscle regeneration, of which two mimicked a small round cell tumour, especially a rhabdomyosarcoma. METHODS AND RESULTS: One case presented as an intramuscular mass, {{located in the}} right quadriceps of a 12 -year-old male; the second patient was a 25 -year-old football player who complained of painful left peroneus muscles; the third patient was a 22 -year-old male who underwent an <b>amputation</b> <b>of</b> the right <b>thigh</b> 5 days after right leg amputation due to limb crush. Histologically, muscle biopsy specimens showed a proliferation of small round cells, either infiltrating the striated muscle in a diffuse manner or growing within and around necrotic myofibres. Immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally, the cellular population was composed of two types of cells: phagocytic cells the nuclei of which occasionally showed a wreathlike arrangement around necrotic myofibres resulting in structures resembling Langhans-type multinucleated giant cells, and proliferating satellite cells showing enlarged nuclei, prominent nucleoli, mitotic figures, myogenic differentiation and fusion features in order to form regenerating myotubes. CONCLUSIONS: Muscle regeneration is a benign process that may occasionally mimic a small round cell proliferation resembling a lymphoma or an alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma with which {{it should not be}} confuse...|$|R

40|$|Background. Festering {{inflammation}} of lower extremities {{is one of}} the most frequent surgical complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). The results of its treatment can not be admitted as satisfactory. The aim of the study was to carry out the analysis of the causes of diabetic foot syndrome and negative results of the treatment on an outpatient basis. Materials and methods. The analysis of the causes of development and negative results of treatment is conducted in 142  patients with DM and ulcer of the foot. We have used the follow-up cards with the detailed evaluation of disease history, lifestyle, presence of pernicious habits and other complications of DM. Results. Lethal cases are registered in 17 patients, <b>amputation</b> <b>of</b> the lower limb was detected in 19 patients. <b>Amputations</b> <b>of</b> the toes were performed in 61  % cases, within the limits of the foot — in 15  % of persons, 6  % of patients operated at the level of shin, and in 18  % of cases, amputation at the level <b>of</b> <b>thigh</b> was performed. The most risk <b>of</b> <b>amputation</b> is related to the presence of foot deformity. Conclusions. Most patients with DM on admission to the hospital for diabetic foot syndrome had long-term decompensation of carbohydrate metabolism, violations of lipid metabolism and concomitant cardiovascular pathology. At the moment of ulcer detection, the majority of patients had a combination of sensorimotor neuropathy with other risk factors — foot deformity, the presence <b>of</b> ulcers and/or <b>amputations</b> in the past medical history...|$|R

40|$|IT is {{probable}} that the process char-acteristic of thrombo-angiitis ob-literans involves vessels in areas other than the extremities more com-monly than is believed. Such involve-ment may only be recognized by care-ful clinical and pathologic investiga-tion. We have not {{had an opportunity to}} examine cases of thrombo-angiitis obliterans after death. Necropsy was performed in seven cases recorded in the literature. Evidence of disease of the coronary arteries was found in four. A summary of these four cases follows: Case reported by Buerger. —A man aged twenty-four years with thrombo-angiitis obliterans died suddenly fol-lowing a Gritti-Stokes <b>amputation</b> <b>of</b> the right <b>thigh.</b> He had been engaged in conversation with a nurse shortly before death. The clinical diagnosis of thrombo-angiitis obliterans of the extremities was confirmed microscop-ically. The left coronary artery was •Submitted for publication March 22, 1929. normal 1. 5 cm. from its origin, where the main branch running down to sup-ply the left ventricle was found to be more or less filled by a fibrous yellow-ish-white substance which was adher-ent to the wall and divided the lumen of the vessel into two small parts. This fibrous process in the lumen of the vessel could be traced down only about 3 cm. The right coronary ar-tery and veins {{did not appear to be}} changed. At the point of origin of the right coronary artery there was an atherosclerotic plaque on the right pos-terior sinus of Valsalva which en-croached on the lumen of the orifice of the artery to such an extent as to obstruct it; in fact, the orifice was only the size of a pin-point. There were numerous pin-head and slightly larger atherosclerotic patches scattered diffusely beneath the intima. At necropsy a diagnosis was made of thrombo-angiitis obliterans, athero-sclerosis of the coronary arteries, and interstitial myocarditis. The micro-scopic examination of the coronar...|$|R

Methods. There were studied the special features of sepsis development and treatment in 117 patients with complicated forms of diabetic foot syndrome. The results of sepsis development in patients with complicated forms of diabetic foot syndrome are the decompensation of diabetes mellitus, toxic syndrome, the raise of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1, IL- 6, TNF), the current pyonecrotic process progresses rapidly and assumes an uncontrolled character. Results. An adequate surgical treatment combined with complex medicamental therapy allows save extremities in 54, 7 %. The operations of choice for these patients are distal guillotine amputations with surgical treatment of foot {{to the level of}} Lisfranc joint or <b>amputations</b> <b>of</b> extremity on the level <b>of</b> shin or <b>thigh.</b> The high amputations are 35, 1 % of general postoperative lethality. Conclusions. Depending on character of the clinical course of pathologic process it is necessary to carry out one-phase or multiphase operative interventions on the background of complex multicomponent pathogenetic therapy.

40|$|The aim of my {{extended}} {{essay is}} to evaluate some social aspects after <b>amputations</b> <b>of</b> extremities {{with children and}} adults. The work is divided into several parts. In the first theoretical part, the {{attention is paid to}} a history <b>of</b> <b>amputations</b> and some indications for an extremity amputation. At the same time, the summary <b>of</b> <b>amputation</b> lines <b>of</b> upper and lower extremities is set up here as well. In this part, there is a list of some indications leading to an <b>amputation</b> <b>of</b> an extremity, too. Besides, here is some theoretical imformation on the comprehensive rehabilitation, especially on therapeutic, social and working one. Some data obtained by evaluating my own research are presented in the practical part of this extended essay. The research was carried out with a quantitative questionnaire method. After the evaluation, all three determined hypotheses were confirmed. Hypothesis No. 1 : I suppose the children and adolescents do not feel being seen at a disadvantage after the <b>amputation</b> <b>of</b> an extremity, which is brought by this treatment. Hypothesis No. 2 : Women {{come to terms with the}} <b>amputation</b> <b>of</b> an extremity psychically worse than men do. Hypothesis No. 3 : I suppose the <b>amputation</b> <b>of</b> an upper extremity is a greater handicap than a loss of a lower one, in consideration of one's asserting at the labour market. The practical evaluation contains all the comparisons of the research results with some specialized literature, too. The main contribution of my extended essay is the summarization of the certain points at issue and the facilitation of an easier orientation in a social situation after the <b>amputation</b> <b>of</b> an extremity...|$|R
