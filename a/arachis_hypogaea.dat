5|$|Peanut, or {{groundnut}} (<b>Arachis</b> <b>hypogaea),</b> {{originally from}} South America, {{has grown from}} a relatively minor crop {{to one of the most}} important commercial nut crops, in part due to the work of George Washington Carver at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
6000|$|The {{vegetables}} are [...] "Mbongwe" [...] (yams), koko or Colocasia esculenta, Occras (Hibiscus esculentus), squashes (pumpkins), cucumbers, beans of several sorts, {{and the sweet}} potato, an esculent disliked by Englishmen, but far more nutritious than the miserable [...] "Irish" [...] tuber. The ground-nut or peanut (<b>Arachis</b> <b>hypogaea),</b> the [...] "pindar" [...] of the United States, a word derived from Loango, is eaten roasted, and, as a rule, the people have not learned to express its oil. Proyart (Pinkerton, xvi. 551) gives, probably by misprint, [...] "Pinda, which we call Pistachio." [...] "Bird- peppers," [...] as the small red species is called, grow wild in every bush; they are wholesome, and the people use them extensively. Tomatoes flourish almost spontaneously, {{and there is a}} bulbless native onion whose tops make excellent seasoning. Sugar-cane will thrive in the swamps, coffee on the hill-slopes: I heard of, but never saw ginger.|$|E

5000|$|Peanut {{agglutinin}} (PNA) is plant lectin protein {{derived from}} the fruits of <b>Arachis</b> <b>hypogaea.</b> Peanut agglutinin may also {{be referred to as}} <b>Arachis</b> <b>hypogaea</b> lectin. Lectins recognise and bind particular sugar sequences in carbohydrates; peanut agglutinin binds the carbohydrate sequence Gal-β(1-3)-GalNAc.

50|$|She {{studied at}} the Utrecht University in the Netherlands, where she was Johanna Westerdijk's first PhD student.
