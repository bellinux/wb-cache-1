5|$|Fiduciary {{funds are}} used to account for assets held in trust by the {{government}} for the benefit of individuals or other entities. The employee pension fund, created by the State of Maryland to provide retirement benefits for its employees, {{is an example of a}} fiduciary fund. Financial statements may further distinguish fiduciary funds as either trust or agency funds; <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> generally exists for a longer period of time than an agency fund.|$|E
5|$|The £5,000 left in {{his estate}} was quickly taken up by expenses, mostly on his funeral. His will stipulated that £100,000 {{should be left to}} Whitby and £25,000 each to his butler, Thomas Foley, and his chauffeur; however it is unknown whether they were ever paid. <b>A</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> had been set up for Frederick, but his half-sisters {{received}} nothing. The House of Lords Act 1999 abolished most hereditary peers' rights; consequently, as well as having no residence at Ickworth, the 8th Marquess does not have a seat in the House.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1896, Sorabji's {{father was}} back in Bombay, where he played a {{significant}} role in the development of India's engineering and cotton machinery industries, among other things. Although he provided his family with financial support, he spent much of his time abroad and on 17 June 1929 bigamously married Nobubai Visvonata Catcar, causing Sorabji and his mother a substantial loss of fortune. He died in Bad Nauheim, Germany, on 8 July 1932. In the same year, Sorabji travelled to India to settle matters related to his father's estate, but obtained nothing but money from <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> that his father had established in 1914. Nevertheless, it saved him from having to earn a living, although his lifestyle was ascetic.|$|E

5|$|Idiots and lunatics {{had their}} land looked after by a court-appointed administrator, and any profits went into <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> {{to support the}} insane person. Due to the vested {{interest}} of the King (who would hold the lands) the actual lunacy or idiocy was determined by a jury, not by an individual judge. Under the Lunacy Act 1845 the Lord Chancellor {{had a right to}} appoint a commission to investigate the insanity of an individual; as part of his role as Keeper of the King's conscience, however, he would only do this when it was beneficial to the lunatic, not simply because somebody had been found insane.|$|E

One day, her boyfriend Johnny uncovers two men stealing money out of <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> and takes pictures of the theft. Johnny puts the pictures in a safety deposit box and gives Nikki the key for safekeeping. The thieves catch Johnny and murder him, then frame Nikki by putting his body {{into the trunk of}} her car. Nikki is sentenced to seven years in prison. This is seen during the animated opening credits of the film.|$|E
5|$|Avery Brundage had no {{children}} with either of his wives. During his first marriage, however, Brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his Finnish mistress, Lilian Dresden. His affair with Dresden was one of many. The children were born in 1951 and 1952, at precisely the time that Brundage was being considered for {{the presidency of the}} IOC. Though he privately acknowledged paternity, Brundage took great pains to conceal the existence of these children, concerned that the truth about his extra-marital relationships might damage his chances of election: he requested that his name be kept off the birth certificates. Brundage visited his two sons periodically in the 1950s, visits that tailed off to telephone calls in the 1960s and nothing in his final years. He did establish <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> for the boys' education and start in life, but after his death, unnamed in his will, they sued and won a small settlement of $62,500 each out of his $19 million estate.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's obstetrician {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E
