5|$|Court-show viewers don't {{seem to want}} moral conundrums or {{technical}} wrinkles. They love Sheindlin's show because she offers them a fantasy of how they'd like the justice system to operateâ€”swiftly, and without procedural mishaps or uppity lawyers. They get to see wrongdoers publicly humiliated by a strong <b>authority</b> <b>figure.</b> There is no uncertainty after Sheindlin renders her verdict and bounds off the bench, and there certainly are no lengthy appeals.|$|E

TNA then introduced a new TNA X Division Championship belt on the May16, 2007 edition of TNA's online podcast TNA Today.

5|$|In {{the first}} main event of SummerSlam wrestlers from the Raw brand competed in an Elimination Chamber match, {{in which the}} ring is {{surrounded}} by a steel structure of chain and girders. The match was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. The buildup to the match began on July 22, 2003, when during the SummerSlam press conference, the <b>authority</b> <b>figure</b> Eric Bischoff, announced that Triple H would defend the championship against Goldberg in a standard wrestling match at the event. On August 4, 2003 during a television episode of Raw, Bischoff changed the stipulations of the match to No disqualification regulations. Later during the episode, another <b>authority</b> <b>figure,</b> Steve Austin, altered Bischoff's announcement, stating that the championship would be contested in an Elimination Chamber match, with Triple H defending his title against Goldberg, Chris Jericho, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. Six days before SummerSlam, during an episode of Raw on August 18, 2003, the rivalry among the six competitors intensified during a promotional interview segment, in which each participant in the Elimination Chamber discussed the match and taunted the other wrestlers. During the show's main event, in which Orton wrestled Goldberg, Nash interfered in the match and attacked Goldberg. Michaels then came down to the ring, but {{as he was about to}} hit Triple H with the World Heavyweight Championship belt, Jericho ran into the ring and hit Michaels with a chair.|$|E

5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) {{and the idea that}} a pastor should be accountable to elders; it is common for pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational <b>authority</b> <b>figure.</b> Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E

She has a brief relationship with Robert Wegler, A.J.'s guidance counselor; he breaks it off abruptly when he suspects that she is manipulating him to improve A.J.'s grades. Tony and Carmela reconcile; Tony promises to be more loyal and agrees to pay for a piece of real estate Carmela wishes to develop.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Against All Odds was a {{standard}} wrestling {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which Jeff Jarrett defended the championship against his on-screen rival Kevin Nash. The bout was announced on the January 21 episode of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, during a pre-taped press conference. On the February 11 episode of Impact!, <b>authority</b> <b>figure</b> Dusty Rhodes added the stipulation that if Jarrett used a guitar (a weapon he often used to win his matches) during the match, he would be automatically disqualified and would lose the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Nash even if the referee did not see him use it.|$|E

5|$|Bundy was {{regarded}} {{by many of}} his young female victims as handsome and charismatic, traits that he exploited to win their trust. He typically approached them in public places, feigning injury or disability, or impersonating an <b>authority</b> <b>figure,</b> before overpowering and assaulting them at more secluded locations. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes {{for hours at a}} time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least 12 of his victims, and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment {{for a period of time}} as mementos. On a few occasions, he simply broke into dwellings at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the impact}} of the predatory deaths {{resemble}} Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People, with the mayor of a small town panicking over how a problem will drive away the tourists. Another source of comparison raised by critics was Moby-Dick, particularly regarding Quint's characterization and the ending featuring a confrontation with the shark; Quint even dies the same way as Captain Ahab. The central character, Chief Brody, fits a common characterization of the disaster genre, an <b>authority</b> <b>figure</b> who is forced to provide guidance to those affected by the sudden tragedy. Focusing on a working class local leads the book's prose to describe the beachgoers with contempt, and Brody to have conflicts with the rich outsider Hooper.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches on the SmackDown brand was between The Undertaker and Edge for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. At Backlash, the Undertaker defeated Edge {{to retain the}} title by forcing him {{to submit to the}} gogoplata, a chokehold move that causes opponents to spit blood (scripted) from their mouths. On the May 2 episode of SmackDown, <b>authority</b> <b>figure</b> Vickie Guerrero stripped the title from the Undertaker, after claiming the gogoplata was an illegal submission hold and she did it to protect the other wrestlers. The following week, Guerrero booked Undertaker in a match for the vacant title at Judgment Day against Edge, who last eliminated Batista in a battle royal, an elimination style match where the last person in the ring is the winner, to become the number one contender.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} at Final Resolution was a {{standard}} wrestling {{match for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Jeff Jarrett, and the challenger, Monty Brown. On the December 24 episode of TNA's primary television program, TNA Impact!, <b>authority</b> <b>figure</b> Dusty Rhodes announced a Three Way Elimination match for Final Resolution involving Brown, Kevin Nash, and Diamond Dallas Page (DDP). The winner of said match would challenge Jarrett for the NWA Championship in the main event. A Three Way Elimination match involves three competitors fighting to eliminate each man by pinfall, submission, or throwing one another over the top rope {{and down to the}} floor until there is one left. Brown defeated Nash and DDP at Final Resolution to gain the opportunity to challenge Jarrett.|$|E
5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they thought {{he should have been}} in the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} <b>authority</b> <b>figure</b> for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket herself or he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E
5|$|The Impact World Tag Team Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling championship contested for in Impact Wrestling's tag team division. After the formation of TNA in June 2002, the company executives signed a contractual agreement with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) that allowed them control of the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships. TNA subsequently changed their name to NWAâ€“TNA, making them an official member of the NWA in the process. In May 2007, the NWA ended their five-year partnership with TNA, and thus regained control of the NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships. As a result, TNA created the TNA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships, which were unveiled on TNA's online podcast TNA Today on the May 15 and May 17, 2007 editions. In the respective editions, the championships were awarded to the last NWA champions under TNA banner by Jeremy Borash and TNA's primary <b>authority</b> <b>figure</b> Jim Cornette. The championship was officially presented {{to the public and}} awarded to the first official champions, Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray), on May 17. The championship was renamed to its current name in March 2017 when the promotion adopted its current name.|$|E
