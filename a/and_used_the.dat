5|$|A {{longtime}} {{fan of the}} English trip hop group Portishead, West {{had been}} significantly influenced by Roseland NYC Live, the band's 1998 live album with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Early in his career, the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hip hop production. Though West {{had not been able}} to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album, the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album. West juxtaposed the lush, intricate melodies of the string section with the hard, pounding drum rhythms of hip-hop, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> sound for the foundation of his rapping.|$|E

5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
5|$|After a {{training}} camp near Nice in southern France Simpson rode in the one-day Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne in Belgium, finishing second to 's Arthur Decabooter.

5|$|After {{losing his}} reelection bid in 1861, Stevenson, a known Confederate sympathizer, {{stayed out of}} public life {{during the war and}} was {{consequently}} able to avoid being imprisoned, as many other Confederate sympathizers were. In 1867, just five days after John L. Helm and Stevenson were elected governor and lieutenant governor, respectively, Helm died and Stevenson became acting governor. Stevenson subsequently won a special election in 1868 to finish Helm's term. As governor, he opposed federal intervention in what he considered state matters but insisted that blacks' newly granted rights be observed <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> state militia to quell post-war violence in the state. Although a fiscal conservative, he advocated a new tax to benefit education and created the state bureau of education.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> standing Roman walls in the town's defences. Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} bus garage by the Chana School District.

In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> building as an overflow classroom.

5|$|After {{years of}} frustration, Honório Hermeto (or Paraná as he became known) had largely recouped the {{prestige}} he had formerly possessed among his peers. He had liquidated his uncle's domestic slave trading business <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> proceeds {{to become a}} coffee plantation owner in 1836. The land he acquired was located in the hills between Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. Although Paraná staunchly opposed {{the abolition of the}} transatlantic African slave trade, the importation of slaves was abolished in 1850 by the Eusébio de Queirós Law. The ban on slave imports seems to have had no impact over Paraná's private affairs; by 1852, he had become a very wealthy man. He also married his son Honório to a niece of Rodrigues Torres, thus establishing a link between his family and the province of Rio de Janeiro's planter aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|An Egyptian historian, {{known by}} his Greek name as Manetho (c. 3rd century BC), {{was the first}} to compile a {{comprehensive}} history of Egypt.

However, the primary sources for Manetho's work were the king list chronicles of previous Egyptian dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients treated with the ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed <b>and</b> <b>used,</b> <b>the</b> ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E

5|$|At {{the reunification}} summit, the {{president}} personally requested Hyun-jun {{to be at}} his side. Concurrently, NSS agents realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall crisis was actually the hostages.

Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. She pretended to be an IRIS agent <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> confusion to stop them. This created mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E

5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 41-yard line <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> good field position to its advantage. After two short-gain plays, Rodgers completed a 16-yard pass and a 24-yard toss to drive the Bears inside the Virginia Tech 20-yard line. Echemandu rushed the ball twice for seven total yards, then Rodgers ran it himself the remaining nine yards for another California touchdown. The touchdown and extra point gave California a 42–28 lead, its largest in the game. Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball with 41seconds remaining in the quarter, and ran four quick plays. After Bryan Randall threw two incompletions, he connected with Ernest Wilford on a long 23-yard pass, and Kevin Jones rushed up {{the middle of the}} field for another 12yards. As time expired in the quarter, Tech was inside California territory for the first time since the beginning of the quarter and had a first down. At the end of the third quarter, California held a 42–28 lead.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff Castle {{was built}} during this period. There are two {{possible}} dates for the construction: William the Conqueror may {{have built a}} castle at Cardiff as early as 1081 on his return from his pilgrimage to St Davids. Alternatively, the first Norman fortification may have been constructed around 1091 by Robert Fitzhamon, the lord of Gloucester. Fitzhamon invaded the region in 1090, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> castle {{as a base for}} the occupation of the rest of southern Glamorgan over the next few years. The site was close to the sea and could be easily supplied by ship, was well protected by the Rivers Taff and Rhymney and also controlled the old Roman road running along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Daybreaker is {{the fifth}} studio album by British metalcore band Architects. It was {{released}} on 28 May 2012 in the United Kingdom and most of Europe and on 5 June 2012 in the United States.

Daybreaker was co-produced by the band and Ben Humphreys at Outhouse Studios in Reading, Berkshire, <b>and</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> same team and studio that were used for recording the band's third studio album, Hollow Crown. Daybreaker was praised by music writers for its variety.|$|E
