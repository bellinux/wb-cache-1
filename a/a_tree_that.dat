Since Brown's original publication had treated all of Fraser's specimens as syntypes for the species, George also chose a lectotype, selecting <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> Fraser had received from Macleay in May 1828.|$|E

The two cry over their loss. Later, the two gather at Finn's outdoor memorial at McKinley, which includes <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> Puck had stolen as a memento and later replanted at Beiste's behest, and Puck tells the coach that he has decided to join the Air Force.|$|E

5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled their homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E

25|$|When {{you take}} <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> {{is rooted in}} the ground, and {{transfer}} it from one place to another, the tree will no longer bear fruit.

25|$|Every finite {{connected}} graph has a spanning tree. However, for infinite {{connected graph}}s, {{the existence of}} spanning trees {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. An infinite graph is connected if each pair of its vertices forms the pair of endpoints of a finite path. As with finite graphs, a tree is a connected graph with no finite cycles, and a spanning tree can be defined either as a maximal acyclic set of edges or as <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> <b>that</b> contains every vertex.|$|E
