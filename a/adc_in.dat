The peace deals which ended the 1990s Tuareg {{insurgency}} in Mali created a new self-governing region, Kidal Region, and provided opportunities for Malian Tuaregs to join the central government in Bamako and the Malian Armed Forces. Unlike the Niger ex-combatants, who appeared successfully integrated into national the Nigerien Armed Forces, small numbers of Malian Tuaregs remained restive, complaining of the Kidal region's poverty. Some were involved in cross border smuggling, and crime was endemic in the region. A splinter faction of the Tuareg ex-combatants rose as the <b>ADC</b> <b>in</b> 2006.

40|$|RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The {{implementation}} of automated dispensing cabinets (<b>ADCs)</b> <b>in</b> healthcare facilities {{appears to be}} increasing, in particular within Australian hospital emergency departments (EDs). While the investment <b>in</b> <b>ADCs</b> is on the increase, no studies have specifically investigated the impacts of ADCs on medication selection and preparation error rates in EDs. Our aim {{was to assess the}} impact of ADCs on medication selection and preparation error rates in an ED of a tertiary teaching hospital. METHODS: Pre intervention and post intervention study involving direct observations of nurses completing medication selection and preparation activities before and after the {{implementation of}} <b>ADCs</b> <b>in</b> the original and new emergency departments within a 377 -bed tertiary teaching hospital in Australia. Medication selection and preparation error rates were calculated and compared between these two periods. Secondary end points included the impact on medication error type and severity. RESULTS: A total of 2087 medication selection and preparations were observed among 808 patients pre and post intervention. Implementation of <b>ADCs</b> <b>in</b> the new ED resulted in a 64. 7 % (1. 96 % versus 0. 69 %, respectively, P =  0. 017) reduction in medication selection and preparation errors. All medication error types were reduced in the post intervention study period. There was an insignificant impact on medication error severity as all errors detected were categorised as minor. CONCLUSION: The implementation of ADCs could reduce medication selection and preparation errors and improve medication safety in an ED setting...|$|R

40|$|Factors that {{contribute}} to the rapid increase in power dissipation as a function of input bandwidth in high speed electronic Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are discussed. We find that the figure of merit (FOM), defined as the energy required per conversion step, increases linearly with bandwidth for high-speed ADCs with moderate to high resolution, or equivalently, the power dissipation increases quadratically. It is shown that by use of photonic time-stretch technique, it is possible to have <b>ADCs</b> <b>in</b> which this FOM remains constant for up to 10 GHz input RF frequency.
