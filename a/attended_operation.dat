40|$|Autonomous mobile robots {{typically}} {{require a}} preconceived and very detailed navigational model (map) of their intended operating environment, but most {{law enforcement and}} urban warfare response scenarios preclude the availability of such a priori information. ROBART III is an advanced demonstration platform for non-lethal robotic response measures, incorporating a supervised autonomous navigation system specifically configured to support minimally <b>attended</b> <b>operation</b> in previously unexplored interior structures. A "human-centered mapping" strategy has been developed to ensure valid first-time interpretation of navigational landmarks as the robot builds its world model. The accuracy of the robot's real-time position estimation (and hence the model itself) is significantly enhanced by an innovative algorithm which exploits a heuristic that assumes the majority of man-made structures are characterized by parallel and orthogonal walls. Intruder detection and assessment capabilities are sup [...] ...|$|E

The analytical comparison was performed primarily with regard to performance and stability and control. A weights, center-of-gravity, and inertia computation was performed for each iteration in the analysis process.
