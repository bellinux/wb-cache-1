While playing back the tapes of a recent session of play, software can generate a scatter plot of the amount bet versus the count {{at the time the}} bet was made and find the trendline that best fits the scattered points. If the player is not counting cards, there will be no trend; his bet variation and the count variation will not consistently correlate. If the player is counting and varying bets according to the count, there will be a trend whose slope reflects the player's <b>average</b> <b>edge</b> from this technique.|$|E

Then, the local extrema are detected which correspond to the start and end points of edges. Finally, the blur metric is achieved by computing the ratio between the <b>average</b> <b>edge</b> length (i.e. the distance between start and end pixel) and the <b>average</b> <b>edge</b> magnitude (i.e. the gray value difference). A high <b>average</b> <b>edge</b> length (and/or a low edge magnitude) indicates that the edges are blurred. In opposite, short edges (and/or high edge magnitudes) means that the edges are sharp.|$|E

An efficient and robust combination of constrained mesh smoothing together with global optimization based algorithm is presented.

Local cost function is modeled with local <b>average</b> <b>edge</b> length, while global cost function includes barycenter and global <b>average</b> <b>edge</b> length.

Methods: A total of 12 cadaveric preserved knees (six right and six left patellae) with close patellar size were chosen to form two groups of six samples. Each group received either plate or tension band-wiring fixation for an experimentally created patella fracture. Cyclic load of an average of 350  N was applied for all specimens and after accomplishing 50 cycles the displacements of all fracture edges were recorded. Results: After completing 50 cycles in each group, the <b>average</b> fracture <b>edges</b> displacement measured in the plate group was 1. 98  ±  0. 299  mm, whereas the <b>average</b> fracture <b>edges</b> displacement measured in the tension band-wire group was 2. 85  ±  0. 768  mm (p =  0. 016).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report a novel method to {{estimate}} the scaling factor of a previously scaled watermarked image and the angle by which the image has been rotated. Scaling and rotation performed on a watermarked image, {{as part of the}} attacks the image may undergo, can very easily confuse the decoder unless it rescales and#or rotates the image back to its original size#orientation, i. e., recover the lost synchronism. To be able do so, the decoder needs to knowby howmuch the image has been scaled and rotated, i. e., needs to know both the scaling factor and the rotation angle. In our approach, we compute the Edges Standard Deviation Ratio #ESDR# which gives us an accurate estimate for the scaling factor. The rotation angle is approximated by the <b>Average</b> <b>Edges</b> Angles Di#erence #AEAD#. Both ESDR and AEAD are computed from wavelet maxima locations whichhave been estimated form the non orthogonal dyadic wavelet transform.
