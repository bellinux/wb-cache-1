5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into interstellar space, distances between stars <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Common {{agreement}} about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule {{has generally been}} chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; {{that is why it}} is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.|$|E

And if the matters <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>great,</b> or so much of grace, that the Chancellor and the others cannot do what is asked without the King, then they shall take them to the King to know his will, and that no petition come before the King and his Council except by the hands of the said Chancellor and the other chief ministers; so that the King and his Council may be able, without the embarrassment of other business, to attend to the important business of his kingdom and his foreign lands.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} {{shot on the}} streets of Los Angeles and in a studio soundstage. It begins with Frusciante {{standing}} alone on a pedestal wearing a red-and-white-striped collared shirt, brown khaki pants, brown shoes, and a purple, green and multicolored chullo, with white stitched wolves in the middle. He plays a 1966 Ocean Turquoise Fender Jaguar behind the backdrop of a desert and an inverted cloudy sky. His shadow is projected on the left and right of where he stands. Frusciante's then-girlfriend, Toni Oswald, selected his clothes that day. Frusciante remembers Van Sant's surprised, though favorable, reaction: [...] "when I got [...] Gus Van Sant was just looking at me and going 'God I'm so glad you wore that hat. I'm so glad you wore that shirt. Oh! Those pants <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> I'm so glad you wore those'". The video marks a significant shift in Frusciante's on-camera behavior; he no longer wished to jump around fervently as he had done in the band's prior music videos.|$|E
500|$|It took Levi {{approximately}} {{one year to}} record all of his dialogue {{due in part to}} his busy schedule. Levi recorded once every six weeks for six hours at a time, recording each of his lines at least twice. The actor's voice ultimately helped shape and develop Flynn's character. Howard explained, [...] "He's so smart and clever, and his adlibs <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>great,</b> and you like him straight away ... he brings that to Flynn." [...] On Levi's own influence on his character, the actor explained that Flynn's [...] "voice was really just a slight variation of [...] own". Wanting to sound [...] "more appropriate" [...] for the film's medieval setting, Levi [...] "cleaned up [...] own diction and made things a little bit more polished", referring to Flynn's accent as Mid-Atlantic. Describing Tangled as a [...] "very family friendly" [...] version of Romancing the Stone (1984), Levi studied and channelled the film's star, American actor Michael Douglas, and English legend Robin Hood. However, when Levi heard his performance in its entirety for the first time after the film's release, the actor admitted that he was ultimately dissatisfied with his performance, explaining, [...] "I felt like I sounded incredibly nasally and I was plugged up," [...] likening the experience to hearing one's voice played back on an answering machine.|$|E

In 1938 the British government issued a policy statement declaring that [...] "the political, administrative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States inside Palestine <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that this solution of the problem is impracticable". Representatives of Arabs and Jews were invited to London for the St. James Conference, which proved unsuccessful.|$|E

(1 May 1862 – 16 February 1928), was a British Indian attorney, {{politician}} and {{former mayor of}} Karachi, in modern-day Pakistan. He is considered a great Sindhi {{and the father of}} modern Karachi.

2500|$|If {{a viable}} hybrid embryo is {{obtained}} via gene editing procedures, {{it may be}} possible to implant it into a female Asian elephant housed in a zoo, but with the current knowledge and technology, it is unlikely that the hybrid embryo would be carried through the two-year gestation. [...] To illustrate one of the many difficulties, it can be noted that the genetic differences between an Asian elephant and an African elephant <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that they actually cannot be interbred, but on one ocassion a pair produced a live calf named Motty that died of organ defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E

2500|$|Jesus' miraculous {{conception}} by the Holy Spirit {{is found}} only in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. Both probably date from the period 80-100 AD, and both were originally anonymous (the attributions to Matthew and Luke were added in the 2nd century). It is widely, though not universally, accepted that both {{are based on the}} Gospel of Mark, but Mark has no birth story, and the differences between Matthew and Luke <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that it is highly unlikely either comes from the other or that they shared a common independent source. Some scholars, notably Raymond E. Brown, have suggested that Joseph was the source of Matthew's account and Mary of Luke's, but modern scholars consider this [...] "highly unlikely", given that this so-called family tradition supposedly emerged only at a late stage in the Christian tradition.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the first book, fear of another Breaking of the World and the dangers posed by saidin's {{corruption}} <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that—while increasingly rare—male channelers are now a source of nightmares and terror to most people. The original symbol of the Aes Sedai—a circle separated into black and white halves by a sinuous line symbolizing both halves of the One Power—has been replaced by the Flame of Tar Valon, consisting only of the white half of the original symbol. The male half of the symbol, known as the dragon's fang, is used as a symbol of evil and a curse—often carved onto the doors of those accused of conspiring with the Dark Lord (known as Darkfriends). The term Aes Sedai – used as a name, title and honorific – refers almost exclusively to female channelers, most often specifically referring to members of an exclusive society headquartered in the White Tower in Tar Valon. Divided into several factions identified by color, known as Ajahs, the Aes Sedai present a unified face to the world but often experience great internal conflict. They refer to each other as [...] "sisters" [...] but maintain a rigid hierarchy of authority determined by custom and strength in the One Power.|$|E
