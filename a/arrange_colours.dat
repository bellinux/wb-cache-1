40|$|One {{aspect of}} Computational Aesthetics is {{the finding of}} {{harmonic}} colours for the objects in a scene. Although the obtained degree of colour harmony is a subjective criterion, experience shows that on average human observers tend to have quite similar responses to individual colour stimuli and their combinations. This observation {{is the basis for}} what is commonly referred to as Colour Order Systems (COS), which aim to <b>arrange</b> <b>colours</b> in a fashion such that users can intuitively select individual colours – or even whole sets of them – according to some criterion. However, when dealing with a spectral rendering system, the use of traditional colour space COS to obtain pleasant associations of colours becomes impossible, principally due to metamerism. An interesting problem would be the derivation of a COS for spectral data which includes the ability to deal with fluorescent colours, the indirect goal of such a metric system being the selection of aesthetically pleasing colour values for a spectral renderer.

40|$|Patients with {{cerebral}} achromatopsia, a perceptual disorder {{caused by}} ventromedial occipital brain damage, can be completely unable to <b>arrange</b> <b>colours</b> in chromatic sequence and fail most conventional tests of colour blindness. A {{possible explanation for}} cerebral achromatopsia is that the colour-opponent parvocellular (P) channel has been selectively and totally destroyed {{at the level of}} visual cortex, leaving vision to be mediated by the broad-band magnocellular (M) channel. The persistence of normal occipital visually evoked potentials, and preserved sensitivity to isoluminant chromatic gratings indicates that if this hypothesis is correct the destruction must occur beyond the striate cortex. We have shown that an achromatopsic subject can detect chromatic borders and construct shape from colour, and that he can even perceive the apparent direction of motion of a phase shifted isoluminant chromatic grating where perceived direction depends on knowing the sign of the colour diffence, i. e., which colour is which in the stripes. This and other evidence suggests that perhaps only one part of the cortical P channel has been destroyed. Does the critical area involved in achromatopsia correspond to cortical area V 4 of monkeys, often implicated in processing wavelength? When Visual Area 4 is totally ablated in monkeys they have only a mild colour discrimination impairment and easily solve the colour ordering and colour selection tasks that an achromatopsic patient finds impossible. However, monkeys with ventromedial damage rostral to Area V 4 do perform like achromatopsic patients, suggesting that the role of V 4 in the perception of colour is still unclear and that the colour area of the human brain does not correspond to area V 4...|$|E

5|$|Once the {{infantry}} {{had reached the}} German trenches, the artillery shifted from the creeping barrage to the standing barrage, a static barrage that would protect {{the infantry}} from counter-attack while they consolidated the position. A variant was the box barrage, in which three or four barrages formed a box—or more often three sides of a box—around a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up into the front line. This was normally used to protect trench raids, although {{it could also be}} used offensively against a German unit. Another type of barrage was the SOS barrage, fired in response to a German counterattack. An SOS barrage could be brought down by firing a flare signal of a pre <b>arranged</b> <b>colour,</b> as a German barrage tended to cut the telephone lines. A pre-registered barrage would then descend on No Man's Land.|$|R
60|$|It is a marvellous {{thing to}} me that book after book should appear on this last subject, without {{apparently}} the slightest consciousness {{on the part of}} the writers that the first necessity of beauty in colour is gradation, as the first necessity of beauty in line is curvature,--or that the second necessity in colour is mystery or subtlety, as the second necessity in line is softness. Colour ungradated is wholly valueless; colour unmysterious is wholly barbarous. Unless it looses itself and melts away towards other colours, as a true line loses itself and melts away towards other lines, colour has no proper existence, in the noble sense of the word. What a cube, or tetrahedron, is to organic form, ungradated and unconfused colour is to organic colour; and a person who attempts to <b>arrange</b> <b>colour</b> harmonies without gradation of tint is in precisely the same category, as an artist who should try to compose a beautiful picture out of an accumulation of cubes and parallelepipeds.|$|R

2500|$|After his marriage, Millais {{began to}} paint {{in a broader}} style, which was {{condemned}} by Ruskin as [...] "a catastrophe." [...] It {{has been argued that}} this change of style resulted from Millais's need to increase his output to support his growing family. Unsympathetic critics such as William Morris accused him of [...] "selling out" [...] to achieve popularity and wealth. His admirers, in contrast, pointed to the artist's connections with Whistler and Albert Moore, and influence on John Singer Sargent. Millais himself argued that as he grew more confident as an artist, he could paint with greater boldness. In his article [...] "Thoughts on our art of Today" [...] (1888) he recommended Velázquez and Rembrandt as models for artists to follow. Paintings such as The Eve of St. Agnes and The Somnambulist clearly show an ongoing dialogue between the artist and Whistler, whose work Millais strongly supported. Other paintings of the late 1850s and 1860s can be interpreted as anticipating aspects of the Aesthetic Movement. Many deploy broad blocks of harmoniously <b>arranged</b> <b>colour</b> and are symbolic rather than narratival. From 1862, the Millais family lived at 7 Cromwell Place, Kensington, London.|$|R

5000|$|In Gauguin's {{painting}} {{the figure of}} the older woman is recognisably Madame Ginoux who ran the Café de la Gare where Vincent had lodged and which he and Gauguin continued to patronise after moving into the nearby Yellow House. Vincent's figures are generally taken to be his mother and sister Willemien. Vincent 's biographer Marc Edo Tralbaut, however, was of the opinion that the younger woman was, consciously or unconsciously, a representation of Kee Vos Stricker. Vincent was somewhat enigmatic on the subject {{in a letter to his}} sister: I’ve already replied to you that I didn’t like Mother’s portrait enormously. I’ve now just painted a reminiscence of the garden at Etten, to put in my bedroom, and here’s a croquis of it. It’s quite a big canvas.Now here are the colours. The younger of the two women walking is wearing a Scottish shawl with green and orange checks and carrying a red parasol. The old one has a blue-violet shawl, almost black. But a bunch of dahlias, some lemon yellow, others variegated pink and white, explode against this sombre figure.Behind them a few emerald-green cedar or cypress bushes. Behind these cypresses one catches a glimpse of a bed of pale green and red cabbages, surrounded by a border of little white flowers. The sandy path is a raw orange, the foliage of two beds of scarlet geraniums is very green. Finally, in the middle ground is a maidservant dressed in blue who’s arranging plants with a profusion of white, pink, yellow and vermilion-red flowers.There you are, I know it isn’t perhaps much of a resemblance, but for me it conveys the poetic character and the style of the garden as I feel them. In the same way, let’s suppose that these two women walking are you and our mother. Let’s even suppose then that there may be not the slightest, absolutely not the slightest vulgar and fatuous resemblance, the deliberate choice of colour, the dark violet violently blotched with the lemon yellow of the dahlias, suggests Mother’s personality to me.The figure in the Scottish plaid with the orange and green checks standing out against the dark green of the cypress, this contrast even more exaggerated by the red parasol, gives me an idea of you, vaguely a figure like those in Dickens’s novels.I don’t know if you’ll understand that one can speak poetry just by <b>arranging</b> <b>colours</b> well, just as one can say comforting things in music. In the same way the bizarre lines, sought out and multiplied, and snaking all over the painting, aren’t intended to render the garden in its vulgar resemblance but draw it for us as if seen in a dream, in character and yet at the same time stranger than the reality.|$|R

He rose at a very early hour, flung his windows open, looked out no doubt towards those other windows in the neighbouring hotel, where he may have fancied he saw a curtain stirring, drawn by a hand that every hour now he longed more to press. He turned back into his chamber with a sort of groan, and surveyed some of the relics of the last night's little feast, which still remained on the table. There were the champagne-flasks which poor Jack Belsize had emptied, the tall seltzer-water bottle, from which the gases had issued and mingled with the hot air of the previous night's talk; glasses with dregs of liquor, ashes of cigars, or their black stumps, strewing the cloth; the dead men, the burst guns of yesterday's battle.

They have the same general form, structure, and habits: they possess the same protective odour, and are equally abundant in individuals, although not so varied in colour, blue and white spots on a black ground being the most general pattern. The insects which mimic these are chiefly Papilios, and Diadema, a genus allied to our peacock and tortoiseshell butterflies. In tropical Africa there is a peculiar group of the genus Danais, characterized by dark-brown and bluish-white <b>colours,</b> <b>arranged</b> in bands or stripes. One of these, Danais niavius, is exactly imitated both by Papilio hippocoon and by Diadema anthedon; another, Danais echeria, by Papilio cenea; and in Natal a variety of the Danais is found having a white spot at the tip of wings, accompanied by a variety of the Papilio bearing a corresponding white spot. Acræa gea is copied in its very peculiar style of colouration by the female of Papilio cynorta, by Panopæa hirce, and by the female of Elymnias phegea. Acræa euryta of Calabar has a female variety of Panopea hirce from the same place which exactly copies it; and Mr. Trimen, in his paper on Mimetic Analogies among African Butterflies, published in the Transactions of the Linnæan Society for 1868, gives a list of no less than sixteen species and varieties of Diadema and its allies, and ten of Papilio, which in their colour and markings are perfect mimics of species or varieties of Danais or Acræa which inhabit the same districts.|$|R

The project centres around a limited edition book work, which explores their shared interests in composition, notation, drawing, music and silence. Repetition and near–repetition, rotation and permutation are also of importance, as is accuracy and inaccuracy {{of the human}} hand, resulting in fluctuations in touch and pulse. The book contains a drawing and a score: The drawing consists of points of <b>colour</b> <b>arranged</b> in patterned formations, which is rotated throughout the book by means of screen print, each time with the points of colour in a different position. The score is shown with all performance indications, staves and stems removed leaving only the notes. The book incorporates performance scores and a DVD of 10 Chromatic Fields for piano; compositions consisting of 176 single notes. These are the 88 notes of a piano played once through and then repeated; the difference between each piece being {{the order of the}} notes. What remains is contour and reflection. An exhibition of the book and related drawings took place at Art at Wharepuke Gallery, New Zealand in September 2012 The book was also exhibited at part of the Soundwaves Festival, University of Brighton and at the Friends Meeting House, which included a promenade performance of Chromatic Fields 51 to 59.
