5000|$|In the {{semiconductor}} at the smaller voltage {{shown in the}} top panel, the positive charge placed on the left face of the insulator lowers {{the energy of the}} valence band edge. Consequently, these states are fully occupied out to a so-called depletion depth where the bulk occupancy reestablishes itself because the field cannot penetrate further. Because the valence band levels near the surface are fully occupied due to the lowering of these levels, only the immobile negative acceptor-ion charges are present near the surface, which becomes an electrically insulating region without holes (the depletion layer). Thus, field penetration is arrested when the exposed negative <b>acceptor</b> <b>ion</b> charge balances the positive charge placed on the insulator surface: the depletion layer adjusts its depth enough to make the net negative <b>acceptor</b> <b>ion</b> charge balance the positive charge on the gate.|$|E
5000|$|Electrons {{and holes}} diffuse into regions with lower {{concentrations}} of electrons and holes, much as ink diffuses into water {{until it is}} uniformly distributed. By definition, N-type semiconductor has an excess of free electrons compared to the P-type region, and P-type has an excess of holes compared to the N-type region. Therefore, when N-doped and P-doped pieces of semiconductor are placed {{together to form a}} junction, electrons migrate into the P-side and holes migrate into the N-side. Departure of an electron from the N-side to the P-side leaves a positive donor ion behind on the N-side, and likewise the hole leaves a negative <b>acceptor</b> <b>ion</b> on the P-side.|$|E
50|$|The {{example in}} the figure shows the Fermi level in the bulk {{material}} beyond {{the range of the}} applied field as lying close to the valence band edge. This position for the occupancy level is arranged by introducing impurities into the semiconductor. In this case the impurities are so-called acceptors which soak up electrons from the valence band becoming negatively charged, immobile ions embedded in the semiconductor material. The removed electrons are drawn from the valence band levels, leaving vacancies or holes in the valence band. Charge neutrality prevails in the field-free region because a negative <b>acceptor</b> <b>ion</b> creates a positive deficiency in the host material: a hole is the absence of an electron, it behaves like a positive charge. Where no field is present, neutrality is achieved because the negative acceptor ions exactly balance the positive holes.|$|E

50|$|The {{conduction}} band edge also is lowered, increasing electron occupancy of these states, but at low voltages this increase is not significant. At larger applied voltages, however, {{as in the}} bottom panel, the {{conduction band}} edge is lowered sufficiently to cause significant population of these levels in a narrow surface layer, called an inversion layer because the electrons are opposite in polarity to the holes originally populating the semiconductor. This onset of electron charge in the inversion layer becomes very significant at an applied threshold voltage, and once the applied voltage exceeds this value charge neutrality is achieved almost entirely by addition of electrons to the inversion layer rather than {{by an increase in}} <b>acceptor</b> <b>ion</b> charge by expansion of the depletion layer. Further field penetration into the semiconductor is arrested at this point, as the electron density increases exponentially with band-bending beyond the threshold voltage, effectively pinning the depletion layer depth at its value at threshold voltages.|$|E
