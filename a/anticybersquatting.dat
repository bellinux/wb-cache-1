50|$|Microsoft sued several {{parties for}} {{contributory}} cybersquatting—that is, encouraging others (through software and instructional videos) to cybersquat on domain names that infringed on Microsoft's trademarks. Microsoft prevailed {{in court and}} also established a precedent that liabilities under the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) include contributory trademark infringement.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{behavior}} with trademarks led the United States government {{to the passage of}} the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act. The ACPA, however, protects only the registration of trademarks as domain names and would not help the U.S. government with the registration of the names of its offices or agencies.|$|E

50|$|A {{large part}} of the first major landrush was cybersquatting, a {{practice}} in which individuals strategically purchase high-value domain names for resale at a higher price.

5000|$|The <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act {{does not}} {{expressly}} recognize reverse domain name hijacking and often only limits defendants’ recovery to retention or transference of the domain name. [...] It also fails {{to provide any}} remedies for victims of attempted reverse cybersquatting. [...] However, the statute permits some monetary relief where bad faith, reckless disregard or the willful violation of a court order are involved.|$|E
50|$|Cybersquatting (also {{known as}} domain squatting), {{according}} to the United States federal law known as the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent {{to profit from the}} goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price.|$|E
50|$|Some {{countries}} have specific laws against cybersquatting beyond the normal rules of trademark law. The United States, for example, has the U.S. <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) of 1999. This {{expansion of the}} Lanham (Trademark) Act (15 U.S.C.) is intended to provide protection against cybersquatting for individuals as well as owners of distinctive trademarked names. However, even notable personalities, including rock star Bruce Springsteen and actor Kevin Spacey, failed to obtain control of their names on the internet.|$|E
50|$|If a party loses a UDRP proceeding, in many jurisdictions it {{may still}} bring {{a lawsuit against}} the domain name {{registrant}} under local law. For example, the administrative panel's UDRP decision can be challenged and overturned in a U.S. court of law by means of e.g. the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act. If a domain name registrant loses a UDRP proceeding, it must file {{a lawsuit against the}} trademark holder within ten days to prevent ICANN from transferring the domain name.|$|E
50|$|Both the Panavision and Intermatic {{cases were}} matters of first {{impression}} for the U.S. Courts {{in dealing with}} trademarks and domain registrations. The practice of registering trademarked words as domains for sale to trademark holders became known as Cybersquatting, a term that was first used by a court in 1998. In November 1999, after the Panavision case had ended, and while Intermatic Inc. v. Toeppen was still pending, the United States gave trademark holders a cause of action against registrants of domain names containing trademarks, in the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft Corp. v. Shah was an <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) case {{heard before}} the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. Microsoft sued the defendants, Amish Shah and others, for, among other charges, {{contributory}} cybersquatting for encouraging others, through videos and software, to infringe on Microsoft's trademarks. The case was {{settled out of}} court in July 2011 after judge Ricardo S. Martinez denied Shah's motion for dismissal. Legal observers suggested that, if upheld, the case would prove notable for the court's expansionof the ACPA liability to include contributory cybersquatting.|$|E

5000|$|Although PETA did not {{initially}} allege that Doughney violated the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), it raised it during its request for summary judgement. Before {{and during the}} litigation, Doughney made statements suggesting that PETA should [...] "settle" [...] with him and [...] "make him an offer". This was seen by the court as his attempt {{to profit from the}} peta.org domain. Because of this {{and the fact that the}} domain name is identical to the distinctive PETA trademark, the court ruled that Doughney violated the ACPA. However, the court further held that PETA was not entitled to damages because Doughney registered and used the domain prior to ACPA's enactment. Instead Doughney was merely required to surrender the domain.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d), is a U.S. law {{enacted in}} 1999 that {{established}} {{a cause of}} action for registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name confusingly similar to, or dilutive of, a trademark or personal name. The law was designed to thwart “cybersquatters” who register Internet domain names containing trademarks with no intention of creating a legitimate web site, but instead plan to sell the domain name to the trademark owner or a third party. Critics of the ACPA complain about the non-global scope of the Act and its potential to restrict free speech, while others dispute these complaints. Before the ACPA was enacted, trademark owners relied heavily on the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA) to sue domain name registrants. The FTDA was enacted in 1995 in part {{with the intent to}} curb domain name abuses. The legislative history of the FTDA specifically mentions that trademark dilution in domain names was a matter of Congressional concern motivating the Act. Senator Leahy stated that “it is my hope that this anti-dilution statute can help stem the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who are choosing marks that are associated with the products and reputations of others”.|$|E
40|$|The {{explosion}} in Internet {{technology in the}} past decade has drawn the Lanham Act into the realm of electronic commerce. Trademark owners seeking to register domain names have recently found themselves entwined in a number of disputes, such as disputes involving claims to multiple domain names and disputes over whether the domain name registration system is fairly administered. One important legal issue that has recently come to the fore is over the practice of cybersquatting. Today, courts must contend with the cybersquatter, a speculator who reserves trademarks as Internet domain names {{for the sole purpose of}} selling or licensing them back to trademark owners willing to pay a considerable price for their use. Complicating matters, the most potent weapons in the Government 2 ̆ 7 s <b>anticybersquatting</b> arsenal [...] the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) and Federal Trademark Dilution Act (FTDA) [...] each give rise to grave constitutional concerns...|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} trademark law’s {{doctrine of}} initial interest confusion, {{which is currently}} applied to Internet cases. First, it argues that the doctrine is problematic {{because it does not}} require the traditional showing of likelihood of confusion, it is superfluous, and it is unnecessary in the Internet context. Second, it proposes that courts should instead rely on the likelihood of confusion analysis. Additionally, courts should acknowledge that metatags are an outdated issue, and, when it comes to domain names, they should make use of the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (“ACPA”) ...|$|E
40|$|Websites have {{provided}} a very strong platform for businesses to reach their customers. They surpass the regular billboards by providing portals through which transactions are conducted without any physical contacts between a seller and a buyer. This usefulness {{underscores the importance of}} domain names through which websites are navigated. Cybersquatters have in bad faith targeted or hijacked domain names of famous and reputable businesses exploiting the goodwill of these names and misleading customers and other internet users. This paper explores the construction of bad faith under both the Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy and the US <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act. The paper argues that, despite some inconsistencies, â€œbad faithâ€ elements have been broadly interpreted to embrace various activities of cybersquatters. It cautions that an overzealous application of the instruments may stifle freedom of speech...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In October, the ICANN, {{a global}} not-for-profit {{organization}} {{responsible for the}} governance of the Internet, was established. Its mandate includes the coordination {{and control of the}} Internet domain name system. In the past, the registration of domain names was handled {{on the basis of the}} principle of “first come, first served”. This had the side effect of cybersquatting, i. e. the practice of registering brand names and selling the registered domains to the trademark owners or their competitors. The World Intellectual Property Organization produced a Report on the Internet Domain Name Process with proposals that would limit trademark infringements. In USA the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Act has been passed, which empowers courts to order registrars to cancel domain names or transfer them to the trademark owner if the registrant acted with a bad-faith intent to profit from the trademark. ICANN has developed a Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy which allows conflicting parties to settle their conflicts on-line as an alternative to conflict settlement in court...|$|E
40|$|In 1999, Congress {{passed the}} <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) to combat “cybersquatters” who profited by {{registering}} domain names that were confusingly similar to established trademarks. Under the ACPA, trademark owners {{have a specific}} cause of action against domain name registrants accused of cybersquatting. Moreover, the law gives U. S. courts in rem jurisdiction over trademark infringing domain names registered to parties that {{are not subject to}} personal jurisdiction. Over the past decade, proceeding in rem against domain names has proven to be an effective strategy for trademark owners. While many companies have used the ACPA against cybersquatters, others have relied on the in rem provision to secure domain names registered to foreign companies that happen to use a similar mark for their goods or services. From a policy perspective, this latter practice is troubling because it allows district courts to determine whether foreign companies can use their marks as domain names, even if these companies lack minimum contacts with the court’s forum. To prevent such overreach, courts should limit the ACPA’s in rem jurisdiction to domain names that were registered in a bad faith attempt to profit from another’s trademark...|$|E
40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, the federal {{judiciary}} has struggled to reconcile {{the conflict between the}} territorial restrictions of International Shoe 2 ̆ 7 s framework for personal jurisdiction and cybersquatting claims filed pursuant to the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (ACPA). The International Shoe framework conditions the exercise of personal jurisdiction on a geographic nexus between a nonresident defendant and the forum state. Logically, this rubric is at odds with cybersquatting [...] a form of trademark infringement entirely within the virtual confines of the Internet. In uBID, Inc. v. GoDaddy Group, Inc., the Seventh Circuit upheld personal jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation accused of cybersquatting by bending the International Shoe framework beyond its breaking point. Although this opinion will surely become the darling of future plaintiffs in cybersquatting suits, the divergent analyses used by the court majority and concurrence demonstrate why cybersquatting has outgrown the limitations of International Shoe. This Note will argue that the proper means of resolving the disjunction between International Shoe and cybersquatting lies with Congress, rather than the federal courts. Thus, namely, a congressional amendment to the ACPA that provides for nationwide service of process will allow the federal judiciary to continue reaching the equitable decision seen in GoDaddy [...] without setting dangerous precedent that eviscerates the jurisdictional framework of International Shoe...|$|E
40|$|In this piece, we take up {{the case}} of the domain name system as an example of {{challenges}} and solutions for realspace sovereigns in cyberspace. First, we analyze the 'in rem' provision of the US <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), which purports to expand the scope of the ACPA to encompass disputes with little direct connection with the United States. In reality, there exist no cases of foreign cybersquatting as to which the 'in rem' provision will be both applicable and constitutional. Instead the ACPA 'in rem' provision is notable primarily for its aggressive assertion of jurisdiction, leading us to consider the (often overlooked) role of realspace sovereigns in the regulation of the domain names system. By mapping the logical control over the domain names system-the distributed hierarchy that is the basis of the system's design-onto realspace territory, the potential for sovereign regulation of the system becomes apparent. We argue that the regulatory significance of geography, and the essentially arbitrary nature of the present territorial locations of the key components of the domain name system implies the future segmentation of the domain name system, and the resulting dramatic decrease in its value. Accordingly, we argue that realspace sovereigns (and especially the United States) have strong interests in avoiding segmentation, and thus must seek to coordinate the regulation of the system.

40|$|This book Konstantinos Komaitis {{identifies}} a tripartite problem - intellectual, {{institutional and}} ethical - {{inherent in the}} domain name regulation culture. Using the theory of property, Komaitis discusses domain names as sui generis 'e-property' rights and analyses {{the experience of the}} past ten years, through the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) and the <b>Anticybersquatting</b> Consumer Protection Act (ACPA). The institutional deficit he identifies, generates a further discussion on the ethical dimensions in the regulation of domain names and prompts Komaitis to suggest the creation of an environment based on justice. The relationship between trademarks and domain names has always been contentious and the existing institutions of the UDRP and ACPA have not assisted in alleviating the tension between the two identifiers. Over the past ten years, the trademark community has been systematic in encouraging and promoting a culture that indiscriminately considers domain names as secondclass citizens, suggesting that trademark rights should have priority over the registration in the domain name space. Komaitis disputes this assertion and brings to light the injustices and the trademark-oriented nature of the UDRP and ACPA. He queries what the appropriate legal source to protect registrants when not seeking to promote trademark interests is. He also delineates a legal hypothesis on their nature as well as the steps of their institutionalisation process that we need to reverse, seeking to create a just framework for the regulation of domain names. Finally he explores how the current policies contribute to the philosophy of domain names as second-class citizens...|$|E
