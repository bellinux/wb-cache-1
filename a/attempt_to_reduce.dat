5|$|A new {{electoral system}} of two-round voting had been {{introduced}} for the 2004 regional elections, in part in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the FN's influence in regional councils. The FN won 15.1% {{of the vote in}} metropolitan France, almost the same as in 1998, but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new electoral system. For the 2004 European elections too, a new system less favourable to the FN {{had been introduced}}. The party regained some of its strength from 1999, earning 9.8% of the vote and seven seats.|$|E

However, generally the station reduced it CO2 emissions by 65% between 1990 and 2010, and the local air quality meets UK and European standards.|$|E
5|$|The term {{greenwashing}} {{was first}} used by environmentalist Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to “save the environment”. Westerveld noted {{that there was little}} else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then greenwashing has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for greenwashing established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> or curb it.|$|E

In an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> costs, Uchikoshi asked Chunsoft if he could develop Virtue's Last Reward and its eventual sequel simultaneously, as both games would use the same engine and digital assets; Chunsoft agreed to his proposal, and green-lit production.|$|E
5|$|As the 49th Congress {{gathered}} in 1885, Cleveland's {{position on the}} tariff was still largely unknown. Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker, busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee. In February 1886, Morrison, still the chairman of Ways and Means, proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $10 million worth of federal bonds each month. Cleveland opposed the plan, and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it. Later that year, however, Cleveland supported Morrison's <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the tariff. Again, Republicans and Randall's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure. In the lame-duck session of 1887, Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors. The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall's protectionists, but Republicans {{and the rest of}} the Democratic caucus rejected it.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, a New Year's Eve benefit {{event was}} held for the Council on Religion and the Homosexual. Police stood outside with large floodlights, and {{in an effort to}} intimidate took {{photographs}} of anyone entering the building. Later, several officers demanded that they be allowed inside. Three lawyers explained to them that under California law, the event was a private party and they could not enter unless they bought tickets. The lawyers were then arrested. Several ministers who were in attendance held a press conference the next morning, likening the SFPD to the Gestapo. Even the Catholic archbishop strongly condemned the actions of the police. In an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> such harassment two officers were tasked with improving the police department's relationship with the gay community.|$|E

A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the largest shareholders via their company, Cubic Expression.

5|$|Manchester United was floated on {{the stock}} market in June 1991 (raising £6.7million), and {{received}} yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch – now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover.

5|$|Other factors {{thought to}} affect this species include {{predation}} by introduced mammals, such as cats and foxes, changes to water quality at breeding sites, herbicide use, {{and loss of}} habitat through the destruction of wetlands. The amphibian chytrid fungus appears to have led to {{at least some of}} the decline in numbers, but the relative importance of the various factors is unclear. The frogs may have become more susceptible to chytrid rather than the fungus being more common. The genetic pool of the frogs has been found to be relatively small, attributed to habitat destruction, which has confined the smaller groups of frogs to isolated pockets and increased the incidence of inbreeding. This has led to proposals for frog populations to be mixed by human intervention in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> negative genetic effects and boost survival rates.|$|E

5|$|The {{designers}} {{of the tracks}} at Altenberg and Oberhof, East Germany, the Olympic tracks in La Plagne, France, and Calgary, Canada, were consulted during planning. Five companies bid for the concrete construction work, which was awarded to {{a joint venture between}} Aker Entreprenør and Veidekke for NOK45 million. Also the construction of the buildings was awarded to the same group. The track {{was the first of the}} Olympic venues for the 1994 games for which construction started. After construction started, Minister of Culture Åse Kleveland (Labour Party) suggested in March 1991, in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> costs, that the 1994 Olympic bobsleigh and luge events be held at La Plagne, the site of the events for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. The French authorities were positive, given that Norway pay for part of the construction costs, but the idea was rejected by LOOC-president Gerhard Heiberg. Also fellow party members reacted, who emphasized that NOK30 million had already been used on blasting the track route.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Ouadi Doum was {{a severe}} setback for Libya. Deserted {{by most of}} their Chadian allies, Libyan forces found {{themselves}} isolated in foreign territory, {{and the loss of}} the main Libyan air base in Chad prevented Libya from providing close air cover to its troops. In general, the offensive against FANT had exposed the vulnerability of Libya's heavy armor to a more mobile enemy. On Gaddafi's orders, a general withdrawal was undertaken from Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture, beginning with Faya-Largeau. The town had served as the main Libyan base during the preceding four years, but was in danger of being encircled. Its garrison of 3,000 men, together with the survivors of Ouadi Doum, retired toward the Libyan base at Maatan-as-Sarra, north of the Chadian border. In an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the damage inflicted to his international standing, Gaddafi announced that Libya had won the confrontation, and was now leaving Chad so that the opposition could play its part in fighting Habré.|$|E
5|$|Course {{officials}} resumed work by drilling shafts {{into the}} surface to form a well and installed a cap on it in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> the drainage problem {{before the start of}} Friday's scheduled sessions. It was mooted by some British press publications that the race would be moved to the track's infield road course but this could not be achieved because the circuit did not hold a licence from motorsport's world governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, to hold an event on this section, and the teams did not bring a suitable aerodynamic package. Drainage problems continued to affect the track leading to the cancellation of the qualifying session, and the starting order was determined by the drivers order in the points' standings. The pole position was awarded to Bräck, his sixth of the season. He was joined on the grid's front row by de Ferran. Andretti was third, Castroneves fourth and Dixon fifth. Dario Franchitti, Patrick Carpentier, Cristiano da Matta, Roberto Moreno and Tony Kanaan rounded out the top ten. Drying efforts continued overnight with additional equipment and extra workers from across England brought in to help improve the track's drainage. Five jet dryers were taken onto the track with additional fuel transported from Sywell Aerodrome to help the vehicles carry out their operation. Additionally, thousands of small holes were created in the track's surface to release moisture.|$|E
