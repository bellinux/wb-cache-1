5|$|Many CAS family {{proteins}} {{have altered}} activity and functional roles in cancer progression and metastasis, with functional roles in influencing cellular adhesion, migration and drug resistance. Changes in CASS4 {{may also be}} associated with human malignancies. CASS4 function was linked to {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) in a study by Miao et al. that correlated elevated CASS4 expression with lymph node metastasis and high TNM stage. In addition, this study detected <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> cytoplasmic accumulation of CASS4 protein between high (H1299 and BE1) and low (LTE and A549) metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines. These may suggest CASS4 as a possible prognostic marker in clinical management of NSCLC.|$|E

In February 1925, Leane hosted a conference of commissioners of police from around Australia held in Adelaide. Leane actively supported commemorative activities such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, and attended unveilings of memorials. In April 1926, Leane relinquished command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade, and was placed on the unattached list. For his military service since 1905, he had also been awarded the Volunteer Officers' Decoration.|$|E

Lovato has received {{a considerable number of}} accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award, 13 Teen Choice Awards, five People's Choice Awards, an ALMA Award, and a Latin American Music Award. Outside the entertainment industry, Lovato has been involved with several social and environmental causes since the launch of her career. In May 2013, she was cited for her dedication as a mentor to teens and young adults with mental health challenges at a National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day hosted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in Washington, D.C.. She has also become an advocate for the LGBT community, and women's rights. In 2014, she was announced as the Grand Marshal for LA Pride week, and that same year she became the face for the Human Rights Campaign's Americans for Marriage Equality Campaign. In April 2016, Lovato was honored with the GLAAD Vanguard Award for making <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> promoting equal rights for LGBT people.|$|E
5|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> {{painting}} trends {{between the}} Northern Song period (960–1127) and Southern Song period (1127–1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials {{were influenced by}} their political ideals of bringing order {{to the world and}} tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society, hence their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. On the other hand, Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success. Hence, their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.|$|E
