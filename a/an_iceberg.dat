The calf is separated from his parents and he becomes trapped in <b>an</b> <b>iceberg.</b> Eventually he finds his way out with his mother's help. The family join a larger pod of whales who fly and frolic through the clouds to emerge into outer space. Introduced by Steve Martin and Itzhak Perlman.|$|E
5|$|A {{century of}} storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, {{which are now}} encased in the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001 {{glaciologist}} Charles R. Bentley estimated that the tent with the bodies was under about 75feet (23m) of ice and about 30miles (48km) from {{the point where they}} died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside <b>an</b> <b>iceberg.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but {{realizes she}} prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing {{on the bow}} at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack {{sketches}} Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with <b>an</b> <b>iceberg</b> and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.|$|E
50|$|Capp {{conceived}} Slobbovia as <b>a</b> large <b>iceberg.</b> <b>As</b> real <b>icebergs</b> {{at intervals}} have their larger subsea components erode away, causing genuine icebergs to invert, so Slobbovia periodically overturned, making Upper Slobbovia into Lower Slobbovia & vice versa. Upper Slobbovia {{was the only}} ecosystem of the Schmeagles, birds who flew so fast {{they could not be}} seen.|$|R
50|$|Since 1912, reports made by {{witnesses}} of the RMS Titanic tragedy {{have stated}} that the ship hit <b>a</b> blue <b>iceberg.</b> Following the sinking and subsequent discovery of the Titanic, scientific research and forensic analysis have reconstructed the tragedy to ascertain {{the reliability of the}} statements made by the survivors. Reports released in {{the last decade of the}} 20th century have shown that <b>a</b> blue <b>iceberg</b> in the north Atlantic would have been easily detected. Alternative theories suggest that pack ice, rather than <b>a</b> blue <b>iceberg,</b> was responsible for sinking the ship.|$|R

5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like <b>an</b> <b>iceberg</b> floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays {{a critical role in}} biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly important component of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} the RMS Titanic {{occurred}} {{on the night of}} 14 April through to the morning of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, four days into the ship's maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224people on board when she struck <b>an</b> <b>iceberg</b> at around 23:40 (ship's time) on Sunday, 14April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, which made it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.|$|E
5|$|Titanic sank in 1912, {{when she}} {{collided}} with <b>an</b> <b>iceberg</b> during her maiden voyage. The wreck {{could not be}} located {{at the time and}} was not discovered until 1985. Numerous expeditions tried using sonar to map the sea bed in the hope of spotting it, but were unsuccessful. The wreck was finally located by a joint French-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel of IFREMER and Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The wreck {{has been the focus of}} intense interest since its discovery and has been visited by numerous expeditions, including salvage operations which have controversially recovered thousands of items which have been conserved and put on public display.|$|E

5|$|After {{three months}} of futile escape attempts, Springfield's {{residents}} finally make {{a crack in the}} dome; pointing out the damage, Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children {{want to go back to}} save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on <b>an</b> <b>iceberg</b> and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E
5|$|Other proffered {{explanations}} are the possible {{appearance of a}} displaced iceberg; the fear of running aground while becalmed, and a sudden seaquake. Hydrographical evidence suggests that <b>an</b> <b>iceberg</b> drifting so far south was improbable, and had it done so other ships would have seen it. Begg gives more consideration to a theory that Mary Celeste, while becalmed, began drifting towards the Dollabarat reef off Santa Maria Island. The theory supposes that Briggs, fearing his ship would run aground, launched the yawl {{in the hope of}} reaching land. The wind could then have picked up and blown Mary Celeste away from the reef, while the rising seas swamped and sank the yawl. The weakness of this theory is that if the ship had been becalmed, all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze, yet the ship was found with many of its sails furled.|$|E
5|$|Being {{frozen in}} <b>an</b> <b>iceberg</b> {{for a hundred}} years while in the Avatar State drained much of Aang's life energy. While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered middle age in his 50s, the strain of this {{exertion}} increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would be powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into the Southern Water Tribe female Korra. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist Zaheer) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.|$|E

5|$|More than {{a century}} before {{the events of the}} series begin, Fire Lord Sozin, ruler of the Fire Nation, planned a world war to expand his nation's {{territory}} and influence. He was prevented from carrying out his plans by Avatar Roku, who was born in the Fire Nation. After Roku's death, the Avatar was reincarnated as an Airbender named Aang. As Aang was then only a child, Sozin saw his chance and proceeded with his militant plans. Because of the threat of Sozin's war, Aang learned about his avatar status when he was only twelve years old. Afraid of his new responsibilities and of separation from his mentor, Gyatso, he fled his home on his flying bison named Appa. Forced into the ocean by a storm, Aang entered the avatar state and encased them in suspended animation in <b>an</b> <b>iceberg</b> for one hundred years. Sozin, knowing that the avatar's reincarnation cycle mandated that an air nomad was the new avatar, carried out a genocide against the Air Nomads during the passing of a once-a-century comet which increases the Firebenders' power, and continues his world conquest.|$|E

25|$|<b>An</b> <b>iceberg</b> or ice {{mountain}} {{is a large}} piece of freshwater ice that has broken off a glacier or an ice shelf and is floating freely in open water.

Also, about 91% of <b>an</b> <b>iceberg</b> is {{below the surface of the}} water.|$|E
