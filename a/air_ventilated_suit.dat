The maximum permissible Mach number, for an aircraft flying at sea level under the maximum ambient tropical temperature of 45 °C, has been calculated over a range of compression ratios, 3 - 15 and precooler efficiencies, 75 - 100 per cent.

The Diploma work assumes from a general description of crawl-space and general dump problems in ground construction. An internal <b>air</b> <b>ventilated</b> crawl-space is a construction where you take the ventilation air from the building and bring {{it down to the}} crawl-space and lets the air circulate before it passes through a retaining aggregate on the way out from the crawl-space. In this matter you get a worm space under the building and a lot less dump problems in form of · Ground damp · Build damp The ground dump reduces through draining around the building, different layer of gravel between the ground and the building and ventilation of the crawl- space. The build dump reduces through ventilation of the crawl-space as fast as possible. To make a internal <b>air</b> <b>ventilated</b> crawl-space work as it is thought it demands that the construction is completely airtight, or else you can get air leakage that makes warm air to leak out and could air can come in.

40|$|Crawl {{spaces are}} known to be risky constructions for both the building’s {{structural}} components and the indoor environment. In Sweden, crawl spaces were popular before the 1940 ’s and again in the mid 1960 ’s and 1980 ’s. The aim {{of this paper is to}} look at why crawl spaces are still being used in today’s constructions from a Swedish perspective and give reasons why some types of crawl spaces fail. There are four different types of crawl spaces: plinth, outdoor ventilated, indoor ventilated, unventilated and suspended crawl space foundations, four of which are currently available to builders and one traditional design. Due to all the negative publicity associated with outdoor ventilated crawl spaces and the fact that this publicity refers to them only as crawl spaces, two other types of crawl spaces that function well are looked negatively upon. If designed and constructed correctly, the indoor <b>air</b> <b>ventilated</b> crawl space can be a cheaper alternative with many advantages over an outdoor <b>air</b> <b>ventilated</b> crawl space...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of blood gases on alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses was {{studied in the}} pithed rat by varying the inspired gas mixture or the ventilation stroke volume. Acidosis favoured the peak responses to the alpha 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, xylazine, while alkalosis favoured the peak responses to the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine. A combination of hypoxia and hypercapnia greatly depressed the alpha 1 response to phenylephrine whereas the alpha 2 response to xylazine remained relatively unaffected. When Pao 2 was varied in either acidotic or alkalotic conditions {{the response to the}} phenylephrine increased as Pao 2 increased. To prevent hypoxia in <b>air</b> <b>ventilated</b> rats, large stroke volumes were required. This caused alkalosis and hence decreased responsiveness to xylazine. Consequently, <b>air</b> <b>ventilated</b> pithed rats gave poorer responses to xylazine than did those ventilated on 100 % O 2. The results show that alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated pressor responses can be differentially affected by blood gases. The relative contribution of alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors to vascular tone may be either under- or over-estimated depending on the arterial blood gases...|$|R

Each of mentioned systems {{has a number}} of advantages and certain disadvantages due to which the problem of durability and efficiency of {{external insulation}} facade systems remains actual. One of the methods to solve this problem is to provide traditional external thermal insulation composite systems with the <b>ventilated</b> <b>air</b> gap presented by innovative material – ventilated façade mat Stuccodrain. Influence of air permeability of provided <b>ventilated</b> <b>air</b> gap in ETICS on moisture conditions of the wall structure has been considered in this work. The method of calculation of such an influence is based upon the comparative evaluation of non-stationary humidity conditions of ETICS and humidity conditions of ETICS with the <b>ventilated</b> <b>air</b> gap. The results of the comparative evaluation show that humidity of render layer in case of ETICS provided with <b>ventilated</b> <b>air</b> gap reduces significantly in comparison with traditional ETICS. Humidity reduction in external render layer of structure raises the durability and keeps the efficiency of the structure during the exploitation period.

The step switch used compressed air and had 12 steps. Since the two switches were operated alternatively, this meant that 23 steps were required which meant that the switching time was very slow. To operate the step switches, the locomotive driver had to turn a vertical crank handle once for each step.

40|$|Development of {{deeper and}} more complex orebodies has {{increased}} the demand for efficient use of the <b>air</b> <b>ventilating</b> underground mining operations. Deeper and heavily mechanized operations present increasing difficulty for maintaining the air temperatures encountered by personnel, which must be removed to ensure their safety and health. The efficient use of air is {{made possible by the}} implementation of Ventilation-on-Request (VOR) systems. However, reductions in the quantity of air supplied by VOR may reduce the quantity below that which is necessary for effective heat exchange. The objective of this thesis is to develop a heat simulation program that will determine the heat balance encountered in mining operations with VOR, and determine the appropriate size and number of conditioning plants required to maintain the air temperature at safe and healthy levels. A program written in Visual Basic was used to simulate the heat uptake by mine air and to solve for the conditioning requirements. The most important advantage for simulating the heat uptake by the mine air is to know if cooling is, or will be required, in the future. As ventilation is a major cost component of an underground operation, and cooling (if needed) is a very large portion of the ventilation costs, accurately simulating these requirements is of primary concern. Results of the heat simulation indicated that thermal rock conductivity, age of the airway, and geothermal gradient were important controlling parameters in the heat uptake by the <b>air</b> <b>ventilating</b> the mine. The accuracy of the simulation to surveyed values was heavily dependent upon these parameters; with airway temperature values predicted by the simulation showing nearly a one-to-one relationship.
