40|$|With semiconductor-device {{geometry}} shrinking {{and becoming}} more complex, conventional aqueous cleaning/drying tends to collapse free-standing MEMS and high-aspect-ratio fragile LSI structures {{due to the}} high surface tension of aqueous chemicals and water. The use of physical cleaning aids such as megasonics with dilute chemistry or high-pressure atomizing jet sprays can also cause damage to nano-structures.

40|$|Biofilms {{can cause}} serious {{concerns}} in many applications. Not only can they cause economic losses, {{but they can}} also present a public health hazard. Therefore, it is highly desirable to remove biofilms from surfaces. Many studies on CO 2 <b>aerosol</b> <b>cleaning</b> have employed nitrogen purges to increase biofilm removal efficiency by reducing the moisture condensation generated during the cleaning. However, in this study, periodic jets of CO 2 aerosols without nitrogen purges were used to remove Pseudomonas putida biofilms from polished stainless steel surfaces. CO 2 aerosols are mixtures of solid and gaseous CO 2 and are generated when high-pressure CO 2 gas is adiabatically expanded through a nozzle. These high-speed aerosols were applied to a biofilm that had been grown for 24 hr. The removal efficiency ranged from 90. 36 % to 98. 29 % and was evaluated by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the biofilm as the treatment time was varied from 16 sec to 88 sec. We also performed experiments to compare the removal efficiencies with and without nitrogen purges; the measured biofilm removal efficiencies were not significantly different from each other (t-test, p > 0. 55). Therefore, this technique can be used to clean various bio-contaminated surfaces within one minute. ope...|$|E

Here, we used phage as a potential agent to evaluate the efficacy of daily cleaning practices combined with a bacteriophage-containing aerosol against CRAB. A two-phase prospective intervention study was performed at a 945 -bed public teaching hospital. From March to December 2013, we performed terminal cleaning using standard procedures plus an aerosol with active bacteriophage {{in the intensive care}} units to evaluate the impact on nosocomial incidence density, carbapenem-resistance rates and antimicrobial drug consumption amounts. Patients with culture proven CRAB infection were transferred to the isolation room when the phage <b>aerosol</b> <b>cleaning</b> had been completed. A total of 264 new acquisitions of CRAB were identified in the intensive care units (191 in the pre-intervention period and 73 in the intervention period).

This study investigates the influence of an aerosol generation stop and go on the filter pressure drop and penetration. Experiments carried out using a HEPA glass fibre filter show that the pressure drop increases by up to 20 % after an aerosol generation interruption. The pressure drop increase could be countered by performing a clean air permeation during the break period. If a permeation velocity higher than the filtration velocity is used, the pressure drop of the filter is noticeably reduced compared to what it would have been without an interruption. The same aerosol interruption did not have a clear influence on the filter penetration.

40|$|International audienceClimate {{change and}} {{increasing}} demography press local authorities {{to look after}} affordable water resources and replacement of drinking water for city necessities like street and pavement cleaning by more available raw water. Though, the substitution of drinking by non-drinking resources demands the evaluation of sanitary hazards. This article aims therefore to evaluate the contribution of cleaning water to the overall exposure of city dwellers in case of wet pavement cleaning using crossed physical, chemical and biological approaches. The result of tracer experiments with fluorescein show that liquid water content of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>aerosol</b> produced is about 0. 24 g m(- 3), rending possible a fast estimation of exposure levels. In situ analysis of the aerosol particles indicates {{a significant increase in}} particle number concentration and particle diameter, though without change in particle composition. The conventional bacterial analysis using total coliforms as tracer suggests that {{an important part of the}} contamination is issued from the pavement. The qPCR results show a more than 20 -fold increase of background genome concentration for Escherichia coli and 10 -fold increase for Enterococcus but a negligible contribution of the cleaning water. The fluorescence analysis of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>aerosol</b> confirms the above findings identifying pavement surface as the major contributor to aerosol organic load. The physical, chemical and microbiological approaches used make it possible to describe accurately the cleaning bioaerosol and to identify the existence of significantly higher levels of all parameters studied during the wet pavement cleaning. Though, the low level of contamination and the very short time of passage of pedestrian in the zone do not suggest a significant risk for the city dwellers. As the cleaning workers remain much longer in the impacted area, more attention should be paid to their chronic exposure...|$|R

Pleasurable psychological effects, craving, active search for the substance and tolerance were present but withdrawal symptoms could not be demonstrated because of simultaneous alcohol dependence. Solvent abuse, first appearing as petrol sniffing {{in the rural areas}} of America in the fifties has become a major health problem in many countries (Tech Hong, 1986; Dinwiddie et al, 1987).

40|$|Inhalants are {{a diverse}} group of {{volatile}} substances whose chemical vapors can be inhaled to produce psychoactive (mind-altering) effects. While other abused substances can be inhaled, the term “inhalants ” is used to describe substances that are rarely, if ever, taken by any other route of administration. A variety of products common in the home and workplace contain substances that can be inhaled to get high; however, people do not typically think of these products (e. g., spray paints, glues, and cleaning fluids) as drugs because they were never intended to induce intoxicating effects. Yet young children and adolescents can easily obtain these extremely toxic substances, and are among those most likely to abuse them. In fact, more 8 th graders have tried inhalants than any other illicit drug. 1 What Types of Products are Abused as Inhalants? Inhalants generally fall into the following categories: Volatile solvents—liquids that vaporize at room temperature Industrial or household products, including paint thinners or removers, degreasers, dry-cleaning fluids, gasoline, lighter fluid Art or office supply solvents, including correction fluids, felt-tip marker fluid, electronic contact cleaners, glue Aerosols—sprays that contain propellants and solvents Household aerosol propellants in items such as spray paints, hair or deodorant sprays, fabric protector sprays, <b>aerosol</b> computer <b>cleaning</b> products, and vegetable oil sprays Gases—found in household or commercial products and used as medical anesthetics Household or commercial products, including butane lighters and propane tanks, whipped cream aerosols or dispensers (whippets), and refrigerant gases Medical anesthetics, such as ether, chloroform, halothane, and nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) Nitrites—a special class of inhalants that are used primarily as sexual enhancers Organic nitrites are volatiles that include cyclohexyl, butyl, and amyl nitrites, commonly known as “poppers. ” Amyl nitrite is still used in certain diagnostic medical procedures.

40|$|Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are a {{group of}} organic {{compounds}} that contain carbon, fluorine, and hydrogen. They are by-products of industrial manufacturing and were introduced {{as a replacement for}} chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone depleting substances. However, though HFCs have zero ozone depletion potential (ODP), they have intrinsic and significant global warming potential (GWP), typically in the range of 1, 000 to 3, 000 times that of CO 2. Thus, they are among the six key greenhouse gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol for emission reduction. Other greenhouse gases listed by the protocol are CO 2, CH 4, N 2 O, PFCs, SF 6, and HFCs. Industry and government are collaborating on research and development, communication, and other activities to find new technologies, designs, and processes to manage these emissions. The emissions management is occurring through non-regulatory means, voluntary measures, and industry-government collaborations. The air-conditioning and commercial refrigeration industry has particularly contributed {{to the success of the}} management process. HFCs are generally colourless and odourless gases at environmental temperatures and are mostly chemically unreactive. They are non-flammable, having very low toxicity; they are recyclable, and highly energy efficient. There has been a significant growth in the market for HFCs because they have been identified as important alternative fluids for many end users. They find applications in refrigeration and air-conditioning, foam-blowing, general <b>aerosols,</b> solvent <b>cleaning,</b> firefighting, and metered-dose inhaling. They are preferred due to certain physical and chemical characteristics, especially their low toxicity and low flammability. The main sources of atmospheric HFCs are traceable to their sources of application. Two other major emitters are chemical plants making HCFC 22 (where HFC- 23 is emitted as a by-product) and HFCs. There are several points in the lifecycle of HFC-using products at which emissions can occur. A computer model uses four emission factors to characterize the HFC emissions, namely fluid manufacturing, product manufacturing, product life, and disposal loss factors. Examples of HFCs include trifluoromethane (HFC- 23), difluoromethane (HFC- 32), fluoromethane (HFCHydrofluorocarbons 41), 2 -chloro- 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane (HFC- 124), 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 -pentafluoroethane (HFC- 125), 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrafluoroethane (HFC- 134), 1, 1, 1, 2 -tetrafluoroethane (HFC- 134 a,), 1, 1 -difluoroethane (HFC- 152 a), 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3 -heptafluoropropane (HFC- 227 ea) ...|$|R
40|$|Air {{cleaning}} {{techniques have}} been applied worldwide {{with the goal of}} improving indoor air quality. The effectiveness of applying these techniques varies widely, and pollutant removal efficiency is usually determined in controlled laboratory environments which may not be realized in practice. Some air cleaners are largely ineffective, and some produce harmful by-products. To summarize what is known regarding the effectiveness of fan-driven air cleaning technologies, a state-of-the-art review of the scientific literature was undertaken by a multidisciplinary panel of experts from Europe, North America, and Asia with expertise in air <b>cleaning,</b> <b>aerosol</b> science, medicine, chemistry and ventilation. The effects on health were not examined. Over 26, 000 articles were identified in major literature databases; 400 were selected as being relevant based on their titles and abstracts by the first two authors, who further reduced the number of articles to 160 based on the full texts. These articles were reviewed by the panel using predefined inclusion criteria during their first meeting. Additions were also made by the panel. Of these, 133 articles were finally selected for detailed review. Each article was assessed independently by two members of the panel and then judged by the entire panel during a consensus meeting. During this process 59 articles were deemed conclusive and their results were used for final reporting at their second meeting. The conclusions are that: (1) None of the reviewed technologies was able to effectively remove all indoor pollutants and many were found to generate undesirable by-products during operation. (2) Particle filtration and sorption of gaseous pollutants were among the most effective air cleaning technologies, but there is insufficient information regarding long-term performance and proper maintenance. (3) The existing data make it difficult to extract information such as Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR), which represents a common benchmark for comparing the performance of different air cleaning technologies. (4) To compare and select suitable indoor air cleaning devices, a labeling system accounting for characteristics such as CADR, energy consumption, volume, harmful by-products, and life span is necessary. For that purpose, a standard test room and condition should be built and studied. (5) Although there is evidence that some air cleaning technologies improve indoor air quality, further research is needed before any of them can be confidently recommended for use in indoor environments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Definition: Although other abused {{drugs can}} be inhaled, the term inhalants is {{reserved}} for {{the wide variety of}} substances—including solvents, aerosols, gases, and nitrites—that are rarely, if ever, taken via any other route of administration. (See below for a list of examples.) Many products readily found in the home or workplace—such as spray paints, markers, glues, and cleaning fluids—contain volatile substances that have psychoactive (mind-altering) properties when inhaled. People do not typically think of these products as drugs because they were never intended for that purpose. However, these products are sometimes abused in that way. They are especially (but not exclusively) abused by young children and adolescents, and are the only class of substance abused more by younger than by older teens. How Are Inhalants Abused? Abusers of inhalants breathe them in through the nose or mouth {{in a variety of ways}} (known as “huffing”). They may sniff or snort fumes from a container or dispenser (such as a glue bottle or a marking pen), spray aerosols (such as computer cleaning dusters) directly into their nose or mouth, or place a chemical-soaked rag in their mouth. Abusers may also inhale fumes from a balloon or a plastic or paper bag. Although the high produced by inhalants usually lasts just a few minutes, abusers often try to prolong it by continuing to inhale repeatedly over several hours. People tend to abuse different inhalant products at different ages. New users ages 12 – 15 most commonly abuse glue, shoe polish, spray paints, gasoline, and lighter fluid. New users ages 16 – 17 most commonly abuse nitrous oxide or “whippets. ” Adults most commonly abuse a class of inhalants known as nitrites (such as amyl nitrites or “poppers”). How Do Inhalants Affect the Brain? Most abused inhalants other than nitrites depress the central nervous system in a manner not unlike alcohol. The effects are similar—including slurred speech, lack of coordination, euphoria, and dizziness. Inhalant abusers may also experience light-headedness, hallucinations, and delu-sions. With repeated inhalations, many users feel less inhibited and less in control. Some may feel drowsy for several hours and experience a lingering headache. Unlike other types of inhalants, nitrites enhance sexual pleasure by dilating and relaxing blood vessels. Although it is not very common, addiction to inhalants can occur with repeated abuse What Are the Other Health Effects of Inhalants Chemicals found in different types of inhaled products may produce a vari-ety of other short-term effects, such as nausea or vomiting, as well as more serious long-term consequences. These may include liver and kidney damage, hearing loss, or bone marrow damage. Effects may also include loss of coordination and limb spasms due to damage to myelin—a protective sheathing around nerve fibers that helps nerves transmit messages in the brain and peripheral nervous system. Inhalants can also cause brain damage by cutting off oxygen flow to the brain. Inhalants can even be lethal. Sniffing highly concentrated amounts of the chemicals in solvents or aerosol sprays can directly cause heart failure within minutes. This syndrome, known as “sudden sniffing death,” can result from a single session of inhalant use by an otherwise healthy young person. High concentrations of inhal-ants may also cause death from suffocation, especially when inhaled from a paper or plastic bag or in a closed area. Even when using aerosols or volatile products for their legitimate purposes like painting or cleaning, it is wise to do so in a well-ventilated room or outdoors. Nitrites are a special class of inhalants that are abused to enhance sexual pleasure and performance. They can be associated with unsafe sexual practices that increase the risk of contracting and spreading infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.
