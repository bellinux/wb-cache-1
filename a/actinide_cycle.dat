40|$|AbstractA {{metal fuel}} cycle {{combined}} with pyropartitioning and transmutation of minor actinide elements from spent light water reactor fuels is proposed for closing <b>actinide</b> <b>cycle.</b> Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry has started {{study on the}} pyropartitioning since 1986. Thermodynamic properties were assessed for uranium, transuranium elements (TRUs), and fission product (FP) elements to understand the process chemistry and feasibility. After demonstration of each step by using simulating material including uranium and TRUs, a pyropartit ioning test using real high level liquid waste was performed. The feasibility of the pyropartitioning process was verified through these studies...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} fuel cycle {{simulations}} were performed using CEA's reactor physics code ERANOS 2. 0 {{to analyze the}} transmutation performance of the Subcritical Advanced Burner Reactor (SABR). SABR is a fusion-fission hybrid reactor that combines the leading sodium cooled fast reactor technology with the leading tokamak plasma technology based on ITER physics. Two general fuel cycles were considered for the SABR system. The first fuel cycle {{is one in which}} all of the transuranics from light water reactors are burned in SABR. The second fuel cycle is a minor <b>actinide</b> burning fuel <b>cycle</b> in which all of the minor actinides and some of the plutonium produced in light water reactors are burned in SABR, with the excess plutonium being set aside for starting up fast reactors in the future. The minor <b>actinide</b> burning fuel <b>cycle</b> is being considered in European Scenario Studies. The fuel cycles were evaluated on the basis of TRU/MA transmutation rate, power profile, accumulated radiation damage, and decay heat to the repository. Each of the fuel cycles are compared against each other, and the minor <b>actinide</b> burning fuel <b>cycles</b> are compared against the EFIT transmutation system, and a low conversion ratio fast reactor.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} thorium {{extraction}} modelling by a 30 %vol TBP in TPH diluent, {{to simulate the}} behaviour of this <b>actinide</b> in extraction <b>cycles.</b> Experimental batch studies were performed to complete the set of distribution data on thorium and 30 %TBP available in the literature. A thorium extraction model was developed and implemented in the PAREX process simulation code. Simulation results are confronted to available distribution data as well as feed back data from industrial plant...|$|R
40|$|The {{modified}} Purex {{process flowsheet}} {{is based on}} combination of all irradiated materials, their joint dissolution and reprocessing as a NPP spent fuel solution with abnormal Pu content after addition of recycled depleted U concentrate. Some groups of long-lived radionuclides could be completely recovered and localized at the stage of extraction reprocessing using 30 % TBP. Studies were conducted for 10 y to develop the process for recovery, concentration, and localization of U, Pu, Np, Tc, and Zr within 1 st extraction <b>cycle.</b> <b>Actinides</b> are recovered from high-level raffinate of this cycle after evaporation and feed adjustment. Results in this report show that combined deep recovery of several elements from highly irradiated materials by TBP extraction, for further transmutation, is possible. Selective stripping of Zr from solvent phase containing U, Pu, Np, and Tc is quite effective. Development of the modified Purex process is not complete; main problem to be solved should be oxide separation from the loop and permissible storage duration before reprocessing and reuse in the loop...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the Seventh Euratom Framework Program {{in the area of}} nuclear fission and radiation protection is to establish a sound scientific and technical basis to accelerate practical developments of nuclear energy related to resource efficiency, enhancing safety performance, cost-effectiveness and safer management of long-lived radioactive waste. Key cross-cutting topics such as the nuclear fuel <b>cycle,</b> <b>actinide</b> chemistry, risk analysis, safety assessment, even societal and governance issues are linked to the individual technical areas. Research need to explore new scientific and techno- logical opportunities and to respond in a flexible way to new policy needs that arise. The following activities are to be pursued. (a) Management of radioactive waste, research on partitioning and transmutation and/or other concepts aimed at reducing the amount and/or hazard of the waste for disposal; (b) Reactor systems research to underpin the con- tinued safe operation of all relevant types of existing reactor systems (including fuel cycle facilities), life-time extension, development of new advanced safety assessment methodologies and waste-management aspects of future reactor systems; (c) Radiation protection research in particular on the risks from low doses on medical uses and on the management of accidents; (d) Infrastructures and support given to the availability of, and cooperation between, research infrastructures necessary to maintain high standards of technical achievement, innovation and safety in the European nuclear sector and Research Area. (e) Human resources, mobility and training support to be provided for the retention and further development of scientific competence, human capacity through joint training activities in order to guarantee the availability of suitably qualified researchers, engineers and employees in the nuclear sector over the longer term...|$|R
40|$|A new {{theoretical}} framework is introduced, the "neutron excess" concept, which {{is useful for}} analyzing breed-and-burn (B&B) reactors and their fuel cycles. Based on this concept, a set of methods has been developed which allows a broad comparison of B&B reactors using different fuels, structural materials, and coolants. This new approach allows important reactor and fuelcycle parameters to be approximated quickly, {{without the need for}} a full core design, including minimum burnup/irradiation damage and reactor fleet doubling time. Two general configurations of B&B reactors are considered: a "minimum-burnup" version in which fuel elements can be shuffled in three dimensions, and a "linear-assembly" version composed of conventional linear assemblies that are shuffled radially. Based on studies of different core compositions, the best options for minimizing fuel burnup and material DPA are metal fuel (with a strong dependence on alloy content), the type of steel that allows the lowest structure volume fraction, and helium coolant. If sufficient fuel performance margin exists, sodium coolant can be substituted in place of helium to achieve higher power densities at a modest burnup and DPA penalty. For a minimum-burnup B&B reactor, reasonably achievable minimum DPA values are on the order of 250 - 350 DPA in steel, while axial peaking in a linear-assembly B&B reactor raises minimum DPA to over 450 DPA. By recycling used B&B fuel in a limited-separations (without full <b>actinide</b> separations) fuel <b>cycle,</b> there is potential for sodium-cooled B&B reactors to achieve fleet doubling times of less than one decade, although this result is highly sensitive to the reactor core composition employed as well as thermal hydraulic performance. by Robert C.
