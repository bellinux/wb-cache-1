Among others, Hyman Minsky and Post-Keynesian economists have argued that as result, Keynes's ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the IS–LM model (which, they argue, distort Keynes's ideas). Keynes began to recover in 1939, {{but for the rest of}} his life his professional energies were largely directed towards the practical side of economics – the problems of ensuring optimum <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that was presented at the Bretton Woods Conference.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} {{conflict}} detection and for <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> attentional <b>resources</b> increase {{the need for}} attentional control. While prior evidence suggests that different cortical regions are preferentially engaged by these two attentional processes, the effect of increasing demand for conflict detection and ⁄ or <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> attentional <b>resources</b> has been relatively unexplored. We designed a novel task (the ‘variable attentional control’ – VAC – task) that varies the demand for attentional control by increasing conflict detection and <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> attentional <b>resources</b> within the same stimuli. We studied 34 subjects who underwent event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} while performing the VAC task. Increasing demand for attentional control, as reflected by longer reaction time and reduced accuracy, was associated with greater activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex and dorsal cingulate. Furthermore, an increase in conflict detection was associated with greater dorsal cingulate activity, whereas an increase in demand for <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> attentional <b>resources</b> implied greater activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices. In essence, in addition to allowing the exploration of the overall effects of increasing demand for attentional control, our novel task also allowed parsing of the neural components of attentional control into those related to <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> attentional <b>resources</b> and those related to conflict detection...|$|R

The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene.|$|E

The paper highlights in particular how a hydrological assessment was used to respond to rapid and uncontrolled groundwater exploitation, which ultimately produced unequal outcomes among different farmers.
