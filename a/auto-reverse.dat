5000|$|In one machine, the [...] "Dragon", Nakamichi {{addressed}} the issue with a motor-driven automatic head alignment mechanism. This proved effective but very expensive. A later Nakamichi <b>auto-reverse</b> model was essentially a single-directional deck, but with an added mechanism that physically removed the cassette from the transport, flipped it over, and re-inserted it. Akai made a similar machine but doing it [...] "flat" [...] instead of [...] "upright". This permitted the convenience of <b>auto-reverse</b> with little compromise in record or playback quality.|$|E
50|$|Cassette decks {{reached their}} {{pinnacle}} {{of performance and}} complexity by the mid-1980s. Cassette decks from companies such as Nakamichi, Revox, and Tandberg incorporated advanced features such as multiple tape heads and dual capstan drive with separate reel motors. <b>Auto-reversing</b> decks became popular and were standard on most factory installed automobile decks.|$|R
50|$|Rumours also {{circulated}} {{in the press}} of an <b>auto-reverse</b> machine shortly before the format was retired. Technically {{this would have been}} a major challenge to enable a single head drum to scan both 'sides' of the tape at the correct angle.|$|E
5000|$|In later years, an [...] "auto reverse" [...] feature {{appeared}} {{that allowed the}} deck to play (and, in some decks, record) {{on both sides of}} the cassette without the operator having to manually remove, flip, and re-insert the cassette. Most <b>auto-reverse</b> machines use a four channel head (similar to those on multitrack recorders), with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time, one pair for each direction. <b>Auto-reverse</b> decks employ a capstan and pinch roller for each side. Since these use the same opening in the cassette shell normally used for the erase head, such decks must fit the erase head (or two, one for each direction) into the center opening in the shell along with the record/play head.|$|E
50|$|The {{machines}} played continuously {{using an}} <b>auto-reverse</b> mechanism. As the tape reaches one end, the reverse mechanism activates and changes the drive direction. The tape head {{moves to the}} other side and the mechanism shifts pinch rollers. The design does not require the head to turn over; instead, the entire head changes position to play the tape at {{the other side of the}} tape path.|$|E
50|$|The HLD-1000 was Pioneer's first high-definition video player; {{it was one}} of a {{small number}} of models to employ {{multiple}} sub-Nyquist sampling encoding (MUSE) technology. It was followed by the HLD-X0, which by many enthusiasts is regarded as the best Laserdisc player ever made. The HLD-X0 was entirely hand-built and weighed 79 lb. Although the X9 has <b>auto-reverse,</b> the X0 offers a picture with less noise and better color rendering than any other player.|$|E
50|$|The LX offered velour upholstery, <b>auto-reverse</b> {{cassette}} stereo, air conditioning, cruise control, power brakes, power steering, power windows & {{power door}} locks (sedan only), a digital clock, roof pillar antenna, along with thick black belt moldings, integrated bumpers and flush plastic mock-alloy style wheels covers that resembled the trend-setting Audi 5000. Supplies were tight, {{as in the}} Eastern states, the wait was months for a Graphite Gray sedan, a then-popular color. The LX hatchback was the only 1984 version of the Accord to include dual side view mirrors.|$|E
50|$|DCC uses a 9-track {{magneto-resistive}} (MR) {{head for}} playback. The head is {{fixed to the}} mechanism of the recorder, unlike rotary heads {{that are used in}} helical scan systems such as DAT or VHS to increase head-to-tape speed. Because of the reduced number of moving parts, DCC decks are less sensitive to shock and vibration. And because of the dimensions that are so similar to analog compact cassettes, existing <b>auto-reverse</b> audio cassette recorder mechanisms can easily be adapted for use in DCC recorders simply by mounting a DCC head instead of only an analog head. In fact, Philips did this during development.|$|E
5000|$|Called [...] "UDAR" [...] for UniDirectional Auto Reverse. Used on the Nakamichi RX {{series of}} decks. With {{the advent of}} <b>auto-reverse</b> (playing the tape in both directions), Nakamichi had long {{recognized}} that {{the angle of the}} tape passing over the playback head was not the same if the tape head was rotated in the opposite direction and its first approach was to track the azimuth on the tape itself by moving the head slightly—a very complex affair which led to the design of the Dragon with its NAAC. Nakamichi subsequently abandoned this approach and set its engineers in search of a more elegant solution. Nakamichi soon developed its UDAR mechanism, which mimicked the way people had manually turned over their tapes in the past: a mechanical system that would eject the tape, spin it around and reload it into the deck. It was available on all Nakamichi RX series of tape decks, i.e., the RX-202, RX-303 and RX-505. The 'top of the range' RX-505 was made after the Dragon. Its operation was elegantly simple, easy to set up, easy to calibrate, and easy to use, with only one rewind and forward operation in a unique unidirectional <b>auto-reverse</b> deck. It also had an updated and simpler drive system that was more direct loading, had updated and quieter electronics, and its revised capstan is essentially what Nakamichi used for its 1988 Nakamichi 1000 DAT recorder.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Inside a {{cassette}} showing the {{leader at the}} beginning of side A. The tape [...] "plays" [...] from left to right (though, of course, an <b>auto-reverse</b> deck can play in either direction). The tape is pressed into close contact with the read-head by the pressure pad; guide rollers help keep the tape in the correct position. Smooth running is assisted by a slippery liner (slip sheet) between the spools and the shell; here the liner is transparent. The magnetic shield reduces pickup of stray signals by the heads of the player. The tab at the top-left corner of the shell permits recording on the current side.|$|E
50|$|Most {{magnetic}} tape recorders use one capstan motor and one pinch roller located after the magnetic heads {{in the direction of}} the moving tape. However multiple pinch rollers may also be employed in association with one or more capstans. An example of the application of multiple pinch rollers is the Technics-RS1520 tape recorder, which utilizes two pinch rollers located on opposite sides of a single capstan shaft, providing a more stable transport across two sets of magnetic heads. Dual pinch rollers are also used (along with dual capstans) in <b>auto-reverse</b> cassette decks to drive the tape in both directions as needed. In this case, only one pinch roller is pressed against its corresponding capstan at a time.|$|E
50|$|The same design concept {{would later}} {{be used in the}} more {{successful}} Compact Cassette, introduced by Philips in 1962. Similar to the Compact Cassette, the RCA cartridges are reversible so that either side can be played. An <b>auto-reverse</b> mechanism in some models allows the tape to run continuously. Equal to 8-track tape and Stereo-Pak, the tape runs at a standard speed of 3.75 inches per second (IPS). This is double the speed of the Compact Cassette and half of the top speed of consumer reel-to-reel tape recorders, which usually offer both 3.75 IPS and 7.5 IPS speeds. Such consumer reel-to-reel machines are capable of superior audio performance, but only at the faster speed.|$|E
50|$|Amid fierce competition, {{primarily}} from Toshiba (the Walky), Aiwa (the CassetteBoy) and Panasonic (the MiJockey), {{by the late}} 1980s, In 1982 Sony introduced the Walkman DD Series, the first model of this series was WM-DD it was available in two colors, silver and red. Sony upped the ante once again by creating the playback-only WM-DD9, launched in 1989 during the 10th anniversary of the Walkman (five years after the WM-D6C) and became the holy grail for a niche group of cassette Walkman collectors. It is the only <b>auto-reverse</b> Walkman in history to use a two-motor, quartz-locked, disc drive system similar to high-end home cassette decks (like the Nakamichi Dragon) to ensure accurate tape speed for both sides (unlike the Dragon, only one motor operates at a time depending {{on the side of}} the tape being played).|$|E
50|$|Until early 2009, {{in spite}} of the decline of the cassette, logically {{operated}} deluxe models (WM-GX788 etc.) had been available in a very few countries, especially in South Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. These models supported a so-called gumstick-type rechargeable battery, offered relatively better sound quality than cheaper models did, and had an automatic tape position selector and <b>auto-reverse</b> function. As of spring 2009, all tape models except the WM-EX651 were discontinued in South Korea. In Japan, only a few cheap models (WM-GX202 etc.) remained. In October 2010, however, those 'few' models finally went out of production. Many people no longer use cassette tapes for music listening and, in a few countries, cassette tapes are only used for language learning, which is now significantly declining thanks to podcasts from BBC or CNN or trends of (foreign-language learning) publishers which adopt MP3 file services or attached CDs rather than attaching tapes to their publications.|$|E
5000|$|Most Laserdisc {{players were}} {{required}} {{the user to}} manually turn the disc over to play the other side. A number of players (all diode laser based) were made that were capable of playing {{both sides of the}} disc automatically; {{at the end of the}} first side, or at the viewer's command, the machine would reverse the direction of the disc's rotation, simultaneously moving the laser pickup head to the other side of the disc, and then initiate playback. Since LD's are made up of two single sided discs glued together, the <b>auto-reverse</b> player would center each disc side individually. Laserdisc players used either a simple U-shaped reversing mechanism, known as [...] "Epsilon Turn", or technique known as [...] "Gamma Turn", where the player physically rotated the laser reading head ° as it moved from one side of the disc to the other, ensuring that the laser retained the same playback orientation on both sides of the disc. Some players even had twin laser reading circuits to eliminate excessive servos.|$|E
5000|$|DCCs {{are similar}} to compact cassettes, except {{that there are no}} [...] "bulges" [...] where the tape-access holes are located. The top side of a DCC is flat and there are no access holes for the hubs on there (they are not {{required}} because <b>auto-reverse</b> is a standard feature on all DCC decks), so this side can be used for a bigger label than can be used on an analog compact cassette. A spring-loaded metal shutter similar to the shutters on 3.5 inch floppy disks and MiniDiscs covers the tape access holes and locks the hubs while the cassette is not in use. Cassettes provide several extra holes and indentations so that DCC recorders can tell a DCC apart from an analog compact cassette, and so they can tell what the length of a DCC tape is. Also, there is a sliding marker on the DCC to enable and disable recording. Unlike the break-away notches on analog compact cassettes and VHS tapes, this marker makes it easier to make a tape recordable again, and unlike on analog compact cassettes, the marker protects the entire tape rather than just one side.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964 Philips {{launched}} the Compact Cassette, and in 1965 Ford and Motorola jointly introduced the 8-track tape in-car tape player. In subsequent years cassettes supplanted the 8-track, and improved with longer play times, better tape quality, <b>auto-reverse,</b> and Dolby noise reduction. They were popular throughout the 1970s and '80s. While the CD {{had been on}} the market since 1982, it was in 1984 that Pioneer introduced the CDX-1, the world's first car CD player. It was known for its improved sound quality, instant track skipping and the formats increased durability over cassette tapes. Due to the ability that allowed drivers and passengers to change up to 10 CD's at a time, car CD changers started to gain popularity in the late 80s and continuing throughout the 90s. Stock and aftermarket compact disc players began appearing in the late 1980s, competing with the cassette. The first car with an OEM CD player was the 1987 Lincoln Town Car, and the last new cars in the American market to be factory-equipped with a cassette deck in the dashboard was the 2010 Lexus SC430, and the Ford Crown Victoria.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{finite element}} model of two nickel-titanium (Ni-Ti) rotary endodontic {{instruments}} (ProTaper and SystemGT; Dentsply-Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) was developed to investigate the mechanical behavior of these devices and to identify the benefits/limitations of different geometries during instrumentation in various root canals. METHODS: Instrument shape, curved root canal geometry, and Ni-Ti alloy pseudo-elastic behavior were investigated in this study using computational techniques. Two different operating conditions were simulated: (1) the file insertion-removal cycle which resembles the standard working condition and (2) the file subjected to a torque in the counter-clockwise direction, which mimics the <b>auto-reverse</b> movement of the instrument when the tip is locked in the canal wall. RESULTS: The simulations of standard and <b>auto-reverse</b> conditions produced bending and torsion loading conditions in the files, respectively. In the standard situation in which different canal shapes were considered, the strains in the SystemGT were generally lower than the strains in the ProTaper and always in the pseudo-elastic range; in only 1 case did the ProTaper overcame the pseudo-elastic range limit. In the <b>auto-reverse</b> situation, a better behavior of the ProTaper was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The two simulated conditions highlighted the different mechanical properties of the files; the SystemGT showed slightly better performances under flexural solicitation, whereas the Protaper presented better behavior under torsion solicitations...|$|E
40|$|A novel assay {{based on}} micropatterning and {{time-lapse}} microscopy {{has been developed}} {{for the study of}} nuclear migration dynamics in cultured mammalian cells. When cultured on 10 - 20 um wide adhesive stripes, the motility of C 6 glioma and primary mouse fibroblast cells is diminished. Nevertheless, nuclei perform an unexpected <b>auto-reverse</b> motion: when a migrating nucleus approaches the leading edge, it decelerates, changes the direction of motion and accelerates to move toward {{the other end of the}} elongated cell. During this process cells show signs of polarization closely following the direction of nuclear movement. The observed nuclear movement requires a functioning microtubular system, as revealed by experiments disrupting the main cytoskeletal components with specific drugs. On the basis of our results we argue that <b>auto-reverse</b> nuclear migration is due to forces determined by the interplay of microtubule dynamics and the changing position of the microtubule organizing center as the nucleus reaches the leading edge. Our assay recapitulates specific features of nuclear migration (cell polarization, oscillatory nuclear movement), while allows the systematic study of a large number of individual cells. In particular, our experiments yielded the first direct evidence of reversive nuclear motion in mammalian cells, induced by attachment constraints.

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} electronic foramen locators (EFLs) to control root canal working length during rotary instrumentation and to assess possible reliability variations of different working lengths. Forty-eight human mandibular bicuspids were randomly divided in 2 groups according to the used device, Root ZX II (RZX) and Propex II (PRO). They were further subdivided in 2 subgroups according to the root canal preparation level (0. 0 and - 1. 0). Preparation was performed with the Protaper rotary system using a crown-down technique. RZX was employed on its automatic <b>auto-reverse</b> mode (AAR) and PRO was used with the MPAS- 10 R contra-angle to monitor the preparation. The last used file (F 3) was fixed, and the apical portion of the teeth was worn buccolingually, allowing to measure the extent between the file tip and the apical foramen (AF). The precision values of 0. 0 mm and - 1. 0 mm were 100 % and 0. 0 % for RZX, and 100 % and 66. 7 % for PRO, respectively, {{with a range of}} ± 0. 5 mm. Statistical analysis showed no differences between the groups at 0. 0 mm. However, at - 1. 0 mm, RZX showed the poorest results (0. 96 ± 0. 11 mm), followed by PRO (0. 43 ± 0. 23 mm). The difference between RZX and PRO was statistically significant. The EFLs were precise in maintaining the working length during rotary preparation when reaching the AF, but when their penetration was limited, both devices showed decreased precision; the RZX AAR failed in all instances...|$|E
40|$|Something {{that has}} {{recently}} gained {{popularity in the}} leading car manufacturing companies is the integration of an <b>auto-reverse</b> assistance system to improve the customer experience. The undeniable spread of smartphones and their significant role in human life in recent years, {{gave rise to the}} idea of designing an application to be used for reverse driving. As a result, the car company Volvo proposed an idea for this project: to implement an Android based application to facilitate reverse navigation in their trucks. From a technical point of view, the most crucial obstacle that should be addressed is implementing a secure and reliable communication link between the smartphone and the truck's control centre. Hence, the primary goal of this thesis work is to provide a secure channel to transmit data and computing reliability of the com-munication link. Another objective of this project is to define a solution for auto-converting path plan function, currently developed in Matlab, to run on Android devices. In addition, this solution should enable the developer to modify the path plan function in Matlab without having to consider Android programming. The differential method has been proposed for transferring secure data transfer using Bluetooth technol-ogy. This solution not only increases the security of the communication link but also improves transmission time. Another objective has been reached by developing a middleware function using C programming language and Android Native Development Kite (NDK) between An-droid and Matlab. The result of these solutions provides a reliable communication link and runs the developed path plan function in Android phone...|$|E
40|$|The {{ambulatory}} electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder {{has been}} in existence {{for more than two}} decades. It is used to document the transient electrocardiographic events in a patient over a protracted period. The conventional ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder, including the advanced ones, can only operate for 24 hours or so due to the memory storage constraints. In certain cases, a longer recording period is required in order to capture the symptoms that don't occur during the 24 -hour recording cycle. This thesis deals with the development of a prolonged ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder that is capable of operating for three days and recording two channels of electrocardiographic data in a continuous fashion. Practicability is given first priority in design. To minimize the cost of this instrument, a tape storage technique has been employed in this project. Generally, the operating time of an ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder is restricted by the length of tape. The technology developed in this project superimposes the timing mark onto the electrocardiographic data and lets the tape move in two directions so that the track on the tape surface previously occupied by the timing mark is utilized for storage of the electrocardiographic data. In this manner, the memory size is doubled and the desired operating time can be achieved. To ensure portability and adequate power life, a switchmode dc-dc voltage converter is employed. As a result, the number of batteries needed for operation is made desirably few. To implement the design, a portable <b>auto-reverse</b> music player (Sony ·Walkman) was purchased and modified into an ambulatory electrocardiogram recorder. The ambulatory ECG recorder developed in this project was tested on a subject as well as on two patients at the Royal University Hospital. The results show that it is capable of operating for as long as three days and the recorded data are very close to the original ECG signal in shape...|$|E
