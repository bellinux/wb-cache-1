5|$|After {{returning}} to England, the Natives faced Lancashire in Manchester, where they lost 1–0. Two days later they drew with Batley Bulldogs, despite their opposition scoring five tries. Their next match was against Yorkshire, who {{were one of}} the strongest counties in the country, and {{went on to win the}} inaugural County Championship that season. Yorkshire fielded <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> team, and were subsequently defeated 10–6 by the Natives, who scored six tries. After a further two victories, the team travelled to Wales, where they lost 3–0 to Llanelli, before facing Wales on 22 December.|$|E
5|$|Armed {{hostilities}} {{during the}} Black Hawk War began at Stillman's Run, and the victory was unexpected for Black Hawk and his British Band.

The chase would take them as far as present day Madison, Wisconsin. It ended at the Battle of Bad Axe, where the militia and its allies massacred <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> foe, by then made up of mostly women and children.|$|E

5|$|On February10, MFR began {{tracking}} {{a tropical}} disturbance in the Mozambique channel near Juan de Nova Island. The system tracked generally south-southwestward, gradually intensifying. Given the name Imboa, the storm reached peak winds of 95km/h (60mph) on February13 while passing near Europa Island. After executing a small loop, Imboa {{turned toward the}} southeastern African coastline and approached the eastern coasts of Mozambique and South Africa as <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> system.

5|$|Throughout the Tidewater region, {{there were}} {{estimates}} {{of thousands of}} downed trees, and hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged. Of these, about 40 structures were declared uninhabitable. Debris was blown several blocks inland from the coast. Among the hardest hit locations was Sandbridge, where about 12 homes were severely damaged. It is reported that the state was unprepared for the damage, expecting a strike from <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> tropical storm. About $15.3million (1998 USD) in damage was inflicted in the Virginia Beach and Norfolk areas. Throughout the state, insured losses totaled $95million (1998 USD).|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} {{was located}} in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 9, potentially the same hurricane as the previous storm. It tracked generally eastward toward the coast of Florida, with its hurricane intensity estimation based on two ship reports. At about 0000UTC on September 12, it moved ashore near Clearwater, Florida as a minimal hurricane, with an estimated minimum barometric central pressure of 985mbar. Accelerating east-northeastward while crossing the state, the cyclone emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> tropical storm before regaining hurricane status on September 13. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras.|$|E

5|$|After {{maintaining}} {{peak intensity}} for 36hours, Oliwa gradually weakened as {{it continued to}} the west-northwest, during which it passed through the Northern Marianas Islands. On September14, the typhoon slowed {{to the north of}} Okinawa, and it turned to the northeast toward Japan. As <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> typhoon, Oliwa moved ashore on Makurazaki, Kagoshima, Kyushu with winds of 85mph (140km/h) late on September15. It weakened to tropical storm strength while crossing Japan, and deteriorated further to tropical depression status on September16. On September17, the JTWC issued the final advisory on Oliwa while it was in the eastern portion of the Sea of Japan. The JMA maintained advisories as the storm crossed northern Japan, and it accelerated over the open Pacific Ocean. On September19, Oliwa dissipated near the International Date Line to the south of the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing out}} on a UEFA berth for 1971–72, Manchester City were invited {{to play in the}} Texaco Cup, a {{competition}} for English, Scottish and Irish teams. City fielded <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> side for the second leg of their tie against Airdrieonians. As punishment Manchester City had their £1,000 prize money withheld and were banned from the competition for two years. Upon the expiry of the suspension in 1974, the club entered the competition again, but exited in the group stage. The tournament saw Denis Law play his final matches as a professional. The withdrawal of Irish teams saw the competition renamed the Anglo-Scottish Cup the following year. Again, City failed to progress beyond the group stage.|$|E

Two victories {{in the league}} followed against Lincoln Citythe first time the two teams had met in a league game since the fire disaster in 1985 and Peterborough United.

5|$|Cyclone Nadia was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that struck both Madagascar and Mozambique in March 1994. It formed on March16 and moved westward for the first ten days of its duration. Warm waters and low wind shear allowed for the storm to gradually strengthen. After developing a well-defined eye, Nadia intensified to reach winds of 175km/h (110mph 10minute sustained) early on March22, according to Météo-France (MF). In contrast, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated winds of about 220km/h (140mph 1minute sustained). On March23, the cyclone struck northern Madagascar, causing flooding and localized damage where it moved ashore. There were 12deaths in the country. Nadia emerged into the Mozambique Channel as <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> storm, although it reintensified slightly before making landfall in northeastern Mozambique on March24. The storm turned southward through the country, emerging over water on March26. It turned to the northeast and meandered over waters before dissipating on April1.|$|E

5|$|Following mass vaccinations, disease {{detection}} and containment were {{central to the}} eradication campaign. As soon as cases were detected, the victims were isolated as were their close contacts, who were vaccinated. Successes came quickly; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa, nor, by 1971, in Brazil. By 1973, smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub-continent, Botswana and Ethiopia. Finally, after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and vaccination campaigns throughout the world, the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979. Although the main weapon used was vaccinia virus, which {{was used as the}} vaccine, no one seems to know exactly where vaccinia virus came from; it is not the strain of cowpox that Edward Jenner used, and it is not <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> form of smallpox.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ekeka was {{an unusual}} Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone that attained major hurricane status {{during the month of}} February. The first storm of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season, Ekeka developed on January 28 well to the south of Hawaii. It gradually intensified to reach major hurricane status on February 2, although it subsequently began to weaken due to unfavorable wind shear. It crossed the International Date Line as <b>a</b> <b>weakened</b> tropical storm, and shortly thereafter degraded to tropical depression status. Ekeka continued westward, passing through the Marshall Islands and later over Chuuk State, before dissipating on February 9 about 310miles (500km) off the north coast of Papua New Guinea. The storm did not cause any significant damage or deaths.|$|E
