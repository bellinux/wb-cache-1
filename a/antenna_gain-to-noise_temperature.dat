40|$|The {{technical}} {{objectives of}} the uplink interference tests and measurements to be performed during this experiment are set forth as {{the determination of the}} integrated interference power from all 6 -GHz terrestrial sources sharing the common carrier band with the RF field of view of the ATS-F satellite; the establishment of practical limits of receiver <b>antenna</b> <b>gain-to-noise</b> <b>temperature</b> ratios for satellites sharing the common 6 -GHz carrier band; and the determination of the geographical and frequency distribution of 6 -GHz terrestrial sources sharing the common carrier band. A brief description of the RF interference measurement system with some details on its hardware and subsystems is included. The performance characteristics of the mission and a measurement program are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Results of a {{statistical}} error analysis performed {{to determine the}} degree of uncertainty encountered when calibrating steerable receiving antennas with the solar calibration method. The analysis considers the propagation of precision error indices. It is shown that a worst-case one-sigma (1 sigma) uncertainty of plus or minus 0. 8 dB in system noise temperature occurs for a solar calibration at L-band. Somewhat better precision {{can be achieved by}} monitoring the <b>antenna</b> <b>gain-to-noise</b> <b>temperature</b> ratio at a station; a worst-case uncertainty of plus or minus 0. 5 dB (1 sigma) can be realized. An error analysis is made of a method to determine absolute antenna gain based upon solar flux density. The uncertainty in this type of measurement is plus or minus 0. 7 dB (1 sigma) at L- and S-band frequencies...|$|E
40|$|Calculations using Physical Optics {{computer}} software were done {{to optimize the}} <b>gain-to-noise</b> <b>temperature</b> (G/T) ratio of DSS- 13, the DSN's 34 -m beam-waveguide antenna, at X-band for operation with the ultra-low-noise amplifier maser system. A better G/T value was obtained by using a 24. 2 -dB far-field-gain smooth-wall dual-mode horn than by using the standard X-band 22. 5 -dB-gain corrugated horn...|$|R
40|$|To make {{satellite}} channels {{cost competitive}} with optical cables, {{the use of}} small, inexpensive earth stations with reduced antenna size and high powered amplifier (HPA) power will be needed. This will necessitate the use of high e. i. r. p. and <b>gain-to-noise</b> <b>temperature</b> ratio (G/T) multibeam satellites. For a multibeam satellite, onboard switching is {{required in order to}} maintain the needed connectivity between beams. This switching function can be realized by either an receive frequency (RF) or a baseband unit. The baseband switching approach has the additional advantage of decoupling the up-link and down-link, thus enabling rate and format conversion as well as improving the link performance. A baseband switching satellite requires the demultiplexing and demodulation of the up-link carriers before they can be switched to their assigned down-link beams. Principles of operation, design and implementation issues of such an onboard demultiplexer/demodulator (bulk demodulator) that was recently built at COMSAT Labs. are discussed...|$|R

The analysis considers the propagation of precision error indices. It is shown that an antenna gain calibration by the stellar method has a one-sigma (1 sigma) uncertainty of plus or minus 0. 65 dB at 1440 MHz (L-band), and plus or minus 0. 8 dB (1 sigma) at 136 MHz (vhf). Somewhat increased precision {{can be achieved by}} monitoring the <b>antenna</b> <b>gain-to-noise</b> <b>temperature</b> ratio at a station; a worst-case uncertainty of plus or minus 0. 4 dB (1 sigma) can be realized at both L-band and vhf.
