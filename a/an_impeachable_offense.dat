500|$|Bauer {{said that}} {{nobody in the}} {{administration}} itself directly discussed the offer with Sestak, {{and he does not}} believe there was anything improper, illegal or unethical about the conduct. Republicans in Congress disagreed, arguing the action contradicted claims Obama made during his presidential campaign about ethical conduct and transparency in government. Darrell Issa, in particular, felt it was <b>an</b> <b>impeachable</b> <b>offense</b> and referred to it as [...] "Obama's Watergate". Nevertheless, the matter gradually became less of a focus during the primary election, where other topics like spending and the economy took the spotlight. With Issa poised to become chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform following the Republican Party recapturing the house during the 2010 midterm elections, it was widely expected he would launch an official investigation into the job offer based on his prior critical comments about the matter. However, on November 5, Issa announced he would not pursue an investigation. Some politicians and members of the media said that the job offer made to Sestak was neither illegal nor abhorrent, and that such deals are regularly made by politicians of all levels. Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post felt the matter only appeared to be a scandal because the White House badly mishandled the response, and Chicago Tribune writer John Kass wrote, [...] "Offering a spot to an ambitious young politician to protect an old servile weakling isn't new. Presidents do it, governors do it. Big-city mayors really know how to do it." ...|$|E

Upon an offer from John Doar, Woods went to Washington in January 1974 and began leading a task force on constitutional issues for the inquiry into a possible impeachment of Richard Nixon. Working closely with Bill Weld and Hillary Rodham, the task force researched previous American and British cases of impeachment, mostly working in the Library of Congress. Their report asserted that not all crimes were <b>impeachable</b> <b>offenses</b> and that not all <b>impeachable</b> <b>offenses</b> were crimes.

2500|$|When the new Reichstag first assembled, Papen {{hoped to}} use the {{opportunity}} to drop all pretense of democracy. [...] He obtained in advance from Hindenburg a decree to dissolve it, then secured another decree to suspend elections for the time being. When the Reichstag met on 12 September 1932, it managed to elect Hermann Göring as its speaker, which {{was followed by a}} Communist motion of no confidence in the Papen government. Papen had anticipated this gambit, however. He knew that the Communist no-confidence motion would only be entertained if the other parties all agreed to a last-minute change in the Reichstags agenda. Alfred Hugenberg had promised Papen that the DNVP would object to the Communist motion. Hearing reports that the NSDAP and the Zentrum were in talks about forming a new government, Hugenberg ordered the DNVP not to object to the change in agenda without telling Papen {{as part of an effort}} to save his government as he believed the Nazis would have to vote against the Communist no-confidence motion to avoid a new election. However, when no one objected, Papen ordered one of his messengers to fetch the dissolution decree. Göring phoned Hitler in Munich, asking him whether the Nazis should vote for the Communist no-confidence motion, and was ordered to vote ja (yes). Papen demanded the floor in order to read the dissolution decree, but Göring pretended not to see him. The motion carried by 512 votes to 42-a result that German historian Eberhard Kolb described as a defeat [...] "such as had never been known in German parliamentary history." [...] Angry and red-faced as Göring ignored him, Papen threw the decree dissolving the Reichstag at him and stormed out. [...] Realizing that he did not have nearly enough support to go through with his plan to subvert the republic from within, Papen decided to call another election to punish the Reichstag for voting against his government. Papen had planned not to call another election after dissolving the Reichstag, but he changed his mind after the NSDAP and the Zentrum threatened to use Article 59 of the constitution, which allowed for impeachment of the president if he violated the constitution, and after Hindenburg's lawyers informed him that dissolving the Reichstag without scheduling new elections was <b>an</b> <b>impeachable</b> <b>offense.</b>|$|E
