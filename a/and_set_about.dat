5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> invading {{the island of}} Tresco. Taking the harbour of Old Grimsby in an amphibious assault on 18 April, he then simply {{bypassed}} King Charles' Castle and marched south, using Tresco {{as a basis for}} then taking the neighbouring island of St Mary's.|$|E
5|$|Between 1869 and 1870, {{the society}} {{completed}} {{construction of a}} new two-story brick building on Lot 56 at the corner of West Main and North High Streets known as Literary Hall, where it could hold its meetings and reassemble the remaining volumes from its original library. Literary Hall was built upon the former location of the shuttered Bank of the South Branch of the Potomac. In addition to the 400 volumes that were initially recovered following the war, the society recovered several more volumes from its original library, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> purchasing new books; the restored library was reopened with about 700 volumes.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, Arrington {{was curious}} {{about the price of}} {{potatoes}} <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> his first economic experiment. He put slips of paper in some of the sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.|$|E

5|$|Edward was {{determined}} to prevent any further rebellion in North Wales <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> building a sequence of new castles and walled towns, replacing the old Welsh administrative system with a new principality governed from Caernarfon. Dolbadarn was no longer relevant and within two years timber from the castle was {{being used by the}} Normans for the construction of Caernarfon Castle. This was both a practical and a symbolic action, demonstrating Norman power over {{one of the most important}} possessions of the Welsh princes.|$|E
5|$|Like Trollope before him, Pope Hennessy took {{rooms at}} The Shannon Hotel, {{near the river}} <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> trying to {{capture the essence of}} the town which had {{inspired}} Trollope's first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran. He proved to be a very popular figure in the town, evidenced {{by the fact that he}} was asked to adjudicate at a local beauty pageant and the horse fair. Pope Hennessy gives particular mention to the Corcoran family, the proprietors of The Shannon Hotel in the 1960s and 1970s, for their help in the production of his work. They sold the hotel in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Nunney Castle {{was built}} {{near the village}} of Nunney in Somerset by Sir John Delamare. Delamare had been a soldier during the Hundred Years War with France, where he had made his fortune. He {{obtained}} a licence to crenellate from Edward III to build a castle on the site of his existing, unfortified manor house in 1373 <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> developing a new, substantial fortification.|$|E

5|$|Small town friends Edna (Deanna Durbin) and Judy (Judy Garland) are upset. Edna's {{grandfather}} and his orchestra, who play free Sunday concerts {{at a local}} park, have been fired by the town council because the concerts are poorly attended. The girls hit upon the idea of singing at the concerts <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> promoting the next concert. The following Sunday Edna and Judy join Granddad on the bandstand. Edna's operatic style and Judy's swing bring crowds running {{from all over the}} park. The event is a huge success and Granddad's concerts are saved.|$|E

Although the main house was restored in 1996, funding was not available to restore the smaller buildings until 2006, with construction completed in spring 2007. The rancho is on State Route 126, but little is visible from the highway.|$|E
5|$|The first castle at Lydford {{was built}} in the {{aftermath}} of the Norman conquest of England in 1066. In 1068 William the Conqueror intervened in South-West England to put down widespread Anglo-Saxon revolts against Norman rule <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> pacifying the region. William had been responsible for building urban castles across England in the former centres of Anglo-Saxon power and in Devon he constructed new urban castles at Exeter, Totnes, possibly Barnstaple and in the town of Lydford.|$|E

5|$|AC/DC {{underwent}} several line-up changes before releasing {{their first}} album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans {{was replaced by}} Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 {{after a night of}} heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman {{invasion}} of 1066, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux {{and the new}} Earl of Kent, probably acquired the manor, which had by this time been lost by its former owners in Canterbury. The burh appears to have continued in use, either because the manor continued to be managed {{in the same way}} as before, or because the occupation of the former elite site demonstrated the Normans' power over the local community. Odo's lands and those of the Archbishop of Canterbury bordered each other, and Eynsford fell within an area mainly controlled by Canterbury. The Italian monk Lanfranc became the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> attempting to recover the manor, probably finally doing so around 1082, when Odo was arrested by King William. Lanfranc assigned a knight called Ralph, probably a lay retainer from Normandy, to run the estate, and appointed Ralph's son, William de Enysford, to the role on his father's death.|$|E
5|$|Although Arsenal {{was founded}} in 1886, {{it was not until}} 1897 that the club {{appointed}} a permanent manager in charge of first-team affairs, with Thomas Mitchell universally recognised as Arsenal's first professional manager. Mitchell joined Arsenal five months after resigning from Blackburn Rovers in October 1896. The Scotsman's time at Woolwich Arsenal was brief and he left his post barely a year into his contract, though he did manage to take the club from tenth to fifth in the league. Mitchell guided Arsenal through a respectable cup run which culminated in the first round proper. William Elcoat succeeded Mitchell as manager in April 1898, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> reviving the squad with new additions. The changes did not have the desired effect; his team finished seventh in a league of 18 and were beaten 6–0 by Derby County in the FA Cup first round. He departed in February 1899, and like his predecessor only remained for a season.|$|E

50|$|With {{concern in}} the village, the Mayor puts up a bounty for its capture of £3000. Percy is as unscrupulous as his rivals <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> <b>about</b> trying to capture his own “Killing machine” {{with the help of}} Arwell and Quimby the wolf hunter.|$|R
5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> taking {{the island of}} Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse. Blake {{deployed}} a force of men in small boats, but they landed on the wrong island {{and had to be}} recalled to the ships. The next day the men landed on the beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E
5|$|Conwy Castle {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} {{again by the}} early 17th century. Charles I sold it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £100, and Edward's son, also called Edward, inherited the ruin in 1631. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles' royalist supporters and Parliament. John Williams, the Archbishop of York, {{took charge of the}} castle on behalf of the king, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> repairing and garrisoning it at his own expense. In 1645, Sir John Owen was appointed governor of the castle instead, however, leading to a bitter dispute between the two men. The Archbishop defected to Parliament, the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton finally took the castle itself after a substantial siege.|$|E
5|$|Feminist cinema, advocating or {{illustrating}} feminist perspectives, arose largely {{with the}} development of feminist film theory in the late '60s and early '70s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women. Differences were particularly marked between feminists {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, Women and Film. Trailblazers from this period included Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey, who also organized the Women's Event at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include Teresa de Lauretis, Anneke Smelik and Kaja Silverman. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, {{the rival}} American League {{declared}} major league status <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> raiding National League rosters. Young left St. Louis {{and joined the}} American League's Boston Americans for a $3,500 contract ($ today). Young would remain with the Boston team until 1909. In {{his first year in}} the American League, Young was dominant. Pitching to Criger, who had also jumped to Boston, Young led the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA, thus earning the colloquial AL Triple Crown for pitchers. Young won almost 42% of his team's games in 1901, accounting for 33 of his team's 79 wins. In February 1902, {{before the start of the}} baseball season, Young served as a pitching coach at Harvard University. The sixth-grade graduate instructing Harvard students delighted Boston newspapers. The following year, Young coached at Mercer University during the spring. The team went on to win the Georgia state championship in 1903, 1904, and 1905.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 17th century a rising cost of {{consumable}} goods and a series of bad harvests brought about economic changes in Glamorgan. Those with enough wealth were able to seize on opportunities created by these unsettled conditions <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> enlarging and enclosing farm lands. The enclosure of freehold lands that began in the later Middle Ages now gained momentum and farms that were once owned by individual farmers were now owned by small groups of wealthy landowners. By the 19th century most of the Rhondda farms and estates were owned by absentee landlords, such as the Marquis of Bute, Earl of Dunraven, Crawshay Bailey of Merthyr and the De Winton family of Brecon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 16th century, Lyme Regis was an {{important}} port, busier than Liverpool {{and one of the}} main links between England and mainland Europe. The combination of strong Puritan beliefs, and demands from King Charles I for ship money meant that upon the outbreak of the First English Civil War, the town was sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause. Two local members of parliament (MP), Thomas Trenchard and Walter Erle claimed Lyme Regis for the Parliamentarians in 1642, <b>and</b> <b>set</b> <b>about</b> fortifying the town. Thomas Ceeley, another local MP, was assigned as governor of the town and its forces. He immediately set about removing those with Royalist loyalties from the area, and sent harrying forces around the region, as far as Exeter and Somerset. Lyme Regis had no permanent fortifications, and so Robert Blake established a set of earthen walls, ditches and forts {{around the perimeter of the}} town.|$|E
