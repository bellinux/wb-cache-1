5000|$|Avon Castle and its private halt {{were sold}} to the Turner-Turner family on 25 June 1863 for £14,300, and the new owner {{exercised}} his right to travel on services running both ways on the line. In March 1872 a dispute arose between the owner and the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) which had introduced a new through-service to Bournemouth from London. The LSWR argued that these new services were not [...] "ordinary services" [...] {{within the meaning of}} the 1859 Act. The owner began an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> a <b>declaration</b> that he was entitled to stop the through-services, as well as an injunction restraining the LSWR from refusing to stop the trains. The railway company argued in its defence that to have to stop the fast services at Avon Lodge Halt would render it practically impossible to run express trains on the line, and that passengers travelling on such services were paying the maximum fares.|$|R
40|$|In declaratory {{judgment}} actions brought by alleged infringers against rights holders, such as <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>declaration</b> of invalidity or non-infringement {{of intellectual property}} rights, U. S. courts have long maintained that sending a cease-and-desist letter alone, absent other acts in an alleged infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum, is not a sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction over the rights holder who mailed them to the alleged infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum. Notwithstanding the similarities between cease-and-desist letters and notifications under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals recently decided that sending a notification alone does establish a basis for personal jurisdiction over the rights holder. Contrary to {{the decision of the}} Tenth Circuit, this article suggests that cease-and-desist letters and DMCA notifications should be treated similarly. First, as a matter of doctrine, the two instruments are similar enough to warrant application of the same rule. If a letter does not support the exercise of personal jurisdiction in {{declaratory judgment}} actions against the rights holder, neither should a notification. Second, as a matter of policy, maintaining the same approach to the two instruments would promote settlements. The Tenth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s approach defeats this pro-settlement policy because it discourages rights holders from using notifications to achieve a speedy removal of allegedly infringing material from the Internet. To avoid personal jurisdiction in the infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum, rights holders must refrain from using a notification and are thereby deprived of the option to stop further infringements immediately; without such an option {{they are less likely to}} seek settlement before filing a lawsuit. It is important to clarify whether notifications will be a basis of personal jurisdiction over a rights holder because the result will determine how practicable the use of notifications will be for rights holders and therefore how effective the notification system will be...|$|R
40|$|One Gustav Muller, {{a native}} German, resided in England on May 20 th, 1915. He {{had never been}} naturalized. He owned a {{leasehold}} house in England, and on the date just mentioned he executed a power of attorney to one John White to sell this leasehold house and make proper conveyance of the same. Six days later he was permitted by the British Government to return to Germany, and he started the same day, May 26 th. He {{was known to be}} in Germany on June 11 th, but the date of his arrival was unknown. On June 2 the leasehold was sold to Tingley, but the latter, upon learning the facts here given respecting Muller refused to proceed with the contract of sale, and commenced an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> a <b>declaration</b> that the contract was illegal because {{at the time it was}} made the defendant, Muller, was an alien enemy. Eve, J., held that this fact had not been proved, and dismissed the action, and an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal, Tingley v. Muller, [1917] L. R. 2 Ch. 144, and the decision of Eve, J., was sustained...|$|R
40|$|New Jersey was the State which, by {{the statute}} of 1915 and the case of In re Ungaro’s Will, began the current {{movement}} for {{the introduction of the}} declaratory judgment into American procedure. Appreciation of its beneficent effect is attested by the fact that thirty-one American jurisdictions have now adopted it as an aid in the solution of contested issues of law, before one party or the other has incurred the risk of loss or damage by acting upon his own interpretation of his rights under a contract, will, statute, or other legal instrument or relation. Its history in continental Europe is ancient, and its modern utility is exemplified by the fact that approximately two-thirds of the cases in equity decided by the High Court in England are <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> a <b>declaration</b> of rights. A somewhat similar record may be cited for other English-speaking jurisdictions, and on the continent the declaratory form of judicial relief has acquired wide vogue in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Some six hundred cases in the highest state courts, since 1921, mark the progress of the movement in the United States, where it has gained increasingly popular favor, especially in New York, California, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Kentucky, and Tennessee...|$|R

In this article, it is argued that the common law could assist them in this respect. They should be able to rely on present or past possession to raise a presumption of Aboriginal title, and so shift the burden onto the Crown to prove its own title. Moreover, Aboriginal nations may be more successful if they bring an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> trespass or for recovery of possession of land, rather than <b>for</b> <b>declaration</b> of Aboriginal title...|$|R

Strumenti di coordinamento tra giurisdizioni statali in materia civile", Naples, Jovene Editore, 2008. Thereby, it moves form the general features of lis alibi pendens and related actions as instruments of coordination among state jurisdictions to address more closely the European regulation of the subject as contained in EC Regulation No. 44 / 2001. The study focuses on the main problems raised by the practical implementation of the said regulation, from {{the determination of the}} identity of the parties of the two concurrent sets of proceedings, to the determination of the identity of the cause of action. In this respect, the author points to the risk of forum shopping inherent in the broad characterization of the said requirement adopted by the European Court of Justice in its case law. The analysis offered by the article is completed by an assessment of the main proposals for reform of the said regulation as advanced in the Green Paper on the review of the Brussels I Regulation (COM(2009) 175 final), with particular regard to troublesome issues such as the relationship between exclusive choice of forum agreements and lis alibi pendens, the requirement of identity of cause of action in relation to <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> a negative <b>declaration</b> and the specific problems posed by lis pendens, exclusive jurisdiction and related actions in the field of intellectual property...|$|R
