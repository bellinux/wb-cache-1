500|$|Ronnie Gene Dunn {{was born}} June 1, 1953 in Coleman, Texas.

He added [...] "Commercial TV is not about risk taking, it is about entertainment for the broadest possible audience. But attitudes have changed and commercial networks like to reflect that". Holy Soap said Chris's most memorable moment was [...] "Announcing to his entire class that he was gay." [...] Anthony D. Langford from website, AfterElton said he found it [...] "humorous" [...] that Neighbours emphasizes what a gentleman Chris is compared to Andrew.
