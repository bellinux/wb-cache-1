40|$|Introduction. Alcoholism could {{represent}} {{an important factor}} of crime and different forms of abuse of family members (physical and emotional) exist in many alcohol-addict cases, as well as characteristics of immoral behaviour. Objective. The objective of our {{study was to determine}} the predominating forms in moral judgment of <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicts,</b> and to examine whether there was any statistically significant difference in moral judgment between <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicted</b> persons and non-alcoholics from general population. Methods. The sample consisted of 62 subjects, divided into a study (alcoholics) and a control group (non-alcoholics from general population). The following instruments were used: social-demographic data, AUDIT, MMPI- 201, cybernetic battery of IQ tests (KOG- 3) and the TMR moral reasoning test. Results. Mature forms of moral judgment prevailed in both group of subjects, <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicted</b> persons and non-alcoholics. Regarding mature forms of moral judgment (driven by emotions and cognitive) non-alcoholics from the general population had higher scores, but the difference was not statistically significant. Regarding socially adapted and egocentric orientation <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicted</b> persons had higher scores. However, only regarding intuitive-irrational orientation there was a statistically significant difference in the level of moral judgment (p< 0. 05) between alcoholics and non-alcoholics, in favour of the alcoholics. Conclusion. Moral judgment is not a category differing <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicted</b> persons from those who are not. Nevertheless, the potential destructivity of alcoholism is reflected in lower scores regarding mature orientations in moral judgment...|$|R

40|$|Context Fecal elastase is a {{noninvasive test}} for {{pancreatic}} insufficiency diagnosis. Objectives Evaluate {{the usefulness of}} fecal elastase 1 for the indication of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency among former <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicts</b> and patients with chronic pancreatitis. Methods Forty-three patients with chronic pancreatitis and thirty-three asymptomatic former <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicts</b> entered the study. The levels of fecal elastase 1 were measured using a commercial kit. Pancreatic imaging findings were used to categorize the groups. Results The levels of fecal elastase 1 were significantly lower in the patients than in the former <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicts</b> and in the group with tissue calcifications, duct alterations, or atrophy. With a cutoff level of 100 &# 956;g/g, the sensitivity of fecal elastase 1 in chronic pancreatitis was 46. 51 % and its specificity was 87. 88 % with a positive predictive value of 83. 33 % and a negative predictive value of 55. 77 %. When patients were stratified according to the severity of their pancreatitis, the sensitivity was 6. 25 % for mild pancreatitis and 70. 37 % for marked pancreatitis. Conclusion Low level of fecal elastase 1 was associated with marked rather than mild chronic pancreatitis; however, {{it may be useful}} to indicate pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in asymptomatic former <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: In this study, it {{is aimed}} to {{evaluate}} the validity and reliability of the Beliefs About Substance Use Questionnaire (BSU) which was originally developed by Wright (1993). Method: Seventy <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicted</b> inpatients, who were admitted to Ankara Dýþkapý Yýldýrým Beyazýt Education and Research Hospital Psychiatry Clinic, 31 healthy volunteers who had never used alcohol and 33 social drinkers were evaluated. For all groups, BSU and Craving Beliefs Questionnaire (CBQ), for the patient groups, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA), Dysfunctional Attitudes Questionnaire (DAS) and Automatic Thoughts Questionnaire (ATQ) were used as the assessment tools. The correlations and differences between the questionnaires were studied. Results: Mean age of the addicted patients, healthy controls and social drinkers were 42, 3 ± 7, 0, 33, 5 ± 9, 9 and 33, 2 ± 8, 9, respectively. In patient group, mean BSU score was 46, 4 ± 21, 2. For <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicts,</b> internal reliability of BSU was foundto be adequate (Cronbach alfa= 0. 91) and item-total score correlations were between 0. 33 and 0. 69. Basic component analysis showed one basic factor. A positive correlation has been found between BSU and CBQ, and ATQ scores. No correlations have been found between total and subscale scores of DAS and total scores of CIWA, BAI and BSU. In evaluation of validity, BSU mean scores of <b>alcohol</b> <b>addicts</b> {{were found to be}} significantly higher than healthy controls and social drinkers.

50|$|The early sequences, {{in which}} Jane {{is sent to}} Lowood, a harsh {{boarding}} school, are derived from the author's own experiences. Helen Burns's death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Brontë's sisters Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood {{as a result of}} the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge, near Tunstall, Lancashire. Mr. Brocklehurst is based on Rev. William Carus Wilson (1791-1859), the Evangelical minister who ran the school. Additionally, John Reed's decline into alcoholism and dissolution recalls the life of Charlotte's brother Branwell, who became an opium and <b>alcohol</b> <b>addict</b> in the years preceding his death.
