2500|$|These early mammals {{developed}} many traits {{which were}} to make them well-suited for a very active lifestyle. They developed four types of teeth (as opposed to the uniform teeth of the reptiles), incisors, canines, premolars and molars, which enabled them to chew and therefore process their food more thoroughly than their reptilian cousins. There {{is evidence that the}} inward-closing movement of the mandible suggests <b>a</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>action</b> to chew food. Their skeletons changed so that their limbs were more flexible (they became less laterally splayed, allowing for faster forward motion) and they developed a shorter ribcage and larger lungs to allow for faster respiration. The structure of their jaw bones changed, the lower jaw becoming a single bone [...] the dentary (as opposed to the seven different bones found in reptilian lower jaws). The other bones which once made up the jaw moved to the middle ear to create a hearing system.|$|E

50|$|Another {{lineage of}} Mesozoic mammals, the eutriconodonts, have been {{suggested}} to be aquatic animals with mixed results.

5000|$|Cold {{saw blades}} are {{circular}} metal cutting saw blades categorized into two types: solid HSS or tungsten carbide-tipped (TCT). Both types of blades are resharpenable {{and may be}} used many times before being discarded. Cold saw blades are used to cut metal using a relatively slow rotational speed, usually less than 5000 surface feet per minute (SFM) (25m/s), and a high chip load per tooth, usually between [...]001" [...] - [...]003" [...] (0.025 - 0.08mm) per tooth. These blades are driven by a high power motor and high-torque gear reduction unit or an AC vector drive.

Reliability of the 3 D chip stack, TSV and solder micro-bump are assessed by examining local stresses and the buildup of plastic strain through series of parametric twodimensional (2 D) and 3 D finite element method (FEM) simulations. A special case when the solder joint is transformed into an intermetallic compound is also examined. Misalignment induced shearing strongly influences stresses and deformation in and around the micro-bump. Thermal CTE mismatches influence stresses and deformation in the entire 3 D chip stack and in the TSV far away from the joint.

50|$|Assuming a flow is bounded on {{one side}} only, and that a {{rectilinear}} flow passing over a stationary flat plate which lies parallel to the flow, the flow just upstream of the plate has a uniform velocity. As the flow comes {{into contact with the}} plate, the layer of fluid actually 'adheres' to a solid surface. There is then a considerable shearing action between the layer of fluid on the plate surface and the second layer of fluid. The second layer is therefore forced to decelerate (though it is not quite brought to rest), creating <b>a</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>action</b> with the third layer of fluid, and so on. As the fluid passes further along the plate, the zone in which shearing action occurs tends to spread further outwards. This zone is known as the 'boundary layer'. The flow outside the boundary layer is free of shear and viscous-related forces so it is assumed to act like an ideal fluid. The intermolecular cohesive forces in a fluid are not great enough to hold fluid together. Hence a fluid will flow under the action of the slightest stress and flow will continue as long as the stress is present. The flow inside the layer can be either viscous or turbulent, depending on Reynolds number.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with all}} matters {{relating}} to pore pressure analysis, the method cannot be applied blindly. In particular, models and constants {{need to be}} adjusted to the particular basin being drilled. The method was developed for the delta of the Mississippi/ Missouri river system in the United States, and works reasonably well there. However, basins with different sediment sources cannot be assumed {{to have the same}} compaction profiles (because they may have different depositional clay mineralogy). Basins with different pore fluid chemistry will have differing hydrostatic pressure profiles, leading to different dc-exponent profiles.

In particular, the use of PDC-type bits with <b>a</b> <b>shearing</b> cutting <b>action</b> (instead of the chipping action that Jorden & Shirley (1966) assumed in their chip-holddown model) will lead to dc-exponent plots that differ from tricone or bi-cone bits in the same formations.While doing wildcat exploration work in a region, the method can be applied [...] "by the book", but after drilling the first well, one would need to carefully re-evaluate the data collected to try to improve the model for the particular basin in question.While it can be used successfully, one must always validate the information presented by dc-exponent plots by examining multiple other pore pressure indicators.|$|R

A semi-industrial twin screw extruder with <b>a</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>action</b> and reactor along with 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole-disulfide (MBTS) chemical were used to devulcanize the waste powder at two different feed screw speeds and main rotor speeds at a constant temperature of 220 °C.

The blends, commercial compound and devulcanized powder were cured with a semi-efficient (SEV) vulcanization system and their viscosity, cure and mechanical properties measured. For the blends, the Mooney viscosity was unchanged with 40 wt%, crosslink density with 20 wt%, tensile strength and elongation at break with 10 wt%, and compression set with 20 wt% of the devulcanized powder. Interestingly, the hardness benefitted from 50 wt% of the devulcanized powder in the blends. The scorch and optimum cure times shortened and the cure rate index rose when the loading of the devulcanized powder in the blends was raised.

Due to the geometry of the LSB, {{as well as its}} unique residual stress characteristics and initial geometric imperfections resultant of manufacturing processes, much of the existing research for common cold-formed steel sections is not directly applicable to LSB. Experimental and numerical studies have been carried out to evaluate the behaviour and design of LSBs subject to pure bending <b>actions</b> and predominant <b>shear</b> <b>actions.</b> To date, however, no investigation has been conducted into the strength of LSB sections under combined bending and <b>shear</b> <b>actions.</b> Combined bending and shear is especially prevalent at the supports of continuous span and cantilever beams, where the interaction of high shear force and bending moment can reduce the capacity of a section to well below that for the same section subject only to pure shear or moment. Hence experimental studies were conducted to assess the combined bending and shear behaviour and strengths of LSBs. Eighteen tests were conducted and the results were compared with current AS/NZS 4600 and AS 4100 design rules. AS/NZS 4600 design rules were shown to grossly underestimate the combined bending and shear capacities of LSBs and hence two lower bound design equations were proposed based on experimental results.
