The group was formed on 28 January 2017 as a merger between Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly al-Nusra Front), the <b>Ansar</b> <b>al-Din</b> <b>Front,</b> Jaysh al-Sunna, Liwa al-Haqq, and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement. After the announcement, additional groups and individuals joined. The merger is currently led by Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and former Ahrar al-Sham leaders, although the High Command consists of leaders from other groups. Many groups and individuals defected from Ahrar al-Sham, representing their more conservative and Salafist elements. Currently, a number of analysts and media outlets still continue to refer to this group by its previous names, al-Nusra Front, or Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on three case studies {{representing}} highlights of tensions concerning the religious background. We examine the deep cultural roots of religious intolerance {{and some of the}} triggers for the recent outbreak of the following disputes in Israel: Safed – The call by rabbis to Jews not to rent or sell apartments to Arabs; Beit Shemesh – The intimidation of Ultraorthodox against non-Haredi and secular Jews, particularly targeting women and children; and Nazareth – The growing control of the Islamic Movement at the Shihab <b>al-Din</b> Tomb in <b>front</b> of the Church of Annunciation. All three case studies manifest an immediate trigger and religious discourse for justifying violence but we found that they cover deeper social processes. Violence emerged from the same roots of cultural exclusivity though refracted through different cultural lenses. The crises discussed reflect on the one hand the growing need of identity-groups to solidify their group-solidarity in times of crisis. While on the other hand they manifest the need of conservative groups to counter modernity...|$|R
