5|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{relative}} <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> of the electron Ar(e) is measured relative to the mass of a carbon-12 atom (divided by 12). When the Avogadro constant is set in the new SI, atomic masses might be measured in dalton (by fixing the Avogadro constant), instead of <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> units (by fixing the mass of carbon-12), thus resulting in a difference between the values of the relative <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> and the <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> in units of dalton.|$|E
5|$|For {{isotopes}} with <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> unit values {{less than}} that of the most abundant stable isotope, 106Pd, the primary decay mode is electron capture with the primary decay product being rhodium.

50|$|In the 1860s Stanislao Cannizzaro refined {{relative}} <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> {{by applying}} Avogadro's law (notably at the Karlsruhe Congress of 1860). He formulated {{a law to}} determine relative <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> of elements: the different quantities of the same element contained in different molecules are all whole multiples of the atomic weight and determined relative <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> and molecular masses by comparing the vapor density {{of a collection of}} gases with molecules containing {{one or more of the}} chemical element in question.|$|R

40|$|We have {{discovered}} a new method of generating electric currents, directly from high pressure-induced flow of neutral ionic solutions.

5|$|Twenty-nine radioisotopes {{have also}} been synthesized, ranging in <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> from 138 to 173. The most stable of these is 154Dy, with a {{half-life}} of approximately 3years, followed by 159Dy with a half-life of 144.4days. The least stable is 138Dy, with a half-life of 200ms. As a general rule, isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by β+ decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by β− decay. However, 154Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and 152Dy and 159Dy decay primarily by electron capture. Dysprosium also has at least 11 metastable isomers, ranging in <b>atomic</b> <b>mass</b> from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is 165mDy, which has a half-life of 1.257minutes. 149Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, 149m2Dy, has a half-life of 28ns.|$|E

Unstable copper isotopes with <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> below 63 tend to undergo β+ decay, while isotopes with <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> above 65 tend to undergo β− decay. 64Cu decays by both β+ and β−.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{definitions}} {{apply to}} molecules. One can compute the molecular mass of a compound {{by adding the}} <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> of its constituent atoms (nuclides). One can compute the molar mass of a compound by adding the relative <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> of the elements given in the chemical formula. In both cases the multiplicity of the atoms (the number of times it occurs) {{must be taken into}} account, usually by multiplication of each unique mass by its multiplicity.|$|R
50|$|The {{estimation}} of the uncertainty is complicated, especially as the sample distribution is not necessarily symmetrical: the IUPAC standard relative <b>atomic</b> <b>masses</b> are quoted with estimated symmetrical uncertainties, and the value for silicon is 28.0855(3). The relative standard uncertainty in this value is 1 or 10 ppm.

5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative <b>atomic</b> <b>mass.</b> The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average <b>atomic</b> <b>mass,</b> and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
