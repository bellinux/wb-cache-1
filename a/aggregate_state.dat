This paper shows that using rollover risk as a disciplining device is effective only if all banks face purely idiosyncratic risk. However, if banks' assets are correlated, a two-sided inefficiency arises: Good <b>aggregate</b> <b>states</b> have banks taking excessive risks, while bad <b>aggregate</b> <b>states</b> suffer from fire sales. The driving force behind this inefficiency is an amplifying feedback loop between asset liquidation values and market discipline.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a {{framework in which}} a model with a continuum of agents and with individual and aggregate risks {{can be viewed as}} an idealization of large finite economies. The paper identifies conditions under which a sequence of finite economies gives rise to a limiting continuum economy in which uncertainty has a simple structure. The state space is the product of <b>aggregate</b> <b>states</b> and micro-states; <b>aggregate</b> <b>states</b> represent economy-wide random aggregate fluctuations, while micro-states reflect individual shocks which fluctuate independently around <b>aggregate</b> <b>states</b> and have no further discernible structure. In the special case where shocks in the finite economies are exchangable, the limiting economy satisfies a continuum-version of de Finetti's Theorem. The paper then uses this framework to derive implications for the interpretations of the Strong Law of Large Numbers and the Pettis Integral. ...|$|R

50|$|The temperature-based phase {{behavior}} of ELPs can be utilized to produce stiff networks {{that may be}} compatible with cellular regeneration applications. At high concentrations (weight percent exceeding 15%), the ELP transition from a linear state to a spherical <b>aggregate</b> <b>state</b> above the transition temperature is arrested, leading {{to the formation of}} brittle gels. These otherwise brittle networks can then be modified chemically, via oxidative coupling, to yield hydrogels which can sustain high levels of mechanical stress and strain. Also, the modified gel networks contain pores, through which important cell-sustaining compounds can easily be delivered. Such strong hydrogels, when bathed in minimal cell media, have been found to promote the growth of human mesencyhmal stem cell populations. The ability of these arrested ELP networks to promote cell growth may prove indispensable in the production of tissue scaffolds that promote cartilage production, for example. Such an intervention may prove useful in the treatment of bone disease and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

In the presence of ruthenium (II) as the maker ion, the behavior of AmB to form ion channels in sterol-free and cholesterol- or ergosterol-containing supported phosphatidylcholine bilayer model membranes were studied by cyclic votammetry, AC impedance spectroscopy, and UV/visible absorbance spectroscopy. Different concentrations of AmB ranging from a molecularly dispersed to a highly <b>aggregated</b> <b>state</b> of the drug were investigated. In a fixed cholesterol or ergosterol content (5 mol %) in glassy carbon electrode-supported model membranes, our results showed that no matter what form of AmB, monomeric or aggregated, AmB could form ion channels in supported ergosterol-containing phosphatidylcholine bilayer model membranes. However, AmB could not form ion channels in its monomeric form in sterol-free and cholesterol-containing supported model membranes. On the one hand, when AmB is present as an <b>aggregated</b> <b>state,</b> it can form ion channels in cholesterol-containing supported model membranes; on the other hand, only when AmB is present as a relatively highly <b>aggregated</b> <b>state</b> can it form ion channels in sterol-free supported phosphatidylcholine bilayer model membranes.

This paper {{considers}} {{the effects of}} a changing dollar on <b>aggregate</b> <b>state</b> output, and for the agricultural, manufacturing and all other (<b>aggregate</b> <b>state</b> output less agricultural and manufacturing) sectors for the contiguous 48 US states during the period 1972 - 89.

Holding differences between foreign and US productivity constant, real exchange rate movements have had small effects on most states ' output growth (total and by sector). More important have been changes in foreign productivity growth relative to domestic productivity growth. 1...|$|E
