5|$|The LRDG {{air link}} was created during the {{occupation}} of Kufra by Major Guy Lenox Prendergast. <b>Appreciating</b> <b>the</b> value of aircraft for reconnaissance, liaison, evacuating wounded and flights to GHQ Cairo, he had two Waco aircraft fitted with long range fuel tanks. Prendergast flew one himself and Sergeant R. F. T. Barker flew the other. When Bagnold {{was appointed to the}} General Staff Cairo in August 1941, Prendergast was given command of the LRDG.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} {{was met with}} mostly positive critical reviews, with many <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> gathering of some of Yankovic's best works. However, the box set was not a high seller, and {{near the end of}} the 1990s, it ranked as Yankovic's least-purchased album. In 2006, due to a mishap by Volcano Records, the artwork for the set was lost, and the collection went out of print. Yankovic refused to scan existing copies of the album to make new ones, fearing that it would lead to an inferior product.|$|E
5|$|America's Asian {{conflicts}} against Japan, North Korea, and North Vietnam brought Sun Tzu to {{the attention}} of American military leaders. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel in the art of war. The Art of War is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of War is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. During the Gulf War in the 1990s, both Generals Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points. However, the United States and other Western countries have been criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not <b>appreciating</b> <b>The</b> Art of War within the wider context of Chinese society.|$|E

50|$|The U350 was {{released}} in July 2009 to mixed reviews from different publications. LAPTOP Magazine <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> laptop’s design and low starting price, but was disappointed by the low battery life. Computer Shopper discounted the laptop’s performance but <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> light weight and affordable price. Stark Insider <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> laptop’s price, performance, keyboard, display and speakers. The negative points noted were the fan noise and heat on the left palm rest.|$|R
50|$|Japanese {{video game}} {{magazine}} Famitsu gave the game {{a score of}} 27/40 in a cross review by four reviewers.

They also <b>appreciated</b> <b>the</b> design of the character Tsumuji, who they called cute.|$|R
5|$|The band's third album, Emotive, was {{released}} on November 2, 2004 - the actual U.S Presidential Election Day. However, the album received a much more polarizing reception than the prior two albums, with some critics and fans not <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> band's move into more political content, or the radical liberties they had taken with the album's cover versions. Other's accused the band of rushing out a third album {{in order to fulfill}} the band's three album contractual obligation to Virgin Records, a claim refuted as false by Howerdel. The album still managed to receive a generally positive reception from critics. Sales were similarly positive, but less so than prior albums. The position debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling 142,000 copies in its first week - matching Thirteenth Step's peak chart placement, but selling almost 90,000 copies less. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA, indicating 500,000 units sold.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu enjoyed the {{tactical}} gameplay and new elements, along with <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> thrill {{induced by the}} permanent death mechanic. A minor criticism was issues with the pacing. Harris enjoyed the gameplay despite noting that little had changed since the release of Fire Emblem, saying that players would not find any notable changes from their original experience. Chapman positively noted the improvements made since the release of Fire Emblem, along with positively noting the multiplayer options. Kasavin praised the deep strategy gameplay, and positively noted that it was geared towards players of various ages and skill levels. Foster called the gameplay the game's biggest feature and greatest strength despite not having changed much since the previous game. Knight enjoyed the gameplay experience, but was mixed to negative {{about the lack of}} true innovations, feeling that it was an overly similar experience to earlier Fire Emblem games. Bramwell enjoyed the gameplay despite getting frustrated at the permanent death mechanic, and positively noted the nuances in character customization. Parkin stated that it was quite easy to spend large amounts of time creating the perfect strategy, and that restarting a level after a character died or going to one of the EXP maps to boost character levels was extremely tempting. In the latter case, he noted it might upset the game's intended difficulty. Marrow enjoyed his time with the game, and praised the additional features that made playing easier for newcomers.|$|E
25|$|Nevett, {{again for}} Comic Book Resources, gave Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. {{a much more}} {{positive}} review, giving it 4 out of 5 stars, and particularly praising the artwork, while also <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> consistent voice throughout the three stories from writer Casey.|$|E

25|$|<b>Appreciating</b> <b>the</b> {{significance}} of the site, the archaeologists realised they had to act swiftly, as it was exposed and rapidly eroding. Historic Scotland put together {{a team led by}} Magnar Dalland to excavate the site, which took place over November and December 1991.|$|E
25|$|Minister Diego Santilli in his speech, while <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> Ambassador Naela Chohan for {{her role}} in the {{renovation}} of the Park, stated that the whole world was reflected in the City of Buenos Aires through its monuments, squares and parks and that Pakistan had a very special place in it.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1855 Nell {{achieved}} another success when the legislature finally abolished segregation in public schools. In recognition of Nell's efforts on this issue, a commemorative dinner {{was held to}} honor him. During 1855, Garrison's The Liberator employed Nell to journey around the Midwest and study African-American anti-slavery efforts. He attended a graduation at Oberlin College, <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> easy relations among the integrated students.|$|E

25|$|In September 1998, the {{government}} called a donors conference in Harare on LRRP II {{to inform the}} donor community and involve them in the program: Forty-eight countries and international organisations attended and unanimously endorsed the land program, saying it was essential for poverty reduction, political stability and economic growth. They agreed that the inception phase, covering the first 24 months, should start immediately, particularly <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> political imperative and urgency of the proposal.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{experiencing}} hemimicropsia often {{complain that}} objects in their {{left or right}} visual field appear to be shrunken or compressed. They may also have difficulty <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> symmetry of pictures. When drawing, patients often {{have a tendency to}} compensate for their perceptual asymmetry by drawing the left or right half of objects slightly larger than the other. In a case of one person with hemimicropsia asked to draw six symmetrical objects, the size of the picture on the left half was on average 16% larger than the corresponding right half.|$|E
25|$|The issues {{surrounding}} body image can be examined through, body negativity, and body positivity. Negative body image {{consists of a}} disoriented view of one’s shape; whereby they often feel self-conscious or feel ashamed, and assume others are more attractive. Aside from having low self-esteems, suffers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances. Long-term behavior could thus potentially lead to higher risks of eating disorders, isolation, and mental illnesses. Positive body image on the other hand, {{is described as a}} clear true perception of one’s figure. In addition to celebrating and <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> body, it also requires an understanding that an individual’s appearance does not reflect their character or self worth.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges to mankind always has been eradicating the presence of debilitating disease. Until just thirty years ago poliomyelitis occurred in the United States and throughout the world in epidemic proportions, striking tens of thousands and killing thousands in our own country each year. Dr. Jonas E. Salk changed all that. This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped {{from the face of the}} Earth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Appreciating</b> <b>the</b> {{important}} quality affecting display aircraft i.e., appearance, the T-37s {{were painted}} all red. However, {{maintenance of the}} red-painted aircraft without the costly polyurethane coating became a problem. The team reverted to the all-metal finish, with only the nose, wing tips and tail painted day-glow orange. In 1980, with the induction of six ex-USAF T-37s, which were polyurethane-coated all white, ‘Sherdils’ became a logical choice for a new titillating appearance. The dramatic ‘sunburst’ paint scheme was adopted, red rays on an all-white background. Later, the aircraft were again painted red, but with the rays in white, a scheme that is in vogue today. Coloured smoke {{has been used to}} enhance the aesthetic qualities of the formation; smoke trails give the impression of multicoloured ribbons twirling in the sky.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Teimuraz {{relations}} with the new Iranian shah, Safi, progressively deteriorated. In 1631, Teimuraz avenged the mountainous tribes of Dagestan for having joined Shah Abbas {{in the destruction of}} Kakheti, and devastated several of their settlements (auls). In 1633, he gave shelter to his brother-in-law Daud Khan, the Iranian governor (beglarbeg) of Ganja and Karabakh of Georgian extraction, who had fled Shah Safi’s crackdown on the family of his brother Imam-Quli Khan, the influential governor of Fars, Lar and Bahrain. Teimuraz refused to surrender the fugitive, and, fully <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> consequences of this refusal, gathered his forces in haste. Shah Safi retaliated by declaring Teimuraz deposed and replacing him with his favorite, a Muslim Georgian prince Khusraw Mirza (Rostom), who had {{played an important role in}} consolidating Safi’s hold of power after Shah Abbas’s death.|$|E

25|$|Inevitably, I {{made up my}} mind to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> technique of playwriting.|$|E
25|$|Gauri was {{received}} coldly by her father. Gauri, being an uninvited guest, {{was not given}} any respect. Furthermore, Dakshin began to insult Shiva. Gauri was unable to bear her father's insults toward her husband, had a heated argument about the virtues (and alleged lack thereof) of Shiva. Every passing moment made it clearer to Gauri that her father was entirely incapable of <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> many excellent qualities of her husband - the supreme divinity of the universe. The realization then came to Gauri that this abuse was being heaped on Shiva only because he had wed her; she {{was the cause of}} this dishonour to her husband. She was consumed by rage against her father and loathing for his mentality. Calling up a prayer that she may, in a future birth, be born the daughter of a father whom she could respect, Gauri invoked her yogic powers and immolated herself.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the naturalization procedures, Lazăr Șăineanu eventually renounced Judaism and accepted baptism in the Romanian Orthodox Church. His godfather was Take Ionescu, {{at the time a}} rising figure within the Conservative Party ranks. Ionescu himself served as Minister of Education, <b>appreciating</b> <b>the</b> scholar's insight and enjoying his company before taking his distance from him for reasons unknown. Șăineanu's case was again presented for Senate approval in December 1899, this time with a favorable review from the special parliamentary commission, and the motion for his naturalization was carried with 37 to 2 votes (or, according to Șăineanu, a 39-vote unanimity). Although the result was positive, the scientist was informed that a new procedure had just been passed with support from across the floor, specifying that naturalization could only be enforced by vote in a common session of the two chambers. The dossier was therefore submitted to another vote, on the last session of 1899, which again enlisted attacks from the antisemitic groups, before being canceled due to lack of quorum.|$|E
