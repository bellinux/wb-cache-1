Additionally, fancy rats are quite independent, loyal <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> trained, earning them comparison to both cats and dogs. This comparison is merited given fancy rats are considered more intelligent than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to normal-length spines, {{members of the}} subfamily Opuntioideae have relatively short spines, called glochids, that are barbed along their length <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> shed. These enter the skin and are difficult to remove, causing long-lasting irritation.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed the goal line (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E

Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{optimise}} {{the safety of}} underground rock engineering construction and the long-term security of the resultant facilities, {{it is necessary to}} have a knowledge of the likely hazards. These risks or hazards fall into the four categories of “known beforehand <b>and</b> relatively <b>easily</b> addressed”, “known beforehand <b>and</b> not <b>easily</b> addressed”, “not known beforehand <b>and</b> relatively <b>easily</b> addressed”, <b>and</b> “not known beforehand <b>and</b> not <b>easily</b> addressed”. This paper describes how these four types of hazard can be incorporated into a design methodology approach, including the process by which the relevant mechanical rock mass parameters can be recognised for modelling and hence predictive purposes. In particular, there is emphasis on the fact that information and judgement are the keys to safety—whether the hazards are known or unknown before construction proceeds...|$|R

C.lutescens has a thinner gelatinous layer and a predominately yellow middle layer, or mesoperidium, with the red color confined to the peristome. It also possesses a well-defined collar {{at the base of}} the spore case, a longer stipe, and globose, pitted spores. C.ravenelii is not gelatinous, but instead has warts adorning the spore case, and is smaller than C.cinnabarinum. It also has a reddish peristome but is otherwise clay-colored. Unlike C.lutescens, the spores of C.ravenelii cannot be distinguished from those of C.cinnabarinum except through the use of atomic force microscopy.|$|E

The Manta chases the Disco Volante to capture it and recover the bombs en route to the first target. An undersea battle ensues between the crews, while Bond fights Largo. Bond, now very weak from his efforts to disable the bombs, tries to get away, but Largo corners him in an underwater cave <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> overpowers him. Before Largo can finish Bond off Domino shoots him with a spear gun. The bombs are recovered and Bond is sent to hospital with Domino.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> transported to hunting sites.|$|E

5|$|Caragiale used Mitică as a stock {{character}} to feature in satirical contexts; the biographical insights he provided are short and often contradict each other. Among Mitică's traits are his tendency to generate sarcastic comebacks and sententious catchphrases, a Francized speech, {{as well as}} inclinations to waste time <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> find {{his way out of}} problematic situations. His existence is connected to events in the history of Bucharest which he occasionally references in his jokes. Like Lache and Mache, who are present in Caragiale's fiction, the character is usually portrayed as a civil servant who has a hard time making ends meet, but who is well liked by his peers.|$|E

In the most recent book, Rystads biography from 2003, the king is again characterized as a strong-willed shaper of Sweden through economic reforms and achievement of financial and military stability and strength.|$|E

5|$|Given these shortcomings, those modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated anti-tank weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons, one such being the Smith Gun.

Smith, the managing director of Trianco Ltd., a firm of structural engineers. The Smith Gun was intended to be a cheap <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> manufactured anti-tank weapon.|$|E
