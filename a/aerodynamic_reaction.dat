40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{investigation of the}} effects of changes in the elevator and rudder settings and of small changes in attitude upon the aerodynamic forces and moments exerted upon a spinning airplane was undertaken with the spinning balance in the 5 -foot vertical tunnel of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.

40|$|Concepts {{from the}} theory of functionals are used to develop {{nonlinear}} formulations of the aerodynamic force and moment systems acting on bodies in large-amplitude, arbitrary motions. The analysis, which proceeds formally once the functional dependence of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>reactions</b> upon the motion variables is established, ensures the inclusion, within the resulting formulation, of pertinent aerodynamic terms that normally are excluded in the classical treatment. Applied to the large-amplitude, slowly varying, nonplanar motion of a body, the formulation suggests that the aerodynamic moment can be compounded of the moments acting on the body in four basic motions: steady angle of attack, pitch oscillations, either roll or yaw oscillations, and coning motion.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{fault-tolerant}} strategy for hypersonic reentry vehicles with mixed <b>aerodynamic</b> surfaces and <b>reaction</b> control systems (RCS) under external disturbances {{and subject to}} actuator faults. Aerodynamic surfaces are treated as the primary actuator in normal situations, and they are driven by a continuous quadratic programming (QP) allocator to generate torque commanded by a nonlinear adaptive feedback control law. When aerodynamic surfaces encounter faults, {{they may not be}} able to provide sufficient torque as commanded, and RCS jets are activated to augment the aerodynamic surfaces to compensate for insufficient torque. Partial loss of effectiveness and stuck faults are considered in this paper, and observers are designed to detect and identify the faults. Based on the fault identification results, an RCS control allocator using integer linear programming (ILP) techniques is designed to determine the optimal combination of activated RCS jets. By treating the RCS control allocator as a quantization element, closed-loop stability with both continuous and quantized inputs is analyzed.

40|$|Integrated {{guidance}} and control based on block backstepping sliding mode and dynamic control allocation Chao Guo 1 and Xiao-Geng Liang 1, 2 A novel integrated {{guidance and}} control (IGC) design method {{based on the}} block backstepping sliding mode and extended state observer is proposed for the near space interceptor (NSI) with <b>aerodynamic</b> fins and <b>reaction</b> jets. Initially, the IGC model is employed by combining the interceptor-target relative motion model with the nonlinear dynamic of the NSI. Subsequently, the ESO is constructed to estimate the target acceleration and autopilot loop disturbance. Based on the estimated value and block backstepping sliding mode method, the IGC algorithm is given to obtain the virtual control moment. The stability of the closed-loop IGC system is also proven based on the Lyapunov theory. Moreover, a new dynamic control allocation algorithm is proposed to distribute the previously virtual control moment among the redundant actuators, while the actuator saturation and rate constraints are also taken into account.

40|$|Atomic Oxygen is the {{dominant}} atmospheric specie at low earth orbit altitudes for spacecraft orbiting the earth. This altitude range of atomic oxygen dominance extends from 120 km to 900 km. Other species such as helium, molecular oxygen and nitrogen make {{up the bulk of}} the rest with the densities corresponding to high to ultrahigh vacuum levels. Spacecraft orbiting at this altitude need to travel at a velocity of 8 km/sec to maintain orbit and therefore spacecraft encounter a high fluence of impinging rarefied atmosphere in a short time period. This gas-surface interaction has several effects which affect the space vehicle. They include <b>aerodynamic</b> drag, surface <b>reaction</b> and surface glow. The need to model these effects on spacecraft surfaces has resulted in the design, development and construction of an advanced facility to simulate these L. E. O. atmospheric effects. This facility utilizing an arc heated source can produce high energy species of the common atmospheric species at a velocity of up to 4. 5 km/sec with fluxes comparable to orbit. This particular type of source is unique in Europe with two similar types reported in the U. S. A. Considerable effort was expended in optimizing the source for atomic oxygen production via beam characterization and stagnation condition measurement. This has enabled the radial and axial temperature profiles in the source to be deduced, thus providing a clearer idea of the processes in the source and therefore benefits future users of this technique. In addition, alternative routes of producing atomic oxygen were pursued via nitrous oxide and nitrous oxide/nitrogen seeding. Extensive work on developing reliable beam characterization equipment resulted in the comparison of two methods of beam analysis. This involved {{the development of a new}} method of beam mass/energy analysis, which has several advantages over current instruments. Conclusions are made on the suitability of mass spectroscopic detection of reactive specie beams. Finally, atomic oxygen degradation tests were pursued on a variety of surfaces including the polyimide Kapton-H. It was concluded from these tests that Kapton-H erosion has a form of energy dependence, with an energy threshold to erosion of approximately 0. 5 eV. The erosion rate above this energy rises rapidly to rates comparable to those of orbit. The Southampton results agree reasonably with the very few results on Kapton-H in this energy range. This has important implications on spacecraft material design...|$|R
