5000|$|Donald G. Butcher Library is a {{multi-purpose}} building {{that provides a}} wide set of traditional and electronic library services and {{is home to a}} gallery space that features the work of students and local artists. Also included in the building are offices for the School of General Studies, the Academic Enrichment Center which provides tutoring services, and an <b>ancillary</b> <b>office</b> for Morrisville native Dr. Raymond Stantz.|$|E
50|$|Greengate North Plaza is an <b>ancillary</b> <b>office</b> {{and retail}} {{building}} at Greengate Centre. It {{sits on the}} bottom of the hill behind the Wal-Mart Supercenter and was once part of the Greengate Mall complex. It was built in 1977 and was anchored by a General Cinema triple-screen movie theater, later to become part of Carmike Cinemas. It closed in 1999 when the larger Carmike 15 multiplex opened at Westmoreland Mall, five miles (8 km) east. Today, tenants include a branch of First Commonwealth Bank, La Bliss bridal boutique, and a travel agency. Heartland Hospice and a number of chiropractic, physical therapy, and medical offices also reside in the building.|$|E
50|$|The building, {{designed}} by Claude Plummer-Jones, contains an exceptionally fine main banking space. Built by day labour, {{the structure is}} of concrete, faced externally with Malmesbury stone for the rusticated base with sandstone for the levels above. The building is classical in style. The 2 storeys above the ground floor have attached corinthian columns which extend through both storeys and are surmounted by an entablature and a balustraded parapet. Inside, the ground floor contains the (former) banking hall and some <b>ancillary</b> <b>office</b> space. Octagonal in shape, the paired corinthian column theme of the exterior is repeated internally to form, with arches between each pair, an open arcade. Above, a 6-metre diameter glazed dome further enhances {{the quality of the}} space. The banking hall as a whole offers one of Wellington's finer interior architectural experiences.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ancillary</b> <b>offices</b> {{and lower}} level lounges {{were placed in}} {{the south end of the}} {{structure}} while the library was placed in the north end. The utilitarian functions of the building are located along a central wall that protrudes at both ends of the building, housing elevators, stairs, and toilets. Architectural Record stated that this concept illustrates where a person should go in the building and easily allow the building to be lengthened when its second stage would be built.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{is on the}} National Register of Historic Places, for both its exterior and public interior spaces. The Custom House {{was one of the}} earliest designations of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. In 1987, the completion of its preservation, spurred by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan who saved the building from demolition in 1979, attracted much public attention. Exterior and ceremonial interior spaces were cleaned, restored, and conserved, while old office space was renovated for Federal courtrooms and <b>ancillary</b> <b>offices,</b> rental offices and meeting rooms, and for a 350-seat auditorium with state-of-the-art projection facilities. Upgrades of fire safety, security, telecommunications, and heating, air conditioning, and ventilating systems accompanied alterations. In 1990, Moynihan sponsored the law that renamed the building after Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury.|$|R
50|$|In January 2006, {{the school}} {{was turned over to}} the {{leadership}} of Mr. Nestor R. Ramos who lifted the school into a new stage of development. Equipment and materials were gradually raised through partnership with the non-governmental organization like the Philippine Business for Social Progress (PBSP), Mead Johnson, GIL@S to name a few. The school during that time, had no Maintenance, Operation and other Expenses (MOOE) but through the effort of Mr. Ramos {{and with the help of}} the General Parents-Teachers Association {{the school was}} able to purchase its own equipment and was able to construct <b>ancillary</b> <b>offices</b> to reinforce the learning of the students. The first graduating class was in March, 2006 held in as simple ceremony at the school ground.|$|R
5000|$|Uses of {{land and}} {{buildings}} are classified into [...] "use classes" [...] and any change from one use class to another use class is automatically a [...] "material change of use" [...] amounting to development. Some small scale changes between use classes are nevertheless [...] "permitted development" [...] and hence do not require planning permission. Certain types of use or activity do not fall into a specific use class and are termed [...] "sui generis". Any change of use of [...] "sui generis" [...] land requires planning permission. In practice most uses are a composite of several uses so that, say, a factory might well have an <b>ancillary</b> <b>office</b> and perhaps storage uses, all within the same premises. In such a case however the primary use would be that of a factory (use class B1 or B2).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the years}} prior to this merger, CSX donated the C&O desk to the White House and it {{was placed in the}} Oval Office Study. Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Ronald Reagan all used the desk there. On May 2, 1985 the desk was moved, and then Vice President George H. W. Bush started using the desk as his main work space in the White House. When Marlin Fitzwater, White House Press Secretary under both presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, was asked about Bush's use of the C&O desk, he stated that [...] "...he got used to it, found it comfortable, and thought it was attractive." [...] After his p{{residential}} inauguration on January 20, 1989 the C&O desk was used in the residential portion of the White House, and on June 13, 1989 it was moved into the newly decorated Oval Office. The Resolute desk, the Oval Office desk removed for the C&O, was placed briefly in the White House storage room, but found a final resting place for the Bush White House in the Treaty Room which Bush used as an <b>ancillary</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E
5000|$|PALCO {{announced}} in 2006 {{a desire to}} sell the homes (to the employees and retirees who currently live there) and commercial property. The company suggested that Scotia become part of Rio Dell, a small neighboring town located directly across the Eel River. Additionally, the need for employees had fallen from over 1,000 to around 300, {{in part due to}} a lack of logs and also from automation. On January 18, 2007, PALCO filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code. On July 8, 2008, the court issued its judgment and order confirming the Plan of Reorganization submitted by secured creditor Marathon Structured Finance Fund (Marathon), joined by Mendocino Redwood Company (MRC). Pursuant to that plan, most of the Town of Scotia’s real and personal assets transferred to a reorganized entity wholly owned by Marathon, Town of Scotia Company, LLC (TOS). Under the plan, the active Scotia sawmill facilities and other <b>ancillary</b> <b>office</b> buildings will transfer to a second reorganized entity, Humboldt Redwood Company (HRC) in which Marathon and MRC both have interests (United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Corpus Christi Division as [...] "Case No. 07-20027-C-11" [...] under the consolidated title, In Re Scotia Development LLC, et al., Debtors.) The Town of Scotia LLC has pursued a General Plan Amendment/ Zone Reclassification and Final Map Subdivision application. Subdivision requires fulfillment of conditions of approval which include formation of a community services district or other public entity to manage utilities. Service district formation requires approval by the Humboldt County Local Agency Formation Commission, which has a pending application. The purpose of the subdivision is to create individual parcels for existing residential and commercial properties, and public facilities. The proposed subdivision would allow for the sale of residential and commercial lots (all of which are currently owned and operated by the Town of Scotia LLC) to individual property owners.|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} forms of {{deviance}} rampant in early modern Ottoman society and their legal treatment, according to the fatwas issued by the Ottoman şeyhülislams in the 17 th and 18 th centuries. One of the aims of this thesis is to present different behavioural forms found in the şeyhülislam fatwas that ranged from simple social malevolencies to acts which were regarded as heresy. In {{the end of our}} analysis, the significance of the fatwa literature for Ottoman social history will once more be emphasized. On the other hand, it will be argued that as a legal forum, the fetvahane was not merely a consultative and <b>ancillary</b> <b>office,</b> but a centre that fabricated the legal and moral devices/discourses employed to direct and stem the social tendencies in the Ottoman society. The primary sources that form the basis of this study are Fetava-yı Feyziye me'an-nukul, Fetava-yı Ali Efendi, Behçetü'-l fetava, Fetava-yı Abdurrahim, and Neticetü'l-fetava me'an-nukul, which are the compilations of the şeyhülislam fatwas...|$|E
50|$|The building, {{formerly}} known as Villa Zagorje or Tito's Villa, was designed by architects Vjenceslav Richter and Kazimir Ostrogović and completed in 1964 for the former Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito. It {{has been used as}} an official workplace (and formerly an official residence) since President Franjo Tuđman moved there following the October 1991 bombing of Banski dvori, the official presidential residence up to that point. In addition to the original building, there is also a 3500 m2 annex built in 1993, an <b>ancillary</b> structure housing <b>office</b> security services and bomb shelter predating the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|IOAS or in <b>office</b> <b>ancillary</b> {{services}} {{include a}} wide range of services. The provision allows physicians to offer services such as X-Ray, ultrasound and MRI. The practice is legal and ethical. Physicians have offered services in their offices such as X-Ray for decades. Studies show an increased use in ancillary services when the procedures are provided in their office. What the studies fall to show is the motivating factor. Assuming its financial would violate the AMA's code of ethics. Other factors to consider are a faster diagnosis, less complex authorization and scheduling process and the consolidation of medical records. All of which benefit the patients treatment.|$|R

40|$|This is a {{contribution}} to the research on the interface between urban economics and urban planning at the micro level {{on the one hand and}} economic development at the macro level on the other hand by a study of the relationship between the performance of the development application mechanism and economic development. This study is conducted in the light that neither urban economics nor urban planning research has utilized useful development control information that can help better understand the spatial and linkage aspects of the industrial sector in economic development. A probit study of a relatively large population of statistics (with 1728 observations) concerning planning applications for uses in lands under industrial zoning in Hong Kong is conducted in terms of 5 refutable hypotheses about the role of the planning authority in respect of land uses that are neutral to, complementary to and substitutes of industrial uses in a local context where major structural changes are occurring in the economy. The hypotheses are derived from standard price theory. The test discovers that, consistent with the theory of substitute goods, that the probabilities of mixed industrial/office and pure office uses in industrial zones being approved were dependent on the rise and fall of the manufacturing sector (measured in terms of labor share). However, those for <b>ancillary</b> <b>office</b> use, a use that theoretically should be complementary to industrial activities, were independent of the state of the manufacturing sector.
