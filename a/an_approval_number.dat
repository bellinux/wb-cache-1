This means that much time and effort in preparation of the form is being used to collect and display information about the filer (a corporate registrant or new registrant who intends to offer securities). The S-1 form requires that the registrant provide information from diverse sources and incorporate this information using many rules or regulations, such as General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act, Regulation C, Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a firearm}} is sold or transferred, the buyer is {{required}} to present their FOID card. This applies to private sales between individuals {{as well as to}} sales by Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders. [...] For firearm sales by an FFL holder, or at a gun show, the seller must perform an automated dial-up check with the State Police, to verify that the FOID card is valid, and to redo the background check of the buyer. [...] This additional checking is known as the Firearm Transfer Inquiry Program (FTIP). [...] For private sales not at a gun show, the seller must also verify the buyer's FOID card with the state police, and receive <b>a</b> transfer <b>approval</b> <b>number,</b> either via <b>a</b> web site or with a phone call.|$|R

5000|$|Illinois law {{requires}} that, when a firearm is sold by a Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder, or at a gun show, the seller perform a dial-up inquiry to the State Police {{to verify that}} the buyer's FOID card is valid. This additional check {{is known as the}} Firearm Transfer Inquiry Program (FTIP). [...] At the time of the inquiry, the police perform an automated search of several criminal and mental health databases, including the federal NICS database. (Generally, FFLs in all states must request a background check through the NICS before selling a firearm; however in some states non-FFL purchasers who possess certain state-issued firearms permits, e.g., a permit to carry a concealed handgun, may purchase firearms from FFLs without undergoing a point-of-sale NICS check.)

Beside him a very old man dozed and nodded <b>approval.</b> <b>A</b> <b>number</b> of other men crowded the apartment, including several who had helped to hold off the rioters from the court.

40|$|Mao, the Unknown Story by Jung Chang and Jon Halliday is {{the latest}} and most {{dangerous}} of the spate of Mao biographies that have appeared over the last 10 years. This massive book, which appeared in 2005 in English and {{is yet to be}} published in Chinese, has caused much controversy amongst China scholars. Responses have ranged from outright dismissal to cautious or conditional <b>approval.</b> <b>A</b> <b>number</b> of journals have already published assessments of the claims made by Halliday and Chang and more are on the way. Yet these criticisms seem to me to be missing the mark. Scholarly debate seems to be having little effect on public opinion. The western media have been overwhelmingly supportive of Mao the Unknown Story. And the book is heading to best-seller status. This paper examines the genre of the book and uses sources from the field of critical biography to conclude that Mao: the Unknown Story is a misleading and dangerous text...|$|R
