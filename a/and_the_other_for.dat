5|$|Fantasia, an {{experimental}} film produced to an accompanying orchestral arrangement conducted by Leopold Stokowski, {{was released in}} November 1940 by Disney itself {{in a series of}} limited-seating roadshow engagements. The film cost $2 million to produce, and although the film earned $1.4 million in its roadshow engagements, the high cost ($85,000 per theater) of installing Fantasound placed Fantasia at an even greater loss than Pinocchio. RKO assumed distribution of Fantasia in 1941, later reissuing it in severely edited versions over the years.

5|$|Mahitsielafanjaka (Mahitsy) {{became the}} {{residence}} of Andrianampoinimerina after he moved his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo. Described in 1888 as the seat of ancestral spiritual authority at the Rova, the traditional sacrifice of a rooster during the ceremony of the Fandroana took place here, and ombiasy (astrologers) asked to perform sikidy (divination) for a sovereign would do so within this space. The building also formerly housed a major royal idol called Manjakatsiroa (or the entire collection of royal idols, according to another account) until the supposed public burning of all such relics by Queen RanavalonaII in 1869 following her conversion to Christianity. Built in 1796, the traditional wooden Mahitsy follows traditional architectural norms: the roof {{is supported by the}} central pillar, and two superimposed beds—the highest for the king <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>for</b> his wives—are located in the northeast corner, the portion of the home reserved for royalty and the ancestors. These beds are raised high off the ground to protect the sleepers from a nocturnal attack. Items formerly on display in this building {{after the end of the}} Merina monarchy in 1897 until the destruction of the original structure in the 1995 fire included Andrianampoinimerina's filanzana (palanquin), several wooden trunks and a pot of jaka (zebu confit) said to date from the king's reign.|$|E

5|$|On December 9, 2003, the Stellamare, a Dutch-owned ship, capsized at the port, killing three Russian crewmembers. The {{ship was}} hauling General Electric {{generators}} when it overturned.

In the early spring of 2008 a port employee was arrested for stealing copper. This in turn led to investigations of employee theft which resulted in the arrest of an operations manager and a maintenance foreman for larceny.
