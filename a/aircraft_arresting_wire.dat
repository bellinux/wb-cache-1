5000|$|The RQ-7 Shadow 200 {{unmanned}} aerial {{vehicle is}} of a high-wing, constant chord pusher configuration with a twin-tailboom empennage and an inverted v-tail. The aircraft {{is powered by a}} [...] AR741-1101 Wankel engine designed and manufactured by UAV Engines Ltd in the United Kingdom. Onboard electrical systems are powered by a GEC/Plessey 28 volt, direct current, 2,000 W generator. Currently, the primary load of the aircraft is the Israeli Aircraft Industries POP300 Plug-in Optical Payload which consists of a forward-looking infrared camera, a daytime TV camera with a selectable near-infrared filter and a laser pointer. The aircraft has fixed tricycle landing gear. Takeoffs are assisted by a trailer-mounted pneumatic launcher which can accelerate the 170 kg (375 pound) aircraft to 70 kn in 40 ft. Landings are guided by a Tactical Automatic Landing System, developed by the Sierra Nevada Corporation, which consists of a ground-based micro-millimeter wavelength radar and a transponder carried on the aircraft. Once on the ground, a tailhook mounted on the <b>aircraft</b> catches an <b>arresting</b> <b>wire</b> connected to two disk brake drums which can stop the aircraft in less than 170 ft.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purchase}} {{cable is}} a wire rope that looks {{very similar to}} the arresting cable. They are much longer, however, and are not designed to be easily removed. There are two purchase cables per arresting cable, and they connect to each end of the <b>arresting</b> <b>wire.</b> Purchase cables connect the <b>arresting</b> <b>wire</b> to the <b>arresting</b> gear engines and [...] "pay out" [...] as the <b>arresting</b> <b>wire</b> is engaged by the aircraft. As an incoming aircraft engages the deck pendant, the purchase cable transmits the force of the landing aircraft from the deck gear to the arresting engine. The pendant (<b>arresting</b> <b>wire)</b> is [...] "swaged" [...] (attached) to the purchase cable by means of a loop created with zinc heated to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This onboard fabrication is considered dangerous, and it is reported the Navy is testing the use of an automated press to accomplish it more safely. On land based systems, heavy nylon tapes are used in place of purchase cables, but they serve the same function.|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s, as jet {{aircraft}} began to operate from carriers, landing speeds and tailhook loads increased. The US Navy developed a test rig. It {{consisted of a}} car, guided by a concrete I-beam and propelled by two jet engines. At {{the end of a}} one-mile run the tailhook under test would engage an <b>arresting</b> <b>wire.</b> The I-beam guide slowly widened to slow down the test car after it passed the <b>arresting</b> <b>wire,</b> in the event of failure. Different aircraft weights and speeds are tested by loading steel plates on the unit. Further testing in 1958 used 4 Allison J33 jet engines.|$|R
50|$|An {{aircraft}} {{landing on}} {{an aircraft carrier}} increases the throttle to full power at touchdown. If the <b>arresting</b> <b>wires</b> fail to capture the plane, {{it is able to}} take off again; {{this is an example of}} fail-safe practice.|$|R

40|$|Summary. [...] The {{kinematics}} of an arresting-hook unit are {{studied in}} order to determine, {{within the limits of}} the assumption of a perfectly rigid hook unit, the damper force necessary to control hook bounce. The necessity for a smooth deck and the desirability of small trail angle for the hook unit are demonstrated from several aspects. The design requirements for a hook damper unit are discussed in all their functional aspects and methods are given for determining the up-swing motion of an arresting hook unit immediately following engagement of an <b>arresting</b> <b>wire.</b> The behaviour of <b>arresting</b> <b>wires</b> after being depressed by the passage of aircraft wheels is also outlined. 1.

50|$|The Tailhook Association is a U.S.-based, {{non-profit}} fraternal organization, {{supporting the}} interests of sea-based aviation, with emphasis on aircraft carriers. The word tailhook refers to the hook underneath {{the tail of the}} aircraft that catches the <b>arresting</b> <b>wire</b> suspended across the flight deck in order to stop the landing plane quickly.|$|R
50|$|Some airports, {{typically}} military airbases, {{have long}} runways used as emergency landing sites. Many airbases have arresting equipment for fast <b>aircraft,</b> known as <b>arresting</b> gear - a strong cable suspended {{just above the}} runway and attached to a hydraulic reduction gear mechanism. Together with the landing <b>aircraft's</b> <b>arresting</b> hook, it is used in situations where the aircraft's brakes would be insufficient by themselves.|$|R
5000|$|If an {{aircraft}} is {{pulled off the}} approach (if the landing area is not clear, for example) or is waved off by the LSO (for poor parameters or a fouled deck), or misses all the <b>arresting</b> <b>wires</b> ("bolters"), the pilot climbs straight ahead to 1200 ft to the [...] and waits for instructions from approach control.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} carriers {{are of a}} STOBAR configuration: Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery. Short take-off is achieved by using a 12-degree ski-jump on the bow. There is also an angled deck with <b>arresting</b> <b>wires,</b> which allows <b>aircraft</b> to land without interfering with launching aircraft. The flight deck has a total area of 14,700 m2. Two aircraft elevators, on the starboard side forward and aft of the island, move aircraft between the hangar deck and the flight deck.|$|R

500|$|Pilots {{found the}} Mauler a heavy {{handling}} aircraft that {{was difficult to}} fly in formation, and hard to land aboard a carrier because a less-than-perfect landing often caused the aircraft to bounce over the <b>arresting</b> <b>wires</b> and into the safety barrier.

Maintenance problems and the difficulty of landing aboard a carrier caused some pilots to give it the nickname of [...] "Awful Monster".|$|R
50|$|The aircraft's design {{supports}} effective operations from forward bases. The OV-10 {{can perform}} short takeoffs and landings, including on aircraft carriers and large deck amphibious assault ships without using catapults or <b>arresting</b> <b>wires.</b> Further, the OV-10 {{was designed to}} take off and land on unimproved sites. Repairs {{can be made with}} ordinary tools. No ground equipment is required to start the engines. And, if necessary, the engines will operate on high-octane automobile fuel with only a slight loss of power.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{signal was}} [...] "the cut" [...] (a {{slashing}} motion at the throat) ordering the pilot to reduce power and land the aircraft. In a properly executed landing, the aircraft's tailhook snagged an <b>arresting</b> <b>wire</b> {{that brought the}} plane to a halt.A [...] "waveoff" [...] was a mandatory order to abort the landing and go around for another attempt. Sometimes a proper approach drew a waveoff if the deck was [...] "fouled" [...] with aircraft or personnel in the landing area.|$|R

50|$|STOBAR is {{a system}} used for the launch and {{recovery}} of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft carrier, combining elements of both STOVL and CATOBAR. Aircraft launch under their own power using a ski-jump to assist take-off (rather than using a catapult). These are conventional aircraft however and require <b>arresting</b> <b>wires</b> {{to land on the}} ship. The Russian Navy aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov operated the Su-33, in this manner. Others include the Indian Vikramaditya and the future Vikrant class aircraft carrier; both will operate MiG-29Ks.|$|R

50|$|CATOBAR is {{a system}} used for the launch and {{recovery}} of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft carrier. Under this technique, aircraft are launched using a catapult-assisted take-off and landing on the ship using <b>arresting</b> <b>wires.</b> Although this system is more costly than alternative methods, it provides greater flexibility in carrier operations, since it allows the aircraft to operate with higher payloads. Ships with CATOBAR currently include: the U.S. Nimitz class, with the F-18 series, France's Charles De Gaulle with Rafales, and Brazil's NAe São Paulo with A-4 Skyhawks.|$|R

50|$|The {{first use}} of a barrier on a {{military}} airfield was during the Korean War when jet fighters had to operate from shorter airfield {{where there was no}} margin for error. The system used was just a transplant of the Davis Barrier used on straight deck carriers to keep any aircraft that missed the <b>arrest</b> <b>wires</b> from crashing into the aircraft parked forward of the landing area. But instead of the more complex hydraulic system used on carriers to stop the aircraft when it hits the barrier the land based system used heavy ship anchor chains to bring the aircraft to a halt.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1950s on {{conventional}} carriers {{it has been}} the practice to recover aircraft at an angle to port of the axial line of the ship. The primary function of this angled deck is to allow aircraft that miss the <b>arresting</b> <b>wires,</b> referred to as a bolter, to become airborne again without the risk of hitting aircraft parked forward. The angled deck allows the installation of one or two [...] "waist" [...] catapults in addition to the two bow cats. An angled deck also improves launch and recovery cycle flexibility with the option of simultaneous launching and recovery of aircraft.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{aircraft}} carrier heritage, all amphibious assault ships resemble aircraft carriers in design. The flight deck {{is used to}} operate attack and utility helicopters for landing troops and supplies and on some ship types also launch and recover Harrier Jump Jets to provide air support to landing operations. STOL aircraft such as the OV-10 were sometimes deployed on {{and were able to}} perform short take-offs and landings on large deck amphibious assault ships without needing catapults or <b>arresting</b> <b>wires,</b> although for safety and clearance reasons, the latter was most often not permitted. Landing craft are also carried, either on deck-mounted davits, or in an internal well deck.|$|R
5000|$|The pilot {{aims for}} the middle <b>arresting</b> <b>wire,</b> which is either {{the second or third}} {{depending}} on the configuration of the carrier. Immediately upon touchdown, the pilot advances the throttles to full power so that a touch and go (known as a [...] "Bolter") can be executed in the event that all trap wires have been missed. Ideally, the tailhook catches the target wire (or cross deck pendant), which abruptly slows the aircraft from approach speed to a full stop in about two seconds. As the aircraft's forward motion stops, the throttles are reduced to idle, and the hook is raised on the aircraft director's signal.|$|R
