5|$|Agent Lang visits Mahone {{and offers}} him a deal: {{eight years in}} <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> Louis prison in {{exchange}} for testifying against {{the government in the}} Lincoln Burrows conspiracy, or multiple homicide charges if he does not cooperate. Mahone eventually accepts the offer and confesses to Lang that he killed Shales, and that guilt made him turn to drugs. Because he is unable to maintain his composure while testifying, Mahone's testimony is dismissed, and Lang is forced to return Mahone to Sona.|$|E

Manchester's Irish Festival, including <b>a</b> <b>St</b> Patrick's Day parade, {{is one of}} Europe's largest. There is also a well-established Chinatown in the city with {{a substantial number of}} oriental restaurants and Chinese supermarkets. The area also attracts large numbers of Chinese students to the city who, in attending the local universities, contribute to Manchester having the third-largest Chinese population in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Oldham Athletic fans had <b>a</b> <b>St</b> George's Cross flag {{made in his}} honour, {{which was}} due to be {{displayed}} at Oldham's matches, {{as well as being}} taken abroad for England international fixtures. The tribute flag was stolen in February 2009, when Spanish hooligans attacked English fans in Seville before an international friendly on 20 February, stealing England flags from fans as trophies. The flag was replaced after a number of donations helped to cover the costs.|$|E

5|$|On July 8, 1949, Barkley met Jane (Rucker) Hadley, <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> Louis widow {{approximately}} half his age, {{at a party}} thrown by Clark Clifford. After Hadley's return to St. Louis, Barkley kept contact with her via letters and plane trips. Their courtship received national attention, and on November 18, 1949, they married in the Singleton Memorial Chapel of St. John's Methodist Church in St. Louis. Barkley is the only U.S. vice president to marry while in office.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, the {{prosecution}} began its case in chief. Post Office Department employees identified {{the letters of}} complaint received against Rialto. Ernest H. Kastor, of <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> Louis advertising firm, testified that he introduced Burton to Dennis and Harlan in November 1902. Witnesses said that the agreement was as Krum described and that the pay was agreed as $2,500 in $500 installments. Dyer read into evidence the letter from Burton to Rialto.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, a copy of <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north {{of the building and}} a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Canada, Peart was recruited to play drums for <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> Catharines band known as Hush, who {{played on the}} South Ontario bar circuit. Soon after, a mutual acquaintance convinced Peart to audition for the Toronto-based band Rush, which needed a replacement for its original drummer John Rutsey. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson oversaw the audition. His future bandmates describe his arrival that day as somewhat humorous, as he arrived in shorts, driving a battered old Ford Pinto with his drums stored in trashcans. Peart felt the entire audition was a complete disaster. While Lee and Peart hit it off {{on a personal level}} (both sharing similar tastes in books and music), Lifeson had a less favourable impression of Peart. After some discussion, Lee and Lifeson accepted Peart's maniacal British style of drumming, reminiscent of The Who's Keith Moon.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E

5|$|As the {{personal}} banner of the Sovereign, {{use of the}} Royal Banner of Scotland is restricted under the Act of the Parliament of Scotland 1672 cap. 47 and 30 & 31 Vict. cap. 17, and any unauthorised use of such is an offence under the Act. In 1978 <b>a</b> <b>St</b> Albans linen merchant, Denis Pamphilon, was fined £100 daily for usurpation of the banner on decorative bedspreads until he desisted, and both Rangers F.C. and the Scottish National Party have been admonished by the Court of the Lord Lyon for their improper and non-authorised use of the banner. Despite such action, the flag continues to feature {{on a variety of}} merchandise and souvenirs produced commercially for Scotland's economically important tourism industry.|$|E
5|$|Berhtwald died on 13 January 731. An epitaph to him {{in verse}} survives, {{and may have been}} placed over his tomb, which was at Canterbury. Subsequently he was canonised with a feast day of 9 January. Little {{evidence}} of extensive cult activity exists, however, and the main evidence for his sainthood is a late medieval entry in <b>a</b> <b>St</b> Augustine's calendar. Berhtwald is the first of the continuous series of native-born archbishops in England, although there had been two previous Anglo-Saxon archbishops at Canterbury—Deusdedit and Wighard.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham {{is home to}} many national, {{religious}} and spiritual festivals including <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> George's Day party. The Birmingham Tattoo is a long-standing military show held annually at the National Indoor Arena. The Caribbean-style Birmingham International Carnival takes place in odd numbered years. The UK’s largest two-day Gay Pride is Birmingham Pride (LGBT festival), which is typically held over the spring bank holiday weekend in May. The streets of Birmingham's gay district pulsate with a carnival parade, live music, a dance arena with DJs, cabaret stage, women's arena and a community village. Birmingham Pride {{takes place in the}} gay village. From 1997 until December 2006, the city hosted an annual arts festival ArtsFest, the largest free arts festival in the UK at the time. The city's largest single-day event is its St. Patrick's Day parade (Europe's second largest, after Dublin). Other multicultural events include the Bangla Mela and the Vaisakhi Mela. The Birmingham Heritage Festival is a Mardi Gras style event in August. Caribbean and African culture are celebrated with parades and street performances by buskers.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{was mostly}} {{done in the}} St. Louis area. Several scenes were filmed at the Berry and McNamara Terminals at Detroit Metro Airport in late February 2009 with minimal filming in Omaha, in Las Vegas and in Miami, Florida. Missouri and St. Louis leaders {{provided}} $4.1 million in tax credits for the $25 million film. Producers set up <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> Louis, Missouri production office on January 5, 2009. Filming began in St. Louis on March 3, 2009, and continued {{through the end of}} April. The film includes 80 different sets at 50 locations throughout the St. Louis area, including Lambert-St. Louis International Airport Concourse C and Concourse D (which played the part of several airports across America), the Mansion House apartments in downtown St. Louis, Hilton St. Louis at the Ballpark, Hilton St. Louis Airport, the Cheshire Inn, the GenAmerica building, Renaissance Grand Hotel, Maplewood United Methodist Church, and Affton High School. The film was shot at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport for five days, twenty hours each day.|$|E
5|$|Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes doubled his patrol. Salovi {{was soon}} arrested, and {{informed}} on his shipmates. Hernández Morales led another sloop, intercepting Beagle off Vieques. After a battle, the pirate sloop was captured and Hernández Morales was transported to St. Thomas for trial. After being sentenced to death, he escaped from prison and disappeared for years. According to <b>a</b> <b>St.</b> Thomas resident, on February 12, 1825 the pirates retaliated by {{setting fire to}} a town on the island. That week, Neptune captured a Danish schooner belonging to W. Furniss (a company based in Saint Thomas) off the Ponce coast with a load of imported merchandise. After the assault, Cofresí and his crew abandoned the ship at sea. Later seen floating with broken masts, it was presumed lost. Some time later Cofresí and his crew boarded another ship owned by the company near Guayama, again plundering and abandoning her. Like its predecessor, it was seen near Caja de Muertos (Dead Man's Chest) before disappearing.|$|E
