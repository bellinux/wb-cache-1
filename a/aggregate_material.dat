By varying the weight of the <b>aggregate</b> <b>material</b> in the concrete, the weight of the concrete could be altered, allowing lighter layers to be laid at the top of concrete domes.

500|$|The shallow {{coffering}} in {{the dome}} {{accounts for a}} less than five percent reduction in the dome's mass, and is mostly decorative. The <b>aggregate</b> <b>material</b> hand-placed in the concrete is heaviest {{at the base of}} the dome and changes to lighter materials as the height increases, dramatically reducing the stresses in the finished structure. In fact, many commentators have cited the Pantheon as an example of the revolutionary possibilities for monolithic architecture provided by the use of Roman pozzolana concrete. However, vertical cracks seem to have developed very early, such that in practice the dome acts as an array of arches with a common keystone, rather than as a single unit. The exterior step-rings used to compress the [...] "haunches" [...] of the dome, which would not be necessary if the dome acted as a monolithic structure, may be an acknowledgement of this by the builders themselves. Such buttressing was common in Roman arch construction. The cracks in the dome can be seen from the upper internal chambers of the rotunda, but have been covered by re-rendering on the inner surface and by patching on the outside. The Pantheon's roof was originally covered with gilt bronze tiles, but these were removed in 663 by Emperor Constans II and replaced with lead roofing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study {{to clarify the}} effect of various <b>aggregate</b> <b>materials</b> characteristics on the drying shrinkage property in mortar and concrete specimens incorporating fourteen kinds of fine <b>aggregate</b> <b>materials</b> (standard sand, natural sand, marine sand, various kinds of slag-type sand, and various kinds of crushed sand) and three kinds of coarse <b>aggregate</b> <b>materials</b> (andesite gravel, hard sandstone gravel, and limestone gravel). The test results revealed that the characteristics of fine and coarse <b>aggregate</b> <b>materials</b> {{play an important role}} in controlling the drying shrinkage property of mortar and concrete, respectively. Limestone sand and blast furnace slag sand can restrain the drying shrinkage of mortar specimens about 22 % and 30 %, respectively, compared to the case of mortar incorporating standard sand. The drying shrinkage strain of concrete specimens proportionally increases with the increase of aggregate shrinkage strain, specific surface area and 6 – 30 nm in diameter pore volume of aggregates, which implies the significant influence of aggregate characteristics on drying shrinkage development in concrete. It was also found that the drying shrinkage property in concrete can be affected by the static modulus of elasticity and total amount of water content, in which the water absorption ratio, unit mass of aggregate and unit water content were considered. Finally, the experimental results presented are useful information for providing a good perspective for the concrete mixture design practices taking into consideration that concrete drying shrinkage could be controlled by appropriate aggregate characteristics and reducing the total amount of water content...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe have {{examined}} the state of aggregation of type I procollagen in the concentration range 5 to 800 micrograms/ml. Electron microscopy typically indicates {{a high proportion of}} <b>aggregated</b> <b>material</b> (greater than 50 %), when a range of preparative techniques are used. Aggregates of in-register molecules (segment-long-spacing-like aggregates) are frequently observed, often with units of in-register molecules connected via the C-terminal propeptides.

The <b>aggregated</b> <b>material</b> is mainly dimeric and probably not segment-long-spacing-like.

In the present study, a bacterial system (Escherichia coli) was used to express truncated peptides of huntingtin translated from exon 1 of the HD gene. Bacterial death was observed after the induction of peptides with expanded polyglutamine tracts, and both sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -soluble peptides and insoluble <b>aggregated</b> <b>material</b> were detected by immunoblotting in the homogenates of such E. coli.

To this end, a research study was undertaken at the Illinois Center for Transportation to evaluate the adequacy and field performances of such large-sized <b>aggregate</b> <b>materials</b> and validate new material specifications. A state-of-the-art image analysis technique was utilized to characterize the size and morphological properties, e. g. shape, texture and angularity of two large-sized aggregates, referred to herein as primary crusher run and crushed concrete.

Contributions of the underlying pavement layers to the total rut accumulation was evaluated through innovative applications of ground penetrating radar (GPR), a light weight penetrometer device, known as the French Panda, as well as a geo-endoscopy probe.
