However, {{little is known about}} its physiological functions in higher plants. Here, we report that AtIpk 2 β regulates Arabidopsis <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> branching. By overexpressing AtIpk 2 β in the wild type and mutants, we found that overexpression of AtIpk 2 β leads to more <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> branches. Further analysis of AtIpk 2 β overexpression lines showed that axillary meristem forms earlier and the bud outgrowth rate is also accelerated, resulting in more <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> branches. The AtIpk 2 β promoter/β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusion (AtIpk 2 β∷GUS) expression pattern {{is similar to that of}} the auxin reporter DR 5 ∷GUS. Moreover, AtIpk 2 β can be induced in response to exogenous indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) treatments. In addition, AtIpk 2 β overexpression plants exhibit IAA-related phenotypes and are more resistant to exogenous IAA treatments. Further analysis employing reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction shows that some genes, including auxin-biosynthesis (CYP 83 B 1), auxin-transport (PIN 4), and auxin-mediated branching genes (MAX 4 and SPS), are regulated by AtIpk 2 β. Taken together, our data provide insights into a role for AtIpk 2 β in <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> branching through the auxin signaling pathway...|$|E
40|$|Three {{varieties}} of Bidens pilosa are recorded in Taiwan, among them only B. pilosa var. radiata {{is considered an}} invasive plant, while B. pilosa var. minor and B. pilosa var. pilosa are naturalized in Taiwan. To identify traits making var. radiata spreading faster {{than the other two}} varieties in sympatric areas, we grew these three varieties in summer and in fall and compared their morphology and traits related to growth. We found that all three varieties grew faster in summer than in fall and var. radiata grew faster and accumulated more biomass than the other two varieties in summer but not in fall. Further analysis revealed that the proportion of shoot biomass allocating to <b>axillary</b> <b>shoots</b> might contribute to the aforementioned differences. Shoots of all three varieties were capable of producing adventitious roots. However, the growing angle of the lowest <b>axillary</b> <b>shoots</b> was significantly more horizontal in var. radiata than in the other two varieties and the secondary <b>axillary</b> <b>shoots</b> were only found in var. radiata. Accordingly, the <b>axillary</b> <b>shoots</b> of var. radiata would have greater opportunity to contact soil, produce adventitious roots and generate ramets than those of var. minor and var. pilosa.

40|$|Plant shoots {{elaborate}} {{their adult}} form by selective {{control over the}} growth of both their primary shoot apical meristem and their <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> meristems. We describe recessive mutations at two loci in Arabidopsis, MAX 1 and MAX 2, that affect the selective repression of axillary shoots. All the first order (but not higher order) axillary shoots initiated by mutant plants remain active, resulting in bushier shoots than those of wild type. In vegetative plants where axillary shoots develop in a basal to apical sequence, the mutations do not clearly alter node distance, from the shoot apex, at which <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> meristems initiate but shorten the distance at which the first axillary leaf primordium is produced by the <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> meristem. A small number of mutant <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> meristems is enlarged and, later in development, a low proportion of mutant lateral shoots is fasciated. Together, this suggests that MAX 1 and MAX 2 do not control the timing of axillary meristem initiation but repress primordia formation by the axillary meristem. In addition to shoot branching, mutations at both loci affect leaf shape. The mutations at MAX 2 cause increased hypocotyl and petiole elongation in light-grown seedlings.

Because the complexity of tree architecture increases with tree age, we chose to describe the trees in the early stages of development. The study was carried out on a 1 -year-old apple progeny derived from two parent cultivars with contrasted architecture.

Therefore, expression of KN 1 is not the sole triggering factor responsible for inducing adventitious shoot meristem formation from in-vitro proliferating <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> meristems in maize. Our results show that genes critical to cell division and plant development have utility in defining in-vitro plant morphogenesis {{at the molecular level}} and, in combination with transformation technologies, will be powerful tools in identifying the fundamental molecular and-or genetic triggering factor(s) responsible for reprogramming of plant cells during plant morphogenesis in-vitro...|$|E
40|$|Stem {{segments}} from apical shoot tips of Polygala myrtifolia {{were used}} as primary explants to establish in vitro cultures. Axillary shoots produced on noncontaminated explants were excised and recultured in the same medium to increase the stock of shoot cultures. Equal molar concentrations of five cytokinins  2 -isopentenyladenine (2 iP), kinetin, zeatin, N 6 -benzyladenine (BA) and adenine were tested for ability to induce <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> development from double node stem segments. The highest rate of <b>axillary</b> <b>shoot</b> proliferation was induced on Murashige and Skoog agar medium supplemented with 1. 8 M BA. Seven indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) concentrations (2. 8, 5. 7, 8. 6, 11. 4, 14. 3, 17. 1 M) were tested to determine the optimum conditions for in vitro rooting of microshoots. Up to 72 % of the microshoots rooted with 14. 3 M IAA. Other auxins tested, -naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA), were less effective than IAA in inducing adventitious root formation. All rooted plantlets having more than 3 roots were successfully established in soil...|$|E
40|$|A new species, Cheilocostus borneensis, is described. Specimens were {{collected}} in Sarawak in 1987 and Kalimantan in 2000, but only intensified surveys of gingers in Sarawak in 2002 - 2004 provided sufficient collections to recognize the new species, which is here described and illustrated. It {{is closely related to}} the widespread C. globosus from which it differs by the chocolate-brown sheaths, absence of <b>axillary</b> <b>shoots</b> on vegetative stems, larger leathery leaves, and by its calyx that is not prickly...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there has}} been a {{significant}} expansion of red pitaya cultivation in Brazil and other countries around the world, its cultivation requires scientific expertise to identify the plant production systems best suited to Brazilian soils and climate. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of exogenous auxin and shading of the parental stock plants on the subsequent quality of red pitaya cuttings. The use of a commercial rooting auxin (with and without) and five shading levels on stock plants (full sun, 35, 50, 65 and 80 % shading) were tested via four randomized blocks in a factorial 2 x 5 scheme with two plants per plot. After 90 days, the following vegetative characteristics were evaluated: length of the longest root (LR), root dry mass (RDM), root width (RW), shoot fresh weight (SFW) and shoot dry weight (SDW), total dry weight (TDW), number of <b>axillary</b> <b>shoots</b> (NAS), sum of the length of the <b>axillary</b> <b>shoots</b> (SLAS), and shoot:root ratio (SRR). We concluded that for the production of high quality plants, collecting cuttings from stock plants grown in full sun or 80 % shade is recommended, eliminating the need to use commercial rooting auxin...|$|R
30|$|The freshly cut scion {{was brought}} in contact with freshly cut {{rootstock}} tissue (Fig.  1 d), the two bionts were incubated on medium to induce root formation. Periodically, <b>axillary</b> <b>shoots</b> that emerged from rootstocks were removed. The different steps of micrografting were carried out on PGR free MS medium and maintained as described above. Micrografts were done in separate batches. When sub apical explants were used, each set comprised 90 micrografts while, when apical explants were used, each set was of ten micrografts.|$|R
