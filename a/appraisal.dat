40|$|Although past {{research}} has shown that neuroticism and extraversion predict stress <b>appraisals,</b> how these traits affect <b>appraisals</b> is not known.

40|$|Chronic {{psychological}} stress {{is a risk}} factor for multiple diseases of aging. Accelerated cellular aging as indexed by short telomere length has emerged as a potential common biological mechanism linking various forms of {{psychological stress}} and diseases of aging. Stress <b>appraisals</b> determine the degree and type of biological stress responses and altered stress <b>appraisals</b> may be a common psychological mechanism linking psychological stress and diseases of aging. However, no previous studies have examined the relationship between stress <b>appraisals</b> and telomere length. We exposed chronically stressed female caregivers and non-caregiving controls (N =  50; M age =  62. 14  ±  6. 10) to a standardized acute laboratory stressor and measured their anticipatory and retrospective threat and challenge <b>appraisals</b> of the stressor. We hypothesized that threat and challenge <b>appraisals</b> would be associated with shorter and longer telomere length respectively, and that chronic caregiving stress would influence telomere length through altered stress <b>appraisals.</b> Higher anticipatory threat <b>appraisals</b> were associated with shorter age-adjusted telomere length (β = −. 32, p = . 03), but challenge <b>appraisals</b> and retrospective threat <b>appraisals</b> showed no independent association with telomere length. Caregivers reported significantly higher anticipatory (β = −. 36, p = . 006) and retrospective (β = −. 29, p = . 03) threat <b>appraisals</b> than controls, but similar challenge <b>appraisals.</b> Although there was no significant main effect of caregiver status on telomere length, caregiving had a significant indirect effect on telomere length through anticipatory threat <b>appraisals.</b> Exaggerated anticipatory threat <b>appraisals</b> may be a common and modifiable psychological mechanism of psychological stress effects on cellular aging...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To assess clinicians' use {{of shared}} {{decision}} making (SDM) skills, enabling patient treatment evaluations (appraisals); and varieties of patient <b>appraisals</b> and clinicians' preceding and following utterances. Methods: Two coders rated videotaped initial visits of 25 early-stage prostate cancer patients to their radiation oncologist. SDM skills were assessed using the Decision Analysis System for Oncology (DAS-O); <b>appraisals</b> and clinicians' utterances were labeled using qualitative methodology. Results: Clinicians offered a treatment choice to 10 patients. They informed 15 / 25 about pros and 20 / 25 about cons of options. Patients expressed 67 <b>appraisals</b> (median/visit = 2; range, 0 - 12). Half of <b>appraisals</b> were favorable and one-fourth was unfavorable toward treatment options. One-fifth referred to explicit tradeoffs. One-third of <b>appraisals</b> followed clinician requests; 58 % followed clinician information. Clinicians approved almost half of <b>appraisals.</b> They contested, ignored or highlighted a minority. Conclusion: Clinicians infrequently offered patients a choice or explored <b>appraisals.</b> Most <b>appraisals</b> supported rather than challenged treatment options. Clinicians most often legitimized <b>appraisals,</b> thereby helping patients {{to feel good about}} the decision. Exploring <b>appraisals</b> may help patients in forming more stable preferences, thus benefiting patients in the long run.

30|$|This study {{supports}} PTSD models {{emphasis on}} the role of cognitive <b>appraisals</b> in PTSD (Ehlers and Clark 2000) and the focus on <b>appraisals</b> in the treatment of PTSD (Resick 2001). The results extend findings conducted with Western populations to indicate that <b>appraisals</b> also {{play an important role in}} PTSD in Asian cultures, which is expected given the emphasis theories of emotion give to the role of cognition in emotion (e.g. see Mauro et al. 1992). The results indicate that the cultural differences in cognitive <b>appraisals</b> of everyday events, which are in line with cross-cultural theories (Mesquita and Walker 2003), tend to extend to trauma cognitive <b>appraisals.</b> Nonetheless, despite these cultural differences in trauma cognitive <b>appraisals,</b> the findings suggest that the types of cognitive <b>appraisals</b> that relate to PTSD symptoms may be culturally similar. However, <b>appraisals</b> of personal control seemed to be somewhat unique. While <b>appraisals</b> of personal control were found, as in previous research (e.g. Jobson and O’Kearney 2009), to differentiate between British trauma survivors with and without PTSD, <b>appraisals</b> of control had little relevance in discriminating between Asian trauma survivors with and without PTSD. This suggests that in some instances the influence of cultural differences in self-construal on cognitive <b>appraisals</b> influences PTSD outcome (see Jobson 2009). The success of the PCSAM in differentiating between those with and without PTSD demonstrates the importance of also considering also public and communal aspects of self in those with PTSD.|$|R

Method - A total of 52 individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder (confirmed by structured interview) completed biweekly assessments of affect regulation behaviours and mood for 4 weeks.

40|$|Moral {{judgment}} {{often requires}} making difficult tradeoffs (e. g., is it appropriate to torture {{to save the}} lives of innocents at risk?).

However, it is unclear how these different types of <b>appraisals</b> are represented in the brain, or how they are integrated into an overall moral judgment. We addressed these questions using an fMRI paradigm in which human subjects provide separate emotional and utilitarian <b>appraisals</b> for different potential actions, and then make difficult moral judgments constructed from combinations of these actions.

40|$|Background: The {{integrative}} {{cognitive model}} of mood swings proposes that mood symptoms {{are driven by}} extreme, self-referent <b>appraisals.</b> For example, if activated mood is appraised positively, this prompts selection of mood regulation strategies that act to upregulate mood. <b>Appraisals</b> are driven by fast and automatic Type 1 cognitive processes, which left unchecked, can cause activated mood to escalate. Aims: It was hypothesised that greater propensity to override these automatic processes by engaging in reflective (Type 2) thinking would be negatively associated with extreme <b>appraisals</b> of activation and activation. Method: Study 1 (n= 150) was a cross-sectional survey comprising measures of activation, extreme <b>appraisals,</b> and an objective performance based measure of the propensity to engage in reflective thought (Cognitive Reflection Test; CRT). In Study 2 (n= 241) participants completed these measures plus three alternative measures of effortful cognitive engagement; CRT- 2, Need for Cognition and Actively Open-Minded Thinking. Results: In Study 1, propensity to engage in reflective thought (higher CRT scores) was not significantly associated with activated mood or extreme <b>appraisals,</b> but activated mood and extreme <b>appraisals</b> were positively correlated. In study 2, the association between activation and extreme <b>appraisals</b> was replicated. Predicted associations between alternative measures of reflective thinking, activated mood, and extreme <b>appraisals</b> were not found. Conclusions: Extreme <b>appraisals</b> of internal states may be a psychological mechanism underlying activated mood. Propensity to reflect on and override default cognitions was unrelated to these extreme <b>appraisals</b> and activated mood.
