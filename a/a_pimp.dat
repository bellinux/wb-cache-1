5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry {{at a party in}} a bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit the stereotypical image of <b>a</b> <b>pimp.</b> She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|Nikki, meanwhile, is {{determined}} to catch the actual thieves and bring forth the truth. After meeting Loudon, Nikki cons him into taking her shopping. After taking a Rolls Royce into Harlem to buy a gun– and nearly being arrested during a police raid– she explains her story to Loudon who believes that she is innocent, and decides to help her. She's also {{on the run from}} <b>a</b> <b>pimp</b> named Raoul (Coati Mundi) and his lackey Benny (Dennis Burkley), the people who killed Johnny. Only after dangling off a car smashed through the top floor of a parking garage, does he tell her the bank and the box number of Nikki's slain boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>pimp</b> rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E
50|$|A {{high school}} {{journalist}} named Willie Wheeler {{and his girlfriend}} Dooley solve crimes {{with the help of}} his shape-shifting superhero motorcycle, Wonder Wheels; whenever Willie goes into action, his beat-up motorcycle transforms itself into <b>a</b> <b>pimped</b> out version with a mind of its own.|$|R

5|$|Ritter leaves Scully {{staking out}} Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she sees}} Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out his window and bangs on his door, demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon. <b>A</b> <b>pimp</b> approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully leaps out of the car with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E
5|$|The video premiered on October 4, 1994, on MTV. It {{begins with}} showing the {{neighborhood}} of Harlem, with Madonna as a singer in a small jazz club. She simply sits in the club with her band and sings for her small, mostly black and Latino audience. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes {{of people living in}} Harlem, doing their daily chores, including a supporting cast of transvestite prostitutes, <b>a</b> <b>pimp,</b> and a black gang member who shows off the scars on his body. During the intermediate verses, Madonna is shown writhing in the lap of an older, maternal woman, who symbolically baptizes her by splashing water on her forehead. Near the video's end, Madonna walks through the neighborhood and climbs a set of stairs to have a reunion with her family, a young Latin man and their supposed son. The video ends with Madonna smiling towards the camera while sitting at the nightclub.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} the sex trade. Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either <b>a</b> <b>pimp,</b> a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E
25|$|When he was {{stationed}} in Hawaii as a squad leader at Schofield Barracks, where prostitution was not a heavily prosecuted crime, Marrow met <b>a</b> <b>pimp</b> named Mac. Mac admired that Marrow could quote Iceberg Slim and he taught Marrow how to be <b>a</b> <b>pimp</b> himself. Marrow was also able to purchase stereo equipment cheaply in Hawaii, including two Technics turntables, a mixer, and large speakers. Once equipped, he then began to learn turntablism and rapping.|$|E
25|$|Procuring or pandering is the {{facilitation}} or {{provision of}} a prostitute or sex {{worker in the}} arrangement of a sex act with a customer. A procurer, colloquially called <b>a</b> <b>pimp</b> (if male) or a madam (if female), is an agent for prostitutes who collects part of their earnings. The procurer may receive this money in return for advertising services, physical protection, or for providing, and possibly monopolizing, a location where the prostitute may engage clients. Like prostitution, the legality of certain actions of a madam or <b>a</b> <b>pimp</b> vary from one region to the next.|$|E

25|$|However, when a {{character}} scorns a god, {{it is usually}} {{a character}} of low standing, such as <b>a</b> <b>pimp.</b> Plautus perhaps does this to demoralize the characters. Soldiers often bring ridicule among the gods. Young men, meant to represent the upper social class, often belittle the gods in their remarks. Parasites, pimps, and courtesans often praise the gods with scant ceremony.|$|E

25|$|The term bitch slap {{is derived}} from American slang. In the {{original}} sense, a bitch slap is a powerful, full-swing {{slap in the face}} with the front of the hand, evoking the way an angry pimp might slap a defiant prostitute (not to be confused with <b>a</b> <b>pimp</b> slap which uses the back of the hand). However, the term is now frequently used figuratively to describe a humiliating defeat or punishment.|$|E

25|$|Procuring {{can often}} take abusive forms. Pimps may punish clients for {{physical}} abuse or failure to pay, and enforce {{exclusive rights to}} 'turf' where their prostitutes may advertise and operate with less competition. In the many places where prostitution is outlawed, sex workers have decreased incentive to report abuse for fear of self-incrimination, and increased motivation to seek any physical protection from clients and law enforcement that <b>a</b> <b>pimp</b> might provide.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Rome, {{chastity}} {{and loyalty}} {{of members of}} a family was an important factor contributing to family honor in addition to social standing and accomplishments of that family.

If the husband chose not to divorce his wife, he would jeopardize his honor and be labeled as <b>a</b> <b>pimp.</b>|$|E
