5|$|<b>Apples</b> <b>are</b> an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, {{and they can}} also be dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. <b>Apples</b> <b>are</b> also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apples</b> <b>are</b> eaten {{with honey}} at the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah to symbolize a sweet new year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apples</b> <b>are</b> a {{rich source}} of various phytochemicals {{including}} flavonoids (e.g., catechins, flavanols, and quercetin) and other phenolic compounds (e.g., epicatechin and procyanidins) found in the skin, core, and pulp of the apple; they have unknown health value in humans.|$|E
30|$|Unwaxed ‘Fuji’ <b>apples</b> <b>were</b> {{purchased}} {{from a local}} grocery store. <b>Apples</b> <b>were</b> of uniform size (230 ± 10 g) and were free of visible defects such as bruises, cuts, or abrasions. The <b>apples</b> <b>were</b> stored at 2 °C and used in experiments within 7 days. Before use, the <b>apples</b> <b>were</b> washed with 2 % sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, rinsed with deionized water, and air-dried before wounding.|$|R
50|$|And when I {{say that}} Its {{necessary}} that the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red, {{this is the}} same as saying that Its not possible {{that it is not the}} case that the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red. Furthermore, when I say that Its not possible that it is not the case that the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red, {{this is the same}} as saying that Its necessary that the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red.|$|R
5000|$|For example, if a {{determination}} cannot {{be made as}} to whether an <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red or not-red, then the truth value of the assertion Q: [...] " [...] This <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red [...] " [...] is [...] " [...] u [...] ". Likewise, the truth value of the assertion R [...] " [...] This <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> not-red [...] " [...] is [...] " [...] u [...] ". Thus the AND of these into the assertion Q AND R, i.e. [...] " [...] This <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red AND this <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> not-red [...] " [...] will, per the tables, yield [...] " [...] u [...] ". And, the assertion Q OR R, i.e. [...] " [...] This <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red OR this <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> not-red [...] " [...] will likewise yield [...] " [...] u [...] ".|$|R
5|$|<b>Apples</b> <b>are</b> often eaten raw. The {{whole fruit}} {{including}} {{the skin is}} {{suitable for human consumption}} except for the seeds, which may affect some consumers. The core is often not eaten and is discarded. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} proportion of food waste is produced by the domestic household, which, in 2007, created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste. Potatoes, bread slices and <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> respectively the most wasted foods by quantity, while salads are thrown away in the greatest proportion. A majority of wasted food is avoidable, with the rest being divided almost equally by foods which are unavoidable (e.g. tea bags) and unavoidable due to preference (e.g. bread crusts) or cooking type (e.g. potato skins).|$|E
5|$|<b>Apples</b> <b>are</b> self-incompatible; {{they must}} cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the {{flowering}} each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees {{are also used}} as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity to be significant pollinators.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species of}} the Haralson <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> the Malus domestica. The origin of the <b>apple</b> <b>was</b> in Minnesota, United States in 1913.|$|R
50|$|While the <b>Apple</b> II <b>was</b> already {{established}} as a successful business-ready platform because of Visicalc, <b>Apple</b> <b>was</b> not content. The <b>Apple</b> III <b>was</b> designed {{to take on the}} business environment. The <b>Apple</b> III <b>was</b> released on May 19, 1980.|$|R
30|$|The law of {{excluded}} middle states {{that everything that}} is, either is or is not, but nothing in between (∀x (x ˅ ¬x)) [4]. So if there <b>is</b> an <b>apple,</b> it <b>is</b> either true or false that the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red. If the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> green, the sentence “the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red” is false, if the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> indeed red, then the sentence “the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red” is true {{but there is no}} third option making the sentence “the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red” is something else than true or false. Or to give another example, if there seems to <b>be</b> an <b>apple</b> on the table and this <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> either there or is not there, but the apple has no third undefined ontological status besides being or not being on the table. In conjunction with the other two laws, this law states basic logical truths about entities of all kind and, thus, knowledge referring to this law can be considered as elemental knowledge. Even the law of {{excluded middle}} produces tautologies. Nevertheless, this kind of knowledge is also true knowledge about entities of all kind. Knowledge that grounds on the third law of thought is not only true in the present but also true in the past and the future.|$|R
5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. <b>Apples</b> <b>are</b> commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.|$|E
5|$|Organic <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} {{produced in}} the United States. Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe. The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has {{been approved by the}} EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} {{has been}} used for applications in biotechnology and is nearing commercialization in others. RNAi has developed many novel crops such as nicotinefree tobacco, decaffeinated coffee, nutrient fortified and hypoallergenic crops. The genetically engineered Arctic apples received FDA approval in 2015. The apples were produced by RNAi suppression of PPO (polyphenol oxidase) gene making apple varieties that will not undergo browning after being sliced. PPO-silenced <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> unable to convert chlorogenic acid into quinone product.|$|E
50|$|For {{historical}} reasons, the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> {{very important}} symbolically to the society. An <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> dropped {{at the end}} of meetings to signify that the meeting is now social; the President bowls an apple as the first 'ball' at the annual cricket match; and, as outlined in the society's Standing Orders, an <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> part of the design of the Society tie.|$|R
5000|$|... e.g. Querying {{application}} may {{dismiss the}} hypothesis [...] "The <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red." [...] e.g. Constraints may be semantic; rejecting [...] "The <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> angry." [...] e.g. Syntactic; rejecting [...] "Red <b>is</b> <b>apple</b> the." [...] Constraints are often {{represented by a}} grammar.|$|R
2500|$|The Orenco <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> {{probably}} the company’s most famous product. [...] The Orenco <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> a red <b>apple,</b> plump, crisp, and juicy {{with a small}} core. [...] According to the company’s 1913 Descriptive Catalogue of Fruit and Ornamental Trees, the Orenco <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> [...] "the ideal dessert apple." [...] The catalog claimed the Orenco {{was better than the}} McIntosh Red apple or Spitzenberg apple, two <b>apples</b> that <b>were</b> known for their quality. Today, the Orenco <b>apple</b> can still <b>be</b> found in some Pacific Northwest orchards and nurseries that specialize in classic apple varieties.|$|R
5|$|The {{fieldfare}} is omnivorous. Animal food in {{the diet}} includes snails and slugs, earthworms, spiders and insects such as beetles and their larvae, flies and grasshoppers. When berries ripen in the autumn these are taken in great number. Hawthorn, holly, rowan, yew, juniper, dog rose, Cotoneaster, Pyracantha and Berberis are all relished. Later in the winter windfall <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> eaten, swedes attacked {{in the field and}} grain and seeds eaten. When these are exhausted, or in particularly harsh weather, the birds may move to marshes or even the foreshore where molluscs are to be found.|$|E
5|$|Weirfield Riverside is {{a linear}} nature reserve {{along the bank}} of the River Tone {{providing}} alder and willow woodland, bramble, scrub and rough grassland. The wetter areas which are sometimes flooded include hemlock water dropwort, and yellow flag. Silk Mills Park and Ride includes landscaping and ponds in three areas next to the River Tone created when the park and ride was created. The woodland and grassland supports aquatic and marginal vegetation. There are a variety of birds, bats, reptiles and invertebrates. Frieze Hill Community Orchard has been converted from allotments to rough grassland and an orchard. The kingston black and yarlington mill varieties of <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> among those grown.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastline}} supplies many crustaceans, sea bass, monkfish and herring. Normandy has {{top quality}} seafood, such as scallops and sole, while Brittany has {{a supply of}} lobster, crayfish and mussels. Normandy {{is home to a}} large population of apple trees; <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> often used in dishes, as well as cider and Calvados. The northern areas of this region, especially Nord, grow ample amounts of wheat, sugar beets and chicory. Thick stews are found often in these northern areas as well. The produce of these northern regions is also considered some {{of the best in the}} country, including cauliflower and artichokes. Buckwheat grows widely in Brittany as well and is used in the region's galettes, called jalet, which is where this dish originated.|$|E
50|$|Teppei's {{apartment}} {{has many}} unusual {{items such as}} a Thai artifact, a 30-year-old refrigerator {{that is no longer}} manufactured, and a crystal apple. The meaning behind the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> {{that there is only one}} true love, between Adam and Eve, that is. A crystal is very fragile, and when one would look in it, his or her views would appear upside down. The <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> seen upside down for the 10 of the 11 episodes. At the last episode, however, the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> no longer upside down. The <b>apple</b> <b>was</b> also on the album cover of Love Generation's soundtrack.|$|R
500|$|There was an [...] "unconfirmed but widely {{circulated}} report" [...] speculating that <b>Apple</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} start using Snapdragon SoCs in Verizon-based iPhones. As of 2012, <b>Apple</b> <b>was</b> still using their own Ax semiconductor designs.|$|R

25|$|There is {{no known}} cure, but an {{appropriate}} diet and the enzyme xylose isomerase can help. The ingestion of glucose simultaneously with fructose improves fructose absorption and may prevent {{the development of}} symptoms. For example, people may tolerate fruits such as grapefruits or bananas, which contain similar amounts of fructose and glucose, but <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> not tolerated because they contain high levels of fructose {{and lower levels of}} glucose.|$|E
25|$|Peaches are {{considered}} self-fertile because a commercial crop {{can be produced}} without cross-pollination, though cross-pollination usually gives a better crop. <b>Apples</b> <b>are</b> considered self-incompatible, because a commercial crop must be cross-pollinated. Many commercial fruit tree varieties are grafted clones, genetically identical. An orchard block of apples of one variety is genetically a single plant. Many growers now consider this a mistake. One means of correcting this mistake is to graft a limb of an appropriate pollenizer (generally a variety of crabapple) every six trees or so.|$|E
25|$|After using toothpaste, {{orange juice}} and other juices have an {{unpleasant}} taste. Sodium lauryl sulfate alters taste perception. It can break down phospholipids that inhibit taste receptors for sweetness, giving food a bitter taste. In contrast, <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> known to taste more pleasant after using toothpaste. Distinguishing between the hypotheses that the bitter taste of orange juice results from stannous fluoride or from sodium lauryl sulfate is still an unresolved issue and {{it is thought that}} the menthol added for flavor may also take part in the alteration of taste perception when binding to lingual cold receptors.|$|E

50|$|An <b>apple</b> doll <b>is</b> a North American {{cultural}} phenomenon {{where the}} doll's head {{is made from}} dried <b>apples.</b> The <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> peeled, then carved with the facial features of the doll. Next the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> left to dry for several days or weeks. When completely dry, the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> positioned {{on the top of}} a wire frame which is shaped into the rest of the doll's body. The rest of the wire frame is covered up by the doll's clothing, which is usually sewn by hand. In modern times, <b>apple</b> dolls <b>are</b> mostly used as decorations or to display craftsmanship, rather than as children's toys. Because of the different effects drying produces, no two dolls are alike.|$|R
25|$|Candy apples, {{also known}} as toffee apples outside of North America, are whole apples covered in a hard sugar candy coating. While the topping varies from place to place, they are almost always served with a wooden stick of sorts in the middle making them easier to eat. Toffee <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> a common treat at autumn festivals in Western culture in the Northern Hemisphere, such as Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night because these festivals fall {{in the wake of}} the annual apple harvest. Dipping fruits into a sugar syrup is an ancient tradition. However, the origin of the red candy apple is {{attributed}} to Newark, New Jersey candymaker who conceived the idea of dipping apples into a red cinnamon candy mixture he had on hand. In addition, dipping apples in hot caramel a 1950s American invention attributed to Kraft salesman Dan Walker.|$|E
25|$|Digory picks one of {{the apples}} for his mission, but their overpowering smell tempts him. Jadis appears, having herself eaten an apple to become immortal; she tempts Digory either to eat an apple himself and join her in immortality, or steal one to take back to Earth to heal his dying mother. Digory resists, knowing his mother would never condone theft, but hesitates. He sees through the Witch's ploy when she {{suggests}} he leave Polly behind—not knowing Polly can get away by her own ring. Foiled, the Witch departs for the North. Digory returns to Narnia and plants the apple, which grows into a mature tree behind them whilst the coronation proceeds. Aslan tells Digory how the tree works: anyone who steals the apples gets their heart's desire, but {{in a form that}} makes it unlikeable. In the Witch's case, she has achieved immortality, but it only means eternal misery because of her evil heart. Moreover, the magic <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> now a horror to her, such that the apple tree will repel her for centuries to come. With Aslan's permission, Digory then takes an apple from the new tree to heal his mother. Aslan returns Digory, Polly, and Uncle Andrew to England; Frank and his wife, Helen (transported from England by Aslan) stay to rule Narnia as its first King and Queen.|$|E
500|$|In the wild, apples grow readily from seeds. However, {{like most}} {{perennial}} fruits, <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> ordinarily propagated asexually by grafting. This is because seedling <b>apples</b> <b>are</b> {{an example of}} [...] "extreme heterozygotes", in that rather than inheriting DNA from their parents {{to create a new}} apple with those characteristics, they are instead significantly different from their parents. Triploid cultivars have an additional reproductive barrier in that 3 sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (<b>apples</b> <b>are</b> an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.|$|E
5000|$|So {{using the}} symbols and their meaning {{described}} above, the first modal axiom, [...] could stand for: Its necessary that the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red if {{and only if}} its not possible {{that it is not the}} case that the <b>apple</b> <b>is</b> red.|$|R
