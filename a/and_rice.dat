40|$|The glycemic index (GI) is an {{important}} parameter of food quality which compares the hyperglycemic effect of a tested meal with pure glucose. The glycomic index of different varieties of rice (Oryza sativa) such as white <b>rice,</b> brown <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> parboiled <b>rice</b> were determined. A group of 22 participants with the mean age, weight, height and body mass index of 24 to 62 ± 1. 43 years, 63. 42 ± 10. 50 kg, 1. 70 ± 0. 0 m and 21. 90 ± 2. 74 kgm- 2 were respectively selected for the study. The mean fasting blood glucose level of the participants was 84. 81 ± 4. 37 mgdl- 1. The mean blood glucose level at 30 and 60 min after the oral administration of 75 g glucose were 147. 43 ± 11. 67 and 125. 95 ± 9. 30 mgdl- 1, respectively. The mean glycemic response of pure glucose at 30 and 60 min were 62. 62 ± 11. 4 and 41. 14 ± 8. 932 mgdl- 1 respectively and hence, higher glycemic response for the pure glucose was obtained at 30 min. To the participants different varieties of cooked vice (white <b>rice,</b> brown <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> parboiled <b>rice)</b> boiled containing 75 g digestible carbohydrate were administered, the peak blood glucose response was obtained at 30 min. The mean glycemic response of white <b>rice,</b> brown <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> parboiled <b>rice</b> were 41. 71 ± 6. 17, 37. 72 ± 5. 11 and 35. 05 ± 3. 77 mgdl- 1, respectively. The glycemic responses after the consumption of cooked rice sample containing 75 g digestible carbohydrate, showed significant difference (P > 0. 05) between cooked white <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> brown <b>rice,</b> cooked brown <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> parboiled <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> cooked white <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> parboiled <b>rice.</b> The mean GI values of cooked white <b>rice,</b> brown <b>rice</b> <b>and</b> parboiled <b>rice</b> were 66. 61 ± 9. 86, 60. 24 ± 8. 16 and 55. 97 ± 6. 01, respectively.
