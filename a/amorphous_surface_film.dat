40|$|Highly active, {{supported}} Au-Pd catalysts {{have been}} tested for catalysing benzyl alcohol oxidation in a silicon-glass micro-packed bed reactor. The effects of Au-Pd composition and anion content during catalyst preparation on catalyst deactivation were studied, and {{a relationship between the}} deactivation rate and the amount of Cl- and Au used in the catalyst formulation was found. Whilst Au aids in enhancing the selectivity to the desired product and the Cl- ions help the formation of uniform 1 - 2 nm nanoparticles, higher amounts of Au and Cl- become detrimental to the catalyst stability once a certain amount is exceeded. Loss of small (1 - 2 nm) metal nanoparticles was evident in all catalysts studied, accompanied by agglomeration and the formation of larger > 10 nm particles. A secondary deactivation mechanism characterised by the formation of an <b>amorphous</b> <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> was observed via TEM in catalysts with high Cl- and Au and was confirmed by the detection of carbon species on the catalyst surface using Raman Spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|First-row {{transition}} metal oxides and chalcogenides {{have been found}} to rival the performance of precious metal-based catalysts for the interconversion of water and O$_ 2 $. The high lability of the first-row {{transition metal}} ions leads to surface dynamics under the conditions of catalysis and results in active site structures distinct from those expected by surface termination of the bulk lattice. While these surface transformations have been well-characterized on many metal oxides, the surface dynamics of heavier chalcogenides under electrocatalytic conditions are largely unknown. We recently reported that the heazlewoodite Ni$_ 3 $S$_ 2 $ bulk phase supports efficient ORR catalysis under benign aqueous conditions and exhibits excellent tolerance to electrolyte anions such as phosphate which poison Pt. Herein, we combine electrochemistry, surface spectroscopy and high resolution microscopy to characterize the surface dynamics of Ni$_ 3 $S$_ 2 $ under ORR catalytic conditions. We show that Ni$_ 3 $S$_ 2 $ undergoes self-limiting oxidative surface restructuring to form an approximately 2 nm <b>amorphous</b> <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> conformally coating the Ni$_ 3 $S$_ 2 $ crystallites. The surface film has a nominal NiS stoichiometry and is highly active for ORR catalysis. Using DFT calculations we show that, to a first approximation, the catalytic activity of nickel sulfides is determined by the Ni-S coordination numbers at surface exposed sites through a simple geometric descriptor. In particular, we find that the surface sites formed dynamically on the surface of amorphous NiS during surface restructuring provide an optimal energetic landscape for ORR catalysis. This work provides a systematic framework for characterizing the rich surface chemistry of metal-chalcogenides and provides principles for developing a broader understanding of electrocatalysis mediated by amorphous materials.

We observe the formation of Bi 2 O 3 -rich interfacial phases at the surface of ZnO grains (<b>surface</b> <b>amorphous</b> <b>films)</b> or at the grain-boundary between ZnO grains (intergranular films). In qualitative agreement with the experimental results reported on premelting of ceramics, the thickness of these films increases as the temperature increases up to the eutectic temperature. Moreover, the Bi 2 O 3 concentration in the surficial or intergranular films is found to be larger than in the bulk. These surficial films exhibit both some layering and lateral ordering.

40|$|The {{influences}} of molecular, crystalline and granular structures on the biodegradability of compressionmolded starch films were investigated. Fungal -amylase {{was used as}} model degradation agent. The substrates comprised varied starch structures obtained by different degrees of acid hydrolysis, different granular sizes using size fractionation, and different degrees of crystallinity by aging for different times (up to 14 days). Two stages are identified for unretrograded films by fitting degradation data using firstorder kinetics. Starch films containing larger molecules were degraded faster, but the rate coefficient was independent of the granule size. Retrograded films were degraded much slower than unretrograded ones, with a similar rate coefficient {{to that in the}} second stage of unretrograded films. Although initially the smaller molecules or the easily accessible starch chains on the <b>amorphous</b> <b>film</b> <b>surface</b> were degraded faster, the more ordered structure (resistant starch) formed from retrogradation, either before or during enzymatic degradation, strongly inhibits film biodegradation...|$|R

One approach is {{to take advantage of}} interfacial engineering in order to modify currently developed materials, thus improving their properties for specific applications. The advantage of interfacial engineering is that it can also be applied to newly developed materials to further improve their properties for the specific applications. In first part of this dissertation, a systematic study is performed to investigate the effect of annealing in reducing atmospheres with different oxygen partial pressures and presence of other species (Ar, H 2, N 2, vacuum or hydrocarbon) on visible-light photocatalytic activity of TiO 2. In second part, a facile nitridation method is used to improve the rate capability of TiO 2 as anode material for Li ion batteries. The enhanced high-rate capacities are attributed to moderate surface nitridation with less-disordered nitridated regions, which may enhance the surface electronic conductivity without forming discrete, nanoscale, and <b>surface</b> <b>amorphous</b> <b>films</b> to block the lithium transport. In third part, pseudocapacitive properties of V 2 O 5 -based adsorbates supported on TiO 2 nanoparticles is systematically measured. <b>Surface</b> <b>amorphous</b> <b>films</b> (SAFs), which form naturally at thermodynamic equilibria at 550 - 600 C with self-regulating or “equilibrium” thicknesses on the order of 1 nm, exhibit superior electrochemical performance at moderate and high scan rates (20 - 500 mV/s) that are of prime importance for supercapacitor applications, as compared with submonolayer and monolayer adsorbates formed at lower equilibration temperatures. In fourth part, we perform a combined experimental and computational investigation into the effects of aliovalent doping in NASICON on both bulk and grain boundary ionic conductivity. Our results show that the dopants with low solid solubility limits in NASICON solid solution lead to the formation of a conducting secondary phase at grain boundaries, thereby improving effective grain boundary conductivity that is otherwise hindered by the poorly-conducting Na 3 PO 4 and ZrO 2 secondary phases in undoped NASICON.

40|$|International audienceReflected-light {{differential}} interference contrast microscopy {{was used}} to observe the disappearance of stearic acid crystal (B-polymorph) deposited onto a heterogeneous anatase/amorphous titania film upon ultraviolet light exposure. Microstructural studies of the films demonstrate the formation of anatase microdomains with sub-micrometric size randomly distributed throughout the <b>amorphous</b> <b>surface</b> of the <b>film.</b> The microscopy images reveal that the disappearance of stearic acid crystal is initiated {{in the immediate vicinity}} of these microdomains located within the crystal or close to its edges. The stearic acid disappearance proceeds via lateral growth and coalescence of pits in shape of flattened-hexagons showing a preferential orientation with respect to the stearic acid crystal symmetry. This latter fact, which is observed {{for the first time to}} the best of our knowledge, is explained by the dependence on crystallographic orientation of the progression rate of the pit edges. To justify the observed photodegradation mode, we first invoke the ultraviolet-induced formation of radical species at the anatase microdomains and their diffusion towards the pits edges. Then, the geometry and the preferential orientation of the pits are discussed in terms of anisotropy of intermolecular interactions within the crystal. These results suggest that the energy barrier seen by the radical species reaching the pit edges is correlated to the crystallographic orientation with consequences on the reaction kinetics...|$|R

SAFs are nanometer-thick amorphous films which are characterized by a self-selecting thickness, and a composition and structure distinct from the bulk phases with which they coexist. Importantly, they are present as an equilibrium, disordered phase below bulk solidus temperatures where all other phases in the system are crystalline. They are true surface phases which coexist in thermodynamic equilibrium with the bulk phases. We have shown that SAFs form {{in a number of}} binary oxide systems, and that they {{play an important role in}} the processing of materials (e. g., solid-state activated sintering in ZnO-Bi 2 O 3) and in forming surface-active layers in supported catalyst systems.

In parallel, transient amorphous precursor phases have been proposed in various biomineralization processes, including bone biomineralization.

This study relies on the investigation of a bone tissue sample and its comparison with synthetic calcium phosphate samples, including a stoichiometric apatite, an amorphous calcium phosphate sample, and two different biomimetic apatites. To reveal if the amorphous environments in bone originate from an <b>amorphous</b> <b>surface</b> layer or a transient amorphous precursor phase, a combined solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment has been used.

In particular, this thesis is concerned with the kinetics of lithium transport through the <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> that form on carbon in non-aqueous electrolyte. These <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> have often been described as a solid electrolyte interphase or “SEI”.

These experiments showed that the kinetics of a fresh cell are limited by lithium diffusion in the bulk carbon. The kinetics of a cycled cell, however, are slower than that of a fresh cell due to an increased impedance of the <b>surface</b> <b>films.</b> A model is proposed to explain how the <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> are slowing the kinetics of lithium transport.

Using different combinations of subphase vesicles and spread <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> a clear correlation between dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) content and minimum surface tension was observed. Spread phospholipid films containing 50 % DPPC over a subphase containing 50 % DPPC vesicles did not form stable <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> with a low minimum surface tension. Addition of surfactant protein B (SP-B) to the <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> led to a progressive decrease in minimum surface tension toward 1 mN/m upon cycling, indicating an enrichment in DPPC.

However, this effect was only observed when SP-A was combined with SP-B and incubated with subphase vesicles before addition to the air bubble containing sample chamber. Comparison of spread films with adsorbed films indicated that refinement induced by SP-B occurs by selective removal of non-DPPC lipids upon cycling. SP-A, combined with SP-B, induces a selective adsorption of DPPC from subphase vesicles into the <b>surface</b> <b>film.</b> This is achieved by formation of large lipid structures which might resemble tubular myelin...|$|R
40|$|From {{measurements}} of the equilibrium spreading pressure pie for dispersions of lecithin [...] dimyristoyl (DML) or dioleoyl (DOL) [...] and cholesterol (CHOL) in water, we have deduced the phase relations in both the aqueous dispersions and the equilibrium <b>surface</b> <b>films.</b> At 29. 5 degrees C, when the mole fraction of cholesterol in the dispersion chi(CHOL) is 0 chi(CHOL) less than chi(CHOL) less than 0. 33, pie is constant and equal to the value for pure lecithin (DOL or DML). The phase rule predicts than two bulk lipid phases coexist; these are pure lecithin and lecithin:cholesterol 2 : 1 complex. The equilibrium <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> contants only lecithin and therefore lecithin and 2 : 1 complex are immiscible in <b>surface</b> <b>films.</b> When 0. 33 less than chi/CHOL) less than 1. 0, pie is also contant with a value intermediate between that for pure lecithin and cholesterol. In this range of lipid composition two bulk lipid phases also coexist: lecithin:cholesterol 2 : 1 complex and pure cholesterol. However, the equilibrium <b>surface</b> <b>film</b> contains only the 2 : 1 complex and, therefore, 2 : 1 complex is also immiscible with cholesterol in <b>surface</b> <b>films.</b> When pi less than pie, {{as in the case}} of spread films, we deduce that two surface phases may coexist; the composition of the phases will depend on chi(CHOL). When 0 less than chi(CHOL) less than 0. 33, both lecithin and 2 : 1 complex coexist, and when 0. 33 less than chi(CHOL) less than 1. 0, 2 : 1 complex and cholesterol coexist. The "condensing" effect of cholesterol in lecithin <b>surface</b> <b>films</b> is reexamined. The effect is attributed to formation of the lecithin:cholesterol 2 : 1 complex and nonequilibrium conditions in the two-phase <b>surface</b> <b>film...</b>|$|R
