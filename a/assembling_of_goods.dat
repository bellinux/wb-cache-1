40|$|The {{sharing of}} {{different}} stages of manufacturing processes between countries is of major and growing importance. However, due to previous deficiencies in the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC) Revision 1 system {{it was not possible}} to differentiate between two key elements of this process- that involving international trade in components and parts as opposed to the exchange of fully fabricated manufactured goods. Such a distinction was needed in order to empirically estimate the size of global production sharing. Changes in the SITC classification system (Revision 2) now allow one to approximate how much production sharing occurs within the key machinery and transportation equipment (SITC 7) group which includes approximately 50 percent of world trade in all manufactures. In 1995, OECD exports of parts and components in this group totalled $ 440 billion which was about 30 percent of all shipments (components plus <b>assembled</b> <b>goods)</b> <b>of</b> machinery and transportation equipment. The data also show that developing countries produced and exported an additional $ 100 billion of these products- which indicates global exports were in excess of one-half trillion dollars. However, the extent of product sharing is clearly larger tha...|$|R

40|$|As firms {{increasingly}} {{consider the}} heterogeneity of customers’ needs as a business opportunity rather than a problem, Mass Customization {{is becoming more and}} more popular in industry and academia alike. Despite much has been written on the topic, little progress has been made in terms of identifying which strategic capabilities a firm has to develop when pursuing Mass Customization. Starting from this premise, the present paper sets forth a theoretically-motivated re-conceptualization of the requisite strategic capabilities for Mass Customization, namely Solution Space Definition Capability, Robust Process and Supply Chain Design Capability and Choice Simplification Capability. The proposed re-conceptualization is operationalized as a formative indicator of Mass Customization in the context <b>of</b> <b>assembled</b> <b>goods</b> and empirically validated with a multiple indicators-multiple causes (MIMIC) model in a sample of 238 companies from 8 countries operating in the automotive, machinery and electronics industries. Results of the MIMIC model provide empirical support for the proposed re-conceptualization. We conclude by discussing the advantages of the proposed re-conceptualization and, borrowing from the Resource-Based View of the firm, we illustrate how the proposed conceptualization contributes to explain the sustainability of a Mass Customization-based competitive advantage...|$|R

This acts both as oxygen carrier and antioxidant for those conditions with potentials for ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Another recent novel approach is the <b>assembling</b> <b>of</b> hemoglobin and fibrinogen into a soluble nanodimension polyhemoglobin-fibrinogen complex that acts as an oxygen carrier with platelet-like activity. This is potentially useful in cases of extensive blood loss requiring massive replacement using blood substitutes resulting in the need for platelet and clotting factors replacement.
