Erebus. These recommendations were a factor in the development of enhanced ground proximity warning systems (EGPWS) in the 1990s and terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) with forward-looking capabilities since then. TAWS systems are widely recommended by international airline safety organizations such as the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and TAWS systems were installed in 95% of commercial jets worldwide by 2007.|$|E

2500|$|By {{a decree}} of the Federal Minister for Labour and Social Order, the Federal Institute for Industrial Protection became the Federal Agency for Industrial Protection and Accident Research. Amongst its {{designated}} tasks included {{the promotion of}} industrial protection, <b>accident</b> <b>prevention</b> on the journey {{to and from work}} and <b>accident</b> <b>prevention</b> in the home and leisure activities, the encouragement of training and advanced training in the area of industrial protection, and to promote and coordinate accident research. A regulation was issued in 1972 which permitted {{for the first time the}} employment of women as drivers of trams, omnibuses and lorries, while further regulations laid down new provisions for lifts and work with compressed air. The Factory Constitution Law (1971) strengthened the rights of individual employees [...] "to be informed and to be heard on matters concerning their place of work." [...] The Works Council was provided with greater authority while trade unions were given the right of entry into the factory [...] "provided they informed the employer of their intention to do so," [...] while a law was passed to encourage wider share ownership by workers and other rank-and-file employees. The Industrial Relations Law (1972) and the Personnel Representation Act (1974) broadened the rights of employees in matters which immediately affected their places of work, while also improving the possibilities for codetermination on operations committees, together with access of trade unions to companies.|$|E
2500|$|A law of January 1972 on the {{organization}} of labour in enterprises significantly extended the works council's right of cooperation and co-management {{in the matter of}} vocational training. That same year, the Safety Institute of the Federal Republic of Germany was transformed into a public Federal Agency (Bundesanstalt) with significantly enlarged powers, in the context of which special emphasis would be placed on its new task of promoting and coordinating {{research in the area of}} <b>accident</b> <b>prevention.</b> New provisions were introduced for the rehabilitation of severely disabled people ("Schwerbehinderte") and accident victims. The Severely Disabled Persons Act of April 1974 obliged all employers with more than fifteen employees to ensure that 6% of their workforce consisted of people officially recognised as being severely handicapped. Employers who failed to do so were assessed 100 DM per month for every job falling before the required quota. These compensatory payments were used to [...] "subsidise the adaptation of workplaces to the requirements of those who were severely handicapped." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vette's {{findings}} on the crash of Flight TE-901 were highly influential in advancing air safety and <b>accident</b> <b>prevention</b> in general. In an interview on the Impact Erebus Two videotape, Peter Mahon said, [...] "An overseas expert in jet training and jet operations has said that this report has made the world a safer place to fly in. Well if that is so, that {{is due to the}} persistence of Gordon Vette and the evidence he produced which directed me and counsel of the Royal Commission onto the right path." [...] In particular, Vette introduced the concepts of [...] "human factors" [...] and [...] "organizational accidents" [...] into the language of accident analysis and prevention. These terms still remain in use today as important considerations in airline safety. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) used Vette's report {{as an example of how}} a combination of organizational failures could cause an accident, calling it [...] "10 years ahead of its time" [...] and adding that if its lessons had been heeded, [...] "Chernobyl, Bhopal, Clapham Junction, King’s Cross and certainly the Dryden Report would not have existed".|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{examining}} {{the relationships between the}} effectiveness of safety intervention programmes and implementation strategies in the Nigeria construction industry. Structured questionnaires were distributed to construction stakeholders across some selected states in Nigeria and the data generated were analysed using Pearson’s product moment correlation.

Based on the principles of social ecological theory and UNICEF’s communication for development strategies, this study developed a multilevel safety intervention implementation strategy for construction industries in Nigeria. Four communication strategies, namely, advocacy, social mobilisation, social change communication, and behaviour change communication, which are central to the effectiveness of safety intervention implementation programmes for construction site <b>accidents</b> <b>prevention,</b> were identified. It further revealed that these communication strategies could be individually and collectively applied at different intervention levels but that the greatest effect would be felt when all strategies are systematically combined with more efficient use of resources. The study recommended systematic actions by policy makers, construction organisations, and various community groups towards construction safety interventions, since maximum effect could only be felt when safety interventions are implemented across all levels...|$|R

2500|$|In the United States, two {{organizations}} contribute {{to one of}} the world's lowest aviation accident rates. Mandatory accident investigation is carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board, while the Aviation Safety Reporting System receives voluntary reports to identify deficiencies and provide data for planning improvements. The latter system is confidential and provides reports back to stakeholders without regulatory action. Similarities and contrasts have been noted between the [...] "cultures of safety" [...] in medicine and aviation. Pilots and medical personnel operate in complex environments, interact with technology, and are subject to fatigue, stress, danger, and loss of life and prestige as a consequence of error. Given the enviable record of aviation in <b>accident</b> <b>prevention,</b> a similar medical adverse event system would include both mandatory (for severe incidents) and voluntary non-punitive reporting, teamwork training, feedback on performance and an institutional commitment to data collection and analysis. The Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS) is a program modeled upon the Aviation Safety Reporting System and developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to monitor patient safety through voluntary, confidential reports. [...] Required training in crew resource management (CRM), which focused on team dynamics both inside the cockpit and outside was introduced in the early 1980s after the tragic mishap of United Airlines 173. [...] CRM is considered an effective means of improving safety in aviation and is utilized by the DoD, NASA, and almost all commercial airlines. [...] Many of the tenets of this training have been incorporated into medicine under the guise of , which was introduced by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). [...] The AHRQ calls this program [...] "an evidence-based teamwork system to improve communication and teamwork skills among health care professionals." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1970, the {{government}} drew up an Action Programme for the Promotion of the Rehabilitation of Handicapped Persons. During that same year, bills were tabled to extend and increase housing allowances (passed in 1970), to extend and standardise {{the promotion of}} vocational training (passed in 1971), to automatically index pensions for war victims (passed in 1970), to increase family allowances (passed in 1970), and to reform “shop rules” (which came into force in 1972). In 1974, a bankruptcy allowance was introduced for employed persons when their employers became insolvent. Developments in accident insurance led to the inclusion of schoolchildren, students and children at kindergarten and thus to more widespread measures for <b>accident</b> <b>prevention.</b> In addition, farm and household assistance was introduced as a new service in agricultural accident insurance. A major pension reform law extended the accessibility of pension insurance by providing generous possibilities for backpayments of contributions, while adjustment of currently paid out pensions was brought forward by 6 months. The Rehabilitation and Assimilation Law of 1974 improved and standardised benefits for the disabled, while a law was passed that same year on {{the establishment of an}} additional relief fund for persons employed in agriculture and forestry. The Law on the Improvement of Works’ Old Age Schemes of 1974 brought conditional non-forfeiture of qualifying periods for works pensions as well as the prohibition of cuts in works pensions due to increases in social insurance pensions. In addition, a number of reforms in areas such as civil and consumer rights the environment, education, and urban renewal were carried out. in 1972, a pension reform act was passed which, according to one historical study, ensured that workers “would not suffer financial hardship and could maintain an adequate standard of living after retirement.” In 1973, sickness benefits became available in cases where a parent had to care for a sick child. In March 1974, Social Assistance (SA) was expanded, “concerning family supplements, means test, and certain additional payments.” ...|$|E
