And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E

2500|$|I {{spent the}} whole process in a wheelchair, so {{physically}} I was really frustrated. I think my vocal performance on it is pretty poor. It sounds tired and strained. The saving grace of the album was [...] "Candy Store Rock" [...] and [...] "Achilles Last Stand". The rhythm section on {{that it was so}} inspired ... I was furious with Page and [...] Peter Grant. I was just furious that I couldn't get back to the woman and the children that I loved. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> is all this rock'n'roll worth anything at all? ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{separating}} from Gordon, Jackson cloistered {{herself in}} her home and lived alone for the first time—the first six months she stated she never actually left her house due to being terrified of Gordon seeing her. Weary after her years of public scorn, she didn't {{know what to do}} with her life and was afraid to perform again. Jackson struggled to rebuild her confidence but was plagued with self-doubt, explaining, [...] "I got to the point, [...] where—well, you know in the media they say things like, 'Oh, she can't sing. She has no talent. She can't dance.' I started believing that, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'Oh my God'. And I started thinking, 'Oh gee, how could this happen to me?' How could I start believing this?". After this time she started to perform in Europe and South America occasionally to start making money to pay off the huge debts which Gordon had accumulated in her name while they were married. In the wake of the September 11 attacks Jackson was moved to compose [...] "Free the World". She performed the song for friends to a positive reception. This spurred on Jackson to write more songs, ending up with a full album, Startin' Over.|$|E

[...] Joss Whedon called the film [...] "my number one" [...] and praised its storytelling, structure and depth, concluding, [...] "It works on whatever level you want to bring to it."Republished online as: [...] Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky commented, [...] "I walked out of The Matrix... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'What kind of science fiction movie can people make now?' The Wachowski Brothers basically took all the great sci-fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured." [...] Director M. Night Shyamalan expressed admiration for The Wachowskis, stating, [...] "Whatever you think of The Matrix, every shot is there because of the passion they have! You can see they argued it out!". Actor and screenwriter Simon Pegg said that The Matrix provided [...] "the excitement and satisfaction that [...] failed to inspire. The Matrix seemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking; making wonderful, intelligent use of CGI to augment the on-screen action, striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal. It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen." [...] Director Quentin Tarantino counted The Matrix as one of his twenty favourite movies from 1992 to 2009.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Swedish magazine Bon, Robyn announced that she had plans to release three new albums in 2010. She said, [...] "I got all these great songs so why not? [...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to start putting them out right away." [...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since I actually made a record! <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> of how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, came up with the idea of what if I just start releasing songs, then I can tour them, then I can make some more songs. We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle. It’s a way for me to show that I’m not trying to distance myself from where I come from. It’s still all about the songs." ...|$|E
