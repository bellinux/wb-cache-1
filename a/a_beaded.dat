5|$|Kenyatta {{moved to}} Thika, where he gained {{employment}} with the engineering firm run by Briton John Cook. In this position, he was tasked with fetching the company wages {{from a bank}} in Nairobi, 25 miles away. Kenyatta had to leave his job when he again became seriously ill. He stayed {{at the home of}} his friend Charles Kasaja, located at the Tumutumu Presbyterian mission, in order to recuperate. At the time, the British Empire was involved in World War I, and it had recruited many Kikuyu to serve in the British Army. One of those who joined was Kongo, but he disappeared during the conflict; his family never learned of his fate. Kenyatta did not join the armed forces, and like many Kikuyu he moved to live among the Maasai, who had refused to fight for the British war effort. Kenyatta had an aunt who had married a Maasai chief and began living with her family. He adopted a number of Maasai customs, and took to wearing the Maasai jewellery, including <b>a</b> <b>beaded</b> belt which was known as kinyata in the Kikuyu language.|$|E

25|$|Some of the {{clothing}} that the Crow People decorated with beads included robes, vests, pants, shirts, moccasins and {{various forms of}} celebratory and ceremonial gear. In addition to creating a connection with the land, from which they are a part, the various shapes and colors reflected one's standing and achievements. For example, if a warrior were to slay, wound or disarm an enemy, he would return with a blackened face. The black color would then be incorporated in {{the clothing}} of that man, most likely in his war attire. <b>A</b> <b>beaded</b> robe, which was often given to a bride to be, could take over a year to produce and was usually created by the bride's mother-in-law or another female relative-in-law. These robes were often characterized {{by a series of}} parallel horizontal lines, usually consisting of light blue. The lines represented the young women's new role as a wife and mother; also the new bride was encouraged to wear the robe at the next ceremonial gathering to symbolize her addition and welcoming to a new family. In modern times the Crow still often decorate their clothing with intricate bead designs for powwow and everyday clothing.|$|E

25|$|The video {{begins with}} a small boy and girl playing on a {{playground}} together, teasingly pushing each other around. The young girl {{is intended to be}} Clarkson as a child, presumably with her young male best friend. The boy hands her <b>a</b> <b>beaded</b> necklace, which she puts on admiringly. The shot closes in on the necklace, then pulls back to reveal it's still worn as a bracelet on the wrist of now-adult Clarkson, her boyfriend (played by Houston Rhines) shows up at her apartment door, presumably after an argument. Clarkson teases him with a set of keys, which she then throws down the toilet. The two are then shown sitting on a couch, reading magazines, when Clarkson grabs her boyfriend's magazine. The two are shown throwing various possessions of one another out of the apartment window, though in a playful manner. Such items include numerous articles of clothing, magazines, a guitar (which Clarkson tries to stop him throwing out), and a fishbowl (with the fish being taken out and put in a glass first, after which they look out the window). After throwing these items out the window, the two are seen sitting affectionately on the couch. Clarkson and her boyfriend are shown still fighting and bickering as they did as children, over the TV Guide and remote control. The latter portion of the video shows the two driving in a first generation Ford Bronco (with the necklace/bracelet hanging from the rear view mirror), eventually getting into an argument. Distracted by the tiff over directions, the Bronco nearly ends up in a head-on collision with an approaching car. After spinning out to avoid the crash, Clarkson simply grabs her boyfriend and pulls him into a kiss, where the video ends.|$|E

500|$|Weinman {{arrived at}} the Mint on [...] [...] He left with two pattern half dollars and {{instructions}} {{to reduce the size}} of the figure of Liberty. [...] Barber appealed to Joyce for permission to make major changes to Weinman's design, but this was initially refused. [...] However, when an additional change by Weinman failed to eliminate the fin problem, Joyce gave in and allowed Barber a free hand.

[...] Cher emerged as a fashion trendsetter in the 1960s, popularizing [...] "hippie fashion with bell-bottoms, bandanas, and Cherokee-inspired tunics". She began working as a model in 1967 for photographer Richard Avedon after then-Vogue magazine editor Diana Vreeland discovered her at a party for Jacqueline Kennedy that year. Avedon took the controversial photo of Cher in <b>a</b> <b>beaded</b> and feathered nude gown for the cover of Time magazine in 1975. Through her 1970s television shows, she became a sex symbol with her inventive and revealing Bob Mackie-designed outfits, and fought the network censors to bare her navel. Although Cher has been erroneously attributed to being the first woman to expose her navel on television, she was the most prominent to do so since the establishment of the American Code of Practices for Television Broadcasters in 1951, which prompted network censors to ban navel exposure on U.S. television. People dubbed Cher the [...] "pioneer of the belly beautiful". In 1972, after she was featured on the annual [...] "Best Dressed Women" [...] lists, Mackie stated: [...] "There hasn't been a girl like Cher since Dietrich and Garbo.
