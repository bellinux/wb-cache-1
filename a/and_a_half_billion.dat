5|$|The {{interdisciplinary}} state commission includes {{officials from}} the Bulgarian ministries of defence, economy and finance and, according to the caretaker government's deputy prime minister and minister of defence Stefan Yanev, {{the main reason for}} choosing the Swedish contestant is the favourable financial terms offered by Saab, including a lease option and offset agreements. In his words, the Swedish offer accounts for about one billion BGN for the aircraft alone ($834 million), while the US/Portuguese one accounts a price of about one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>billion</b> BGN for the aircraft alone. The decision is pending the approval of the next regular Bulgarian government and, more importantly, of the Bulgarian Parliament. The second-place offer is to be retained as a back-up option, should the negotiations with Saab not be concluded successfully, as the financial resources for this program are budgeted until the end of 2017. The new fighters are to replace both the MiG-29 fighters of Graf Ignatievo Air Base and the Su-25 attack aircraft of Bezmer Air Base, as well as to fill the gap left by the retirement of the country's dedicated Su-22 reconnaissance airplanes.|$|E

60|$|And now {{notice the}} {{peculiar}} relation that {{is set up}} between the monopolist's production and the satisfaction of human wants. In proportion as the quantity produced is increased the lower must the price be set in order to sell the whole output. If the monopolist insisted on turning out {{more and more of}} his goods, the price that people would give would fall until it barely covered the cost, then till it was less than cost, then to a mere fraction of the cost and finally to nothing at all. In other words, if one produces a large enough quantity of anything it becomes worthless. It loses all its value just as soon as there is enough of it to satisfy, and over-satisfy the wants of humanity. Thus if the world produces three <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>billion</b> bushels of wheat it can be sold, let us say, at two dollars a bushel; but if it produced twice as much it might well be found that it would only sell for fifty cents a bushel. The value of the bigger supply as a total would actually be less than that of the smaller. And if the supply were big enough it would be worth, in the economic sense, just nothing at all. This peculiarity is spoken of in economic theory as the paradox of value. It is referred to in the older books either as an economic curiosity or as a mere illustration in extreme terms of the relation of supply to price. Thus in many books the story is related of how the East India Companies used at times deliberately to destroy a large quantity of tea in order that by selling a lesser amount they might reap a larger profit than by selling a greater.|$|E
