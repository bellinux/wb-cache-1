5|$|Mickiewicz {{spent his}} {{childhood}} in Navahrudak, initially taught by his mother and private tutors. From 1807 to 1815 he attended a Dominican school following a curriculum that had been designed by the now-defunct Polish Commission for National Education, which had been the world's first ministry of education. He was <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> student, although active in games, theatricals, and the like.|$|E
5|$|After several disappointing seasons, Coughlin {{retired after}} the end of the 2015 season as head coach and {{replaced}} with previous offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo. McAdoo brought the Giants to an 11-5 record and their first playoff berth since 2011 with a much improved defense (despite <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> offense). He was the first Giants coach since Jim Fassel in 1997 to bring them to the playoffs in his first year as head coach. On December 11, 2016, during a Sunday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys, McAdoo was fined $200,000 for illegally using a walkie talkie on the field.|$|E

50|$|A close {{collaborator}} of party leader Georges Marchais, {{he was chosen}} to be the PCF's candidate in the 1988 presidential election. <b>A</b> rather <b>mediocre</b> public speaker, Lajoinie {{proved to be an}} uncharismatic candidate, and was lampooned by humorists who caricatured him as a dimwit. His voting share of 6.8% was considered <b>an</b> unusually <b>mediocre</b> result for PCF standards. Lajoinie retired from active politics in 2002.|$|R
5|$|In February 1946, Brown {{was posted}} to the Operations Division of the Air Training Command at Barksdale Field, Louisiana, {{where he served}} under Major General Alvin C. Kincaid and his Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations, Brigadier General Thomas C. Darcy. For the first time, Brown {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> effectiveness report. In December 1946 he joined Headquarters Air Defense Command at Mitchel Field, New York, as assistant to Air Chief of Staff, Operations, and later as chief of its ROTC branch. On 1 July 1947 he became assistant deputy for operations.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{attended}} the selective Melbourne High School, where Australian test captain Bill Woodfull was his mathematics teacher. Miller was <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> student, which disappointed Woodfull; however, Woodfull quickly noticed Miller's cricket skills. Aged 14, Miller {{was selected for}} the school's first XI, scoring 44. His control and solidity prompted the spectators to call him The Unbowlable—Woodfull's own nickname. In 1934, Miller failed all of his subjects, scoring zero in his final exam for Woodfull's geometry class, {{and was forced to}} repeat the year.|$|E
5|$|Released in July 1968, Thunderbird 6 had <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> {{reception}} at the box office, which ruled out the production of further sequels in the Thunderbirds film series. Critical response has remained mixed: although the special effects have been praised, commentators are divided {{on the quality of}} the plotting, which is considered either well-paced and concluding on a note of high action, or confusing and inordinately long, with little visual spectacle to contrast with the dialogue. Nevertheless, Thunderbird 6 is viewed favourably in comparison to Jonathan Frakes' 2004 film adaptation, receiving praise for the perceived agelessness of its entertainment value.|$|E

5|$|Smith's salary rose to over $1.4 million, but he {{followed}} his 1988 season with <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> 1989, finishing with his worst ERA in five years. For the seventh consecutive season, his number of innings pitched decreased or remained the same. However, he compiled 12.23 strikeouts per nine innings, nearly two higher {{than any other}} season of his career. It was also {{the last of his}} four seasons with more than 10 strikeouts per nine innings.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiplayer}} component was criticized, with Polygon {{calling it}} one of the least necessary multiplayer additions to a typically single-player experience. The gameplay was described as <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> shooter, incapable of supporting the necessary use of guns by its villains and with poor control of movement. GameSpot noted that poor weapon accuracy and movement controls made the thugs seem weak and inept, while playing as the heroes lacked empowerment because of more restrictive combat ability and less resistance to damage. Other reviewers called the experience fun and hectic, but lacking sufficient depth to retain long-term interest.|$|E
5|$|After {{screening}} at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival on October 20, 2007, Boogeyman 2 {{was released}} direct-to-video in the United States on January 8, 2008; {{it was later}} released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered {{it to be a}} general improvement over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human-like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was preferable to monsters in other contemporary creature features, including the previous film. Despite <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> commercial performance, recouping slightly less than its budget, the film received a sequel, Boogeyman 3, the following year.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Ted was {{frequently}} uprooted as {{his family moved}} among Bronxville, New York, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Palm Beach, Florida, and the Court of St. James's in London, England. His formal education started at Gibbs School, in Sloane Street, Kensington, London. He attended ten different schools {{by the age of}} eleven, with his education suffering as a result. Ted was an altar boy at the St. Joseph's Church and received his First Communion from Pope Pius XII in the Vatican at age seven. Ted spent sixth and seventh grades in the Fessenden School, where he was <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> student, and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School; both schools were in Massachusetts. His parents were affectionate toward him as the youngest child, but also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers.|$|E
5|$|Butler {{got off to}} <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> start, losing {{twice in}} the 76 Classic 82–73 to 22nd-ranked Minnesota and to 19th-ranked Clemson 70–69.

Butler won its next two games before falling to 13th-ranked Georgetown 72–65 in the Jimmy V Classic. The team won its next two games beating #15 Ohio State 74–66 and edging out former conference rival Xavier 69–68, both at home. After losing 67–57 at UAB three days later, Butler stood at 9–4 and {{fell out of the}} AP rankings. However, the team {{remained}} in the Coaches Poll at #23.|$|E
5|$|Charles Edward Greene {{was born}} September 24, 1946, in Temple, Texas. He played high school {{football}} at Dunbar High School in Temple. Despite Greene's talents, the Dunbar Panthers had <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> record, {{and he was not}} heavily recruited by colleges. His options were limited further due to segregation of the Southwest Conference. He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now University of North Texas), where he played on the varsity team from 1966 to 1968. He led the team to a 23–5–1 record during his three seasons. In his 29 games at defensive tackle, North Texas State held the opposition to 2,507 yards gained on 1,276 rushes, a per-carry average of less than two yards. Greene was a three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference selection.|$|E

5|$|Distributed in most territories by 20th Century Fox, The Great Silence was theatrically {{released}} to <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> commercial reception in Italy, but it fared better in other countries. The film was withheld from release in the United States until 2001, {{when it was}} made available on DVD by Fantoma Films and Image Entertainment. Controversial for its bleak and dark tone, the film's reputation grew, and it gained a cult following {{in the wake of}} its release. The Great Silence is now widely regarded by fans and authorities on Spaghetti Westerns {{as one of the greatest}} films of the genre, and is acknowledged as Corbucci's masterpiece. Praise has gone to the acting, the utilization of snowbound landscapes, Ennio Morricone's score, and the film's subversion of several conventions of the Western film genre.|$|E
5|$|Due to pancreatitis, Crozier {{played only}} 58 out of 70 {{games for the}} Red Wings in 1966–67. His numbers were down as he won only 22 games and {{recorded}} a 3.35 GAA. The Red Wings missed the playoffs. After another bout of pancreatitis {{at the beginning of}} the 1967–68 season, Crozier announced his retirement due to stress and depression. His announcement was short-lived as after six weeks, he returned to hockey. Before re-joining the Red Wings, Crozier played five games with the Fort Worth Wings of the Central Professional Hockey League (CPHL) as conditioning. Crozier spent two more seasons on <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> Red Wings team before being traded to the newly formed Buffalo Sabres in 1970.|$|E

Despite the fact that Berg was <b>a</b> <b>mediocre,</b> third-string catcher, he was invited at the last minute to make the trip. Among the items Berg took with him to Japan were a 16-mm Bell & Howell movie camera and a letter from MovietoneNews, a New York City newsreel production company with which Berg had contracted to film the sights of his trip. When the team arrived in Japan, he gave a welcome speech in Japanese and also addressed the legislature.|$|E

5|$|In 1848, {{at the age}} of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was {{admitted}} to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Leigh and Laurence Olivier {{performed}} {{two plays}} about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra and George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a {{season at the}} Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> talent that forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.|$|E

Playing against New South Wales, he hammered three sixes in one over and made 153 of a 271-run partnership with Merv Harvey in just over three hours, setting up an innings victory. Bill Ponsford said that it was the hardest hitting he had ever seen. The Third Test was Miller's first in his home town. He had <b>a</b> <b>mediocre</b> game in a drawn match, scoring 33 and 34, and taking two wickets.|$|E
