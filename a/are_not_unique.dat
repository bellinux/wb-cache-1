5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts {{for the first}} few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild symptoms that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled {{his work with}} a feeling of empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form to express his political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E
5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E

5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted green pigeon <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> among pigeons, {{but are also}} seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the speckled pigeon (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E

25|$|Subsequent studies (and more {{specimens}} of Microraptor) {{have shown that}} the features used to distinguish Cryptovolans <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>unique,</b> but are present to varying degrees across various specimens. In a review by Phil Senter and colleagues in 2004, the scientists suggested that all these features represented individual variation across various age groups of a single Microraptor species, making the name Cryptovolans pauli and Microraptor gui junior synonyms of Microraptor zhaoianus. Many other researchers, including Alan Feduccia and Tom Holtz, have since supported its synonymy.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} elements of the Vestal costume include the stola and the vittae. It {{is important to note}} that these two items are closely related to the traditional attire of Roman brides and the Roman matron, and therefore <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> to the Vestals. The vittae that the Vestals wore was a cloth ribbon worn in the Vestals’ hair. It is closely associated with status of Roman matron. Vittae were worn by a wider range of woman at different stages of life and therefore cannot be accepted as unique to just one stage. Unmarried girls, matrons, as well as the Vestal virgins all wore them.|$|E

25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae form large colonies (>0.5cm) after 24 {{hours of}} incubation, and produce haemolysis on blood agar; SDSD is alpha-haemolytic, whereas SDSE is {{predominantly}} beta-haemolytic. They are facultative anaerobic, incapable of respiratory metabolism, but are aerotolerant. Growth {{is enhanced by}} incubation in 5% CO2 atmosphere, but they usually grow adequately in ambient air. The optimum temperature for growth is approximately 37° Celsius. Lancefield group C and G carbohydrate antigens are predominantly expressed, but group A and L have been documented. However, the above characteristics <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> to S.dysgalactiae, and further testing is required to confirm the species identity. Although many laboratories currently identify bacteria by mass-spectrometry (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/ionization Time Of Flight (MALDI TOF MS), phenotypic testing is still widely used. Unlike Streptococcus pyogenes (harbouring Lancefield group A antigen), S.dysgalactiae is PYR-negative and Bacitracin resistant. The distinction from the Streptococcus anginosus group (Lancefield A, C, G or F) {{can be made by}} colony size and Voges Proskauer test (VP); the S.anginosus group being VP positive. Streptococcus equi contains Lancefield group C, and Streptococcus canis harbours group G, but unlike S.dysgalactiae, they are both Hyaluronidase negative.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{arguing that the}} rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory {{point out that the}} symptoms of the Black Death <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>unique</b> (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves. Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.|$|E
