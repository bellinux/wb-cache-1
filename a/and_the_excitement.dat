25|$|The capable {{coaching}} of John Kennedy aside, the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s were lean {{years for the}} Kangaroos. However, the rebuilding of the club was taking place. The Krakouer brothers (Jim and Phil) brought a spark into the side and lifted many hopes for North supporters <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> to the general football public. The innovative idea of night games was instigated by the club and meeting the challenges, the club survived. One major highlight was the recruitment of forward John Longmire in 1989, who topped the club goalkicking over five consecutive seasons (1990–1994) and won the Coleman medal in 1990 with 98 goals. At {{the beginning of the}} 1993 season, in a dramatic and controversial move, the board of the club sacked coach and long-time player Wayne Schimmelbusch, and appointed Denis Pagan in his place. Results were immediate, as North reached the finals {{for the first time in}} nearly a decade.|$|E

Boatswain William Cole testified that Heywood had been detained on the ship against his will. Ship's carpenter William Purcell thought that Heywood's ambiguous behaviour during the critical hours—he had been seen unwittingly resting his {{hand on top of}} a cutlass—was due to his youth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> of the moment, and that he had no hand in the uprising itself. On the other hand, Midshipman John Hallett reported that Bligh, with a bayonet at his breast and his hands tied, had addressed a remark to Heywood who had [...] "laughed, turned round and walked away". Another midshipman, Thomas Hayward, claimed he had asked Heywood his intentions and been told by the latter that he would remain with the ship, from which Hayward assumed that his messmate had sided with the mutineers.|$|E
500|$|The manga {{has been}} praised for its fast-paced action, which [...] "epitomizes the action genre", {{according}} to Anime News Network's Carlo Santos.

Writing for Manga Life, Michael Aronson commended it for having a restrained pace, layout and action scenes, calling it [...] "more western" [...] than Japanese because of it. Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime commented that Black Cat [...] "knows how to pack the action <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> to good effect, visuals and nail-biting suspense." [...] Sheena McNeil stressed that despite its flaws the series' action [...] "makes it all worth reading." [...] Ken Haley of Pop Culture Shock said that [...] "writing and characterization-wise" [...] it is a typical shōnen manga. Santos, Hoffman and McNeil criticized its plot for being [...] "predictable", clichéd, and [...] "not terribly original" [...] respectively. Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin called it [...] "an easy going version of Bleach", while Hoffman found it reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop, and McNeil compared it to Dragon Ball Z.|$|E

[...] Neubauer and literary critic Harold Bloom both consider {{it one of the}} best poems in the volume. [...] The poem was featured in the motion picture Poetic Justice (1993), directed by John Singleton. Bloom calls it a [...] "hymn-like poem to woman's beauty". [...] Angelou [...] "skillfully engages" [...] in some word-play with the word [...] "". [...] As Angelou often does in her poetry, [...] "Phenomenal Woman" [...] is paired with the one that follows it, [...] "Men", in which Angelou uses a raw egg metaphor to contrast dominant masculinity with fragile and cautious femininity. [...] She celebrates both [...] "her slightly mysterious power" [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> created by men. [...] The poem is characteristic of Angelou's style, with terse and forceful lines and irregular rhymes. The short and often monosyllabic words, as Neubauer states, [...] "create an even, provocative rhythm that resounds with underlying confidence". [...] Angelou said that she wrote the poem for all women, regardless of their race or appearance. She also stated, [...] "Now, I know men are phenomenal, but they have to write their own poem".|$|E

500|$|On October 2, 1938, Feller was the {{starting}} pitcher against the Detroit Tigers. Detroit's Hank Greenberg was {{two home runs}} short of Babe Ruth's then-single-season record of 60 home runs. By the ninth inning, Feller had recorded 16 strikeouts, one fewer than the MLB record in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when he struck out Detroit's Pete Fox and passed it, to set a modern major league record of 18 strikeouts, when he struck out Chet Laabs {{for the fifth time}} that day. Greenberg said, [...] "Feller's curve was jumping wickedly and with that and his fast ball, he was murder." [...] Feller did not earn a win, however, as the Indians lost, 4–1. [...] "It was one of those days when everything feels perfect, your arm, your coordination, your concentration, everything. There was drama in the air because of Greenberg's attempt to break Ruth's record, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> grew even greater when my strikeouts started to add up", Feller said. For the 1938 season, Feller led all pitchers with 208 walks and 240 strikeouts. In 1939, Feller received his first career Opening Day start against the Tigers after a match against the Browns was rained out. He won the game 5–1, after allowing three hits. On Mother's Day, Feller pitched against the Chicago White Sox with his family in attendance. One pitch was fouled off by Marv Owen into the seats and into the face of Feller's mother; he {{went on to win the}} game. Feller finished the 1939 season having led the AL in wins (24), complete games (24) and innings pitched (296.2) and led the majors for a second consecutive year in both walks (142) and strikeouts (246).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a quantitative measure of <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> of sports games. This measure {{can be thought}} of as the variability of the expectancy of winning as a game progresses. We illustrate <b>the</b> concept of <b>excitement</b> at soccer games for which the theoretical win expectancy can be well approximated from a Poisson model of scoring. We show that in the Poisson model, higher scoring rates lead to increased expected excitement. Given a particular strength of a team, the most exciting games are expected with opponents who are slightly stronger. We apply this theory to the FIFA World Cup 2006 games, where the winning expectancy was independently estimated by betting markets. Thus it was possible to compute <b>the</b> expected <b>and</b> <b>the</b> realized <b>excitement</b> of each given game from the trading data. ...|$|R

2500|$|During that busy year, Remington became further {{immersed}} in military matters, inventing {{a new type}} of ammunition carrier; but his patented invention was not accepted for use by the War Department. His favorite subject for magazine illustration was now military scenes, though he admitted, [...] "Cowboys are cash with me". Sensing the political mood of that time, he was looking forward to a military conflict which would provide the opportunity to be a heroic war correspondent, giving him both new subject matter <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> of battle. [...] He was growing bored with routine illustration, and he wrote to Howard Pyle, the dean of American illustrators, that he had [...] "done nothing but potboil of late".

2500|$|Josephine wrote {{much later}} that [...] "The fear <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement,</b> the weeks of {{exhausting}} travel, chagrin over my own foolishness, all together proved {{too much for}} my strength.

[...] If Josephine, as she said, left San Francisco at age 18, it's unclear why she would still be attending school upon her return two years later. Like cerebral meningitis, St. Vitus Dance is a form of a streptococcus infection. The symptoms of St. Vitus Dance and meningitis are somewhat different, but both can be contracted from the same strain of bacteria through saliva. Both of Behan's children, Henrietta and Albert, were ill with meningitis around 1877, and in July of that year, Henrietta died from the disease.|$|E

[...] Less narrative and descriptive than McGee’s, McGready’s accounts focused on the chronological unfolding of events. [...] McGready’s Calvinist beliefs prevented him from pronouncing with certainty that a person had been converted; he believed that only God knew for sure, but he made attempts, judging by the evidence at hand, to count the conversions {{that began in the}} summer sacraments of 1800. [...] The numbers showed an accumulating and broadening effect: [...] In June at Red River, ten were converted; in July at Gasper River, 45, as well as some Tennessee youths who returned home and encouraged the experience of “real religion” among twenty of their friends and neighbors. [...] The Gasper River event hosted people from as distant as one hundred miles away. [...] Thirteen wagons were employed to transport people and supplies, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>excitement</b> was so great that some stayed at the meeting house through the night.
