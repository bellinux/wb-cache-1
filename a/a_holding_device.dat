50|$|Non-patent duck calls {{may have}} been made as early as 1850, but the first patent was awarded to Elam Fisher in 1870. In 1863, Fred Allen had created {{external}} duck calls, but {{did not have a}} patent. Allen’s calls were barrel calls with straight tone boards and curved reeds. His most unusual call was the “Allen Nickel-Plated Duck Caller” which was made of metal but froze to the hunters’ lips and had to be re-made using wood. Fisher was famous for the production of his Tongue Pincher Duck Calls which were made of two pieces of curved wood facing each other with a metal reed sandwiched between them and <b>a</b> <b>holding</b> <b>device</b> (usually a band) holding it all together. Tongue Pinchers had limited tone range and often cut the hunters’ tongues and mouths. Fred Allen was the first to sell his duck calls commercially and began advertisements in 1880. David Fuller was the first to receive the patent for the goose call in 1885 and impacted the duck hunting world in 1903 with his combination goose/duck call. This call had a screw that retracted from inside the barrel which changed the sounds that were produced. In the early 1890s a blacksmith by the name of Victor Glodo Jr. began producing duck calls, he is credited with the barrel shape, his signature copper reeds and using the “duck wing” checkered pattern. Glodo Jr.’s most well-known production is the Reelfoot Lake Style duck call.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{study was}} to {{determine}} the feasibility and safety of truly stentless aortic valve replacement with bovine pericardium sutured directly onto the aortic wall by using <b>a</b> <b>holding</b> <b>device.</b> Methods: Seven patients with pronounced aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease who underwent aortic valve leaflets plasty with a xenopericardial patch by means of <b>a</b> <b>holding</b> <b>device</b> combined with CABG were recruited. Results: The aortic valve was successfully re-paired in 7 patients. A normal function of the valve was confirmed by echocardiographic data obtained in all patients. No complications were observed during follow-up. Mean hospital stay was 17 (13; 35) days. No reoperation for the aortic valve was performed during follow-up. Hospital mortality was 0 %. Mean follow-up was 759 days. Long-term survival rate was 86 %. Freedom from structural valve deterioration, thromboembolism, endocarditis and reoperation ran to 100 %. The peak gradient across the aortic valve in the late period was 30 (26; 42) mm Hg, peak speed amounted to 3 (2. 8; 3. 2), mean aortic regurgitation grade was 1 ± 0. 1 degree. Conclusion: Truly stentless xenopericardial aortic valve replacement is a good alternative to standard aortic valve replacement. This method is safe with regard to freedom from reoperations, degenerative valve changes, thromboembolism, endocarditis in the early and late postoperative periods. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this study, we used an {{in vitro}} model {{to test the}} {{capacity}} of tissue transglutaminase to increase the adhesive strength at a cartilage-cartilage interface. Full-thickness cartilage-bone cylinders were prepared from fresh adult bovine shoulder joints, and the superficial half of the hyaline cartilage was then removed to provide a plane surface. Tissue transglutaminase {{was applied to the}} freshly cut surface of one cylinder, and a calcium-chloride solution (to act as an activating agent) was applied to that of the other. The cartilage surfaces were immediately apposed, {{one on top of the}} other, and an eighty-gram weight was applied to the upper cylinder for ten minutes at 37 degrees Celsius under defined humidity conditions. A measured force was then applied transversely to the upper cylinder until it was displaced from the lower one (which was clamped in <b>a</b> <b>holding</b> <b>device),</b> and the force recorded at this point was taken as a measure of the adhesive strength achieved at the cartilage-cartilage interface.

40|$|Purpose: Implant-abutment {{connections}} {{still present}} {{failures in the}} oral cavity due to the loosening of mechanical integrity by detorque and corrosion of the abutment screws. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the detorque of dental abutment screws before and after immersion in fluoridated solutions. Materials and Methods: Five commercial implant-abutment assemblies were assessed in this investigation: (C) Conex˜aoR, (E) EmfilsR, (I) INPR, (S) SINR, and (T) Titanium FixR. The implants were embedded in an acrylic resin and then placed in <b>a</b> <b>holding</b> <b>device.</b> The abutments were first connected to the implants and torqued to 20 Ncm using a handheld torque meter. The detorque values of the abutments were evaluated after 10 minutes. After applying a second torque of 20 Ncm, implant-abutment assemblies were withdrawn every 3 hours for 12 hours in a fluoridated solution over a period of 90 days. After that period, detorque of the abutments was examined. Scanning electronicmicroscopy (SEM) associated to energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was applied to inspect the surfaces of abutments. Results: Detorque values of systems C, E, and I immersed in the fluoridated solution were significantly higher than those of the initial detorque. ANOVA demonstrated no significant differences in detorque values between designs S and T. Signs of localized corrosion could not be detected by SEM although chemical analysis by EDS showed the presence of elements involved in corrosive processes. Conclusion: An increase of detorque values recorded on abutments after immersion in fluoridated artificial saliva solutions was noticed in this study. Regarding chemical analysis, such an increase of detorque can result from a corrosion layer formed between metallic surfaces at static contact in the implant-abutment joint during immersion in the fluoridated solutions. capes e cnp...|$|E
