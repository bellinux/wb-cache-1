5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full <b>agonist,</b> as it competes with the full <b>agonist</b> for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full <b>agonist</b> alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial <b>agonist</b> will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal <b>agonist</b> is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial <b>agonist</b> of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
5|$|The {{affinity}} of an antagonist for its {{binding site}} (Ki), i.e. {{its ability to}} bind to a receptor, will determine the duration of inhibition of <b>agonist</b> activity. The affinity of an antagonist can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in radioligand binding studies using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Schild regression {{can be used to}} determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non-competitive and Ki determination is independent of the affinity, efficacy or concentration of the <b>agonist</b> used. However, it is important that equilibrium has been reached. The effects of receptor desensitization on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account. The affinity constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects, such as in competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising <b>agonist</b> binding, cannot be analyzed using Schild regression. Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an <b>agonist</b> alone compared to the EC50 {{in the presence of a}} competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve. Altering the amount of antagonist used in the assay can alter the dose ratio. In Schild regression, a plot is made of the log (dose ratio-1) versus the log concentration of antagonist for a range of antagonist concentrations. The affinity or Ki is where the line cuts the x-axis on the regression plot. Whereas, with Schild regression, antagonist concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, <b>agonist</b> concentrations are varied. Affinity for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng-Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki (affinity constant for an antagonist) from the shift in IC50 that occurs during competitive inhibition. The Cheng-Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering <b>agonist</b> concentration and <b>agonist</b> affinity for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists.|$|E
5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} receptor <b>agonist</b> on a {{wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial <b>agonist</b> or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known to be involved in the development of migraine headaches.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to μ-opioid {{receptor}} (MOR) <b>agonists,</b> KOR <b>agonists</b> are potently analgesic, {{and have}} been employed clinically {{in the treatment of}} pain. However, KOR <b>agonists</b> also produce side effects such as dysphoria, hallucinations, and dissociation, which has limited their clinical usefulness. Examples of KOR <b>agonists</b> that have been used medically as analgesics include butorphanol, nalbuphine, levorphanol, levallorphan, pentazocine, phenazocine, and eptazocine. Difelikefalin (CR845, FE-202845) and CR665 (FE-200665, JNJ-38488502) are peripherally restricted KOR <b>agonists</b> lacking the CNS side effects of centrally active KOR <b>agonists</b> and are currently under clinical investigation as analgesics.|$|R
40|$|Although TLR 7 and TLR 8 are phylogenetically and {{structurally}} related, {{their relative}} functions are largely unknown. The role of TLR 7 {{has been established}} using TLR 7 -deficient mice and small molecule TLR 7 <b>agonists.</b> The absence of TLR 8 -selective <b>agonists</b> has hampered {{our understanding of the}} role of TLR 8. In this study TLR <b>agonists</b> selective for TLR 7 or TLR 8 were used to determine the repertoire of human innate immune cells that are activated through these TLRs. We found that TLR 7 <b>agonists</b> directly activated purified plasmacytoid dendritic cells and, to a lesser extent, monocytes. Conversely, TLR 8 <b>agonists</b> directly activated purified myeloid dendritic cells, monocytes, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (GM-CSF/IL- 4 /TGF-�). Accordingly, TLR 7 -selective <b>agonists</b> were more effective than TLR 8 -selective <b>agonists</b> at inducing IFN-�- and IFN-regulated chemokines such as IFN-inducible protein and IFN-inducible T cell � chemoattractant from human PBMC. In contrast, TLR 8 <b>agonists</b> were more effective than TLR 7 <b>agonists</b> at inducing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-�, IL- 12, and MIP- 1 �. Thus, this study demonstrated that TLR 7 and TLR 8 <b>agonists</b> differ in their target cell selectivity and cytokine induction profile. Th...|$|R
50|$|Pridopidine is {{less likely}} to produce {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms, such as akinesia (inability to initiate movement) and akathisia (inability to remain motionless), than dopamine antagonists (such as antipsychotics). Furthermore, pridopidine displays no detectable intrinsic activity, differentiating it from D2 receptor <b>agonists</b> and partial <b>agonists</b> (agents that stimulate receptor responses). Pridopidine, therefore, differs from D2 receptor antagonists, <b>agonists</b> and partial <b>agonists.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ibotenic {{acid and}} {{muscimol}} are structurally {{related to each}} other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA <b>agonist,</b> while ibotenic acid is an <b>agonist</b> of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication. Muscimol is the agent responsible for the majority of the psychoactivity.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the {{receptor}} target and, in general, {{cannot be}} removed; inactivating the receptor {{for the duration}} of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of receptor turnover, the rate of synthesis of new receptors. Phenoxybenzamine is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker—it permanently binds to α adrenergic receptors, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of <b>agonist</b> dose-response curves and a right shift in the curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of <b>agonist</b> will be restored.|$|E
5|$|Prolactinomas {{may respond}} to {{dopamine}} <b>agonist</b> treatment–medication that mimics {{the action of}} dopamine on the lactrotrope cells, usually bromocriptine or cabergoline.

40|$|Targeting the {{complement}} component 3 a receptor (C 3 aR) with selective <b>agonists</b> or antagonists {{is believed}} to be a viable therapeutic option for several diseases such as stroke, heart attack, reperfusion injuries, and rheumatoid arthritis. We designed a number of <b>agonists,</b> partial <b>agonists,</b> and antagonists of C 3 aR using our two-stage de novo protein design framework. Of the peptides tested using a degranulation assay in C 3 aR-transfected rat basophilic leukemia cells, two were prominent <b>agonists</b> (EC 50 values of 25. 3 and 66. 2 nM) and two others were partial <b>agonists</b> (IC 50 values of 15. 4 and 26. 1 nM). Further testing of these lead compounds in a calcium flux assay in U 937 cells yielded similar results although with reduced potencies compared to transfected cells. The partial <b>agonists</b> also displayed full antagonist activity when tested in a C 3 aR inhibition assay. In addition, the electrostatic potential profile was shown to potentially discriminate between full <b>agonists</b> and partial <b>agonists...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{receptor}} modulator, or receptor ligand, {{is a type}} of drug which binds to and modulates receptors. They are ligands {{and include}} receptor <b>agonists</b> and receptor antagonists, as well as receptor partial <b>agonists,</b> inverse <b>agonists,</b> and allosteric modulators.|$|R
5|$|Apomorphine, a non-orally {{administered}} dopamine <b>agonist,</b> {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} off periods and dyskinesia in late PD. It is administered by intermittent injections or continuous subcutaneous infusions. Since secondary effects such as confusion and hallucinations are common, individuals receiving apomorphine treatment should be closely monitored. Two dopamine agonists that are administered through skin patches (lisuride and rotigotine) and are useful for people in the initial stages and possibly to control off states in those in the advanced state.|$|E
5|$|Baclofen, a GABAB {{receptor}} <b>agonist,</b> {{is under}} {{study for the}} treatment of alcoholism. A 2015 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of baclofen for withdrawal symptoms in alcoholism. There is tentative data supporting baclofen in alcohol dependence however further trials are needed as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an <b>agonist.</b> The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an <b>agonist.</b> Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E
30|$|In {{pathological}} conditions {{associated with}} platelet activation, multiple <b>agonists</b> are generated. In fact, apart from classical strong <b>agonists</b> such as thrombin or collagen, {{there is an}} expanding list of <b>agonists</b> that can contribute to platelet activation. These additional platelet <b>agonists</b> have allowed a re-appreciation of mechanisms and role of platelet activation in vascular inflammation and thrombotic events associated {{with a range of}} infectious and inflammatory conditions [53].|$|R
25|$|The most {{successful}} hormonal treatments are orchiectomy and GnRH <b>agonists.</b> Despite their higher cost, GnRH <b>agonists</b> are often chosen over orchiectomy for cosmetic and emotional reasons.

50|$|New motilin <b>agonists</b> are erythromycin-based; however, {{it may be}} {{that this}} class of drugs becomes redundant. Growth hormone secretagogue receptors share 52% of their DNA with motilin receptors, and <b>agonists</b> of these receptors, termed ghrelins, can bring about similar effects to motilin <b>agonists.</b>|$|R
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes. In enzyme kinetics, the reaction rate is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's kinetics in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its activity is controlled, and how a drug or an <b>agonist</b> might inhibit the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Those with {{relatively}} mild visual field loss or double vision only may be managed conservatively, with close {{observation of the}} level of consciousness, visual fields, and results of routine blood tests. If there is any deterioration, or expected spontaneous improvement does not occur, surgical intervention may still be indicated. If the apoplexy occurred in a prolactin-secreting tumor, this may respond to dopamine <b>agonist</b> treatment.|$|E
5|$|An inverse <b>agonist</b> {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E

40|$|GABAA {{receptor}} <b>agonists</b> {{have previously}} been characterized at human GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The correlation between these data and functional in vivo data of 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisoxazolo[5, 4 -c]pyridin- 3 -ol (THIP) {{has shown that}} THIP is 100 fold more potent in clinical studies than in oocytes. THIP {{and a series of}} <b>agonists</b> (GABA, Isoguvacine), partial <b>agonists</b> (Imidazole acetic acid; P 4 S, 4 -PIOL, thio- 4 -PIOL) and one antagonist (SR 95531) were characterized in the rat cortical wedge preparation using inhibition of spontaneous activity in Mg++ free medium as the measurable parameter. <b>Agonists</b> were in general 40 times more potent in the wedge preparation than at α 1 β 3 γ 2 s containing receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, whereas the antagonist was equipotent under these two conditions. Partial <b>agonists</b> with responses above 6 % at α 1 β 3 γ 2 s containing receptors were full <b>agonists</b> in the rat cortical wedge preparation, whereas partial <b>agonists</b> with maximum responses below 6 % behaved as partial <b>agonists</b> in the rat cortical wedge preparation. These data suggest that {{only a small fraction of}} the GABAA receptors in the rat cortical wedge needs to be activated by GABAA <b>agonists</b> in order to obtain a maximum response.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to ion pumps, ion channels do not build chemical gradients but rather dissipate {{them in order}} to perform work or send a signal. Probably the most familiar and best studied example is the voltage-gated Na+ channel, which allows conduction of an action potential along neurons.
