5|$|After Cersei {{fails to}} appear, Lancel Lannister {{is sent to}} {{retrieve}} her. Lancel follows one of Cersei's spies beneath the Sept, and finds a wildfire cache <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b> He is stabbed in the spine before he can disarm the cache. Inside the Sept, Margaery Tyrell, realizing that Cersei has set a trap, warns the crowd to leave, but the High Sparrow prevents anyone from leaving. The wildfire ignites and destroys the Great Sept, killing everyone inside. King Tommen Baratheon witnesses the explosion from the Red Keep and commits suicide by jumping out a window.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Federation {{starship}} Enterprise. In this episode, telepath Tam Elbrun (Harry Groener) joins the crew to investigate a bio ship detected near a star about to go supernova. As the crew investigates, the Romulans threaten the Enterprise and the creature, Gomtuu, and Elbrun boards it with Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner). As the star is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode,</b> Gomtuu sends Data back to the Enterprise and the two ships out of the system. Gomtuu and Elbrun leave together as the star goes supernova.|$|E
5|$|The game is set during World War II and the {{campaign}} mode is experienced through the perspectives of four soldiers: one in the Red Army, one in the United States Army, and two in the British Army. It contains four individual campaigns, split into three stories, {{with a total of}} twenty-seven missions. Activision officially announced the game on April 7, 2005 in a press release. Many features were added and changed from the original Call of Duty. The most notable change is the regenerating health. Additions include an icon that indicates a nearby grenade <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b>|$|E
25|$|Film scholar Greg Jenkins {{has done}} a {{detailed}} analysis of the adaptation of the novel as a screenplay. The novel is in three parts. The film greatly expands the relatively brief section in Part I, about the boot camp on Parris Island, and essentially discards Part III. This gives the film a twofold structure, telling two largely independent stories connected by the same characters acting in each. Jenkins believes this structure is a development of concepts that Kubrick has had since the 1960s. At that time, Kubrick talked <b>about</b> wanting <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> the usual conventions of narrative structure.|$|R

By its {{structure}} and composition, one Snakewall is more linear in its narration, more gradual and analogue. The {{other one is}} fragmented, unpredictable, closer to digital language code. However, both are fiercely expressive and dramatic, both full of tension, characteristic for the matter that is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> break and <b>explode.</b>|$|R

Miriam reveals why Julian did not come herself—she is pregnant. Theo {{believes}} Julian is deceiving herself, but when the two meet, Julian invites Theo to listen to her baby's heartbeat.|$|R
5|$|After {{the car is}} {{disconnected}} {{from the rest of}} the train on a remote rail siding, Mulder questions the Red-Haired Man, who says that the patient is immune to biological warfare. Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E
5|$|Sovereign {{reveals that}} the Reapers remain outside the Milky Way waiting for organic life to develop and {{discover}} the Mass Relays, before harvesting them when they reach their peak. Afterwards, with the bomb <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode,</b> Shepard hears that Ashley and Kaidan have both been pinned down, and must choose which one to rescue. Shepard also finds Saren, who claims that his allegiance to Sovereign will save organic life forms by demonstrating their usefulness to the Reapers. Liara is then able to pinpoint the Conduit's location back on the Normandy: a Prothean world known as Ilos. There, Shepard learns that the Citadel Station is actually a huge Mass Relay that the Reapers use to invade the galaxy. During the last extinction cycle, a few Protheans survived on Ilos via cryopreservation and then re-entered the Citadel Station via the Conduit, a reverse-engineered miniature Mass Relay disguised aboard the station as a statue. The Protheans sabotaged the Citadel to prevent the Reapers from remotely activating the Citadel Mass Relay. Saren plans to reach the Citadel by using the Conduit to allow Sovereign to activate the Citadel Mass Relay and trigger the Reaper invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode,</b> but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E

50|$|At 01:11, {{just as she}} was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> fire torpedoes, Saumarez was hit. The top of her funnel {{disappeared}} {{over the}} side and a 5in shell penetrated No. 1 Boiler Room, severed a steam main and lodged inside the boiler. Five men were scalded, two of whom died, but as with the 8in shell hits, this shell failed <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> at such close range and was later thrown overboard.|$|R
25|$|A small tug ship detaches {{from the}} Fesarius and tows the Enterprise deep into First Federation space where Balok states he will intern {{the crew and}} destroy the Enterprise. Kirk orders the Enterprise to {{gradually}} resist the tug ship's tractor beam. Just as its engines are <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> from overload, the Enterprise breaks free. This apparently disables the alien vessel, which is unable {{to call for help}} from its mother ship.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 1990 a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA {{exploded}} in the men's toilets behind the visitors' gallery. The area had already been evacuated and nobody was injured. About 30 minutes before the blast at 8:49a.m., a man {{who said he was}} a member of the IRA told Reuters that a bomb had been placed at the exchange and was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode.</b> Police officials said that if there had been no warning, the human toll would have been very high. The explosion ripped a hole in the 23-story building on Threadneedle Street and sent a shower of glass and concrete onto the street. The long term trend towards electronic trading had been reducing the Exchange's status as a visitor attraction and, although the gallery reopened, it was closed permanently in 1992.|$|E

500|$|In Cobb's view, the {{transfer}} of personnel to the yawl may have been intended as a temporary safety measure. He speculated from Deveau's report {{on the state of}} the rigging and ropes that the ship's main halliard may have been used to attach the yawl to the ship, enabling the company to return on board when the danger had passed. If, however, the line had subsequently parted, Mary Celeste would have sailed away empty leaving the yawl to founder with its occupants. Begg notes the illogicality of attaching the yawl to a vessel that the crew thought was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode</b> or sink, while the modern writer Macdonald Hastings asks whether Briggs, an experienced captain, would have effected a panicky abandonment of the ship when, [...] "If the Mary Celeste had blown her timbers, she would still have been a better bet for survival than the ship's boat." [...] If this is what happened, says Hastings, Briggs [...] "...behaved like a fool; worse, a frightened one." ...|$|E
500|$|Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily {{acknowledges}} {{the influence of}} Stockhausen's Zeitmaße (especially on his two wind quintets, Refrains and Choruses and Five Distances) and Gruppen on his work more generally ( [...] ; [...] ). Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the [...] "technical and speculative innovations" [...] of Klavierstücke I–IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter , they nevertheless produced a [...] "sharp emotion, {{the result of a}} beneficial shock engendered by their boldness" [...] and provided [...] "an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations" [...] While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British première of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets—how it always seemed to be <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode,</b> but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core—but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. [...] With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, {{it seems to me that}} the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time[...] [...] [...] I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. [...] In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that [...] "Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course" [...] and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carré, Klavierstück X, Inori, and Jubiläum [...]|$|E

Longshaft nearly kills Kröd, but Grimshank jumps {{in front of the}} blow and dies, telling Kröd with his dying breath that he remains unconvinced Kröd is the golden one. Longshaft becomes disarmed, but Kröd can't bring himself to kill an unarmed man; when Longshaft pulls out a secret dagger and tries to stab him, Aneka throws a sai into his chest and kills him: however, Ralph [...] "remains classy to the end". Kröd confronts Dongalor, who reveals he is Kröd's brother-in-law, having married (and divorced) Kröd's crazy estranged sister. With the Eye of Gulga Grymna <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>explode,</b> Kröd shoves Dongalor and Barnabus aside, accidentally knocking them out a window. Following advice from the disembodied voice of his deceased mentor Arcadius (Roger Allam), Kröd stabs the Eye with his flaming sword, destroying it. Aneka embraces Kröd, although a voice-over narrator reveals she will continue her promiscuous ways. Dongalor and Barnabus have survived by falling into a tree, while Dongalor's bastard son, having survived his father's suicidal task (going on a fishing boat to the middle of a lake with lots of rocks in his pockets knowing he can't swim), pelts them with rocks, and starts chopping down the tree they're in for revenge (the cleverness of which impresses Dongalor enough for him to declare the boy his heir).|$|E
