Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{described}} the album {{as being a}} [...] "soul-satisfying project that won't pay the bills". It was reported in October 2008 that Holley had been conducting workshops {{on the art of}} audition. He drew inspiration from his time on American Idol, as well as his experience with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Queen Latifah. While at Berklee College of Music, he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. [...] "Everyone starts out dreaming, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, and what I want to let people know is {{that there are so many}} jobs out there. My thinking is, if you're a musician and you can make music instead of digging a ditch, make it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{recorded}} at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco on December 7, 2001. War at the Warfield was Slayer's second DVD. Originally set for release on February 11, 2003, and later February 13, 2003, it was delayed several times, due to unspecified [...] "production issues". However, on May 20, 2003, {{it was announced}} that the release would be on June 17, 2003, only to be pushed back once again to July 27. Before the DVD's release, Tom Araya commented, [...] "I don't think it's different than any other Slayer show, you got your kids doing the mosh stuff. They get crazy, they tear the place up. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> the one kid that's tempted to jump off the balcony. Whether he does it or not is another story. When they do, of course they get hurt, but they always insist on staying so they can watch the rest of the show, then they go to the emergency room." [...] On July 25, 2003, four days before its release, MTV announced the DVD's contents.|$|E

"Between the Lines" [...] {{became the}} album's first single; it was {{released}} digitally on the band's Twitter page on March22, later peaking at {{number one on the}} Billboard Rock Songs chart.The music video for [...] "Between the Lines", [...] directed by Christopher Sims, was shot on April11 in Los Angeles, California, and premiered on Fuse TV's Top 20 Countdown on May 7.The song was written by Robert, with a guitar solo written by Dean. Robert was inspired by the 1960s rock groups, The Zombies and The Animals, and who had been picturing [...] "a '60s go-go beat and a girl in a miniskirt" [...] before Weiland changed the song's meaning with his lyrics. Dean commented on how Weiland had turned [...] "Between the Lines" [...] into a love song: [...] "Sometimes we don't feel musically what Scott does lyrically. He took it to an exciting place. It's pretty twisted." [...] Weiland's lyrics reflected on his relationship with his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, and his history with drug abuse. Speaking of the at-times strange lyrics, Weiland cited The Beatles' [...] "I Am the Walrus" [...] as an inspiration. [...] "Sometimes you throw together random words that phonetically sound good with the melody <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to the meat of the song in the chorus." [...] "Between the Lines" [...] was originally the working title of the song, which Weiland incorporated into his lyrics.|$|E

2500|$|The {{narrative}} for Overwatch {{is led by}} Blizzard's senior game designer Michael Chu. Creating {{a narrative}} for the game was a challenge compared to past Blizzard titles as the game lacks a single-player mode or a traditional story-telling mechanic. Instead, the story crafters for the game sought to create a spanning narrative that could be interjected into the game through short in-game dialogue and unlockable hero skins. A March 2017 patch for the game added short character biographies, as well as lore details about specific character skins in the Hero Gallery. Outside of the game, the narrative is primarily driven by a transmedia storytelling method, which includes animated shorts and digitally released comics. This gives the developers some flexibility as to where they can take the story as Overwatch is expanded over the years. The narrative can still be seen being hinted at through map environments and character dialogue within the game itself; Chu explains that [...] "you get a character like Soldier: 76 and he says, like: 'back in my day we'd have this payload delivered'. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a character like Zenyatta, the robot monk, {{and he would say}} something like, [...] "becoming one with the objective." [...] So we find these ways to really differentiate them and it makes for unexpected and sometimes ridiculous lines." [...] Blizzard also found ways to include narrative elements through limited-time events, such as the [...] "Junkenstein's Revenge" [...] event during October 2016 and the April 2017 [...] "Uprising" [...] event. Chu said that with these types of events, they will encourage players to explore the other forms of media that Blizzard is using to develop the Overwatch narrative, as well as prompt fans to continue to explore and speculate on the world and characters they created.|$|E
