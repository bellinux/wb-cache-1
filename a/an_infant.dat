50|$|Unlike {{many other}} sensory systems, the human visual system - {{components}} from {{the eye to}} neural circuits - develops largely after birth, especially {{in the first few}} years of life. At birth, visual structures are fully present yet immature in their potentials. From the first moment of life, there are a few innate components of <b>an</b> <b>infant's</b> visual system. Newborns can detect changes in brightness, distinguish between stationary and kinetic objects, as well as follow kinetic objects in their visual fields. However, many of these areas are very poorly developed. With physical improvements such as increased distances between the cornea and retina, increased pupil dimensions, and strengthened cones and rods, <b>an</b> <b>infant's</b> visual ability improves drastically. The neuro- pathway and physical changes that underlie these improvements in vision remains a strong focus in research. Because of <b>an</b> <b>infant's</b> inability to verbally express their visual field, growing research in this field relies heavily on non-verbal cues including <b>an</b> <b>infants</b> perceived ability to detect patterns and visual changes. The major components of the visual system can be broken up into visual acuity, depth perception, color sensitivity, and light sensitivity.|$|R
