40|$|AbstractThe digital Radon {{transform}} (DRT) can {{be adapted}} to reconstruct images from <b>analog</b> projection <b>data.</b> This new technique is a variation of the conventional back-projection method. It requires no pre-filtering of the projection data, straightforward 1 D linear interpolation and some simple sorting of projection samples. The DRT enables the use of a form of block-data copy for the reconstruction, which is fast in comparison to the usual methods of back-projection. To obtain reconstructed images of high quality, further intrinsic interpolation is required; the reconstructed image size has to be several times larger than the number of projection samples. We describe an algorithm to convert <b>analog</b> projection <b>data</b> into a form suitable to apply the DRT. We compare the performance of the “standard” DRT and a hybrid version of the DRT to some conventional reconstruction algorithms...|$|R
