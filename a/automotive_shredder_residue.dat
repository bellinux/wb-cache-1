5000|$|The {{shredding}} {{of automobiles}} and major household appliances {{is a process}} where a hammermill acts as a giant tree chipper by grinding the materials fed into it to fist-size pieces. The shredding of automobiles results {{in a mixture of}} ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal (e.g. alloys of copper and aluminium) and shredder waste, called <b>automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> or automobile shredder residue (ASR). ASR consists of glass, fiber, rubber, automobile liquids, plastics and dirt. ASR is sometimes differentiated into shredder light fraction and dust.

50|$|Approximately 12-15 million {{vehicles}} {{reach the}} end of their use each year in just the United States alone. These automobiles, although out of commission, can still have a purpose by giving back the metal and other recyclable materials that are contained in them. The vehicles are shredded and the metal content is recovered for recycling, while in many areas, the rest is further sorted by machine for recycling of additional materials such as glass and plastics. The remainder, known as <b>automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residue,</b> is put into a landfill.The shredder residue of the vehicles that is not recovered for metal contains many other recyclable materials including 30% of it as polymers, and 5-10% of it as residual metals. Modern vehicle recycling attempts to be as cost-effective as possible in recycling those residual materials. Currently, 75% of the materials are able to be recycled. As the most recycled consumer product, end-of-life vehicles provide the steel industry with more than 14 million tons of steel.|$|E

40|$|<b>Automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> is a {{byproduct}} of the automotive recycling infrastructure and represents 15 % of the overall weight of a vehicle. The byproduct is currently diverted to landfill and although the potential for recycling exists, none are currently being utilized within Canada at this time. Consequently, the possibility of dismantling vehicle seats separately from the current vehicle dismantling process in order to remove {{a large portion of}} <b>automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> before the shredding process is investigated using an industrial engineering systems approach. In order to understand the structural make-up of the vehicle a thorough disassembly was performed and all operations, part types, weights and material compositions were recorded. Disassembly and dismantling times were calculated using time measurement studies and relationships were identified between process times and seat characteristics. Using this relationship a heuristic complexity based model was developed that relates the product components and connections to the disassembly and dismantling times. This model was then applied to develop a business model to determine the profitability of a vehicle seat dismantling facility. Issues such as government regulations, expenses and potential revenues are discussed to determine the economical viability of vehicle seat recycling...|$|E

Between seven to nine million vehicles are disposed of annually in the EU; only 75 % of this is recyclable. Textiles form part of the remainder non-recyclable materials (Collora 2012). Textiles from ELV seating make up about 15 % of <b>automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residue,</b> (ASR - possible to process into vehicular sound proofing insulation and then finally incinerated) (Erth et al. 2008 a, 2008 b).|$|E
40|$|<b>Automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> (ASR) is an {{industrial}} waste, generated during the recycling process of End-of-life vehicles. The large increasing production volumes of ASR and its hazardous content have raised concerns worldwide, leading some countries to impose more restrictions on ASR waste disposal and encouraging researchers to find efficient solutions for ASR processing. Although {{a great deal}} of research work has been carried out, all proposed solutions, to our knowledge, remain commercially and technically unproven. While the volume of waste materials continues to increase, the production of materials from new sustainable sources has become of great importance. Advanced ceramic materials such as nitrides, carbides and borides are widely used in a variety of applications. Among these ceramics, {{a great deal of}} attention has been recently paid to Titanium nitride (TiN) owing to its unique characteristics. In our study, we propose a new sustainable approach for ASR management where TiN nanoparticles with ideal particle size ranging from 200 to 315 nm can be synthesized as a by-product. In this approach, TiN is thermally synthesized by nitriding pressed mixture of <b>automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> (ASR) incorporated with titanium oxide (TiO 2). Results indicated that TiO 2 influences and catalyses degradation reactions of ASR and helps to achieve fast and full decomposition. In addition, the process resulted in titanium nitride (TiN) ceramic with several unique structures (porous nanostructured, polycrystalline, micro-spherical and nano-sized structures) that were simply obtained by tuning the ratio of TiO 2 to ASR, and a product with appreciable TiN content of around 85 % was achieved after only one hour nitridation at 1550 °C...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the results of}} an extensive analytical characterization study of <b>automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residues</b> (ASR), also known as "fluff". The analyses concerned material fractions and their content, with special reference to heavy metals (e. g. Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Cu) and arsenic. Elution tests on the original materials were also conducted. Moreover, chemical concentrations of ASR samples after about five years' landfill residence was assessed, in order to verify possible changes resulting from both in-situ leaching and organic matter degradation phenomena. Results show that lead seems to be the most critical element in view of possible ASR acceptance in non-hazardous waste landfills because of its high concentration in raw waste and, especially, of its proven leachability characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{identify}} and discuss the valorization pathways of tires, <b>automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residues</b> (ASR) and lignocellulosic biomass waste pyrolysis products. The adopted approach has provided the definition of several indicators (Inlet waste characteristics, pyrolysis technology, char quality, pyrolysis oil quality, and gas quality) able to depict the main characteristics of the pyrolysis products. An extensive literature review allowed the assignment of values to each indicator. Results showed how pyrolysis oils and char are the most searched products for tires and biomass waste. Gas valorisation, on the other hand, seems to be of little importance for tires. Instead, for the ASR, pyrolysis is mainly directed towards char production although a scenario of uncertainty has been observed highlighting no clearly valorisation paths for ASR pyrolysis products...|$|R

40|$|In this work, we model a countercurrent {{tubular reactor}} where an <b>automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residue</b> (ASR) {{is subject to}} {{pyrolysis}}. An inert gas is adopted to convey the pyrolysis products; the solid entering the reactor undergoes an endothermic chemical process which is very sensitive {{with respect to the}} temperature. Pressure effects and friction loss of the gas phase are taken into account to better match the real operative conditions. The reaction is modelled by a system of boundary-value differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) where the thermodynamic variables of both phases are investigated with respect to the axial coordinate of the tube. This algorithmic strategy has shown a greater robustness and reliability in comparison with a more traditional approach relying upon well-known ODE solver codes. In particular, the effects of different gas-solid ratios on conversion and the relevant configurations in the inner phase geometries have been investigated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Car {{manufacturers}} recycle many of {{the materials}} from wrecked vehicles, but the disposal of the lighter components is increasingly difficult. The high cost of landfill is making the option of incineration more attractive, as it reduces the mass and {{the volume of the}} waste. Energy recovery is also possible. This paper examines those properties of <b>automotive</b> <b>shredder</b> <b>residues</b> (ASR) which are relevant to the formation of pollutants during incineration. The higher specific energy of ASR was found to be 19, 000 kJ kg- 1 and the ash content 38 %, which indicate that it is a suitable fuel for municipal incinerators or cement kilns. However, it is very heterogeneous, as the low density fraction is mainly composed of plastics, with smaller amounts of metallic pieces, rubber, glass and wood. The macroscopic composition of a representative sample of ASR was determined.
