This review assesses the <b>Agricultural</b> Education and <b>Training</b> in South Africa focusing on sub-Saharan Africa including factors affecting students and teachers attitude towards their performance and teaching.

However, very limited analytical research has been conducted in area of agricultural sciences education in sub-Saharan countries including South Africa. It is recommended that it is essential to identify the existing <b>Agricultural</b> Education and <b>Training</b> problems by considering both teaching and learning processes as well as, the attitude of students and educators towards <b>Agricultural</b> Education and <b>Training</b> in order to produce efficient and capable professionals for the agricultural production and processing systems...|$|R
