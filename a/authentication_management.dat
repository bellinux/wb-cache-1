Recently, Niu et al. have proposed an <b>authentication</b> and ownership <b>management</b> protocol based on 16 -bit pseudo random number generators and exclusive-or operations which both can be easily implemented on low-cost RFID passive tags in EPC global Class- 1 Generation- 2 standard. They claim that their protocol offers location and data privacy and also resists against desynchronization attack. In this paper, we analyze the security of their proposed <b>authentication</b> and ownership <b>management</b> protocol and show that the protocol is vulnerable to secret disclosure and desynchronization attacks. The complexity {{of most of the}} attacks are only two runs of the protocol and the success probability of the attacks are almost 1.

30|$|In this paper, the Secure <b>Authentication</b> <b>Management</b> human-centric Scheme (SAMS) is proposed, {{which uses}} {{blockchain}} to authenticate mobile devices and trust the resource {{information in the}} mobile devices participating in the MRM resource pool. The SAMS creates blocks based on the hash value of the master node and the hash value of the resource information in the subordinate client nodes in the MRM, and it then forms blockchain by connecting the hash values and blocks when the client nodes are added. Devices {{that have not been}} authenticated through the SAMS in the MRM cannot access or falsify data. This research evaluates the performance of the SAMS by applying the SAMS to the MRM and verifying the impossibility of data falsification by malicious users accessing the SAMS for human-centric aspect.|$|E
40|$|Ad hoc networks, such as sensor {{and mobile}} ad hoc networks, must {{overcome}} {{a myriad of}} security challenges to realize their potential in both civil and military applications. Typically, ad hoc networks are deployed in un-trusted environments. Consequently, authentication is a precursor to any secure interactions in these networks. Recently, numerous authentication protocols have been proposed for ad hoc networks. To date, there is no common framework to evaluate these protocols. Towards developing such a framework, this paper proposes a generic authentication process and a new taxonomy that clarifies similarities and differences among authentication protocols reported in the literature. The taxonomy {{is based upon the}} role of nodes in the authentication function, establishment of credentials, and type of credentials.

40|$|Salleh,Norsaremah: Grundy,John:In IPv 6 networks, two {{security}} {{mechanisms are}} available at the network-layer; SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) and IP security (IPsec). Although both provide authentication, neither subsumes the other; both SEND and IPsec mechanisms should be deployed together to protect IPv 6 networks. However, when a node uses both SEND and IPsec, the authentication has to be done twice, which increases the burden on the node and decreases its performance. In this paper, we propose an approach to enable them to work together under the mediation of an <b>Authentication</b> <b>Management</b> Block, where IPsec uses the public-private keys obtained by SEND rather than negotiating its own authentication credentials in order to save the time and facilitate the IPsec authentication deployment. We implement and evaluate our approach using ipsec-tools and DoCoMo SEND implementations. Our proof-of-concept experiment shows a considerable speedup of IPsec authentication tim...|$|E

This is in contrast to traditional architectures based on a request-broker scheme that would need huge standardization efforts to be applicable to smartcards.

40|$|Abstract — User <b>authentication</b> and session <b>management</b> {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} aspects of computer security and privacy on the web. However, despite their importance, in practice, <b>authentication</b> and session <b>management</b> are implemented through the use of vulnerable techniques. To solve this complex problem, we proposed new authentication architecture, called StrongAuth. Later, we presented an improved version of StrongAuth that includes a secure session management mechanism based on public key cryptography and other cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we present an experimental implementation and evaluation of the proposed scheme to demonstrate its feasibility in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we realize a prototype consisting of two modules: (1) a registration module that implements the registration, and (2) an authentication module integrating both the mutual authentication and the session management phases of the proposed scheme. The experimental results show that in comparison to traditional <b>authentication</b> and session <b>management</b> mechanisms, the proposed prototype presents the lowest total runtime...|$|R
