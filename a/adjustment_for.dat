5|$|The {{national}} Scout jamboree is {{a gathering}} of Boy Scouts from across the US. It is usually held every four years, with some <b>adjustment</b> <b>for</b> special years such as the 2010 National Scout Jamboree that celebrated the BSA centennial. The first jamboree was held in 1937 at the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. Since then, jamborees have been held in varying locations. Beginning in 1981, the jamboree has been held at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. A permanent location owned by the BSA was sought in 2008 for future jamborees, high adventure programs and training. The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve near Beckley, West Virginia is now the permanent site beginning with the 2013 National Scout Jamboree.|$|E

40|$|Accommodations or <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> {{students}} with disabilities (SWDs) who need them are required in Australian education law and policy for classroom instruction and assessment, and external educational accountability tests. Drawing upon {{the structure of the}} Assessment Accommodations Checklist and {{more than a decade of}} accessibility research, the Checklist of Learning and Assessment <b>Adjustments</b> <b>for</b> Students (CLAAS) was developed to help teachers select and document adjustments that support SWDs and {{students with}} additional needs in classroom instruction and assessment, and external tests. The CLAAS was trialled with 21 primary school teachers documenting <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> 89 students with diverse needs. Teachers indicated that the CLAAS provided a comprehensive list of <b>adjustments,</b> was useful <b>for</b> recording <b>adjustments</b> across classroom instruction and assessment, and external tests, and provided guidance about potential <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> SWDs or with additional learning needs. The documented adjustments also indicated some considerable gaps between supports provided in classrooms compared with the Australian educational accountability tests. Findings also provided initial evidence for the reliability and validity of use of the CLAAS for its intended purposes. The CLAAS is a promising tool for helping both researchers and teachers systematically document and provide equitable and inclusive <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> SWDs and additional learning needs given their needs for classroom learning, assessment and external testing and examination requirements...|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} of HPV within the tumour has been realised {{to be an}} important factor for predicting survival since the 1990s. Tumor HPV status is strongly associated with positive therapeutic response and survival compared with HPV-negative cancer, independent of the treatment modality chosen and even after <b>adjustment</b> <b>for</b> stage. While HPV+OPC patients have a number of favourable demographic features compared to HPV-OPC patients, such differences account for only about ten per cent of the survival difference seen between the two groups. Response rates of over 80% are reported in HPV+ cancer and three-year progression free survival has been reported as 75â82% and 45â57%, respectively, for HPV+ and HPV- cancer, and improving over increasing time. It is likely that HPV+OPC is inherently less maligant than HPV-OPC, since patients treated by surgery alone have a better survival after <b>adjustment</b> <b>for</b> stage. In one study, less than 50% of patients with HPV-OPC were still alive after five years, compared to more than 70% with HPV+OPC and an equivalent stage and disease burden.|$|E
25|$|The use of bourdon tube, diaphragm, {{and digital}} depth gauges may require <b>adjustment</b> <b>for</b> use at altitude. Capillary gauges {{have been shown}} to be a {{conservative}} method for measurement of compensated depth at altitude. Modern dive computers detect changes in altitude or accept it as a user input and automatically adjust their calculation of a safe decompression regime for a dive at that altitude. If an altitude-aware computer is not used, altitude decompression tables must be used.|$|E
25|$|It has {{previously}} been speculated that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRP gene may affect clinical decision-making based on CRP in rheumatoid arthritis, e.g. DAS28 (Disease Activity Score 28 joints). A recent study showed that CRP genotype and haplotype were only marginally associated with serum CRP levels and without any association to the DAS28 score. Thus, that DAS28, which is the core parameter for inflammatory activity in RA, {{can be used for}} clinical decision-making without <b>adjustment</b> <b>for</b> CRP gene variants.|$|E
40|$|Economic theory {{predicts that}} the current change in {{national}} wealth, broadly defined to include natural and human capital as well as produced capital ("genuine savings"), determines whether {{the present value of}} future changes in consumption is positive or negative. Theoretical research has focused on the effects of population growth on this relation, but no rigorous empirical investigation has been conducted. Panel data for 64 developing countries during 1970 [...] 82 are used to test the effects of three <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> population growth, including one that controls for omitted wealth. Although the adjustments have substantial impacts on estimates of genuine savings, they lead to only limited improvements in the relation between those estimates and subsequent consumption changes. Even without <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> population growth, <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> natural resource depletion improve the relation significantly. Policymakers and economists can interpret published estimates of genuine savings as signals of future consumption paths if and only if the estimates include <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> natural resource depletion. But better estimates of capital stocks are needed before it can be confidently said that <b>adjustments</b> <b>for</b> population growth significantly improve the accuracy of those signals.

25|$|Externalities occur {{where there}} are {{significant}} social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices.
