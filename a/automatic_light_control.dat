In view of {{the issue}} that present {{illumination}} facilities in classrooms can cause the waste of electric energy, this project group tried {{to solve the problem}} by designing the <b>automatic</b> <b>light</b> <b>control</b> system. The group started with the study of the electricity consumption of those lamps in the classroom and, with the help of MATLAB and LINGO, the established classroom model was analyzed, offering us the differential analysis and the data fitting of the light source coordinates. And software for the design of illumination, DIALux was adopted to implement the simulation test on the illumination of the classroom. We found the problem that the light distribution is uneven under the traditional configuration mode and put forward the relatively efficient way to arrange the distribution of lamps. Meeting the CIE standard, the configuration mode of the lamps increased the effective lighting area of the classroom and increased the efficiency of the electricity used for illumination. It has a broad prospect in the applied fields. And it can also help build a conservation-minded campus and achieve the goal of energy conservation and emission reduction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{daylight}} control system represents an electric light system used in office or design laboratory applications. The system tries to maintains constant the illuminance level on the working plane even the daylight contribution is variable. From other {{point of view}} the {{daylight control}} system is the lighting system that compensates the daylight variation in a room (office, design laboratory). The importance {{of this type of}} lighting system is that it satisfies the following requirements: user visual comfort and electrical energy savings. Considering these requirements the lighting system has to be implemented such an automatic control system with negative feedback. The behavior of the <b>automatic</b> <b>lighting</b> system will depend mainly on the controller behavior. In the present paper, a feed-forward artificial neural network (FANN) was chosen to <b>control</b> the <b>lighting</b> process using the Control by Estimation Iterative Algorithm. Due to the control strategy for a stable behavior of the <b>automatic</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> system without or with acceptable overshoot (regarding the control system step response) the learning rate of the FANN needs to have very small values and in a short range. To remove this shortcoming in present paper is proposed a modified learning error which allows the learning rate to have a wider range of values for which the <b>automatic</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>control</b> system has a good behavior. Also, is proposed a new way that the user can modify the speed reaction of the automatic control system regarding the daylight changes...|$|R

Though most consumers do not think about lighting until the light bulb fails or the power goes out, expenses incurred due to lighting have been found to be a large part of overall energy consumption and lighting has now become the focus of efforts aimed at reducing the high cost of electricity.

However it is more rigorous as the bowel cleanliness for capsule colonoscopy has to be excellent or at least good to result in an adequate sensitivity of the method. Briefly, it consists of 3. 5 - 4 L of split dose polyethylene glycol. Oral NaP boosters are administered after 1 - 2 h if the capsule has entered the small bowel. Sodium phosphate (NaP) seems to be a necessary adjunct to the regimen because the total transit time is doubled without NaP. The cleansing level was considered to be good to excellent in 72 %- 88 % in studies with PCC 1.
