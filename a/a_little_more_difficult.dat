5|$|Emsleyan or Mertensian mimicry {{describes}} unusual {{cases where}} deadly prey mimic a less dangerous species. It was first proposed by Emsley {{as a possible}} answer for the theoretical difficulties a predator species faces when associating an aposematic phenotype of potentially dangerous animals, such as the coral snake, with unprofitability when the predator has {{an increased risk of}} death, negating any learned behaviour. The theory was developed by the German biologist Wolfgang Wickler in a chapter of Mimicry in Plants and Animals, who named it after the German herpetologist Robert Mertens. Sheppard points out that Hecht and Marien put forward a similar hypothesis ten years earlier. This scenario is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to understand, since in other types of mimicry it is usually the most harmful species that is the model. But if a predator dies, it cannot learn to recognize a warning signal, e.g., bright colours in a certain pattern. In other words, there is no advantage in being aposematic for an organism that is likely to kill any predator it succeeds in poisoning; such an animal is better off being camouflaged, to avoid attacks altogether. If, however, there were some other species that were harmful but not deadly as well as aposematic, the predator could learn to recognize its particular warning colours and avoid such animals. A deadly species could then profit by mimicking the less dangerous aposematic organism if this reduces the number of attacks. The exception here, ignoring any chance of animals learning by watching a conspecific die (see Jouventin et al. for a discussion of observational learning and mimicry), is the possibility of not having to learn that it is harmful in the first place: instinctive genetic programming to be wary of certain signals. In this case, other organisms could benefit from this programming, and Batesian or Müllerian mimics of it could potentially evolve. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} some species do have an innate recognition of certain aposematic warnings. Hand-reared turquoise-browed motmots (Eumomota superciliosa), avian predators, instinctively avoid snakes with red and yellow rings. Other colours with the same pattern, and even red and yellow stripes with the same width as rings, were tolerated. However, models with red and yellow rings were feared, with the birds flying away and giving alarm calls in some cases. This provides an alternative explanation to Mertensian mimicry. See Greene and McDiarmid for a review of the subject.|$|E

500|$|Hill {{was one of}} four batsmen touring England for {{the first}} time; Joe Darling, Frank Iredale and Harry Donnan were the others. All four scored more than 1,000 runs for the tour with Hill scoring 1,196runs at an average of 27.81. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Hill [...] "was a {{brilliant}} success" [...] and his batting on good wickets during the tour was [...] "first rate". Hill made his Test début in the First Test at Lord's. [...] Australia collapsed in the first innings to be all out for 53 with Hill bowled by George Lohmann for one. [...] England made 292runs in reply but the second innings saw an Australian fightback. [...] The captain, Harry Trott (143), was partnered by Syd Gregory (103) to help Australia to a score of 347, setting England 109runs to win. Hill failed again scoring only five, bowled this time by Jack Hearne. Rain made England's task <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> but they were able to make the runs for the loss of only four wickets. Hill played in the remaining two Tests, but managed to score only 30runs in the series. Australia lost the series and the Ashes by two Tests to one.|$|E

Veeck reported that the league passed a rule against it the very next day. However, extensive research by two members of the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) suggests that this story was made up by Veeck. [...] The two researchers could not find any references to a moveable fence or any reference to the gear required for a moveable fence to work.|$|E

50|$|The {{airframe}} {{also has}} G-Force limitations {{depending on whether}} the aircraft was fully loaded as the real F-16 has stores configuration categories. When fully loaded, the player can only pull 5.5G's, instead of the 9G's a clean F-16 is capable of. Airspeed & Mach speed would be lower when fully laden as well. The player can even jettison the fuel and weapons in the event of emergency to enable the aircraft to pull higher G's, such as in an emergency or in combat or an aborted mission. Spins and ground effect are not simulated, as is with other simulations of its time, although another rare feature, turbulence is a user selectable option at Briefing & Weather screen.

Conscious of needing {{a new album}} release for their independent label, the band gathered in January 1975, in the studio that rhythm guitarist Bob Weir had built at home. Rather than their usual approach of recording studio versions of songs that had matured on stage, the tracks were developed in the studio setting. According to manager Rock Scully, this was in part an attempt by lead guitarist Jerry Garcia to ensure more involvement {{in the writing process}} from other band members. In creating material from scratch, the band were able to progress beyond the previous genres in which they had played. Garcia explained [...] "We're working on creating styles, rather than just being eclectic or synthesizing other styles.

50|$|Originally, {{the club}} began in Brunswick, Maine, {{approximately}} 25 {{miles north of}} Portland. Bowdoin College offered both new players as well as facilities. The team had access to athletic facilities, locker rooms, a playing field, and a practice field. The nearby Brunswick Naval Air Station provided players who had rugby backgrounds. In this scenario, the club began to grow, attracting more players. While the club drew interest to surrounding Brunswick residents, players from Portland began joining the team. As more and more Portland players joined the team, it became increasingly difficult for the Portland players, who made {{the majority of the}} team, to travel to and from Brunswick nearly four times a week. In 1974, plans were drawn up and the club was moved to Portland, while the Bowdoin College Men's Rugby Club stayed in Brunswick. While playing fields were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> to acquire, local restaurants and bars in Portland's Oldport offered exciting postgame festivities, of which both the club and the opposing club were able to enjoy together. With the move, the team accepted even more new members and found many loyal fans. In 1979, the team won its first Division I championship in the New England Rugby Football Union. The club has also gone international, touring Ireland in 1978, 1982, 1989 and 1994, and England and Wales in 1985. In 1996, Rocco Frenzilli, a former player, founded the Portland Youth Rugby Club, teaching the sport to high school students in the surrounding areas.|$|R
40|$|Capital {{structure}} {{decisions and}} impacts {{have always been}} on top of every CFO’s and shareholder’s mind. Many theories have been presented and so far, no ap- parent consensus regarding how, why or when financing {{should be done in}} order to maximize firm value, exists. This thesis relates the most prominent theories to KIN Group, one of Swedens major retailers with the aim to uncover the underlying factors for its financing decisions. The study gathers data from 2007 in order to capture the complexity of managing, not only a rapid-growing private company, but also while combat- ing challenges of the recent financial downturn in 2008. Semi-structured interviews are conducted with the CFO and the company’s two shareholders and a significant quantity of raw financial data is analyzed. The findings suggest that the most applicable forms of framework in the KIN Group case are the market timing theory due to information asymmetry and hence, the willingness to finance ownership based on market trends. As a private company, this becomes <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> since pricing of shares becomes a complex process. In this context, shareholder and investor perception of future cash flows differed, and hence the given offer was considered underpriced. Second, the firm demonstrated the principle of least effort approach, which is a pragmatic frame- work for financing decisions. This had great impact on KIN Group’s pursuit for capital, and as the debt-levels already was burdened, equity was the only feasible choice. Third, the findings show that no other of the academic theories covered in this thesis is applied within KIN Group in their obtaining of capital structure. Finally, the findings covered in this thesis suggest that the firm value creation was to a high degree dependent on the leverage undertaken by KIN Group. By implementing WACC calculations, we can conclude that the firm value had increased to an approximate level of MSEK 686. 5 by the end of 2010. By conducting a what-if analysis, assuming no leverage and 15 % annual growth, the firm value would instead have reached a level of approximate MSEK 167. ...|$|R
