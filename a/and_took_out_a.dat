5|$|Peckinpah's {{longtime}} {{composer and}} collaborator Jerry Fielding {{was hired to}} do the film score for The Getaway. He had worked previously with the director on Noon Wine (1966), The Wild Bunch (1969), Straw Dogs (1970), and Junior Bonner. After the film's second preview screening, McQueen was unhappy with the music and used his clout to hire Quincy Jones to rescore the film. Jones's music had a jazzier edge and featured harmonica solos by Toots Thielemans and vocals by Don Elliott, both {{of whom had been}} his associates. Peckinpah was unhappy with this action <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> full-page ad in Daily Variety on November 17, 1972, including a letter he had written to Fielding thanking him for his work. Fielding would work with Peckinpah on two more films, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974) and The Killer Elite (1975). Jones was nominated for a Golden Globe award for his original score.|$|E
25|$|Later {{years of}} the 1930s took him to other country towns, such as Woodstock; Ridgefield, Connecticut; and Bernardsville, New Jersey. Every time, he found the {{experience}} had a beneficial effect on his composing. In 1947 he realized {{he would have to}} have a country place of his own, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> three-year rental on a Colonial-era house in the Rockland County hamlet of Palisades. He found it the perfect balance between the country life he desired and the proximity to the city he needed.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Millikan {{referred}} I. H. Lyons {{from the}} National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, {{instead of having}} clerks lick stamps. Beckman's solution was to make ink with butyric acid, a malodorous substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> couple of patents for re-inking typewriter ribbons, but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman's first experience at running a company and marketing a product, and while this first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.|$|E

Đức [...] emerged from the car along with two other monks. One placed a cushion on the road while the second opened the trunk <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> five-gallon petrol can. As the marchers formed a circle around him, Đức calmly sat down in the traditional Buddhist meditative lotus position on the cushion. A colleague emptied the contents of the petrol container over Đức's head. Đức rotated a string of wooden prayer beads and recited the words [...] ("Homage to Amitābha Buddha") before striking a match and dropping it on himself. Flames consumed his robes and flesh, and black oily smoke emanated from his burning body.|$|E

2500|$|Pepsi took {{advantage}} of consumer backlash in its advertising. [...] Roger Enrico, then director of North American operations, declared a company-wide holiday <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> full-page ad in The New York Times proclaiming that Pepsi had won the long-running [...] "Cola Wars". [...] Since Coke officials were preoccupied over the weekend with preparations for the announcement, their Pepsi counterparts had time to cultivate skepticism among reporters, sounding themes that would later come into play in the public discourse over the changed drink. After the announcement on April 23, PepsiCo gave their employees the day off saying, [...] "By today's action, Coke has admitted that it's not the real thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 1975, Margaret Thatcher {{was elected}} {{leader of the}} British Conservative Party. The Institute of Economic Affairs {{arranged}} a meeting between Hayek and Thatcher in London soon after. During Thatcher's only visit to the Conservative Research Department {{in the summer of}} 1975, a speaker had prepared a paper on why the [...] "middle way" [...] was the pragmatic path the Conservative Party should take, avoiding the extremes of left and right. Before he had finished, Thatcher [...] "reached into her briefcase <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> book. It was Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty. Interrupting our pragmatist, she held the book up {{for all of us to}} see. 'This', she said sternly, 'is what we believe', and banged Hayek down on the table".|$|E
2500|$|Greenleaf {{continued}} to be active in land speculation in New York state as well. In 1791, New York merchant Alexander Macomb purchased [...] {{from the state of}} New York (a tract known as [...] "Macomb's Purchase"). Macomb sold [...] to William Constable for £50,000 (New York money). Six months later, Constable sold [...] to banker Samuel Ward for £100,000 pounds (New York money). Constable and Ward agreed to sell [...] to the British land speculator John Julius Angerstein. But New York state barred non-citizens from owning property in the state. Constable and Ward agreed that if the law was not changed, they would buy the land back from Angerstein. The problem was that neither Constable nor Ward had the funds to do so. William Stephens Smith (son-in-law of President John Adams) held power of attorney for Angerstein, and in September 1794 he convinced Aaron Burr to buy [...] of Angerstein's land for £24,000. Smith, in an obvious conflict of interest, assured Burr that he would provide half the sale price. But Smith withdrew from the purchase, leaving Burr {{to come up with the}} entire amount. Burr could not afford to do so. Either Ward or Burr (sources are unclear) sought out Greenleaf for financial assistance. On November 25, 1794, Greenleaf agreed to contribute £12,000 (about $500,000 in 2012 inflation-adjusted dollars) to help Burr purchase Angerstein's land. Constable and Ward conveyed the deed to Greenleaf in December 1794. But Greenleaf was deep in debt. He had purchased a cargo of tea from Rhode Island merchant John Brown (whose family funded and leant its name to Brown University). Greenleaf paid for the cargo partly in cash, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> mortgage with Philip Livingston in 1795 on the Angerstein land to pay for the remainder. But the purchase agreement with Constable and Ward/Angerstein barred the land from being mortgaged. Greenleaf now defaulted on his agreement to help Burr. [...] Burr was now facing the loss of his own £12,000 as well as the Angerstein property. Angerstein was unhappy as well. He was upset not only that Ward had sold [...] but also that Greenleaf had mortgaged the property. Angerstein hired attorney Alexander Hamilton (who had just resigned as Secretary of the Treasury) to press his case in America. A series of suits and countersuits lasting years followed, causing increasingly bad feelings between Burr and Hamilton. (Burr dueled with Hamilton over other issues on July 11, 1804. Hamilton was killed.) For his part, Greenleaf was unable to make his mortgage payments on the Angerstein land, and Livingston foreclosed in December 1798. Brown bought the mortgage for $33,000. (These [...] thus became known as Brown's Tract.) ...|$|E
