50|$|It is {{available}} with four barrel lengths {{and can be}} easily converted from a standard assault rifle (with <b>a</b> 16.5 <b>inch</b> barrel) into <b>a</b> carbine (with <b>a</b> 14.5 <b>inch</b> barrel), into <b>a</b> compact assault rifle (with <b>a</b> 10.5 <b>inch</b> barrel), or into a designated marksman rifle (with <b>a</b> 18 <b>inch</b> barrel) without any tools. Barrel lengths of the two calibers are exactly the same. The Barrels are hammer-forged and hardened with a nitriding process rather than having chrome plated bores as some other rifles.|$|R

5|$|June 1990: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Boris briefly caused heavy rainfall in southern California. This {{was one of}} the reasons why it was the wettest June in San Diego, since record-keeping began in 1850. Despite this, less than <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> (25mm) of rain fell in most locations.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. <b>An</b> <b>inch</b> or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E

5|$|In 1979 {{he began}} to {{experience}} hip and leg problems; one of his legs had shortened <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> {{and a half and}} he had to learn to walk again. Although he remained otherwise in good health this was a sign of his increasing age, and the disabilities that came with it began to affect his judgments as well. While speaking at Cumberland Lodge in 1980 he forgot the details of the case, something shocking for a judge noted for his excellent memory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the box was a hole perhaps <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in diameter. As {{they looked}} through the hole they saw the picture of a man. It was a most {{marvelous}} picture.

5|$|John M. Harlan's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} {{towards the end}} of his career. His eyesight began to fail during the late 1960s. To cover this, he would bring materials to within <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> of his eyes, and have clerks and his wife read to him (once when the Court took an obscenity case, a chagrined Harlan had his wife read him Lady Chatterley's Lover). Gravely ill, he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two common}} widths of single speed and fixed gear bicycle chains: [...] inch and [...] inch. The chainring, {{sprocket}} and chain {{should all be}} the same width. Although <b>an</b> [...] <b>inch</b> chain will work on <b>a</b> [...] <b>inch</b> chainring or sprocket, it is not ideal. <b>A</b> [...] <b>inch</b> chain will not work on <b>a</b> [...] <b>inch</b> chainring or sprocket. Because {{they do not need}} to shift between sprockets, track chains use a full bushing to reduce flex and increase strength. Newer bicycles with derailleur gears use bushingless chains which flex, making gear changing possible.|$|R
6000|$|On both sides, {{importance}} seemed {{attached to}} this question of relief. Riderhood quite petted his reply; saying a second time, and prolonging a negative roll of his head, 'n--n--not <b>a</b> <b>inch</b> sooner, governor.' ...|$|R
5|$|The wreck is {{steadily}} decaying, turning to oxide {{at a rate}} of 0.5–1 ton per day (assuming one ten-thousandth of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> per day on all surfaces).

5|$|Then {{suddenly}} he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart.

When it was only <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E
5|$|Written by Roger Dixon, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} on January 16, 1967. The basic story idea had the TARDIS bring the Doctor and his companions to the Nevada Desert, where they discover they have been shrunk to a tenth of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> in height. To make matters worse, they learn that the local ants have been made super-intelligent by atomic bomb tests and plan {{to take over the}} Earth.|$|E

5|$|As the {{secondary}} storm began to intensify offshore, precipitation rapidly expanded and tracked northward towards southern Virginia, eastern Maryland and Delaware, {{largely in the}} form of freezing rain, ice, and snow. From 0200 UTC on December 30 to 1200 UTC, the cyclone intensified by 13 mbar, and continued to deepen for several more hours. Snowfall reached southern New Jersey between 0600 and 0800 UTC, and New York City at around 1000 UTC. Thundersnow developed within heavy bands in some areas. The significant snow was characterized by a sharp western cutoff; for example, in Chester County, accumulations ranged from around 6inches in the far eastern parts of the county to only <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> along its western border with Lancaster County.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{are thrilled}} {{to hear that}} a film version of their {{favorite}} comic book series, Radioactive Man, is in production. Rainier Wolfcastle, {{the star of the}} McBain films, is chosen to play Radioactive Man, and even more excitingly for the Springfield Elementary School children, the production moves to their town. A search is launched for a young actor to play Radioactive Man's sidekick, Fallout Boy, and Bart auditions. Bart does well, but is rejected for being <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> too short, and Milhouse gets the part, albeit reluctantly, under pressure from his greedy parents.|$|E
5|$|Francis, {{having heard}} Elizabeth's screams, enters the dungeon. Nicholas confuses Francis for Bartolome, and knocks him unconscious. He straps {{him to a}} stone slab located {{directly}} beneath a huge razor-sharp pendulum. The pendulum {{is attached to a}} clockwork apparatus that causes it to descend fractions of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> after each swing, ever closer to Francis's torso. Catherine arrives just in time with Maximillian, one of the servants. After a brief struggle with Maximillian, Nicholas falls to his death in the pit. Francis is removed from the torture device. As they leave the basement, Catherine vows to seal up the chamber forever. They slam and lock the door shut, unaware that Elizabeth is still alive, gagged and trapped in the iron maiden.|$|E
