5|$|Georgia coach Herman Stegeman, in {{the section}} on Southern {{football}} in Spalding's football guide, wrote that Vanderbilt had a good year {{but was unable to}} play up to its full capabilities and the Commodores should prepare for a fine season the next year. For Stegeman, the contest for the theoretical title of greatest Southern team in 1921 was between Centre, Georgia Tech, and Georgia. Clyde Berryman retroactively listed Vanderbilt as national champion. Lynn Bomar at fullback, Pos Elam at tackle, and Thomas Ryan <b>at</b> <b>end</b> were listed on Walter Camp's list of notable players. Bomar, Elam, Ryan, Tot McCullough, Alf Sharpe, and Pink Wade all made an All-Southern team although, according to the yearbook, Tom Ryan was the only player in the group to appear on an All-Southern team.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{movie was}} {{followed}} by 26 episodes, each 45 minutes long and airing at 8:00pm on Fridays. Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushaw openly touted Brisco and its star Bruce Campbell. The network fully expected the show to be its breakout hit of the year, a distinction which eventually went to Briscos follow-up, The X-Files. Hoping that more viewers would follow Brisco as it progressed, Fox approved producing an entire season of the show, despite post-pilot low ratings. Subsequent episodes failed to attract more viewers and the show was cancelled <b>at</b> <b>end</b> of its first and only season. After the series ended, Fox retransmitted the show on Sunday nights at 8:00pm during July and August 1994. The show was later broadcast {{for a short time}} in syndication, airing on the U.S. cable channel TNT.|$|E

5|$|Using {{his various}} natural {{abilities}} and occasionally items or power-ups, Kirby must overcome obstacles while heading towards a goal door <b>at</b> <b>end</b> of the level, where he must fight a boss to obtain {{one of the}} Sparkling Stars. Most bosses are fought by sucking up the projectiles they create and spitting them back at the boss, however, the boss of the third level briefly turns the game into a Shoot 'em up. The last level before the final boss consists of a boss rush, where the player must fight all of the game's bosses again going through a short area based on the boss's home level.|$|E
5|$|The meerkat Flower is {{born in the}} Kalahari Desert on March 15, 2000, to Holly, {{the leader}} of a meerkat group called the Whiskers. After an attack by a rival group, the Lazuli, the Whiskers are forced to {{surrender}} their territory and move to a new home. A hawk kills Holly when Flower is a year old, and her father abandons the group to find a new mate. Flower's sister Viale becomes the group's matriarch and chooses Youssarian, a roving male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Flower mates with Yossarian's brother, Zaphod, but Viale kills the resulting pups and banishes Flower from the group, allowing her to return later. During a time of starvation and drought, Viale attempts to lead the group across a road to forage. As she crosses, she is struck and killed by a passing truck. As the Whiskers attempt to adjust to the loss of their leader, a snake approaches the group. Flower steps in to lead an attack to drive it off. In doing so, she becomes the new leader of the group. Zaphod returns to the group to be her mate, while Yossarian steps aside and leaves the group. Flower leads the Whiskers back to their original home, and after a brief battle, the Whiskers reclaim it from the Lazuli. <b>At</b> <b>end</b> of the film, an on-screen note describes Flower's death during the third season of Meerkat Manor and the children she left behind.|$|E
