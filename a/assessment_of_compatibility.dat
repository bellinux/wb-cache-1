40|$|Background HLAMatchmaker is {{a program}} to analyze the epitope {{specificities}} of HLA antibodies. It considers each HLA allele as a string of eplets. Intralocus and interlocus comparisons between donor and recipient alleles offer a structural <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> and an analysis of allele panel reactivity patterns can generate information about epitope specificities of HLA antibodies. However, HLAMatchmaker cannot always generate conclusive interpretations of reactivity patterns of all monospecific antibodies which by definition recognize single epitopes. Hypothesis We have therefore developed a new antibody analysis approach that utilizes the nonself-self algorithm of HLA epitope immunogenicity. It is based in the concept that HLA antibodies originate from B-cells with immunoglobulin receptors to self HLA epitopes on one given allele and which can be activated by epitopes defined by a few nonself residue differences whereas {{the remainder of the}} structural epitope of the immunizing allele consists of self residues. Methods Three human monoclonal class I antibodies from HLA typed women sensitized during pregnancy were tested in Ig-binding assays with single alleles on a Luminex platformFindings Three new HLA epitopes were identified; they are defined by combinations of nonself and self residues for one allele of the antibody producer.

40|$|Abstract—Traditional data {{integration}} and analysis ap-proaches tend to assume intimate {{familiarity with the}} structure, semantics, and capabilities of the available information sources before applicable tools can be used effectively. This assumption often does not hold in practice. We introduce dataspace profiling as the cardinal activity when beginning a project in an unfamiliar dataspace. Dataspace profiling is {{an analysis of the}} structures and properties exposed by an information source, allowing 1) assessment of the utility and importance of the information source as a whole, 2) <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> with the services of a dataspace support platform, and 3) determination and externalization of structure in preparation for specific data applications. In this paper, we define dataspace profiling and articulate re-quirements for dataspace profilers. We then describe the Quarry system, which offers a generic browse-and-query interface to support dataspace profiling activities, including path profiling, over a variety of data sources with minimal setup costs and minimal a priori assumptions. We show that the mechanisms used in Quarry deliver strong performance in large-scale applications. Specifically, we use Quarry to efficiently profile 1) a detailed standard for medication nomenclature supplied under a generic schema and 2) the metadata for an environmental observation and forecasting system, and conclude that in these contexts Quarry offers advantages over existing tools.

The selected referencematerial, Whatman No. 1 filter paper, being made ofpurified cotton linters, is susceptible to volatiles promotingboth hydrolytic and oxidative degradation, and its responseto tested materials is thus likely to be relevant to a widevariety of heritage materials and objects of organic origin.

Current landfill design practice requires {{the presence of a}} clay barrier (liner) that may consist of either a natural stratum or compacted clay borrow. The liner acts as a hydraulic barrier to control the flux of contaminants from the waste into the adjacent groundwater. In order to do this clay liners are required to have low hydraulic conductivity, k (typically 10 dollarlcub- 8 rcubdollar cm/s) that shall not increase during exposure to waste leachate.;This thesis reports the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> between natural clays from Sarnia, Ontario, and various leachates ranging from municipal solid waste leachate to concentrated organic solvents. The studies were performed using specially designed fixed-ring permeameters that allowed controlling confining effective stresses, volume changes in the soil specimen and chemistry of the influent and effluent permeants.;The Sarnia clays appeared to be compatible with domestic waste leachate, showing slight reductions in k. Extensive retardation of potassium from the leachate required long testing periods (up to twelve pore volumes) before the soils were deemed to be in chemical equilibrium.;Concentrated, water-soluble organics (ethanol and dioxane) increased the hydraulic conductivity of compacted clays by 100 to 1000 -fold, thus destroying their effectiveness as liners. Water-compacted clays appeared remarkably resistant to penetration by concentrated hydrophobic solvents such as cyclohexane. Large hydraulic gradients (up to dollar∼dollar 900) were required to produce breakthrough along compaction induced fractures. However, alcohols and surfactants can facilitate the entry of hydrophobic liquids into the double layers causing large increased in k.;Ethanol and dioxane present in domestic waste leachate at concentrations greater than 70...|$|E
40|$|For the {{assessment}} of vehicle safety in frontal collisions compatibility (which consists of self and partner protection) between opponents is crucial. Although compatibility has been analysed worldwide for over 10 years, no final assessment approach has been defined to date.

40|$|The {{objective}} of vehicle crash compatibility is the optimisation of vehicle design to minimise {{the total number}} of injuries and fatalities that occur in all collisions in the accident environment. It is hence distinguished from traditional perceptions of occupant protection in that it requires vehicle designs to be optimised to protect other road users in addition to the vehicle’s own occupants. The aim of this thesis is to define an objective method to assess the compatibility of a front-to-front or front-to-side collision between two passenger vehicles. Accident statistics from the German In-Depth Accident Survey (GIDAS) relational database are analysed to determine the significance of passenger vehicle occupant casualties with regards to other road users and also to set priorities for the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> between passenger vehicles. Collision obstacles, configurations, velocity, and vehicle mass are analysed with respect to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). A method is defined to objectively measure compatibility by comparing the post-collision deformations from a vehicle-to-vehicle collision with the post-collision deformations from a series of vehicle-to-barrier collisions. The result is quantified with respect to injury data derived from the accident statistics. Ideal models of horizontal and vertical structural homogeneity are developed and applied in front-to-front and front-to-side collision simulations between a mid-sized passenger car and a large Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV). Hence, for the first time, independent conclusions are able to be drawn based on the effects of ideal horizontal homogeneity and ideal vertical homogeneity. The effects of front-end structural homogeneity are also investigated in combination with changes to the stiffness of various components in the vehicle side structure. Finally, the findings of the simulations and the accident analysis are used to describe the necessary characteristics for a test procedure to assess a vehicle’s compatibility. The merits of existing test procedures are discussed, and alternative concepts are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dietary {{guidelines}} {{are designed to}} help meet nutritional requirements, but they do not explicitly or quantitatively account for food contaminant exposures. Objective: In this study, we aimed to test whether dietary changes needed to achieve nutritional adequacy were compatible with acceptable exposure to food contaminants. Methods: Data from the French national dietary survey were linked with food contaminant data from the French Total Diet Study to estimate the mean intake of 204 representative food items and mean exposure to 27 contaminants, including pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins, nondioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDL-PCBs) and dioxin-like compounds. For each sex, 2 modeled diets that departed the least from the observed diet were designed: 1) a diet respecting only nutritional recommendations (NUT model), and 2) a diet that met nutritional recommendations without exceeding Toxicological Reference Values (TRVs) and observed contaminant exposures (NUTOX model). Food, nutrient, and contaminant contents in observed diets and NUT and NUTOX diets were compared with the use of paired t tests. Results: Mean observed diets did not meet all nutritional recommendations, but no contaminant was over 48 % of its TRV. Achieving all the nutrient recommendations through the NUT model mainly required increases in fruit, vegetable, and fish intake and decreases in meat, cheese, and animal fat intake. These changes were associated with significantly increased dietary exposure to some contaminants, but without exceeding 57 % of TRVs. The highest increases were found for NDL-PCBs (from 26 % to 57 % of TRV for women). Reaching nutritional adequacy without exceeding observed contaminant exposure (NUTOX model) was possible but required further departure from observed food quantities. Conclusions: Based on a broad range of nutrients and contaminants, this first <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> between nutritional adequacy and toxicological exposure showed that reaching nutritional adequacy might increase exposure to food contaminants, but within tolerable levels. However, there are some food combinations that can meet nutritional recommendations without exceeding observed exposures...|$|E

40|$|The <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> in frontal impacts has {{to address}} the {{importance}} of different vehicle structures. A critical component in the assessment is to identify, quantitatively, what constitutes good performing structures. In particular, the concepts of structural alignment and structural interaction need to be investigated. Structural alignment is incorporated in the FIMCAR candidate compatibility assessments to achieve geometric alignment of identifiable crashworthiness structures. Structural interaction is also a global assessment of how structures interact with a collision partner during the crash. The performance of lower vehicle structures in a crash {{has been identified as}} important as they may not be evaluated in a structural alignment assessment, but can contribute to structural interaction and thereby improve collision outcome. There has been, however, no clear definition of the characteristics for lower load paths that improve vehicle safety and how these structures manifest themselves in proposed test procedures. FIMCAR has developed a vehicle crash test program that investigates the performance of vehicle structures using three different test series. The first test series used Super mini vehicles with different front end architectures. These tests with, and without, geometric alignment allowed the effectiveness of a lower load path to be compared to a case without a lower load path. A second set of tests investigated the importance of lower load paths for SUV type vehicles where the main front structures may not align with the main structures in a collision partner, but a lower load path may offset the consequences of this initial misalignment. A final test series investigated how the lower load paths in higher SUV type vehicles influence safety in side impact conditions and thus identify potential side effects of a new assessment procedure. Results of the test program show that the presence of a lower load path contributes to a more robust performance of the vehicle. The rearward offset of a lower load path could be reviewed and used to quantify when a lower structure design can contribute to structural interaction in both frontal and side impact configurations...|$|E

The FIMCAR full-width assessment procedure consists of a 50 km/h test against the Full Width Deformable Barrier (FWDB). The Load Cell Wall behind the deformable element assesses whether or not important Energy Absorbing Structures are within the Common Interaction Zone as defined based on the US part 581 zone. The metric evaluates the row forces and requires that the forces directly above and below the centre line of the Common Interaction Zone exceed a minimum threshold. Analysis of the load spreading showed that metrics that rely on sum forces of rows and columns are within acceptable tolerances.

40|$|The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, {{previously}} ‘food stamps’), is the nation’s largest federal entitlement nutritional {{assistance program}} which assists individuals and households living below {{the federal poverty}} level {{in order to reduce the}} amount of money they spend on food. With the conversion of food stamps coupons to Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT), vendors at farmers markets are unable to accept SNAP benefits due to lack of necessary technology adoption. The number of farmers markets has increased 39 percent since 2010 yet only 21 percent of the nation’s farmers markets are equipped to accept EBT (USDA AMS, 2015 a). The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to apply the theory of Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) to explain EBT technology adoption at mid-west farmers markets (Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin). This study intended to identify the socio-demographic characteristics and levels of communication of farmers market managers, market compatibilities, and perceived EBT attributes that might influence EBT adoption at farmers markets. A survey was administered electronically to market managers of three mid-west states to collect the necessary information to answer the research objectives. A total of 181 managers completed the survey. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify effects of several variables on EBT adoption. Analysis of Variance and Chi-square test were utilized to compare the states and adopter groups. Results of logistic regression showed significant effects of specific variables on EBT adoption. Market managers’ level of communication (Farmers Market Association membership and having partnerships with other organizations), market characteristics (availability of public transports to the market and number of SNAP recipients living in the area), and market managers’ perceptions of EBT attributes (perceived usefulness, ability to try-out, and acceptability) were statistically significant predictors of EBT adoption.

In conclusion, the theory of DOI was able to explain effects of market characteristics, market managers’ level of communication, and perceived attributes of EBT on its adoption among the respondents of mid-west farmers markets. Findings of the study can be useful for policymakers in navigating through financial, human, organizational, and political constraints to develop a reachable goal in providing EBT to farmers markets across the nation.

40|$|The {{combination}} of empirical rigour and intuitive, aesthetic insight in Sapir's thought has been amply documented (cf Lowie 1965), but an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> the two, infused {{as they are}} in his theoretical formulations, has been lacking. Metaphorically, Sapir's approach may be said to oscillate between two types of vision: the empirical caution to see what is given to the senses, and an intuitive sense of implication [...] "the chronic inability to see just what is there". The present examination shows, in a more system-atic fashion, how in various dimensions, Sapir's underlying epistemology evinces central inconsistencies reflective of this oscillation. The findings should be important for current anthro-pologists following on Sapir's ideas. It is also su. ggeste...|$|R
40|$|Several {{biochemical}} {{and biological}} methods {{are available for}} <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> environment adaptability in apricot and, also, molecular-based approaches recently proposed for peach could possibly be applied to apricot. The tolerance to low temperatures is a complex process depending on a genetic control that interacts with physiological and environmental factors. While cold-responsive, regulating genes with specific functions {{have been found in}} other species, insufficient knowledge is available in apricot. <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> floral <b>compatibility</b> is a lengthy procedure and, although it could be assisted by reliable in vitro techniques, field validation is often hampered by yearly climatic fluctuation. Recent findings on genes regulating self(in) compatibility will allow the development of PCR primers for marker-assisted selection. Several rootstocks with a satisfactory degree of adaptability to specific soils/ environments are available, even if graft compatibility could limit their commercial introduction. Histological, biochemical and molecular tools are available for early in vitro screening <b>of</b> graft <b>compatibility...</b>|$|R
40|$|Compatibility {{requirements}} for repair mortars used in restoration works are defined {{based on the}} original mortar characteristics, but the quality {{and the performance of}} the repair mortars after application on masonry are generally not assessed. From this perspective, original mortars and their repair mortars from three historic masonry structures were characterized to assess their <b>compatibility</b> in terms <b>of</b> chemical, mineralogical, physical and mechanical point of view. A methodology relying on a fundamental approach for a mortar analysis is adopted taking into account the added values and the basic requirements from both practical and scientific point of view. This study will contribute to the existing knowledge on mortar characterization and will provide new insights on the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> the repair mortars. status: publishe...|$|R
