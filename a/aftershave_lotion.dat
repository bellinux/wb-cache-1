2500|$|Limonene {{is common}} in {{cosmetic}} products. As the main odor constituent of citrus (plant family Rutaceae), d-limonene is used in food manufacturing and some medicines, e.g. as a flavoring to mask the bitter taste of alkaloids, and as a fragrance in perfumery, <b>aftershave</b> <b>lotions,</b> bath products, and other such products that include fragrance. d-Limonene is also used as botanical insecticide. d-Limonene {{is used in the}} organic herbicide [...] "Avenger." [...] It is added to cleaning products, such as hand cleansers to give a lemon-orange fragrance (see orange oil) and for its ability to dissolve oils. In contrast, l-limonene has a piney, turpentine-like odor.|$|R

40|$|Musk ambrette, {{a contact}} and photocontact allergen, is a {{synthetic}} fragrance present in <b>aftershave</b> <b>lotions</b> and many toiletries. Thirty-four patients with contact and photocontact allergy to musk ambrette were studied. All had a facial eczema. Four distinctive clinical pictures were seen. These were plaques of eczema, jawline (mandibular) dermatitis, acute contact dermatitis and chronic actinic dermatitis. Twenty-six patients were light sensitive by history and 10 were diagnosed by clinical criteria as having chronic actinic dermatitis. Patch and photopatch testing to musk ambrette showed that seven patients had pure photocontact dermatitis to musk ambrette. Eight patients had contact dermatitis to musk ambrette {{but this was}} exacerbated by irradiation. Cross reaction with moskene occurred. Scrupulous avoidance of musk ambrette has resulted in clinical resolution in most patients...|$|R
40|$|Fragrance free/unscented: According to Health Canada's {{labeling}} regulations, “fragrance free/unscented” {{means that}} no fragrance {{has been added}} to the cosmetic product, or that a masking agent has been added in order to suppress the scents from the other ingredients in the cosmetic. Scented Personal Products: Refers to any scented personal care product including, but not limited to, perfume, cologne, essential oils, scented <b>aftershave</b> <b>lotions,</b> scented deodorant, scented moisturizing hand, body or face washes, lotions or sprays, massage oils, scented sunscreen, and any scented hair shampoo / conditioner/ mousse / gel/hairspray, scented powder or talc, solid or spray air fresheners, incense and potpourri. Policy Statement: Mount Sinai Hospital will strive to ensure that the use of chemical products with scents and fragrances, are minimized or, where necessary, based on health risk, eliminated. The issues around the health effects of exposure to scented products are complex. In consideration of the allergies and sensitivities from which many people suffer, and in recognition {{of the fact that there}} is evidence to support the theory that scented products may trigger symptoms of the above noted health conditions, the wearing of scented personal products within hospital buildings is to be limited, so that the use does not cause any sort of negative health reaction or discomfort...|$|R
40|$|Phthalates are {{multifunctional}} {{chemicals used}} {{in a variety of}} applications, including personal care products. The present study explored the relationship between patterns of personal care product use and urinary levels of several phthalate metabolites. Subjects include 406 men who participated in an ongoing semen quality study at the Massachusetts General Hospital Andrology Laboratory between January 2000 and February 2003. A nurse-administered questionnaire was used to determine use of personal care products, including cologne, <b>aftershave,</b> <b>lotions,</b> hair products, and deodorants. Phthalate monoester concentrations were measured in a single spot urine sample by isotope dilution–high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Men who used cologne or aftershave within 48 hr before urine collection had higher median levels of monoethyl phthalate (MEP) (265 and 266 ng/mL, respectively) {{than those who did not}} use cologne or aftershave (108 and 133 ng/mL, respectively). For each additional type of product used, MEP increased 33 % (95 % confidence interval, 14 – 53 %). The use of lotion was associated with lower urinary levels of monobutyl phthalate (MBP) (14. 9 ng/mL), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) (6. 1 ng/mL), and mono(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) (4. 4 ng/mL) compared with men who did not use lotion (MBP, 16. 8 ng/mL; MBzP, 8. 6 ng/mL; MEHP, 7. 2 ng/mL).

40|$|A {{cosmetic}} {{is legally}} {{defined as a}} product that enhances appearance, aids in personal hygiene, and {{does not affect the}} structure or function of the skin. Therefore, cosmetic products contain no active drug ingredient. Sometimes the division of cosmetics and over-the-counter drugs is not always clear, for example the recent hair regrowth treatment, topical minoxidil (Regaine / Headway), which has been shown to cause allergic contact dermatitis of the scalp (1). Cosmetics can be broadly divided into the following groups: • Decorative products e. g. make-up • Nail care products e. g. varnishes and removers • Skin care products e. g. moisturizers • Soaps & bath additives • Shaving products e. g. foams, <b>aftershave</b> <b>lotions</b> • Oral Hygiene products e. g. toothpaste & mouthwashes • Hair Products e. g. shampoo, dyes & regrowth treatments • Sun Protection products • Feminine Hygiene products • Fragrances e. g. perfumes & colognes • Deodorants & Antiperspirants – Technically because they reduce or decrease sweating, which affect the function of the skin, they should be considered drugs It can be seen, therefore, that cosmetics {{are an important part of}} our daily life. It is estimated that the average adult uses at least 7 different skin care products each day, so it’s not surprising that reactions to these products are very common. Reactions can be seen after the first application or after years of use. In New Zealand, like the rest of the developed world, there is a trend towards using "natural products", with the misconception that natural products are "healthier " and cause fewer reactions than artificial products. This myth is debunked when people are reminded that most allergens are "natural ” proteins...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Phthalates {{are used}} as {{plasticizers}} in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics. As phthalate plasticizers are not chemically bound to the PVC, they can leach, migrate or evaporate into indoor air and atmosphere, foodstuffs, other materials, etc. Therefore, humans are exposed through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal exposure over their entire lifetime, including during intrauterine development. In particular, university students have {{a great number of}} opportunities to contact products including phthalates during campus life (food packaging, body care products, cosmetic, <b>lotions,</b> <b>aftershave,</b> perfume etc.). The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine levels of phthalate exposure as undergraduate students begin to use pharmaceuticals and personal care products including phthalates. Methods: Phthalate metabolites, mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono- 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), {(mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP}, and mono-(2 -ethlyl- 5 -oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP} were examined. 80 urine samples collected from university students were analyzed using LC/MS/MS(API 4000, Applied Bioscience) with on-line enrichment and column-switching techniques. This study was carried out at Y university located in Gyonggi Province from 2008 to 2011. Results: The detection limit of phthalate metabolites were 0. 03 ng/mL for MEP, 0. 11 ng/mL for MnBP, 0. 08 ng/m...|$|R

50|$|Shaving soap {{in a cup}} is {{traditionally}} lathered and applied using a rotating in-and-out motion of a shaving brush, usually made of boar or badger bristles. The shave is completed using as few strokes as possible, stropping sparingly if at all. A second shave with another razor in an alternate direction against the beard yields an extremely close shave. Rinsing with cold water constricts minor abrasions or cuts, followed by patting dry (not rubbing) and an astringent or <b>aftershave</b> <b>lotion.</b> More serious nicks can be attended with direct pressure for perhaps a minute with a styptic pencil, or with an application of a household astringent such as witch hazel. A light steady touch is most effective at providing a close shave, preserving the edge and avoiding cuts.|$|E
5000|$|Maguire {{was born}} in 1934, {{the son of a}} violent {{alcoholic}} father, James Maguire, who migrated from Glasgow in 1922. His mother, Annie (née McLaughlin), from Edinburgh, was usually the subject of her husband's beatings, which frequently left her [...] "cut, bloodied and bruised". Maguire was the youngest of four children. His only memory of his father taking any notice of him was when [...] "he'd been away and when he came home, he beat me with his belt". His eldest sibling was Eileen, then Kathleen, then James (Jim) who was eight years older than him, the last child. The family had to move house a number of times when all of the rent money was spent on drink. James Maguire was often found unconscious in the street and his son Jim had to drag or carry him back home. Sometimes their father drank Bay Rum, an <b>aftershave</b> <b>lotion.</b> The family was very poor, and the young Maguire had to borrow his brother's old services overcoat to hide the holes in the clothes he wore to school, and he rarely had socks. He [...] "looked up to his long-suffering mum" [...] and saw her as a [...] "model of Christian piety".|$|E
30|$|Most {{cosmetic}} products contain fragrances, {{many of which}} are sensitizers [11 – 14]. It seems to be rather difficult to produce scented personal care products with fragrances that are not labelled. I found that out of 111 fragrances frequently applied in cosmetics and washing and cleansing products 106 were classified in the C&L Inventory. Most of them are skin sensitizers or eye irritants. Also natural substances can be sensitizers and irritants, e.g. essential oils. Some products consist of a large fraction of fragrances, for example <b>aftershave</b> <b>lotion</b> contains 10 % fragrances. Normally, mixtures which are not classified as sensitizing but contain at least one sensitizing substance in a concentration equal or greater than 0.1 % must bear the supplemental label EUH 208 ‘Contains (name of sensitizing substance) … May produce an allergic reaction.’ ([1] Annex II Part 2 2.8) Table 1 (C). This supplemental label element would be relevant for most {{cosmetic products}}, but it is again not applied to them because they are excluded from the CLP Regulation in general.|$|E

This building’s walls feature 1960 s inspired contemporary art paintings of flowers, text, and a stylized bird. Art paintings on the building’s walls include the following statements “I Was Lord Kitchener's Valet” and “Sock It to Me. ” According to the Barbados Corporate Affairs and Intellectual Property Office (CAIPO), "I Was Lord Kitchener's Valet" was registered in Barbados on November 25, 1968. "I Was Lord Kitchener's Valet" was a boutique store in London during the 1960 s, which sold secondhand uniforms and military memorabilia. This image also features the store’s memorable sign which was inspired by the famous 1914 military recruitment poster designed by Alfred Leete. The sign and poster features Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchener, then Secretary of State for War, pointing at the viewer with the words “Your Country Needs You. ” However, this store's sign also features the Union Jack flag behind Lord Kitchener’s image.
