40|$|The Administration's Clear Skies {{initiative}} and all competing legislative proposals take a pollutant-by-pollutant approach to address air pollution {{problems caused by}} emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2).

For a scenario where firms could use permits to emit three tons of NOx instead of one ton of SO 2, we estimate that compliance costs would fall by more than $ 1 billion per year relative to emissions caps like those in Clear Skies. Yet expected environmental damages would not increase because the projected damages from three tons of NOx are roughly the same as from one ton of SO 2.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is a major}} environmental problem that poses numerous health risks to those exposed to it. The adverse health effects are compounded in a place as dense as Hong Kong and further intensified due to its proximity to industrial and manufacturing plants {{across the border in}} Mainland China. Hong Kong has attempted {{to address the issue of}} air pollution through the enactment of legislation and policies such as the 1983 Air Pollution Control Ordinance and Air Quality Objectives, but so far these measures have not proven to be particularly effective. The new Air Quality Objectives are not as stringent as claimed by the Environmental Protection Department, the legal system is limited in enforcing <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>legislation,</b> and the Air Pollution Control Ordinance itself is flawed at best and requires urgent attention. An examination of the <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>legislation</b> and policies of overseas jurisdictions such as Ontario, California, and Tokyo show that these regions have made significant progress in addressing air pollution by prioritizing public health and utilizing a variety of measures to reduce air pollution. Ontario’s Environmental Protection Act gives the Ministry of the Environment numerous ways to deal with polluters and the Environmental Bill of Rights helps facilitate public participation in environmental decision-making by granting the public the right to apply for an investigation or review of existing legislation and policies. California’s Air Resources Board has been commended for enacting air pollution regulations that are more stringent than national standards and many states have adopted the Golden State’s standards as their own. In Japan, government, corporate, and public responsibilities for reducing air pollution and protecting the environmental are outlined in the Basic Environmental Law. Legislation providing compensation to victims of pollution as well as the use of a Total Mass Emissions Control system has helped the country achieve an extraordinary rate of compliance with national air quality standards. By studying, modifying and applying air pollution control legislation and policies being used in the three jurisdictions to its own Air Pollution Control Ordinance and air pollution control management as a whole, Hong Kong can be better prepared to protect public health and it’s environment in the future. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E

40|$|Air {{quality in}} Canada has {{substantially}} improved since the 1970 s {{and at least}} some of this improvement {{can be attributed to the}} detailed, extensive system of legislation currently in place to control air pollution.

Ozone has been labeled as the most serious of the damaging air pollutants to agriculture, where growth rates and consequently yields are dramatically reduced. Quantifying the effects has formed a key factor in policymaking. Based on the widely held view that AOT 40 (Accumulated exposure Over Threshold of 40 ppb) is a good indicator of ozone-induced damage, the Danish Eulerian Model (DEM) was used to compute reduced agriculture yields on a 50 km × 50 km grid over Europe. In one set of scenarios, a ten year meteorological time series was combined with realistic emission inventories. In another, various idealized emission reduction scenarios are applied to the same meteorological time series. The results show substantial inter-annual variability in economic losses, due in most part to meteorological conditions which varied much more substantially than the emissions during the same period. It is further shown that, taking all uncertainties into account, estimates of ozone-induced economic losses require that a long meteorological record is included in the analysis, for statistical significance to be improved to acceptable levels for use in polic...|$|E

Global three-dimensional chemistry-transport simulations of atmospheric composition over the past 3  decades have been performed to estimate what the air quality levels would have been under a scenario of stagnation of anthropogenic emissions per capita as in 1980, accounting for the population increase (BA 1980) or using the standard practice of neglecting it (AE 1980), and how they compare to the historical changes in air quality levels. The simulations are based on assimilated meteorology to account for the year-to-year observed climate variability and on different scenarios of anthropogenic emissions of pollutants. The ACCMIP historical emissions dataset is used as the starting point. Our sensitivity simulations provide clear indications that air quality legislation and technology developments have limited the rapid increase of air pollutants.

40|$|Across Europe {{anthropogenic}} emissions have changed substantially over recent decades, {{due in part}} to the implementation of <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> control <b>legislation.</b> It is important to understand the effect that such changes in emissions have on atmospheric aerosols and their impact on air quality and climate. The composition climate model HadGEM 3 -UKCA and long term observations of aerosols are used to simulate and evaluate the change in aerosols over the period 1960 to 2009. Simulated sulphate mass, total aerosol mass and aerosol number concentrations from HadGEM 3 -UKCA were underestimated but temporal trends were in better agreement when compared to observations. The inclusion of aerosols was found to be essential when reproducing the observed brightening trend in surface solar radiation across Europe since 1990. The all-sky aerosol radiative forcing (relative to a 1980 - 2000 mean) increased by > 3 W m- 2 during the period 1970 - 2009 due to reductions in aerosol concentrations. The sensitivity of sulphate aerosol formation and aerosol radiative effects to an increase in cloud water pH were investigated over the period 1970 to 2009. Sulphate aerosol mass increased over regions with large SO 2 emissions but decreased at other locations. A positive response in the all-sky aerosol radiative effect was simulated due to reductions in aerosol number concentrations. Over Europe the aerosol radiative forcing between 1970 and 2009 varied from + 1. 5 to + 7 W m- 2 depending on whether an increase or decrease in cloud water pH was assumed. This shows the additional uncertainty that could exist in aerosol radiative effects if temporal changes in such parameters are not considered.

40|$|Background: Air {{pollution}} by fine {{aerosol particles}} {{is among the}} leading causes of poor health and premature mortality worldwide. The growing awareness of this issue has led several countries to implement <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>legislation.</b> However, populations in {{large parts of the}} world are still exposed to high levels of ambient particulate pollution. The main aim of this work is to evaluate the potential impact of implementing current air quality standards for fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) in the European Union (EU), United States (US) and other countries where PM 2. 5 levels are high. Methods: We use a high-resolution global atmospheric chemistry model combined with epidemiological concentration response functions to investigate premature mortality attributable to PM 2. 5 in adults >= 30 years and children < 5 years. We perform sensitivity studies to estimate the reductions in mortality that could be achieved if the PM 2. 5 air quality standards of the EU and US and other national standards would be implemented worldwide. Results: We estimate the global premature mortality by PM 2. 5 at 3. 15 million/year in 2010. China is the leading country with about 1. 33 million, followed by India with 575 thousand and Pakistan with 105 thousand per year. For the 28 EU member states we estimate 173 thousand and for the United States 52 thousand premature deaths in 2010. Based on sensitivity analysis, applying worldwide the EU annual mean standard of 25 mu g/m(3) for PM 2. 5 could reduce global premature mortality due to PM 2. 5 exposure by 17 %; while within the EU the effect is negligible. With the 2012 revised US standard of 12 mu g/m(3) premature mortality by PM 2. 5 could drop by 46 % worldwide; 4 % in the US and 20 % in the EU, 69 % in China, 49 % in India and 36 % in Pakistan. These estimates take into consideration that about 22 % of the global PM 2. 5 related mortality cannot be avoided due to the contribution of natural PM 2. 5 sources, mainly airborne desert dust and PM 2. 5 from wild fires. Conclusions: Our results reflect the need to adopt stricter limits for annual mean PM 2. 5 levels globally, like the US standard of 12 mu g/m(3) or an even lower limit to substantially reduce premature mortality in most of the world...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the impact of global greenhouse gas policies on traditional air pollutants using the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model in the time horizon up to 2050. The integrated assessment framework of GAINS has been linked through an interface to the POLES global energy system model so that different global energy pathways can be implemented and examined. The impact analysis has been carried out based on projections of energy use data provided by the POLES model for two different climate policy scenarios, i. e., for a current policy Baseline scenario without any global greenhouse gas mitigation efforts, and a 2 -degree Centigrade climate Mitigation scenario which assumes internationally coordinated action to mitigate climate change. Outcomes of the analysis are reported globally and for key world regions: EU- 27, China, India and the US. The assessment takes into account current air pollution control legislation in each country. The results of scenario calculations for SO 2, NOx and PM 2. 5 emissions, air pollution control costs, as well as health and environmental impacts, indicate significant scope for co-benefits made possible through climate policies. Climate mitigation measures appear to be more effective in reducing oxides of sulphur and nitrogen, while emissions of particulate matter are reduced to a smaller extent. Decarbonisation of the global energy system by 2050 results in SO 2 and NOx emissions lower by two-thirds than in the world without GHG-abatement efforts. Corresponding reduction in the emissions of PM 2. 5 is estimated at about 30 % relative to the Baseline and is particularly sensitive to the assumptions on projected biomass combustion. Expenditures on air pollution control under the global climate mitigation regime are reduced in 2050 by 250 billion Euros when compared to the Baseline scenario. Under the GAINS cost assumptions the largest potential for cost savings is reported for the transport sector, followed by savings in the power generation sector. Around one third of financial co-benefits estimated world-wide in this study by 2050 are allocated to China, while an annual cost saving of 35 billion Euros is estimated for the EU member countries if the current <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> <b>legislation</b> and climate policies are adopted in parallel. This study also quantifies health impacts of air pollution in Europe, China and India in terms of loss of life expectancy related to the exposure from anthropogenic emissions of PM 2. 5, as well as in terms of premature mortality due to ground-level ozone. For example in China, current ambient concentrations of PM 2. 5 are responsible for 38 months-losses in the average life expectancy. In 2050, the global GHG-mitigating strategies reduce this indicator in China by 16 months. In addition, decrease of ozone concentrations in the three regions as estimated for the climate Mitigation scenario in 2050 might save nearly 80, 000 cases of premature death per year. Similarly significant are reductions of impacts on ecosystems due to acidification and eutrophication...|$|E

40|$|Objective To explore various {{contributors}} to people's reporting of self reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems in area of living, including GIS-modeled <b>air</b> <b>pollution,</b> and {{to investigate whether}} those with respiratory or other chronic diseases tend to over-report <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems, compared to healthy people. Methods Cross-sectional data from the Oslo Health Study (2000 – 2001) were linked with GIS-modeled <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> data from the Norwegian Institute of Air Research. Multivariate regression analyses were performed. 14 294 persons aged 30, 40, 45, 60 or 75 years old with complete information on modeled and self reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> were included. Results People who reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems were exposed to significantly higher GIS-modeled <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> levels {{than those who did}} not report such problems. People with chronic disease, reported significantly more <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems after adjustment for modeled levels of nitrogen dioxides, socio-demographic variables, smoking, depression, dwelling conditions and an area deprivation index, even if they had a non-respiratory disease. No diseases, however, were significantly associated with levels of nitrogen dioxides. Conclusion Self reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems in area of living are strongly associated with increased levels of GIS-modeled <b>air</b> <b>pollution.</b> Over and above this, those who report to have a chronic disease tend to report more <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems in area of living, despite no significant difference in <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> exposure compared to healthy people, and no associations between these diseases and NO 2. Studies on the association between self reported <b>air</b> <b>pollution</b> problems and health should be aware of the possibility that disease itself may influence the reporting of <b>air</b> <b>pollution...</b>|$|R
