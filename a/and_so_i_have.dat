500|$|I {{perceived}} that that teaching {{which is our}} salvation was to be had in a much purer and more lively form if sought at the fountain-head and drawn from the actual sources than from pools and runnels. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> revised the whole New Testament (as they call it) against the standard of the Greek original... I have added annotations of my own, in order {{in the first place}} to show the reader what changes I have made, and why; second, to disentangle and explain anything that may be complicated, ambiguous, or obscure.|$|E
2500|$|He came to Madina {{and spoke}} to the people, saying, [...] "I desired the way {{followed}} by Abu Bakr and 'Umar, but I was unable to follow it, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> followed a course with you which contains fortune and benefits for you despite some bias, so be pleased with what comes to you from me even if it is little. When good is continuous, even if it is little, it enriches. Discontent makes life grim." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vera {{decided to}} call Inayat Khan back to London, to meet and talk. Vilayet Inayat Khan remembered trying to stop his sister going on her mission exactly {{the time of this}} meeting. [...] "You see, Nora and I had been brought up with the policy of Gandhi's nonviolence, and at the {{outbreak}} of war we discussed what we would do," [...] said Vilayet, who had followed his father and become a Sufi mystic. [...] "She said, 'Well, I must do something, but I don't want to kill anyone.' So I said, 'Well, {{if we are going to}} join the war, we have to involve ourselves in the most dangerous positions, which would mean no killing.' [...] "Then, when we eventually go to England, I volunteered for minesweeping and she volunteered for SOE, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always had a feeling of guilt because of what I said that day." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my way, <b>and</b> we {{gained the}} room where his infamous traffic had been held. Yet for once he spoke the truth. She was no longer there.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts: [...] "Oh, yes! Mrs. Miller never {{gives you}} {{anything}} but ice-cream; and I {{thought we should}} all need something hot when we got back, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a few--But <b>I</b> forgot all about the supper!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, mother, I accused him--that is, I {{suspected}} him {{of dancing}} with Miss Moseley against {{my right to}} her; now you find {{that it was all}} a mistake, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better act with dignity, and confess my error." ...|$|R
2500|$|As mentioned, KR's first {{homosexual}} experiences {{occurred in}} the Imperial Guards. [...] The Grand Duke made great efforts to repress his feelings. [...] But despite his love for his wife, KR could not resist the temptations offered to a person of his exalted state. KR claimed in his diary that between 1893 and 1899 he remained away from the practice {{of what he called}} his [...] "main sin." [...] Yet by the birth of his seventh child, KR had become a steady visitor to several of the male brothels of St. Petersburg. In 1904 he wrote in his diary that he [...] "ordered my coachman...to go, and continued on foot past the bath-house. I intended to walk straight on... But without reaching the Pevchesky Bridge, I turned back and went in. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> surrendered again, without much struggle, to my depraved inclinations." [...] The cycle of resistance and capitulation to temptation is a common theme of KR's diaries.|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything". <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a list of questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, [...] "Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." [...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, {{where there is a}} chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{written it}} whilst we wait their return, and Mrs. Harker has written with the {{typewriter}} all since {{she brought the}} MS to us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. A {{man named}} Crawford, {{who was in}} our regiment. He was {{appointed}} an officer {{on the same day}} I was shot; but, as he was appointed after the occurrence they held that his single witnessing was not enough, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to hunt for another." ...|$|R
60|$|My friend {{struggled}} with the case several minutes, turning it over and examining it in his mind, then he said that so {{far as he could}} see the modification was itself a lie, it being a misleading reservation of an explanatory fact, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> told two lies instead of only one.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> ended (<b>I</b> <b>have</b> used Hayes' own words) Amyas Leigh's story.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} way I can get my living," [...] said the butterfly. [...] "Nobody ever gives me anything, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to take what I want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{wait for}} the coffee," [...] she smilingly explained. [...] "You said you were hungry <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> brought in a little 'snack.' The coffee will be ready soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You {{have been}} so good to me that I wish {{to do the best}} for you; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{arranged}} that you shall occupy the state suite in the right wing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{did not see}} him any more, but I detest his memory. Of course my resentment did {{not extend}} to the students, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an unforgettable good time talking to them. And <b>I</b> think they <b>had</b> a good time too, for they responded [...] "as one man," [...] to use Susy's unimprovable phrase.|$|R
6000|$|... "You gave me {{credit for}} more {{sharpness}} than I possess, Dick. I felt sure {{it could not}} be done, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to go right down to Cadiz, and back to Lisbon by ship. It was a very much easier affair than ours was, and I met with no adventures and no difficulties on the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{forgot all}} about it," [...] he said humbly. [...] "You see, this morning the poundman got Maria's two cows and the baby calf, and--well, it {{happened}} that Maria didn't <b>have</b> any money, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to recover her cows for her. That's where the Transcontinental fiver went--'The Ring of Bells' went into the poundman's pocket." ...|$|R
6000|$|My mother {{drank the}} water and spoke. [...] "That boy," [...] she said, [...] "takes after his father. He grows more like him every day.... <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> brought him to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have made}} up my mind that I must have money, Pa. I feel that I can't beg it, borrow it, or steal it; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{resolved}} that I must marry it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am your nearest neighbor, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{climbed up}} here to get acquainted. I am Agatha Lord, but {{of course you do}} not know me, because I came from Boston, whereas you came from--from--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and, as {{you told}} me, {{he is quite}} {{confident}} that I will keep faith with him; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> will. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had a letter from him since you saw him." ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. Yes, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> believe, <b>have</b> you too, {{though you}} make so strange about it.|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>had</b> already {{discussed}} it with him, <b>I</b> confessed; <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> thought, <b>had</b> Mr. Woodcourt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, you fellows," [...] he said; [...] "I am {{off with}} the right wing {{according}} to orders; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to shake hands, in case we should not meet again, you know," [...] he added significantly.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is. The Skeezers did it <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{declared}} war on them. In revenge for making my wife a Pig I intend to ruin their Magic Island and make the Skeezers the slaves of the Flatheads!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} is," [...] said Edna, {{speaking}} in a low voice. [...] "We cannot expect such a boy to keep awake, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been on watch. It was easy {{enough for me to}} keep my eyes open." ...|$|E
6000|$|Butter wouldn't {{kill himself}} with the {{life-preserver}} in sight, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an idea. <b>I</b> took it to a pawnshop, and [soaked] it for a revolver: The pawnbroker didn't think much of the exchange, but when I explained the situation he acquiesced. We went {{up on top of}} a high building, and this is what happened to the poet: ...|$|R
50|$|Richard Franklin later recalled:I'd done Eskimo Nell in the Australian idiom, and... my American friends didn't {{understand}} it. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> thought, well, I'll go to {{the other}} extreme and have everybody speaking Queen's English. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> everybody doing, not so much English accents as just speaking Queen's English. Robert Helpmann broke his back during filming trying to lift up Robert Thompson in one scene.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know, Ada, <b>I</b> really <b>had</b> {{not made}} up my mind. You see, all along <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been feeling that I could never get engaged again, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an answer ready, and had not thought it over as <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> done otherwise. There is a snowflake. Do let us hurry, {{so as to be}} in before it begins in earnest.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> valued {{my chair}} ever since, [...] Like {{the shrine of}} a saint, or the throne of a prince; [...] Saint Fanny, my patroness sweet I declare, [...] The queen of my heart and my cane-bottom'd chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Yes, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have.</b> But {{here is a}} {{proof of}} what I was saying. My poor head, I had quite forgot it. Well, the thing is this: I have just had a letter from John; you can guess the contents." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I do," [...] said Uncle Hatto. [...] "I {{do think}} it foolish {{for young people to}} hold {{themselves}} betrothed before they have got anything to live on, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> told your father. He answered me by saying that you were not betrothed." ...|$|E
60|$|Calots are not {{permitted}} {{within the walls of}} the palace proper, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> had to relegate poor Woola to quarters in the stables where the royal thoats are kept. He had comfortable, even luxurious apartments, but <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> given much to have had him with me; and if he had been, the thing which happened that night would not have come to pass.|$|R
6000|$|I saw a cast in her husband's eye which I {{took for}} a hint not {{to press the}} matter, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better say, [...] "It is only that in Altruria we hold serving in {{peculiar}} honor." ...|$|R
60|$|While I {{was still}} {{watching}} their sluggish motions in the sunlight, and noting each strange detail of their form, the curate {{reminded me of}} his presence by pulling violently at my arm. I turned to a scowling face, and silent, eloquent lips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only one of us to peep through; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to forego watching them for a time while he enjoyed that privilege.|$|R
