50|$|While the {{materials}} {{were to be}} widely shared, the organization had to establish policies and procedures to deal with preservation, privacy, legalities and other concerns. Some of the issues they addressed were that {{the creator of the}} archive, not the repository (the IIAV), determines what is included in the records they donate. The second premise was that the IIAV determined the scope of the collections that they wanted to acquire, thus they are limited to women and the various women’s movements. Finally, the institute recognized that after its acquisition, the archivist {{had to be able to}} organize and preserve only those materials within the scope. From its earliest beginnings, the archive was intended to be an international <b>archive</b> <b>repository,</b> though the fact that the women's movements were confined at that time to Western countries and their colonial territories, shaped the character of the collected materials. After the war ended, there was a shift in focus to more national concerns and almost all donations, as there was no active acquisition effort, came from Dutch women with ties to the various women's groups.|$|E

50|$|Wren Hall is a Grade I listed {{building}} in Salisbury Cathedral Close, Wiltshire. Situated {{on the west}} side of Choristers' Green it was originally part of the attached Braybrook House. A rebuilding was commissioned and funded by Sir Stephen Fox, an alumnus of the Cathedral School, and carried out in 1714 by Thomas Naish, Clerk of Works to the Cathedral to provide a classroom and further dormitories for the cathedral choristers. It has little proven connection with Christopher Wren except that in its style it provides a suitable memorial to that great Wiltshire born architect. After the removal of the Choir School the College of Sarum St Michael acquired it for a short period until it became the diocesan <b>archive</b> <b>repository.</b> In the 1980`s it was used as the Salisbury Cathedral Spire Appeal office and in the past few years has become a Cathedral educational resource centre for school visits.
