5|$|Darwin's theory {{followed}} {{from his}} understanding that coral polyps {{thrive in the}} clean seas of the tropics where the water is agitated, but can only live within a limited depth of water, starting just below low tide. Where {{the level of the}} underlying land stays the same, the corals grow around the coast to form what he called fringing reefs, and can eventually grow out from the shore to become <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> reef. Where the land is rising, fringing reefs can grow around the coast, but coral raised above sea level dies and becomes white limestone. If the land subsides slowly, the fringing reefs keep pace by growing upwards on a base of dead coral, and form <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> reef enclosing a lagoon between the reef and the land. <b>A</b> <b>barrier</b> reef can encircle an island, and once the island sinks below sea level a roughly circular atoll of growing coral continues {{to keep up with the}} sea level, forming a central lagoon. Should the land subside too quickly or sea level rise too fast, the coral dies as it is below its habitable depth.|$|E

5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> island that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two halves of the island.|$|E

50|$|Common {{measures}} {{of the effectiveness of}} a building envelope include physical protection from weather and climate (comfort), indoor air quality (hygiene and public health), durability and energy efficiency. In order to achieve these objectives, all building enclosure systems must include a solid structure, a drainage plane, <b>an</b> air <b>barrier,</b> <b>a</b> thermal <b>barrier,</b> and may include <b>a</b> vapor <b>barrier.</b> Moisture control (e.g. damp proofing) is essential in all climates, but cold climates and hot-humid climates are especially demanding.|$|R
5|$|One study {{published}} in 2003 suggested that curve-billed speciation was due to climate, which {{could be explained by}} molt and feather wear. The same study suggested that the Sierra Madre Occidental acts as <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> to initiate differentiation within the species.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>barrier</b> jet in the {{low levels}} forms just {{upstream}} of mountain chains, with the mountains forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to the mountains. The mountain barrier increases {{the strength of the}} low level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Another {{quantum effect}} that predicts the {{occurrence}} of faster-than-light speeds is called the Hartman effect; under certain conditions the time needed for a virtual particle to tunnel through <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> is constant, regardless of {{the thickness of the}} barrier. This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster-than-light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> restricted-access <b>barrier</b> system (RABS) is an {{installation}} {{which is used}} in many industries, such as pharmaceutical, medical, chemical, electrical engineering where clean air is needed.

5|$|As 1943 {{gave way}} to 1944, many {{problems}} remained. Tests began on the machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without <b>a</b> <b>barrier.</b> Attention turned to a new process developed by Kellex. Finally, in July 1944, Kellex barriers began to be installed in K-25. K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of the}} product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment. Uranium partially enriched in K-25 was fed into the calutrons at Y-12 to complete the enrichment process.|$|E
5|$|Contraceptive sponges combine <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, {{they are}} {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective. Typical failure rates {{during the first year}} depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth, being 24% in those who have and 12% in those who have not. The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward. Allergic reactions and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported.|$|E
5|$|Dental {{sealants}} {{are another}} preventive therapy {{often used to}} provide <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> to bacteria and decay {{on the surface of}} teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in an procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.|$|E

30|$|The {{electronic}} coupling in vertically aligned InAs/GaAs quantum dot (QD) pairs is investigated by photoluminescence (PL) measurements. A thin Al 0.5 Ga 0.5 <b>As</b> <b>barrier</b> greatly changes the energy transfer {{process and the}} optical performance of the QD pairs. As a result, the QD PL intensity ratio shows different dependence on the intensity and wavelength of the excitation laser. Time-resolved PL measurements give a carrier tunneling time of 380 ps from the seed layer QDs to the top layer QDs while it elongates to 780 ps after inserting the thin Al 0.5 Ga 0.5 <b>As</b> <b>barrier.</b> These results provide useful information for fabrication and investigation of artificial QD molecules for implementing quantum computation applications.|$|R
5|$|E. coli stains Gram-negative {{because its}} cell wall is {{composed}} of a thin peptidoglycan layer and an outer membrane. During the staining process, E. coli picks up {{the color of the}} counterstain safranin and stains pink. The outer membrane surrounding the cell wall provides <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> to certain antibiotics such that E. coli is not damaged by penicillin.|$|E
5|$|Gastric acid acts as <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> against {{microorganisms}} {{to prevent}} infections and {{is important for}} the digestion of food. Its low pH denatures proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as pepsin. The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin by self-cleavage. After leaving the stomach, the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the duodenum by sodium bicarbonate.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, BART stated its {{intention}} to improve non-peak (night and weekend) headways for each line to 15 minutes. The current 20-minute headways at these times is <b>a</b> <b>barrier</b> to ridership. In mid-2007, BART temporarily reversed its position stating that the shortened wait times would likely not happen due to a $900,000 state revenue budget shortfall. Nevertheless, BART eventually confirmed {{the implementation of the}} plan by January 2008. Continued budgetary problems halted the expanded non-peak service and returned off-peak headways to 20 minutes in 2009.|$|E
