40|$|Trends {{in spring}} and fall <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of birds {{migrating}} to their breeding (spring) and wintering (fall) grounds in Northern California vary among species. Over a 36 -year period at the Point Reyes Bird Observatory’s (PRBO) Palomarin Field Station on Point Reyes Peninsula, Wilson’s Warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) have been arriving significantly earlier in recent years, a pattern shown by several other songbird species (MacMynowski et al. 2007). In contrast, spring <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of Swainson’s Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) have been remarkably stable. Fall arrivals of Ruby-crowned Kinglets (Regulus calendula) from more northerly breeding grounds show a significant fit to a quadratic regression, arriving earlier from 1971 until the mid 1980 s, then reversing to arrive later in the fall.

The violent south-southwesterly gale lasted 15 hours when the vessel was probably located at 20.5°N, 47°W. The storm was initially assigned a single set of coordinates for October 6, and no attempt was made to reconstruct its track due to a lack of certain data on it. However, it was noted that a ship further north on October 9 experienced a heavy gale. Based on the likely correlation between the two ship reports, the storm's track was extended four days to late on October 9 in the Atlantic hurricane database.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in spring <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> {{have been reported}} in many migratory species but the mechanism driving these advances is unknown. As population declines are most widely reported in species that are not advancing migration, there is an urgent need to identify the mechanisms facilitating and constraining these advances. Individual plasticity in timing of migration in response to changing climatic conditions is commonly proposed to drive these advances but plasticity in individual migratory timings is rarely observed. For a shorebird population that has significantly advanced migration in recent decades, we show that individual <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> are highly consistent between years, but that the <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of new recruits to the population are significantly earlier now than in previous years. Several mechanisms could drive {{advances in}} recruit arrival, none of which require individual plasticity or rapid evolution of migration timings. In particular, advances in nest-laying dates could result in advanced recruit arrival, if benefits of early hatching facilitate early subsequent spring migration. This mechanism could also explain why <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> of short-distance migrants, which generally return to breeding sites earlier and have greater scope for advance laying, are advancing more rapidly than long-distance migrants...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of studies have {{documented}} shifts in avian migratory phenology in response to climate change, and yet there is a large amount of unexplained variation in the magnitude of those responses across species and geographic regions. We use a database of citizen science bird observations to explore spatiotemporal variation in mean <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> across an unprecedented geographic extent for 18 common species in North America over the past decade, relating <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> to mean minimum spring temperature. Across all species and geographic locations, species shifted <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> 0. 8 days earlier for every °C of warming of spring temperature, but it was common for some species in some locations to shift as much as 3 - 6 days earlier per °C. Species that advanced <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> the earliest in response to warming were those that migrate more slowly, short distance migrants, and species with broader climatic niches. These three variables explained 63 % of the interspecific variation in phenological response. We also identify a latitudinal gradient in the average strength of phenological response, with species shifting arrival earlier at southern latitudes than northern latitudes for the same degree of warming. This observation is consistent with the idea that species must be more phenologically sensitive in less seasonal environments to maintain the same degree of precision in phenological timing...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} first arrival and last {{departure}} dates of migrant bird species from, respectively, six and three English area bird reports. Of all 145 bird series, 50 % demonstrated significantly earlier arrival {{in recent years}} with the average advance over all species being 0. 25 days/year or 12 days earlier over 50 years. 30 % of 67 series demonstrated significantly later departure, with the average species delay being 0. 16 days/year or 8 days later over 50 years. There was greater consistency between species in trends in first arrival than in last departure, with species such as sand martin Riparia riparia significantly earlier at all six sites while, for example, spotted flycatcher Muscicapa striata showed no significant change in arrival at all sites. Significant negative correlations between <b>arrival</b> <b>dates</b> and English temperatures were found for 26 % of all series but temperature effects on departures were less clear.
