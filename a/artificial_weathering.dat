40|$|This {{simulation}} {{research was}} conducted {{in order to develop}} a large-fire risk assessment system for the contiguous land area of the United States. The modeling system was applied to each of 134 Fire Planning Units (FPUs) to estimate burn probabilities and fire size distributions. To obtain stable estimates of these quantities, fire ignition and growth was simulated for 10, 000 to 50, 000 ‘‘years’’ of <b>artificial</b> <b>weather.</b> The fire growth simulations, when run repeatedly with different weather and ignition locations, produce burn probabilities and fire behavior distributions at each landscape location (e. g., number of times a ‘‘cell’’ burns at a given intensity divided by the total years). The <b>artificial</b> <b>weather</b> was generated for each land unit using (1) a fire danger rating index known as the Energy Release Component (ERC) which is a proxy for fuel moisture contents, (2) a time-series analysis of ERC to represent daily and seasonal variability, and (3) distributions of wind speed and direction from weather records. Large fire occurrence was stochastically modeled based on historical relationships to ERC. The simulations also required spatial data on fuel structure and topography which were acquired from the LANDFIRE project ([URL] Fire suppression effects were represented by a statistical model that yields a probability of fire containment based on independent predictors of fire growth rates and fuel type. The simulated burn probabilities were comparable to observed patterns across the U. S. over the range of four orders of magnitude, generally falling within a factor of 3 or 4 of historical estimates. Close agreement between simulated and historical fire size distributions suggest that fire sizes are determined by the joint distributions of spatial opportunities for fire growth (dependent on fuels and ignition location) and the temporal opportunities produced by conducive weather sequences. The research demonstrates a practical approach to using fire simulations at very broad scales for purposes of operational planning and perhaps ecological research...|$|R

The nanocomposites were prepared by mixing the C 30 B in PLA matrix using two stages of extrusion followed by injection molding. In addition, we also studied materials without C 30 B in PLA matrix prepared by a single stage of injection, {{as well as with}} two stages of extrusion followed by injection, in order to assess thermal effects. XRD (X-ray diffraction) and TEM (Transmission electron microscope) were used to determine the layer dispersion of the C 30 B within the PLA. An increase in the interlayer spacing of a sandwich structure corresponding to a partial exfoliation of the C 30 B was found, leading to the creation of small particles at nanoscale of one (1. 29 nm) to eight (11. 76 nm) platelets. Also, GPC (Gel permeation chromatography) was used to evaluate the molecular weight decay of neat PLA and its nanocomposites due to thermal processing and subsequent <b>artificial</b> <b>weathering</b> exposure. From thermal processing, a more significant decrease of polydispersity in amorphous PLA than in semicrystalline PLA counterparts could be observed.

The analysis shows that the diatomite particles (15 – 20 [*]μm in radius) are large and have strong hygroscopic property (absorbing cloud water). As a result, during the experiment, spreading large diatomite particles lead to downward motion (producing more stable atmospheric condition) and reduction of cloud water.
