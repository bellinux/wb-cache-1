At the forest site, mostly C 3 -amines (from pptv {{to tens of}} pptv) and ammonia (up to 2 ppbv) were detected, and they both showed temperature dependencies. Aerosol-phase amines measured thermal-desorption chemical ionization mass spectrometer (TDCIMS) showed a higher mass fraction in the evening with cooler temperatures and lower in the afternoon with warmer temperatures, a trend opposite to the gas-phase <b>amines.</b> <b>Concentrations</b> of aerosol-phase primary amines measured with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) from micron and submicron particles were 2 orders of magnitude higher than the gas-phase amines. These results indicate that gas to particle conversion {{is one of the}} major processes that control the ambient <b>amine</b> <b>concentrations</b> at this forest site. Temperature dependencies of C 3 -amines and ammonia also imply reversible processes of evaporation of these nitrogen-containing compounds from soil surfaces in daytime and deposition to soil surfaces at nighttime. During the transported biomass burning plume events, various amines (C 1 –C 6) appeared at the pptv level, indicating that biomass burning is a substantial source of amines in the southeastern US. At the moderately polluted Kent site, there were higher concentrations of C 1 - to C 6 -amines (pptv to tens of pptv) and ammonia (up to 6 ppbv). C 1 - to C 3 -amines and ammonia were well correlated with the ambient temperature. C 4 - to C 6 -amines showed frequent spikes during the nighttime, suggesting that they were emitted from local sources. These abundant amines and ammonia may in part explain the frequent new particle formation events reported from Kent.

The carcasses of feathered game (Phasianus colchicus), left entirely untreated after hunting and placed in a storage space at a pre-set temperature of 7 °C for 21 days were used in the study.

Measurement of biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, tyramine, tryptamine, histamine, phenylethylamine) was based on high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Higher biogenic amine concentrations were detected in the muscles (both breast and thigh) of pheasants hanging by their legs compared to pheasants hanging by their heads (no statistically significant difference in biogenic <b>amine</b> <b>concentration</b> between monitored groups was, however, established). Higher concentrations of biogenic amines were found in the thigh muscles compared to breast muscles in both monitored groups.

The study of <b>amine</b> <b>concentration</b> and lean loading in conventional process shows that the optimal lean loading increases with MEA concentration rising, but it basically keeps constant in DEA. Moreover, reboiler duty is more sensitive to lean loading in processes using MEA than DEA. Both for MEA and DEA, higher pressure is beneficial to reducing total energy consumption {{in all of the}} processes. The effect of lean solvent loading on process modifications for MEA and DEA is pretty different, and the minimum point of total equivalent work also depends on amine type and process.

30|$|Both {{permeate}} flux {{and salt}} rejection ability {{depend on the}} polyamide layer density, which is related to cross-linking density [39]. The polymer density across the barrier layer is not uniform [40]. The core layer (near the original MPD/TMC interface) is the most dense region, and the polymer density decreases gradually as the polymer grows further into the organic phase [41, 42]. In many applications of interfacial polymerization using MPD and TMC, the initial <b>amine</b> <b>concentration</b> {{is much higher than}} the acyl chloride concentration. Whether the <b>amine</b> <b>concentration</b> is decreased or the acyl chloride concentration is increased, this results in a more dense polyamide layer, compared with those prepared using higher amine/acid chloride molar ratios [43]. An increase in density or in thickness of the MPD/TMC barrier layer would increase the mass transfer resistance of the resulting membrane, thereby reducing permeate flux. Thus, varying the initial concentration of monomers can influence the membrane’s water and salt transport properties.|$|E

Detection of ammonia and amines other than dimethyl amine is discussed. We also report results from the first ambient measurements performed in spring 2013 at a boreal forest site. While minute signals above the signal-to-noise ratio that could be attributed to trimethyl or propyl amine were observed, DMA concentration never exceeded the detection threshold of ambient measurements (150 ppqV), thereby questioning, though not excluding, the role of DMA in nucleation at this location...|$|R
40|$|Acidization {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} techniques to increase the productivity of crude petroleum oil and gas wells. The effective way for protecting these oil well tubular materials is by using corrosion inhibitors during the acidization process. The present study deals with the evaluation of inhibition effect of ethanolamines on oil well tubular materials of grade N- 80 steel in 15 percent hydrochloric acid at room temperature with 0 - 2 percent <b>amine</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The <b>amines</b> such as mono, di and triethanolamine were studied for their inhibiting capacity by mass loss method, DC polarization method and AC impedance method. The inhibitor efficiency increases with increasing <b>concentration</b> of <b>amines.</b> Monoethanolamine is found to be more effective than the other two amine...|$|R
