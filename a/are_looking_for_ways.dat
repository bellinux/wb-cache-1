500|$|The {{restoration}} of the Everglades is an ongoing effort to remedy damage inflicted on the environment of southern Florida during the 20th century. It {{is the most expensive}} and comprehensive environmental repair attempt in history. The degradation of the Everglades became an issue in the United States in the early 1970s after a proposal to construct a jetport in the Big Cypress Swamp. Studies indicated the airport would have destroyed the ecosystem in South Florida and Everglades National Park.
