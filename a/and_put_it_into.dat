He has become a bizarre {{creature}} – part octopus, part lobster, part man. Jones collects the souls of dead or dying sailors to serve aboard his ship for one hundred years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work would contribute to a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E

Shapiro also {{observed}} an empty P2P bottle at the house. Two days later, he returned with 100 g of P2P.

Patrick Connolly finished the rest of the process, and Shapiro stopped by the next morning to pick up his half of the meth. He also bought a portion of the remainder for $60.|$|E
25|$|According to Indian {{military}} sources, the Pakistani Army {{prepared a}} plan called Operation Gulmarg <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> action {{as early as}} 20 August, {{a few days after}} Pakistan's independence. The plan got accidentally revealed to an Indian officer, Major O. S. Kalkat serving with the Bannu Brigade. According to the plan, 20 lashkars (tribal militias), each consisting of 1000 Pashtun tribesmen, were to be recruited from among various Pashtun tribes, and armed at the brigade headquarters at Bannu, Wanna, Peshawar, Kohat, Thall and Nowshera by the first week of September. They were expected to reach the launching point of Abbottabad on 18 October, and cross into Jammu and Kashmir on 22 October. Ten lashkars were expected to attack the Kashmir Valley through Muzaffarabad and another ten lashkars were expected to join the rebels in Poonch, Bhimber and Rawalakot with a view to advance to Jammu. Detailed arrangements for the military leadership and armaments were described in the plan.|$|E

500|$|Besides 3D effects, {{the filmmakers}} also used 2D artwork and {{drawings}} for specific elements and sequences in the film, including Elsa's magic and snow sculptures, {{as well as}} freezing fountains and floors.

500|$|The {{major part}} of the Royal Navy's {{strength}} was deployed at home in the Grand Fleet, with the primary aim of drawing the German High Seas Fleet into an engagement. No decisive victory ever came. The Royal Navy and the German Imperial Navy did come into contact, notably in the Battle of Heligoland Bight, and at the Battle of Jutland. In view of their inferior numbers and firepower, the Germans devised a plan to draw part of the British fleet into a trap <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> effect at Jutland in , but the result was inconclusive.

500|$|Congress {{eventually}} {{passed a}} watered-down {{version of the}} original plan put forward by Bedell and Senator Pete Domenici. The compromise version enacted a tax on the gasoline barges used <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a [...] "trust" [...] for waterway projects. While other supporters of waterway usage fees, including Domenici, backed the compromise, Bedell gave a passioned plea for his colleagues to oppose it. He viewed it as lacking a crucial element of the original plan - that of capital recovery. The trust was optional, and the Government could spend money on waterway projects irrespective of the trust. The compromise was eventually signed by Jimmy Carter. Bedell's original plan never {{made it through the}} House of Representatives, but he continued to introduce it in succeeding sessions. It would not, however, get a floor vote in succeeding sessions.|$|E
500|$|Director Ardolino {{encouraged}} the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling, even if actors went [...] "off script". One {{example of this}} was the scene where Grey was {{to stand in front}} of Swayze with her back to him and put her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar to the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and tender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior annoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, [...] "as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film." ...|$|E

However, the deadline given for accepting a track was only three days. The only song the band had completed in any shape or form was [...] "Vow". After Volume was released in December 1994, [...] "Vow" [...] began to receive radio airplay from BBC Radio 1 DJs Steve Lamacq, John Peel and Johnnie Walker, and record stores in the United Kingdom began to receive requests for a single that did not yet exist.

500|$|On 5 June 2003 Gjelsten told Koppel {{he could}} not go on subsidising Wimbledon F.C., and {{withheld}} the scheduled monthly injection of £800,000. Koppel declared Wimbledon F.C. insolvent the next day <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> administration with reported debts of £3.5million. John Gurney, who had just become the chairman of Luton Town following a takeover by a consortium from Hong Kong and the United States, briefly floated the idea of buying Wimbledon F.C. and merging it with Luton, in his words [...] "effectively buying a back door to Division One" [...] (Luton were in the division below), but was soon after ousted by Luton supporters. In late June, after Wimbledon F.C. missed a deadline to invest in renovations to the Hockey Stadium, the National Hockey Foundation pulled out of discussions over the ground's use, creating confusion as to where the club would now be located. The administrators stated on 27 June that as things stood the move to Milton Keynes was off. A week later, after Watford had refused to let Wimbledon F.C. share their ground at Vicarage Road, the administrators announced a return to Selhurst Park.|$|E

[...] "I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', {{and it was like}} whoa [...] this is trippy. After 20 seconds, it quickly fell apart and you realized how it actually works, and it wasn't that impressive. But it was still, for 20 seconds, really exciting. The more people that talked to it, the smarter it got." [...] Jonze's interest in the project was renewed after directing the short film I'm Here (2010), which shares similar themes. Inspiration also came from Kaufman's writing approach for Synecdoche, New York (2008). Jonze explained, [...] " [...] said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the script.
