40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 63) Cancer is {{a devastating}} disease. The {{realities of the}} illness and its treatment, however, are {{only a part of}} the cancer patient???s life. Cancer causes a whirlpool of emotional and social problems in the lives of both patients <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Cancer patients <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> need to manage their emotional reactions to this life-threatening disease, get through treatment, <b>and</b> redefine <b>their</b> life priorities. They may be challenged to adjust to new <b>family</b> roles, <b>and</b> reestablish <b>their</b> social support systems. Such problems cannot be resolved with a simple prescription. In addition to medical support, cancer patients <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> need psychosocial support. 	This project features a workbook designed for mental health professionals who will be, or are interested in, working with cancer patients <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> This project contains a literature review of previous studies and research regarding psychosocial support for cancer patients <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> Such studies indicate that although concepts of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) are more socially accepted, and thus, more psychosocial support for caner patients <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families</b> is available, there still are many cancer patients and families who struggle with difficult cancer-related problems, and feel isolated and hopeless. 	The purpose of this workbook is to help mental health professionals support cancer patients <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families.</b> This workbook includes, therefore, useful information about cancer, psycho-oncology, psychosocial needs of cancer patients <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>families,</b> <b>and</b> psychotherapeutic interventions to meet such needs. The workbook also contains information about hospice care, palliative care, and loss and grief...|$|R

5|$|John Gilchriese {{became friends}} with John Flood, who had been Wyatt Earp’s secretary, confidante, and best friend for many years. When Earp died, Flood {{inherited}} many of his personal belongings. Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese, who amassed {{over a number of}} years one of the largest collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp, along with many unpublished photos of them <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family.</b> Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval to paint the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. The oil on masonite painting titled The Street Fight is 6 feet 4 inches by 4 feet (1.93 m by 1.22 m). It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval. He referred to original documents in Gilchriese's collection, including Wyatt Earp's own diagram of the shootout, and unpublished notes made by John Flood, to create what is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout. Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints reproduced from the original, which Perceval signed. The prints were sold by the museum for $10.|$|E
5|$|Ranulf of Chester {{remained}} {{upset over}} Stephen's {{gift of the}} north of England to Prince Henry. Ranulf devised a plan {{for dealing with the}} problem by ambushing Henry whilst the prince was travelling back from Stephen's court to Scotland after Christmas. Stephen responded to rumours of this plan by escorting Henry himself north, but this gesture proved the final straw for Ranulf. Ranulf had previously claimed that he had the rights to Lincoln Castle, held by Stephen, and under the guise of a social visit, Ranulf seized the fortification in a surprise attack. Stephen marched north to Lincoln and agreed to a truce with Ranulf, probably to keep him from joining the Empress's faction, under which Ranulf would be allowed to keep the castle. Stephen returned to London but received news that Ranulf, his brother <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> were relaxing in Lincoln Castle with a minimal guard force, a ripe target for a surprise attack of his own. Abandoning the deal he had just made, Stephen gathered his army again and sped north, but not quite fast enough—Ranulf escaped Lincoln and declared his support for the Empress, and Stephen was forced to place the castle under siege.|$|E

5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>family</b> and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5 billion.|$|E
