5|$|One major {{advantage}} of genome-scale RNAi screening {{is its ability}} to simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes. With the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> a large amount of data per experiment, genome-scale RNAi screening has led to an explosion data generation rates. Exploiting such large data sets is a fundamental challenge, requiring suitable statistics/bioinformatics methods. The basic process of cell-based RNAi screening includes the choice of an RNAi library, robust and stable cell types, transfection with RNAi agents, treatment/incubation, signal detection, analysis and identification of important genes or therapeutical targets.|$|E

5|$|Five of the state's {{counties}} are wholly {{within the boundaries}} of sovereign Indian reservations. Because of the limitations of climate and land, and isolation from urban areas with more employment opportunities, living standards on many South Dakota reservations are often far below the national average; Ziebach County ranked as the poorest county in the nation in 2009. The unemployment rate in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Reservation, is 70%, and 21% of households lack plumbing or basic kitchen appliances. A 1995 study by the U.S. Census Bureau found 58% of homes on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation did not have a telephone. The reservations' isolation also inhibits their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> revenue from gaming casinos, an avenue that has proved profitable for many tribes closer to urban centers.|$|E

They rescue dwellers from the wasteland and assign them to different resource-generating buildings in the Vault, using the SPECIAL statistics system from the other Fallout games. Each character's SPECIAL profile affects their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> different resources, and their statistics can be increased by training them in rooms devoted to each stat. The dwellers can level up over time, increasing their health, and can be given new items and weapons to help with various tasks.

Ron's personal fears, insecurities and clumsiness sometimes {{have a tendency to}} jeopardize the success of their own missions. Kim and Ron are aided remotely by Wade, a 10 year-old computer genius who seldom leaves his bedroom and communicates with the duo via device he invented himself known as a Kimmunicator. Together, the foursome is known as Team Possible. The majority of Kim's missions involve her traveling to various destinations around the world to rescue citizens from harm and battle a variety of enemies and villains, the most frequent of whom are Dr. Drakken, a mad scientist constantly plotting world domination, and his superpowered sidekick Shego, who possesses the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> powerful energy blasts and emit them from her hands, making her the heroine's most dangerous opponent.

40|$|Opportunity {{identification}} and, in particular, {{the generation}} of new business ideas is becoming {{an important element of}} entrepreneurship education.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> remember specific past personal events as well as the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> specific future events in patients with bipolar disorders (BD). Moreover, the study investigated whether the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> specific events is related <b>to</b> the <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> solve interpersonal problems which was measured using the Optional Thinking Test (OTT) (Platt & Spivack, 1977). Method: Nineteen patients with bipolar disorders and 17 healthy subjects completed validated French versions (Neumann & Philippot, 2006) of the AMT Williams & Broadbent (1986). Participants were instructed <b>to</b> <b>generate</b> specific past and future memories in response to cues words. For the OTT, they were asked to yield the most solutions as possible to daily problems. Results: For the past events task, the analysis revealed a significant group by memory interaction (F(2, 68) = 4. 0; p=. 023) which indicates that the patients with BD recollected less specific events and more overgeneral events than controls. For the future events task, a significant group by memory interaction emerged (F(2, 68) = 7. 85; p<. 001) which indicates that the patients with BD were less specific and yielded more overgeneral memories than the control group. Further, the numbers of specific past and future events were correlated to the numbers of solutions to interpersonal problems (r(36) =. 57; p<. 001, r(36) =. 43; p=. 009, respectively). Conclusion: the results are consistent with previous studies that have examined autobiographical memory (AM) specificity in patients with BD (Scott et al., 2000; Mansell & Lam, 2004). These results support the notion of impairments in imagining specific past and future events BD patients. The difficulty in imagining the future may contribute to relapse. Thus, AM remediation program could be an additional useful tool to develop in CBT for bipolar patients...|$|R
