5|$|Calhoun's {{ideas on}} the {{concurrent}} majority are illustrated in A Disquisition on Government. The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive <b>and</b> <b>comprehensive</b> ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.|$|E

The publication also had a general description of the Oregon Country, {{a detailed description of}} the Willamette Valley, and included a copy of the Organic Laws of Oregon adopted by settlers at the Champoeg Meetings. It was a popular guidebook for immigrants for the next ten years.|$|E
5|$|The Malay Archipelago {{attracted}} many reviews, {{with interest}} from scientific, geographic, church and general periodicals. Reviewers noted and sometimes disagreed with various of his theories, especially {{the division of}} fauna and flora along what soon {{became known as the}} Wallace line, natural selection and uniformitarianism. Nearly all agreed that he had provided an interesting <b>and</b> <b>comprehensive</b> account of the geography, natural history, and peoples of the archipelago, which was little known to their readers at the time, and that he had collected an astonishing number of specimens. The book is much cited, and is Wallace's most successful, both commercially and as a piece of literature.|$|E

5|$|The {{proteasome}} and its subunits are {{of clinical}} significance {{for at least}} two reasons: (1) a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome can be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of specific diseases, and (2) they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions. More recently, more effort has been made to consider the proteasome for the development of novel diagnostic markers and strategies. An improved <b>and</b> <b>comprehensive</b> understanding of the pathophysiology of the proteasome should lead to clinical applications in the future.|$|E
5|$|Abovian's poetry {{was filled}} with satire best {{expressed}} in The wine jug, in which he criticized Russian bureaucracy. Leisure entertainment was adapted by Abovian from notes he took in public gatherings. The work {{is a collection of}} fables in verse that chastise vice, injustice and moral degeneration. He wrote scientific and artistic non-fiction works such as the Discovery of America and Book of Stories. Abovian translated to the Armenian language the works of Homer, Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Nikolay Karamzin, I. A. Krylov and others. He continued promoting secular <b>and</b> <b>comprehensive</b> (mental, moral, working, physical) training, school accessibility, free education for the indigent and equal education of boys and girls. Pedagogical compositions of Abovian include the book for reading Introduction to education (1838), a textbook of Russian grammar and an Armenian-language novel History of Tigran, or a moral manual for the Armenian children (printed in 1941). He was the first Armenian to study scientific ethnography: the way of life and customs of the peasants of the native settlements around Kanaker, inhabitants of Yerevan, and gathered and studied Armenian and Kurdish folklore.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{observations}} of the carnivorous syndrome in plant species have been restricted to the more obvious examples of carnivory, such as the active trapping mechanisms of Drosera and Dionaea, though authors have often noted speculation about other species {{that may not be}} so obviously carnivorous. In one of the earlier publications on carnivorous plants, Charles Darwin had suggested many plants that have developed adhesive glands, such as Erica tetralix, Mirabilis longifolia, Pelargonium zonale, Primula sinesis, and Saxifraga umbrosa, may indeed be carnivorous but little research has been done on them. Darwin himself only mentioned these species in passing and did not follow through with any investigation. Adding to the small but growing list, Francis Lloyd provided his own list of species suspected of carnivory in his 1942 book on carnivorous plants, though these species and their potential were only mentioned in the introduction. Later, in a 1981 review of the literature, Paul Simons rediscovered Italian journal articles from the early 1900s that identified several additional sticky species that digested insect prey. Simons was surprised to find these articles lacking in the literature cited sections of many modern books and articles on carnivorous plants, suggesting that academic research has treated Lloyd's 1942 book as the authoritative <b>and</b> <b>comprehensive</b> source on pre-1942 research on the carnivorous syndrome.|$|E

5|$|The Restudy {{came with}} a plan to stop the declining {{environmental}} quality, and this proposal was to be the most expensive <b>and</b> <b>comprehensive</b> ecological repair project in history. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) proposed more than 60construction projects over 30years to store water that was being flushed into the ocean, in reservoirs, underground aquifers, and abandoned quarries; add more Stormwater Treatment Areas to filter water that flowed into the lower Everglades; regulate water released from pumping stations into local waterways and improve water released to Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Areas; remove barriers to sheetflow by raising the Tamiami Trail and destroying the Miami Canal, and reuse wastewater for urban areas. The cost estimate for the entire plan was $7.8billion, and in a bipartisan show of cooperation, CERP was voted through Congress with an overwhelming margin. It was signed by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Turtle was {{the first}} {{submersible}} vessel used for combat {{and led to the}} development of what we know today as the modern submarine, forever changing underwater warfare and the face of naval warfare. As such, the Turtle has been replicated many times to show new audience the roots of submarine technology, how much it has changed, and the influence it has had on modern submarines. By the 1950s, historian of technology Brooke Hindle credited the Turtle as “the greatest of the wartime inventions.” The Turtle remains a source of national as well as regional pride, which led to the construction of several replicas, a number of which exist in Bushnell’s home state of Connecticut. As Benjamin Gale noted in 1775, the vessel was “constructed with great simplicity,” and it has thus inspired at least four replicas. Many of these followed the designs set down by Bushnell, with “precise <b>and</b> <b>comprehensive</b> descriptions of his submarine,” which aided the replication process.|$|E
