40|$|This study {{argues that}} if we, really, accept English {{as a global}} language, and {{diversity}} of cultures, we have {{to better understand the}} different composing conventions of different cultures; otherwise, written communication among people of different cultures may break down. This argument is theoretically based on a number of premises drawn from Purves’s (1988) extensive research in contrastive rhetoric. With this in mind, the present study attempts to show how Arabic and Spanish speakers narrate in English and, to what extent <b>their</b> native cultures <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> narrative <b>written</b> <b>productions.</b>   In addition, some of the cognitive factors that may shape the subjects’ <b>written</b> <b>productions</b> were discussed. Using Laböv’ sociolinguistic model of narrative structure, this study shows that the narrative texts of both Arabic and Spanish speakers share almost all the structural properties of Laböv’s model.   This finding may lead us to claim that regardless of the subjects’ linguistic and cultural backgrounds, the narrative structural components seem to be somehow universal. This claim needs to be tested with low-level subjects of various languages and cultures...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to highlight the need to advise students to revise <b>their</b> online <b>written</b> <b>productions</b> to avoid the incorrect use of forms which differ from their L 1. In order to do so, this paper explores a specific error: misuse of the initialism ‘ICT’. Even though the analysis deals with this term, the conclusion can be applied to similar cases. The subjects are university students who use English as a vehicular language in the classroom but who have very different levels of proficiency. After analysing <b>their</b> <b>written</b> <b>productions</b> in an online forum it was observed that misuse of ‘ICT’ could be either an error, due to a gap in knowledge, or a mistake, due to interlingual transfer. Taking Selinker’s (1972) and Corder’s (1981) theories as a starting point, we then explore what to do in these cases considering the specific form of instruction that these students receive. Consequently, explicit teaching of the term in the classroom is proposed taking into account the learners’ age factor and the revised theories...|$|R

In order to find evidence of this a field study was carried out focusing on the results of bilingal and monolingual students in National tests in English. The field study indicated that the monolingual students generally performed better {{in all parts of the}} test. The reason for this is mainly because of the fact that the bilingual students' greatest difficulty was spelling.
