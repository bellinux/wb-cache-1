500|$|Hollyoaks devised an arson plot {{to begin}} on Guy Fawkes Night 2010, {{as a result}} of which some {{characters}} would die. The production team intended to keep details of who would die secret until transmission. Prior to broadcast, Stenson revealed that Steph would risk her own life to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies), Leah Barnes (Jessica Croft-Lane) and Lucas Hay. The actress explained that [...] "She stares death in the face every day because of her cancer, so thinks she really has nothing to lose now." [...] Stenson performed one of her own stunts during filming, with the rest undertaken by a stunt double. A promotional trailer for the episodes aired across the Channel 4 network, featuring Steph on fire. In the event, Steph rescued Amy and her children from a burning building but refused to leave herself, saying she was ready to die. Her exit received a positive reaction from fans on the social networking website Twitter, with Stenson stating that she was [...] "honoured" [...] by the response. Steph's legacy continued following her death, with her husband, family and friends left {{to come to terms with}} their grief. On 29 November 2011 it was confirmed Stenson was to reprise the role for a one off guest appearance as Steph in which she appears as an angel to Doug Carter who had attempted suicide and she convinces him that his life matters. Steph tells Doug something and he shows Frankie a special song that Steph had recorded for her. Frankie, overjoyed that her daughter had not forgotten her, wept whilst Angel Steph looked on happily and placed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder before winking to Tom and returning to heaven, stating she was [...] "ready for her solo." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{scenes from}} the {{original}} episode were seen as vulgar and {{were removed from the}} television broadcast. [...] One of the scenes removed was {{from the beginning of the}} episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching Genital Hospital, a reference to the television show General Hospital. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno. Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on Adult Swim every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex). In this scene, Peter refers to the Grimace as Ronald McDonald's autistic friend, which was originally penned as [...] "retarded friend" [...] (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird tasting Smuckers jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on his crotch. In a scene added later to the episode, Mel Gibson apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that now that he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering Herbert's house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV. The original ending of this episode (with the [...] "choose your own ending" [...] text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.|$|E

60|$|She knelt there, lost to {{everything}} but the loveliness around her, until she was startled by <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. Marilla had come in unheard by the small dreamer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm deshed," [...] he murmured. Ann became interested. He laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm and pointed. Ann scrutinised the Labyrinthodon {{and then}} came around to Kipps' face in mute interrogation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{very much}} obliged to you," [...] she said haughtily {{as she turned}} away. But Gilbert had also sprung from the boat and now laid <b>a</b> detaining <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|R

6000|$|Daisy looked conscious, but answered, with a smile, and <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> necklace, [...] "This {{old thing}} wouldn't look well in my pretty box, so I'll leave it empty till I can afford {{something}} better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not talking}} {{out of any}} novel that ever was written," [...] said Bobus seriously; but she was {{speeding}} on too fast to heed him, and started as he laid <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|E

60|$|She {{leaned on}} the mantelpiece, burying {{her face in her}} arms, and burst into a passion of sobs. Rutherford leaped up, shocked and helpless. He sprang to her, and placed <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have sent}} for you, Corny," [...] she said, laying <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> heart, {{as if to}} quiet its throbbings, [...] "to say one word {{in the way of}} caution--I hope it is not wrong." ...|$|E
60|$|The girl sat very insecurely, {{clinging}} fast. He put <b>a</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> waist, {{to support}} her. And {{he held her}} closely, he clasped her as in an embrace, he was weak with desire as he strode beside her.|$|E
6000|$|Serviss rose, {{his blood}} astir. At last {{he was about}} to remove his doubt--or prove Viola's guilt.
