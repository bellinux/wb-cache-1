40|$|Important {{reactions}} of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> are the chain oxidation of NO and CO. Thus: H 2 O + NO yields OH + NO 2; OH + CO yields H + CO 2; H + O 2 + M yields HO 2 + M. In most models, {{the need to}} know the <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> concentration could also be described as the {{need to know the}} rate of the above oxidation chain in the atmosphere. It is the total rate of this chain (also carried by RO 2 and RO) which was measured using the PERCA. The PERCA is thus essentially a RO sub X meter. The PERCA works by adding excess CO (10 %) and NO (5 ppm) to a stream of air and measuring the NO 2 produced after 3 s of reaction time. Since other processes produce NO 2, the chain reaction is modulated by switching the CO for N 2. The chain length is limited by the reaction OH + NO yields HONO and is modeled to be somewhat over 1000. Measured chain lengths agree with the modeled numbers...|$|R

Nevertheless, non-radical oxidants like hydrogen peroxide and ozone {{also contribute to the}} degradation and conversion of this substance group (Tilgner und Herrmann, 2010). In this work kinetic investigations of non-radical reactions were conducted using UV/Vis spectroscopy (dual-beam spectrophotometer and Stopped Flow technique) and a capillary electrophoresis system applying pseudo-first order kinetics of glyoxal, methylglyoxal, glycolaldehyde, glyoxylic, pyruvic and glycolic acids as well as methacrolein (MACR) and methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) towards H 2 O 2 and ozone. The measurements indicate rather small rate constants at room temperature of k 2 nd − 1 s − 1 (except for the unsaturated compounds exposed to ozone). Compared to radical reaction rate constants the values are about 10 orders of magnitude smaller (k OH· ~ 10 9 M − 1 s − 1). However, when considering the much larger non-radical oxidant concentrations compared to radical concentrations in urban cloud droplets, calculated turnovers change the picture to more important H 2 O 2 reactions especially when compared to the nitrate radical.

The concentration of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> in mitochondria increased significantly during ischemia (for 20 and 40 min). The concentration of <b>free</b> <b>radicals</b> after reperfusion was higher than that during ischemia, and a large amount of <b>free</b> <b>radical</b> generation occurred within the first 60 sec of reperfusion and returned to the level of prereperfusion at 5 min after reperfusion.
