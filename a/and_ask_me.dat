500|$|Starting at the {{beginning}} of July 1992, Gaven appeared in a new musical called The Who's Tommy at La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego. It was based on the rock opera album Tommy by The Who. Gaven starred as Mrs. Walker, the mother of the boy Tommy who is traumatized when he sees his father murder Mrs. Walker's new boyfriend. Tommy ultimately becomes non-responsive, leading people to believe that he is deaf, mute, and blind, and his parents try to find a cure for his condition. Gaven later told TheaterWeek that she initially did not want to do the musical, since she [...] "had no idea how this could be staged as a theatrical piece. I hoped my agents wouldn't call me <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to audition." [...] However, they did, and she was cast as Mrs. Walker after an audition in which she sang the song [...] "Heaven Help My Heart" [...] that she performed in Chess, also a rock musical. The Who's Tommy was La Jolla Playhouse's biggest success yet and as a result its run was lengthened by several weeks. Later that year, Gaven once again played Doris in Here's Love—this time in a Theatre Under The Stars production.|$|E
500|$|Ali {{learned that}} his {{regurgitation}} talents {{had the potential to}} entertain and to earn money through performance at the age of fifteen:I tried out my tricks first of all in the street, swallowing many glasses of water and then pouring forth a great fountain {{from one side of the}} road to the other... A cafe proprietor saw me doing this one day, and chased me down the street. I thought he wanted to beat me up, but no—all he did was to put a coin in my hand <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to repeat the trick. Finally, he was so delighted that he asked me to come to his cafe and entertain the customers. Taking his abilities on the road, Ali met an Italian man in Cairo who signed him to a contract for music hall performances. Ali performed under contract throughout Europe and at times for heads of state. According to Ali, in or about 1914 he was summoned by Tsar NicholasII of Russia to perform at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia. He stated that the Tsar [...] "must have liked my performance because he awarded me a special decoration, which is now one of my most treasured possessions." [...] Following World War I, Ali began managing his own affairs and toured the world, learning more tricks as he went.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, he {{received}} praise from Darlington's manager, David Hodgson, after reviewing {{a decision made}} during their FA Cup first round tie at home to Yeovil Town on 13 November 2004. [...] "Joslin ... admitted he was wrong to send [...] Close off in the closing stages", and rescinded the red card. Hodgson said: [...] "It's not often that a referee will admit {{he is in the}} wrong but he has and I think he deserves {{a lot of credit for}} that. He has taken it upon himself to ring me <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> what I saw. I told him and he agreed that he'd made a mistake." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his songwriting {{contributions}} {{were rejected}} from the band's previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he [...] "just became the singer," [...] but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; [...] "I thought, 'What a great idea! Brilliant!' And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung {{me to talk}} about it <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> if I had any songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but give me a minute and I'll see what I can do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt to see it all the way through, like we really should have done. Seventh Son... has no story. It's about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn't every Iron Maiden record?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 108th Congress, a {{preliminary}} Medicare vote passed 216–215, {{a vote on}} Head Start passed 217–216, a vote on school vouchers for Washington, D.C., passed 209-208, and [...] "Fast track", usually called [...] "trade promotion authority", passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as [...] "growing the vote". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists {{in the process of}} passing House bills. One lobbyist said, [...] "I've had members pull me aside <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill—at least like they are asking us to whip bills now." [...] His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over $980,000 in total.|$|E

2500|$|Jaime Murray {{completed}} the lead actors, playing Stacie Monroe who, as the grifters' only female member, is self-styled as [...] "the lure". Murray, described {{by one of}} the Hustle production team as [...] "that rare specimen – a stunningly beautiful actress who can actually act", and who auditioned in platform shoes to match her 5ft7in height with Stacie's description as having [...] "legs that go on for miles", was reportedly [...] "terrified" [...] to be working with the more famous actors Vaughn and Lester, saying [...] "when we were filming the first couple of episodes I was absolutely petrified and was convinced that it would be really obvious on screen. So when I watched some of it on tape I was totally amazed that you couldn't see how frightened I really was. I kept thinking, 'Oh my God! I'm working with Adrian Lester and Robert Vaughn. Any time now someone is going to tap me on the shoulder <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to get my coat!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{leaving the}} seminary, Fernandes moved to Bombay in 1949 {{in search of}} a job. His life was tough in Bombay, and he had to sleep on the streets, until he got a job as a {{proofreader}} for a newspaper. He relates to the beginning of his career by saying, [...] "When I came to Bombay, I used to sleep on the benches of Chowpatty Sands. In {{the middle of the night}} policemen used to come and wake me up <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> to move on." [...] He came into contact with veteran union leader Placid D'Mello, and the socialist Rammanohar Lohia, who were the greatest influences on his life. Later, he joined the socialist trade union movement. He rose to prominence as a trade unionist and fought for the rights of labourers in small scale service industries such as hotels and restaurants. Emerging as a key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s, Fernandes was a central figure in the unionisation of sections of Bombay labour in the 1950s. As a labour organiser, he served many prison terms when his workforce engaged in fights with company goons. He served as a member of the Bombay Municipal Corporation from 1961 to 1968. He won in the civic election in 1961 and, until 1968, continuously raised the problems of the exploited workers in the representative body of the metropolis.|$|E
