60|$|But even in {{that hour}} the letter was my first thought, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> way to thrust it farther under my girdle so {{that it should not}} be seen.|$|E
40|$|Recently Stephen Theriault <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>an</b> {{elementary}} {{construction of}} Anick's spaces and proved their main properties(arXiv: 0710. 1024).

60|$|The Rube {{left the}} box, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> seat between Nan and Milly. The field was a splendid sight. Those bleachers made me glow with {{managerial}} satisfaction. On the field both teams pranced and danced and bounced around in practice.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In 1992 {{and in a}} small town, Ambérieu-en-Bugey (France), {{some friends}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>founded</b> <b>a</b> new sort of life-writing archive, {{accepting}} from unknown persons any autobiographical items (narratives, diaries, letters), reading and indexing them, and opening them to any interested reader or researcher (among them sociologists, but mainly historians). This data are described both in a biennial printed catalog, the Garde-mémoire, and on the Association pour l'Autobiographie (APA) website. Nearly 3000 texts have been so far collected, read and offered to any form of social science study...|$|R
60|$|She was the {{treasurer}} of the literary society of the village, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was its secretary. We had to work together sometimes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> her <b>a</b> very straightforward girl in her accounts and in every other way.|$|R
60|$|I rushed away to {{the back}} court, where the Castle Brady stables stand, <b>and</b> there <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> dragoon {{whistling}} the 'Roast Beef of Old England,' as he cleaned down a cavalry horse. 'Whose horse, fellow, is that?' cried I.|$|R

60|$|As I imagined, so it was. There {{appeared}} before {{me a little}} opening of the land, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> strong current of the tide set into it; so I guided my raft as well as I could, to keep {{in the middle of}} the stream.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please do not so call me, sir! I {{tried to}} read the service, but I could not get the {{children}} to be still, so I had {{to tell them about}} Joseph, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> beautiful Bible full of pictures, like our Dutch one at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{told you}} that, like Diogenes, I went forth {{to seek a}} man. Did I not promise you, that when <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> one you {{should be the first}} to hear of him? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> <b>a</b> man.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Any {{amount of}} news here, Mummy," [...] Nora intervened cheerfully, [...] "and heaps of excitement. We had a Zeppelin over Dutchman's Common last night, and {{she lost her}} {{observation}} car. Mr. Somerfield took me up there this afternoon, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> German hat.

6000|$|... "From {{the time}} of our {{alighting}} at the outer gate (which we found locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber.

6000|$|... "Nay, then," [...] said Dick, [...] "I {{will even}} make the adventure. A friar is not much regarded; <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> good fairy to lead me up, I may find another belike to carry me down. How call they {{the name of this}} spy?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> singular, <b>and,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>found,</b> <b>a</b> painful smile, {{crossed the}} sweet face of Priscilla Bayard, as I made this remark; {{but she did}} not answer it.

60|$|A {{group of}} ancient, gnarled and twisted alder bushes, with trunks like trees, grew {{just on the}} margin of the pond, <b>and</b> by-and-by <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> {{comfortable}} arm-chair on the lower stout horizontal branches overhanging the water, and on that seat I rested for a long time, enjoying the sight of that rare unexpected loveliness.|$|R

6000|$|... "I am more uneasy on {{the subject}} of {{religion}} than on any other," [...] observed the governor, as he helped his little companion up a difficult part of the ascent.

6000|$|... 'Oh, {{as much as}} {{a living}} body differs from a dead one. Instead of mere dry disquisitions on the {{properties}} of lines <b>and</b> curves, <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> mine of poetry and theology.

6000|$|Aunt Sally jumped for her, {{and most}} hugged the head off of her, and cried over her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> <b>a</b> good enough {{place for me}} under the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.

60|$|We {{then set}} sail from Archangel the 20th of August, the same year; and, after no {{extraordinary}} bad voyage, arrived {{safe in the}} Elbe the 18th of September.
