25|$|A {{commutator}} is {{a mechanism}} used to switch {{the input of}} most DC machines and certain AC machines consisting of slip ring segments insulated {{from each other and}} from the electric motor's shaft. The motor's <b>armature</b> <b>current</b> is supplied through the stationary brushes in contact with the revolving commutator, which causes required current reversal and applies power to the machine in an optimal manner as the rotor rotates from pole to pole. In absence of such current reversal, the motor would brake to a stop. In light of significant advances {{in the past few decades}} due to improved technologies in electronic controller, sensorless control, induction motor, and permanent magnet motor fields, electromechanically commutated motors are increasingly being displaced by externally commutated induction and permanent-magnet motors.|$|E
40|$|A {{widely used}} method for the {{magnetic}} field calculation in permanent magnet (PM) machines is the harmonic modeling (HM) method. Despite its many advantages, the application of this method is limited to machines in which <b>armature</b> <b>currents,</b> {{as a source of}} {{the magnetic field}}, are known. Since most of PM machines are supplied with three phase voltages, any variation of parameters in the armature electric circuit could lead to the uncertainty in knowing the <b>armature</b> <b>currents</b> and therefore limit use of the harmonic modeling method.

50|$|For {{the same}} {{mechanical}} load, the <b>armature</b> <b>current</b> varies with field excitation {{over a wide}} range and so causes the power factor also to vary accordingly.

DC-excited flux switching machine (FSM) offers inherently a good torque capability {{along with an}} effective controllability thanks to its DC field windings. These machines have been evaluated mainly over their performance with little consideration on their control. This paper proposes a control strategy, applied on a 3 -phase 6 / 5 DC-excited FSM for traction applications. To obtain the non-linear magnetic behavior of the machine, 2 D finite element method (FEM) simulations are performed. The controller regulates the DC field current before reaching base speed to minimize the iron and copper losses. Due to the high armature reaction of the motor the speed range is extended by limiting both the field and <b>armature</b> <b>currents</b> {{as a function of}} the speed and inverter supply voltage.

The eddy current loss associated with each significant harmonic in the captured <b>armature</b> <b>currents</b> is predicted separately employing the developed method and the total magnet loss is evaluated by applying the principle of superposition. The magnet loss at real operating conditions of the machine is predicted from the method using the phase current captured when the SPM is operating at its maximum speed conditions.

5000|$|A {{compensation}} winding in a DC shunt motor is a winding {{in the field}} pole face plate that carries <b>armature</b> <b>current</b> to reduce stator field distortion. Its purpose is to reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors. When flux from the <b>armature</b> <b>current</b> is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the field pole plate is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of armature flux to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the pole face plate. The result is arcing of the brushes. By adding a compensating winding in the pole face plate that carries <b>armature</b> <b>current</b> {{in the opposite direction}} of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the pole face plate can be restored to the position it would have with zero <b>armature</b> <b>current.</b> The main drawback of a {{compensation winding}} is the expense.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel magnetic-geared permanent magnet (MGPM) machine with dual-layer PM excitations, referred as dual-layer MGPM (DL-MGPM) machine. The {{key is to}} employ both the outer rotor and the modulation ring with PM-iron sequences, in which the PMs are separated by iron segments one by one, and can provide PM excitation and flux modulation simultaneously. Both the outer rotor and the modulation ring can achieve flux modulating, namely, bidirectional flux modulating, which can couple the magnetic fields excited by {{the two sets of}} PMs and <b>armature</b> <b>currents</b> effectively. The proposed DL-MGPM machine, as well as its existing counterpart which employing all the PMs on the outer rotor and referred as single-layer MGPM (SL-MGPM) machine, are optimal designed using finite element method coupled with genetic algorithm. The electromagnetic performances of the DL-MGPM machine and the SL-MGPM machine are investigated in detail and quantitatively compared. The results show that the proposed DL-MGPM machine can achieve higher torque density than the SL-MGPM machine, and is more suitable for low-speed high-torque direct-drive applications.

40|$|The grid code, FIKS, {{from the}} Norwegian {{transmission}} system operator (TSO), Statnett, states that synchronous generators > 25 MVA, {{must have a}} static excitation system. However, an improved brushless excitation system is in operation on some commercial power plants (36 MVA, 93. 75 rpm & 52 MVA, 166. 67 rpm) with grid-assisting performance beyond the conventional static system. The convenional diode bridge is replaced with a remote-controlled thyristor bridge on the shaft. If wireless communication is not allowed, a control signal through brushes should be employed instead. The thesis explores the expected new era for large brushless hydrogenerators. The proposed brushless system have benefits of reduced regular maintenance due to elimination of brushes and reduced unscheduled maintenance due to redundancy; causing a redused cost-of-energy. A six-phase exciter design with a hybrid-mode thyristor bridge interface leads to improved fault-tolerance, better controllability, minimized torque pulsations and reduced <b>armature</b> <b>currents</b> of the exciter.
