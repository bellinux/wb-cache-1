In many places where adult conchs have become rare due to overfishing, larger juveniles and subadults are taken before they ever mate.

All chess coaches strongly recommend the recording of one's games so that one can look for improvements in one's play. The algebraic and descriptive notations are also used in books about chess.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of New Zealand may, at any time, {{call for a}} referendum on any issue, but must pass enabling legislation first, otherwise the resulting referendums will be indicative, not binding on central government. This provision allows some parliamentary scrutiny of the issue and wording of the question. There is no constraint on whether an issue is {{to be decided by}} the New Zealand Parliament or by the public. The only exceptions to this are the term of Parliament and several other aspects of the electoral process, which can be changed only through a referendum or by at least 75% of MPs voting for the change. This has led to the sporadic use of referendums, partly because there is no constitutional requirement, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> other countries like Australia or Switzerland that have codified constitutions.|$|E

25|$|As {{constructed}} popularly {{through the}} Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, relativists {{believe that the}} structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her world view. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, it was Sapir's student Harry Hoijer who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist Leo Weisgerber also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of cognitive linguistics in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like George Lakoff have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language Jacques Derrida's writings have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, especially through deconstruction and was even heavily criticized in the media {{at the time of his}} death for his theory of relativism.|$|E

500|$|Gather Together {{retains the}} {{freshness}} of Caged Bird, but has a self-consciousness absent from the first volume. Author Hilton Als states that Angelou [...] "replaces the language of social history with the language of therapy". The book exhibits the narcissism and self-involvement of young adults. It is Rita who is the focus, and all other characters are secondary, and they are often presented [...] "with the deft superficiality of a stage description" [...] who {{pay the price for}} Rita's self-involvement. Much of Angelou's writing in this volume, as Als states, is [...] "reactive, not reflective". [...] Angelou chooses to demonstrate Rita's narcissism in Gather Together by dropping the conventional forms of autobiography, which has a beginning, middle, and end. For example, there is no central experience in her second volume, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> Caged Bird with Angelou's account of her rape at the age of eight. Lupton believes that this central experience is relocated [...] "to some luminous place in a volume yet to be".|$|E
500|$|Hadley {{found the}} most {{important}} contribution of the theoretical framework laid down in Animal Rights Without Liberation to be {{the application of a}} Razian framework of rights to animals, adding that [...] "assuming that one takes philosophical reasoning seriously, there is little to take issue with in Cochrane's analysis". However, for Hadley, there is a fundamental tension in Cochrane's theory, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> most animal rights literature. In denying that animals possess the psychological capacities to value freedom, Cochrane undermines the challenge to orthodox rights theory that it is not only persons who should possess rights. For Hadley, [...] "only theories that have no truck with commonsense intuitions at all, like Bentham's, are really in a position to place humans and animals on a genuinely equal moral plain. The rest, arguably, are more or less disguised versions of the person-centred orthodoxy masked by rhetorical appeals to cross-species equality." [...] Hadley denies that this tension undermines Cochrane's overall argument, writing that it [...] "ought to give no comfort to opponents of animal rights. [...] reasoning, assuming you accept animals matter at all, is as uncontroversial as his writing is accessible." ...|$|E
500|$|As a {{freshman}} at Wisconsin in 1997, Echols was redshirted, but in 1998, he entered week one of the season as a starting cornerback opposite fellow redshirt freshman Jamar Fletcher. Against Purdue on October 11, he intercepted quarterback Drew Brees in the end zone, ending their first drive of the game. Wisconsin won 31–24. He finished the season with three interceptions. In 1999, he started the season off poorly, being beat for touchdowns often; however, as the season progressed, his performances improved. During the season, he intercepted just one pass. Before his junior season in 2000, Echols and 25 of his teammates were suspended {{for the start of}} the season by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. He served his one-game suspension during week two of the season, in which Wisconsin won 27–23 against Oregon. On November 4, against Minnesota, he intercepted a pass and returned it 56yards for a touchdown. He finished the season with five total interceptions, as well as a fumble recovery. Echols also set a school record with 25 pass deflections. He was named second–team All–Big Ten Conference for his performances that season. Entering 2001, Echols became the only returning member of Wisconsin's secondary after the other players either graduated or declared for the 2001 NFL Draft. In an interview about the team, secondary coach Todd Bradford said that Echols, [...] "is probably as good a tackling defensive back <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the country." [...] On September 27, after Wisconsin lost to Oregon early in the month, Oregon's quarterback Joey Harrington, in a diary for ESPN.com, stated that Echols, [...] "is one of the best corners I have ever played against. He was very impressive." [...] He finished his senior season at Wisconsin with three interceptions. He graduated in 2002 with a degree in behavioral science and law.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after he}} left Lehigh, McClung began {{a career as a}} college {{football}} referee. He began as early as November 1895, when he partnered with Paul Dashiell to officiate a game between Yale and Princeton. The pairing with Dashiell quickly became regular, with McClung acting as referee and Dashiell as Umpire. Former Princeton guard William [...] "Big Bill" [...] Edwards stated that [...] "within my recollection, for many years the two most prominent, as well as most efficient officials, whose names were always coupled, were McClung, Referee, and Dashiell, Umpire.

2500|$|This marked {{difference}} between {{the composition of the}} alveolar air and that of the ambient air can be maintained because the functional residual capacity is contained in dead-end sacs connected to the outside air by fairly narrow and relatively long tubes (the airways: nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi and their branches down to the bronchioles), through which the air has to be breathed both in and out (i.e. there is no unidirectional through-flow <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the bird lung). This typical mammalian anatomy combined {{with the fact that the}} lungs are not emptied and re-inflated with each breath (leaving a substantial volume of air, of about 2.5-3.0liters, in the alveoli after exhalation), ensures that the composition of the alveolar air is only minimally disturbed when the 350ml of fresh air is mixed into it with each inhalation. Thus the animal is provided with a very special [...] "portable atmosphere", whose composition differs significantly from the present-day ambient air. It is this portable atmosphere (the functional residual capacity) to which the blood and therefore the body tissues are exposed – not to the outside air.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, {{a couple}} from Los Angeles, Matthew and Grace Huang, moved to Doha, in Qatar, where Matthew, an engineer, {{was working on}} a {{long-term}} project. The Huangs had three adopted African-born black children. On January 15, 2013, one of these children, the Huangs’ eight-year-old daughter, Gloria, died suddenly. Officials arrested Matthew and Grace the following day and subsequently charged them with murdering Gloria, on the theory that the couple must have had some nefarious purpose (perhaps organ harvesting) for adopting Gloria in the first place, as she was black and therefore could not really have been wanted (they argued) by the Huangs. Ultimately, although the prosecution presented no substantial case (medical evidence showed that Gloria had not died of starvation – indeed, the autopsy failed to establish cause of death – and no other evidence of abuse surfaced), the couple were convicted on a lesser charge of child endangerment and sentenced to three years in prison. Even so, the prosecution still wanted to charge them with the more serious offense of child trafficking. Representatives of the Huangs created a YouTube video to plead their case, in which Brooks is filmed saying, [...] "In my 25 years of practicing criminal law, I have never seen as outrageous a prosecution theory <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> this case" [...] and [...] "this case completely lacks any type of due process."
