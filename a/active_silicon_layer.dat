40|$|The {{production}} of crystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on cost effective ceramic substrates {{depends on a}} highly reliable diffusion barrier to separate the light absorbing layers from the substrate. Ideally this intermediate layer should be deposited with cost effective techniques, be conductive and should feature optical confinement. Furthermore the intermediate layer should withstand high temperatures and harsh chemical environments like they occur during solar cell processing. Especially stability against oxidizing solvents like HNO(3) or inactivity during e. g., oxide removing steps with HF is required. Crystalline silicon carbide (c-SiC) deposited by atmospheric pressure chemical vapour deposition (APCVD) can match all those requirements and additionally fits the thermal properties of crystalline silicon. The c-SiC intermediate layer is deposited from methyltrichlorosilane (MTS) and H(2) at 1100 degrees C. Under these conditions, growth of solely cubic 30 -SiC could be observed by X-ray diffraction measurements. Use of such intermediate layers during high temperature steps prevents diffusion of transition metals, originating from the substrates, into <b>active</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>layers.</b> Doping of these 3 C-SiC layers with nitrogen results in specific resistivity of less than 100 Omega cm.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{efficiencies}} exceeding 10 % with crystalline silicon solar cells a minimum grain size of about 100 #mu#m is required. SSP ribbon material, which has grain sizes between 10 and 200 #mu#m, {{has been used for}} ribbon solar cell processing resulting in conversion efficiencies of up to 5. 4 %. LBIC measurements show a strong lateral inhomogeneity of the material quality. An additional surface melting step prior to solar cell processing improved the efficiency to 9. 1 %. This improvement can be explained with a slightly increased grain size combined with a reduction of the dislocation density. A further increasing of the grain size has been realised using one of our crystalline silicon thin film (CSiTF) solar cell concepts. This includes a perforated SiO_ 2 intermediate layer with a silicon layer on top which has been recrystallized by large area melting. The resulting grain structure reveals grains with up to several mm in size depending on the distance between the holes in the SiO_ 2 layer. This thin silicon layer acts as seeding layer for the following epitaxial growth of the <b>active</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>layer.</b> An additional advantage of using an SiO_ 2 intermediate layer is to reduce the diffusion of impurities into the <b>active</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>layer</b> if a low purity substrate is used.

Thus far, the best AM 1. 5 efficiency reached for n–i–p cells on stainless-steel with HWCVD i-layers is 8. 6 % for single junction nc-Si:H solar cells and 10. 9 % for triple junction solar cells. The opportunities for further improvement of cell efficiency are also discussed.

40|$|We {{present the}} main {{research}} aspects encountered {{during the development}} of thin film silicon-based single and multijunction solar cells using hot-wire chemical vapor deposition (HWCVD) of the <b>active</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>layers.</b> First of all, a significant current enhancement is obtained by using textured Ag/ZnO back contacts instead of plain stainless steel. The textured interface acts as a diffuse scattering mirror, due to which the optical path in the cell is lengthened. We studied the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness by 2 D atomic force microscopy (AFM) {{and found that the}} morphology of the surfaces needs to be controlled to avoid cavities and shunting paths. A further drawback of such rough metallic surfaces is the parasitic absorption due to surface particle plasmons. Nevertheless, optimized back reflectors lead to an enhancement of the photocurrent of as much as 50 %. The second large step forward is the use of multijunction (tandem) cells, in which {{at least one of the}} cells contains nanocrystalline silicon. This material behaves optically like 1. 1 eV material and, used in the bottom cell, it forms a perfect combination with the 1. 7 eV amorphous material in the top cell. Using silicon germanium (1. 5 eV) in the middle cell, our triple junction cells have reached nearly 11 % efficiency and they are stable within 3 % relative.

40|$|Crystalline silicon {{thin film}} (CSiTF) {{has a good}} {{potential}} for manufacturing cost effective solar cells. In order {{to take advantage of}} this potential inexpensive and therefore often highly impure substrates have to be used. If diffusing into the <b>active</b> <b>silicon</b> <b>layer,</b> impurities of the substrate may act as very efficient lifetime-killers in the electrically active layer and considerably reduce the solar cell efficiency.

At an in-depth level, and as an important contribution to printed devices, this work presents the design, production, and characterization of a novel fully printed current-driven switch, referred to here as a Current Switching Transistor (CST). The CST possesses the unique ability to operate as a two-way switch for both direct (DC) and alternating current (AC). In this thesis, CSTs were successfully used for the fabrication of exible fundamental "AND" and "OR" logic gates. At the fundamental level, this work sets out to illustrate that, a printed nanostructured silicon layer could be used as the active material for current switching transistors and other electronic devices. Also investigated was the temperature dependence of the transfer characteristics, in an extended range of temperature from 340 to 10 K, as well as their reliability when subjected to a constant current bias stress. Significantly in this work, the switching behavior observed and the electrical properties of the CSTs produced using nanostructured silicon remained excellent at temperatures as low as 10 K.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a concept to create photovoltaically <b>active</b> <b>silicon</b> thin-films on ceramic substrates. To achieve this, the ceramics are {{coated with a}} diffusion barrier of crystalline silicon carbide. On top of the diffusion barrier the light absorbing <b>silicon</b> <b>layer</b> is created by zone-melting recrystallization of poly-silicon and subsequent epitaxial thickening of the absorber layer. All the processing steps were hereby performed at atmospheric pressure, to allow high throughput and low costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{transverse}} field detector (TFD), {{a recently}} proposed type of CMOS color-sensitive pixel for imaging applications, has an intrinsic and peculiar characteristic of tunable spectral response. The TFD color-detection principle {{relies on the}} generation of a suitable electric field configuration in a depleted region of a CMOS low-doped <b>silicon</b> <b>active</b> <b>layer.</b> Depending on the applied voltage at the biasing/collecting electrodes, different electric field configurations can be obtained. In the depleted region, carriers’paths {{are determined by the}} electric field streamlines. Simulations show how different biasing values lead to different collection by the electrodes of carriers generated at various depth and, thus, to different sets of spectral photoresponses. Experimental results obtained on structures designed in a 90 -nm CMOS technology prove the principle and show the amplitude of the allowable tuning rang...|$|R
40|$|International audienceN-type {{microcrystalline}} silicon (μc-Si) top-gate Thin Film Transistors (TFTs) are fabricated at {{a maximum}} temperature of 180 °C using different thicknesses of undoped μc-Si active layers. The {{effect of the}} thickness on the TFT performance is experimentally studied and then modeled using Silvaco software tools. The experimental high improvement of the subthreshold swing and the limitation of the rear channel effect, when using very thin active layer, are shown {{to be due to}} the increase of the lateral electrical field between the source or drain and the active layer. This increase of the lateral field is shown to be much more important for defected active layer as the microcrystalline silicon one compared to single crystalline <b>silicon</b> <b>active</b> <b>layer.</b> The importance of the use of very thin active layer for amorphous or ploy-micro-nano-crystalline silicon based TFTs is then demonstrated...|$|R
