5|$|Following {{enquiries}} by the media, Paramount and Namco {{released a}} joint statement explaining {{that it was an}} issue with the Steam system, and was something that the company was seeking to fix shortly. While others stated issues with co-op gameplay on the PS3, the companies stated that they were not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> issues and recommended that faults should be reported via Twitter. After the PC issue was rectified, a further statement was published to alert customers that they could now use this type of gameplay. A day after the co-op issues with Star Trek were resolved, the Dead Island: Riptide problems were also corrected, with speculation by reviewers presuming that it was the same error in both games.|$|E

Minh was also upset with the {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot {{for as long as he}} could, and then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they were not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> such threat.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{there were}} rumors of a {{three-dimensional}} Kid Icarus game for the Wii that was allegedly developed by the German American studio Factor 5.

In a 2010 interview, Yoshio Sakamoto was asked about a Kid Icarus game for the Wii, to which he replied that he was not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> plans to revive the franchise. A new series entry for the Nintendo 3DS, , was eventually revealed at the E3 2010 trade show and was released in 2012.

While the {{original}} Sanskrit manuscript is not available, it {{was translated into}} Gujarati by Nityanand Swami {{under the direction of}} Swaminarayan and is revered in the sect. The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency summarised it as a book of social laws that his followers should follow. A commentary on the practice and understanding of dharma, it is a small booklet containing 212 Sanskrit verses, outlining the basic tenets that Swaminarayan believed his followers should uphold in order to live a well-disciplined and moral life. The oldest copy of this text is preserved at the Bodleian Library of Oxford University and {{it is one of the}} very few presented by Sahajanand Swami himself.

5|$|Written in 1866, Augusta Jane Evans {{domestic}} novel St. Elmo {{became one}} of the best-selling novels of the 19th century. Its popularity would spur the creation of popular consumer products, parodies and even the names of several towns. Evans was concerned about how the novel's themes would be portrayed on the stage and did not approve the first script for a St. Elmo play until 1909. It is also unknown if Evans was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> intention to adapt the novel for the screen. Lloyd Lonergan adapted the play for the Thanhouser Company. The Book News Monthly said that Lonergan received a share of interest in the company for his good work in producing the scenario.

25|$|ESC {{can work}} on any surface, from dry {{pavement}} to frozen lakes. It reacts to and corrects skidding much faster and more effectively than the typical human driver, often before the driver is even <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> imminent loss of control. In fact, this led to some concern that ESC could allow drivers to become overconfident in their vehicle's handling and/or their own driving skills. For this reason, ESC systems typically inform the driver when they intervene, so that the driver knows that the vehicle's handling limits have been approached. Most activate a dashboard indicator light and/or alert tone; some intentionally allow the vehicle's corrected course to deviate very slightly from the driver-commanded direction, {{even if it is}} possible to more precisely match it.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that Fordism derives from Taylor's work. Taylor {{apparently}} made this assumption himself when visiting the Ford Motor Company's Michigan plants {{not too long}} before he died, but {{it is likely that}} the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best. Charles E. Sorensen, a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all. There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded in spite of, not because of, experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts. Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor Walter Flanders in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905-1915.|$|E
