5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is {{the only}} known {{exoplanet}} in the orbit of host star MOA-2009-BLG-387L. The planet {{is estimated to be}} 2.6 times the mass of Jupiter. However, because knowledge of the exact parameters of the planet <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> host star's parameters, and the host star's parameters are not well-constrained, uncertainty places MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass between 1.0 and 6.7 times that of Jupiter. The planet is estimated to orbit its host star every 1970 days at a distance of 1.8 AU, some 1.8 times the mean distance between Earth and the Sun. Uncertainty broadens the mean distance to between 1.1 and 2.7 AU.|$|E
5|$|Amon {{was the son}} of King Manasseh of Judah and Meshullemeth, a {{daughter}} of Haruz of Jotbah. Although the date is unknown, the Hebrew Bible records that he married Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. Amon began his reign of Judah at the age of 22, and reigned for two years. Biblical scholar and archeologist William F. Albright has dated his reign to 642 – 640, while professor E. R. Thiele offers the dates 643/642– 641/640. Thiele's dates <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reign of Amon's son Josiah, whose death at the hands of Pharaoh Necho II occurred in the summer of 609. Josiah's death, which is independently confirmed in Egyptian history, places the end of Amon's reign, 31 years earlier, in 641 or 640 and the beginning of his rule in 643 or 642.|$|E
5|$|The Festivals are Nativity, Epiphany, the Baptism of our Lord, the Transfiguration, the Annunciation, Palm Sunday, Easter, the Ascension, Pentecost, Holy Trinity, All Saints, and Christ the King. Most {{of these}} festivals <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{moveable}} feast of Easter. Festivals {{take precedence over}} all other days, including Sundays, have their own collects and Eucharistic proper prefaces. Of the festivals, Christmas {{is considered to be}} twelve days in length (from December 25 until January 5) and Easter is fifty days in length (from Easter Sunday up to and inclusive of Pentecost). For Easter, Sundays are considered to be another part of the festival. For the Ascension which, falling on fortieth day of Easter, will always be on a Thursday, the festival is sometimes transferred to the Seventh Sunday of Easter in addition to or in place of the normal part of the Easter festival for that day.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{gustatory}} {{disorders are}} challenging to diagnose and evaluate. Because gustatory functions <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sense of smell, the somatosensory system, {{and the perception}} of pain (such as in tasting spicy foods), it is difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system. In addition, gustatory dysfunction is rare when compared to olfactory disorders.|$|E

25|$|Jeffery Paige made a {{distinction}} between centralized sharecropping found on cotton plantations and the decentralized sharecropping with other crops. The former is characterized by political conservatism and long lasting tenure. Tenants <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landlord through the plantation store. Their work is heavily supervised as slave plantations were. This form of tenure tends {{to be replaced by}} wage slavery as markets penetrate. Decentralized sharecropping involves virtually no role for the landlord: plots are scattered, peasants manage their own labor and the landowners do not manufacture the crops. Leases are very short which leads to peasant radicalism. This form of tenure becomes more common when markets penetrate.|$|E
25|$|Many notable dances {{are found}} in the state of Guerrero. The three most common dances of the coast of Oaxaca and Guerrero are the Devil Dance, the Turtle Dance and the Toro de Petate (Straw Bull Dance), all of which <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area’s Afro-Mexican communities. The first three {{contains}} characteristics which are found only in this region and nowhere else in Mexico and include violence and even sexual overtures. The main characters, devils, turtles and bulls represented by those in masks, are mythical creatures which dance in the streets alongside humans who either challenge or subdue them. Other important Afro-Mexican dances include the Tiger Dance and the Tejorones.|$|E
25|$|Weaving {{normally}} begins {{from the}} bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the knot count of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.|$|E

25|$|Some have {{described}} the women’s rights movement in Morocco as a movement of elites and criticized the new Mudawana on similar grounds. Most women’s organizations in Morocco receive external funding, whether from the government, various Moroccan political parties, or international actors such as USAID, the European Development Bank, and the World Bank, which has left them open to criticisms that their agendas <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sources of their funding and therefore compromised. However, some scholars have argued that just because the movement was started among elites, {{it does not necessarily}} follow that they are incongruent with grassroots interests. Still others point out that in an even broader sense, the universal notion of formal equality itself may not be evenly applicable or relevant to women from different social, cultural, and national backgrounds.|$|E
25|$|The Ulysses mosaic {{is a work}} {{inspired}} by the Odyssey: the Greek hero is seen standing on a boat that is decorated with a human head and a palm branch and that has two sails and a battering ram. Ulysses’s hands <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main mast so {{that he will not}} succumb to the fatal charm of the sirens’ music. Ulysses’s companions are seated around him, their ears blocked with wax as described in the legend. Three sirens stand {{at the base of a}} rocky crag. They are depicted with the bust of a woman, but with the wings and legs of a bird. One of them holds a flute, the second a lyre, while the third, who does not carry an instrument, is believed to be the singing siren. In front of Ulysses’s boat, there is a small barque with a fisherman holding a lobster, the depiction of which is over-sized. The mosaic has been dated to around 260-268 CE; it was discovered in the “house of Ulysses and the pirates”.|$|E
25|$|Identity fusion, a {{psychological}} construct rooted in social psychology and cognitive anthropology, {{is a form}} of alignment with groups in which members experience a visceral sense of oneness with the group. The construct relies on a distinction between the personal self and the social self. The personal self refers to the characteristics that make someone a unique person (e.g., tall, old, intelligent), while the social self pertains to the characteristics that align the person with groups (e.g., American, fraternity brother, student council member, etc.). As the name suggests, identity fusion involves the union of the personal and social selves. When fusion occurs, both the personal and social selves remain salient and influential but the boundaries between them become highly permeable. In addition, the theory proposes that fused persons come to regard other group members as “family” and develop strong relational ties to them as well as ties to the collective. Therefore, fused persons are not just bound to the collective; they <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> individual members of the collective.|$|E
50|$|According to Frederick Howard Wines in {{his book}} Punishment and Reformation: A Study Of The Penitentiary System there were three main types of {{coercion}} employed in the torture chamber: Coercion by the cord, by water and by fire.

25|$|Goodness, he believed, came {{more from}} {{practice}} and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed {{that one should}} distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of their neighbors fail to understand that their fortunes <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set their judgment on the possible and be satisfied with what one has—giving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.|$|E

500|$|At the party, Peter dresses up as [...] "Pee Pants the Inebriated Hobo Clown", [...] "an adorable tramp {{who wears}} found {{clothing}} and eats {{out of your}} garbage can". Peter then tells Meg that he got her a scarf for her birthday. Meg declines, while Peter then says he got her [...] "a dozen scarves" [...] which Peter then proceeds to regurgitate as one long scarf, as he has actually tied and swallowed them (which Lois says he {{was not supposed to}} do). This causes him to cough and vomit. Peter hands Meg the long scarf from his tongue, but Meg refuses to hold it. Peter then urges Meg to hold them, and then asks if his long johns <b>are</b> <b>tied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of them. When Meg says they are not, Peter then says [...] "Oh, god" [...] and regurgitates them as well, and then crouches in pain following the ordeal. Meg asks Lois if she can open her gifts, and Meg notices Stewie opening most of them. Peter gets drunk, and attempts to ride a unicycle down the steps, but falls off and crushes his father, Francis, who later dies in the hospital from the accident. Just before Francis dies, he calls Peter [...] "a fat stinking drunk".|$|E
