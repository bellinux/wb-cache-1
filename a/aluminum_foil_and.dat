5|$|After several failed {{attempts}} by Homer, Marge convinces Bart {{to take the}} medication and his behavior immediately improves, paying attention in school, being respectful to his parents, and tutoring a Navajo boy in his spare time. One night, however, Marge and Homer come home from a date to find Bart in his room wrapped in <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> <b>and</b> coat hangers on the ceiling. Suffering from drug psychosis and Paranoia, he claims Major League Baseball is spying on the town using a satellite. The doctors recommend that Bart go off Focusyn, but he refuses, swallows several handfuls of Focusyn and runs away.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil,</b> <b>and</b> cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel technique for joining similar <b>and</b> dissimilar metal <b>foils,</b> namely micro clinching with cutting by laser shock forming. A {{series of experiments}} were conducted to study the deformation behavior of single layer material, during which many important process parameters were determined. The process window of the 1060 pure <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> <b>and</b> annealed copper <b>foils</b> produced by micro clinching with cutting was analyzed. Moreover, similar material combination (annealed copper <b>foils)</b> <b>and</b> dissimilar material combination (1060 pure <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> <b>and</b> 304 stainless steel foils) were successfully achieved. The effect of laser energy on the interlock and minimum thickness of upper foils was investigated. In addition, the mechanical strength of different material combinations joined by micro clinching with cutting was measured in single lap shearing tests. According to the achieved results, this novel technique is more suitable for material combinations where the upper foil is thicker than lower foil. With the increase of laser energy, the interlock increased while the minimum thickness of upper foil decreased gradually. The shear strength of 1060 pure <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> <b>and</b> 304 stainless steel foils combination was three times as large as that of 1060 pure <b>aluminum</b> <b>foils</b> <b>and</b> annealed copper <b>foils</b> combination...|$|R

25|$|John Connolly gave Shapiro {{from his}} most recent output, and Patrick Connolly {{said they had been}} able to make three pounds of meth since May of that year. Shapiro also {{observed}} an empty P2P bottle at the house. Two days later, he returned with 100 g of P2P. While he mostly watched as the trio made their meth, at one point, according to later court testimony, he and Russell helped pick up some pieces of dropped <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> <b>and</b> put it into a flask. Patrick Connolly finished the rest of the process, and Shapiro stopped by the next morning to pick up his half of the meth. He also bought a portion of the remainder for $60.|$|E
25|$|When {{the great}} debate about window {{broke out in}} the spring of 1942, Downing {{suggested}} that the AIF might be naturally immune to its effects. Window, which consists of lightweight <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> <b>and</b> paper, stops in the air almost immediately after being dropped and then falls slowly to the ground. An AIF locked onto a bomber would see these signals quickly pass out of the gated range, and they would disappear. To test this theory, a Beaufighter was flown to Coltishall and fitted with the AIF prototype. Jackson carried out 13 flights in November to test the system against window. These tests demonstrated, to great concern, that the system would instead lock onto the window and break contact with the bomber.|$|E

500|$|Florida student Kiera Wilmot {{attended}} the event; she gained {{notice in the}} press two years prior, after being {{arrested and charged with}} a felony when her science project made a loud popping noise. At the time an honors high school student participating in a science project in Polk County, Florida at Bartow High School, Wilmot combined <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> <b>and</b> toilet-bowl cleaner inside of a bottle. After the bottle made a loud popping noise, Wilmot was removed from the class, placed in handcuffs, [...] sent to a juvenile detention facility and faced charges of obtaining and utilizing a destructive device. Administration officials at her school explained their reactions to her science project by stating they had a zero tolerance practice in place against undesirable behaviors or possession of items; charges against her were dropped and {{she went back to the}} high school. At the time of her attendance at the White House Astronomy Night, Wilmot was a student at Florida Polytechnic University with a focus in mechanical engineering.|$|E

[...] Initially, they were individually wrapped by hand in squares of <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil,</b> <b>and</b> the introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 simplified the process while adding the small paper ribbon {{to the top of}} the package to indicate that it was a genuine Hershey product. [...] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day.
