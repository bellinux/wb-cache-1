5|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, {{for the first time since}} the Napoleonic Wars, the {{population}} of the British Isles was in danger of attack from naval raids. The country also came under attack from <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> by zeppelins and fixed-wing aircraft, another first.|$|E

50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>Raid</b> Precautions were {{introduced}} in January 1942 and the <b>Air</b> <b>Raid</b> Wardens had the responsibility to ensure compliance with the regulations within the community. Black-out curtains and slit trenches became part of every home in the Cairns area. <b>Air</b> <b>raid</b> practice drills were held {{on a regular basis}} both in the daytime and evenings, and during drills people on the streets were required to move to the nearest <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> shelter. The Cairns City Council constructed seven public <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> shelter around the city for the population.

5|$|Moscow {{itself was}} also hastily fortified. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and {{teenagers}} worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million {{cubic meters of}} earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory {{was turned into a}} submachine gun armory, a clock factory manufactured mine detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production for the front, and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles. Despite these preparations, the capital was within striking distance of German tanks, with the Luftwaffe mounting large-scale <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> on the city. The <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> caused only limited damage because of extensive anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> were mounted against Bardia in December, {{in the hope}} of persuading the {{garrison}} to withdraw. Once {{it became clear that the}} Italians intended to stand and fight, bombing priorities shifted to the Italian airbases around Tobruk, Derna and Benina. <b>Air</b> <b>raids</b> on Bardia resumed in the lead-up to the ground assault, with 100 bombing sorties flown against Bardia between 31 December 1940 and 2 January 1941, climaxing with a particularly heavy raid by Vickers Wellington bombers of No. 70 Squadron RAF and Bristol Bombay bombers of No. 216 Squadron RAF on the night of 2/3 January 1941.

Created as the Security and Assistance Service (Sicherheits und Hilfsdienst) in 1935, it was renamed Luftschutzpolizei in April 1942. The <b>air</b> <b>raid</b> network was supported by the Reichsluftschutzbund (Reich Association for <b>Air</b> <b>Raid</b> Precautions) an organization controlled from 1935 by the Air Ministry under Hermann Göring.

5|$|A {{total of}} 610 {{aircraft}} were built, including prototypes, and they entered service in 1948 with the Soviet Air Forces. At least 372 {{were transferred to}} the People's Liberation Army Air Force in 1950 to defend Chinese cities against <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> by the Nationalist Chinese and train the Chinese pilots in jet operations. The MiG-9 was quickly replaced by the MiG-15, and three are known to survive.|$|E
5|$|Army Wing {{aircraft}} {{were assigned}} to carry out strategic reconnaissances, to report on Ottoman reserves well behind their lines, to carry out daily photography, and to conduct <b>air</b> <b>raids.</b> Fighter and bombing squadrons were established for these purposes while the Corps Squadrons were attached to the two infantry corps carried out artillery and contact patrols, along with tactical reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> on Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E

5|$|During the war the {{chancellery}} was destroyed, {{except for}} the exterior walls, by <b>air</b> <b>raids</b> and in the Battle of Berlin in 1945.
