5|$|The {{site was}} so popular that in 1999 the East Sussex county council made an appeal to Disney as the old wooden bridge had been worn down by an {{overwhelming}} number of visitors. The company provided a substantial donation towards the estimated Â£30,000 needed to replace the bridge. Partly rebuilt in 1979, the donations from Disney, building firms {{and members of the}} public funded its complete reconstruction. The newly built and modernised bridge retained its precursor's original style. A plaque was also placed to commemorate the occasion and thank those who financially contributed to the project. The sport can still be played in Ashdown Forest to this day and the site regularly attracts tourists from as far afield <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> Japan. However, visitors are now advised to bring their own sticks, as previous visitors have caused damage to the trees in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|The hull is {{constructed}} from a high-tensile micro-alloy steel, developed by Swedish steel manufacturer SSAB, and improved by BHP of Australia, which was lighter {{and easier to}} weld than the HY-80 or HY-100 nickel-alloy steel used in contemporary submarine construction projects, while providing better results in explosion bulge testing. The submarines are covered in a skin of anechoic tiles to minimise detection by sonar: Collins was retrofitted with the tiles after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction. These tiles were developed by the Australian DSTO: <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> United Kingdom would not share their information on the tiles used on their nuclear submarines, Australian researchers had to develop the tiles from scratch. The tiles were moulded {{in the shape of}} the hull, and are secured by a commercial adhesive normally used to fix cat's eyes to road surfaces: although British and American submarines are often seen with missing tiles, as of March 2007, none have been lost from a Collins-class boat.|$|E
