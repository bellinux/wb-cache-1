5|$|In the {{following}} season, the Lakers won 26 {{of their first}} 39 games, but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40. They were eliminated {{in the first round}} by Phoenix again. Frustrated by the team's inability to <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the offseason. Buss initially agreed to seek a trade, but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.|$|E
5|$|Texas won {{the game}} 52–17 and moved into {{first place in the}} Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings {{for the first time since}} they were {{implemented}} in 1998. The BCS formula took into account strength of schedule so that teams received more credit for beating stronger opponents. This allowed Texas to <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rankings since they beat an unbeaten team while University of Southern California, who previously held the numberone spot, beat Washington, a 1–6 team.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} of food crops, many civilians were forced to leave the hills and surrender to the TNI. Often, when surviving villagers came down to lower-lying regions to surrender, the military would execute them. Those who were not killed outright by TNI troops were sent to receiving centers for vetting, which had been prepared in <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of local TNI bases. In these transit camps, the surrendered civilians were registered and interrogated. Those who were suspected of being members of the resistance were killed.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War in December 1941, the school's Wirraways were classified as Second Line (Reserve) aircraft in the defence of Australia, while the base was fortified with sandbags, trenches, and gun pits. On 1January 1942, No.60 Squadron was established at Forest Hill from No.2 SFTS aircraft and personnel. Equipped with 18 Wirraways, the unit formed part of the expansion of the Australian military in response to the rapid Japanese <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first month of the Pacific War. A contingent of 68 WAAAFs also began arriving at Forest Hill in January.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, in December 1993, Kariya {{left his}} college team, the Maine Black Bears, {{to join the}} Canadian {{national}} team {{in preparation for the}} 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. At the start of the tournament, Canada was seeded seventh overall and were not considered favourites to do well. Playing on a line with Chris Kontos and Petr Nedved, Kariya led his team in scoring with three goals and seven points over eight games, helping Canada to a silver medal. Tied with the Czech Republic 2–2 in the quarterfinal, Kariya scored the game-winning goal after 16 minutes of overtime play to help the Canadians <b>advance.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> gold medal game, Kariya scored the first goal as Canada went on to lose 3–2 in a shootout to Sweden. With a chance to tie the shootout after Swedish forward Peter Forsberg scored, Swedish goaltender Tommy Salo stopped Kariya with a glove save.|$|E
5|$|North Korean troops, {{hampered}} by supply shortages and massive losses, continually staged attacks on UN forces {{in an attempt}} to penetrate the perimeter and collapse the line. However, the UN used the port to amass an overwhelming advantage in troops, equipment, and logistics, and its navy and air forces remained unchallenged by the North Koreans during the fight. After six weeks, the North Korean force collapsed and retreated in defeat after the UN force launched a counterattack at Inchon on September 15. The battle would be the furthest the North Korean troops would <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war, as subsequent fighting ground the war into a stalemate.|$|E

5|$|On July 12, 2016, Engen {{was named}} to the 18-player team that would {{represent}} the United States at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. She made her Olympic debut on August 6 in place of an injured Julie Johnston in their second group match against France. She played all 90 minutes of the match to help the United States win 1–0. Engen once again started in the team's final group match on August 9 against Colombia, which ended in a 2–2 draw. Engen did not make an appearance during the team's match against Sweden on August 12. The United States fell to Sweden in a penalty shootout and did not <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tournament. This {{was the first time the}} United States women's team did not medal in an Olympic tournament.|$|E
5|$|On June 7, 2012, Aron Winter {{resigned}} from the club upon refusing to be reassigned from his head coaching role after the team started {{the season with a}} nine-game losing streak, setting an MLS record for worst start to a season. Under Winter in 2012, the club's league record was 1–9–0 and in all other competitions was 3–1–4, including a fourth-straight Canadian Championship. He was replaced by Paul Mariner, but TFC continued to struggle finishing with a 4–12–8 record in league play under him. Toronto FC also failed to <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CONCACAF Champions League, finishing second in its group with a 2–2–0 record. Overall, they finished the MLS season on a 14-game winless streak and ended up in last place, with five wins and 23 points (both franchise lows).|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to Italy the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade {{was sent to}} Rome on 3 September, and moved again on 8 September to a camp near Taranto {{to prepare for a}} {{possible}} mission in Greece, Operation Manna. The Russian <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east had forced the Germans to withdraw from Greece or be cut off from support and reinforcements. Over the night of 12/13 October 1944 'C' Company of the 4th Parachute Battalion, were parachuted onto Megara airfield near Athens to prepare a landing strip for the follow-up waves {{from the rest of the}} brigade. The company sustained several casualties while landing in adverse weather conditions that forced the remainder of the brigade to delay their arrival for another two days.|$|E

5|$|Operation Arctic Fox (German: Unternehmen Polarfuchs, Russian: Кандалакшская операция) was the codename {{given to}} a World War II {{campaign}} by German and Finnish forces against Soviet Northern Front defenses at Salla, Finland in July 1941. The operation {{was part of the}} larger Operation Silver Fox (Silberfuchs) which aimed to capture the vital port of Murmansk. Arctic Fox was conducted in parallel to Operation Platinum Fox (Platinfuchs) in the far north of Lappland. The principal goal of Operation Arctic Fox was to capture the town of Salla and then to <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of Kandalaksha (Finnish: Kantalahti) to block the railway route to Murmansk.|$|E
5|$|Records from 1985 are {{not clear}} on which trios teams participated in the tournament to {{determine}} the first ever Mexican National Trios Championship, only a few matches were clearly identified {{as part of the}} tournament, the earliest of which was a January 25, 1985 match in Arena Coliseo that saw Los Infernales (MS-1, Pirata Morgan, Satánico) defeat El Enfermero Jr., Herodes and Jerry Estrada to <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tournament. Records also indicate that trios consisting of Popitekus, Panico and Zorro de Oro; Talisman, La Fiera, and Mocho Cota; Atlantis, Stuka and Acertijo; Chamaco Valaguez, Impacto and Águila Solitaria were in the tournament, but were all eliminated before the finals. On February 10, 1985 Los Infernales defeated Los Brazo to win the championship.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{attacked}} at dawn {{under the}} cover of fog, but other than one small penetration by a German company in the early morning which was quickly resolved, partly due to the gallantry of Sergeant Stanley McDougall of the Australian 47th Battalion, the Germans failed to break through the Allied defences. McDougall was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle, the highest award that could be received by an Australian soldier for gallantry {{in the face of the}} enemy. By late afternoon, rain was setting in, making early renewal of the assault less likely. The Germans suffered about 550 casualties during the battle, with the Australians losing around 137 killed or wounded. In the following week, the Germans renewed attempts to <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sector, culminating in the Second Battle of Dernancourt on 5 April, in which the Germans were defeated in desperate fighting.|$|E

5|$|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's {{third major}} {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the orthodox doctrines of Hinduism and the heterodox doctrines of Buddhism, with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally {{with the impact of}} religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society. In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system made it very difficult for individuals to <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> society beyond their caste. Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant {{in the context of the}} advancement of the soul.|$|E
5|$|The brigade's next {{mission was}} Operation Manna. This time {{they would be}} landing in Greece. The Soviet Red Army <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east had forced the Germans to {{withdraw}} from the country or risk being cut off from any support or reinforcements. Over the night of 12/13 October 1944, the first of the brigade's units parachuted onto Megara airfield near Athens to prepare a landing zone for the follow-up waves {{from the rest of the}} brigade. The brigade moved into Athens and then over three months fought their way to Salonika and the border with Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Lake Tauca and the later Coipasa lake phase {{is associated with}} the Central Andean Pluvial Event, which occurred from 18,000–14,000 to 13,800–9,700 BP. During this epoch, major environmental changes occurred in the Atacama as precipitation increased between 18° and 25° degrees south. In some areas, oases formed in the desert and human settlement began. During the Coipasa lake cycle, precipitation may have focused on the southern Altiplano and been transported there from the Chaco; the main Tauca cycle may have been accompanied by precipitation from the northeast. A glacial <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Turbio valley (a feeder of the Elqui River) between 17,000 and 12,000 years ago has been attributed to the Central Andean Pluvial Event. Other indicators point to dry conditions in central Chile during the highstand of Lake Tauca.|$|E

5|$|The move to Memphis did {{not solve}} the Grizzlies' {{financial}} problems, and as of 2011 the team's cumulative loss was US$100million. The team did manage a 50-win season and reach the playoffs four times, but failed to <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> playoffs until the 2010–11 season. As of 2011, the Grizzlies remain, according to Forbes, the third least-valuable NBA franchise, at US$266million. Attendance did not exceed Vancouver levels {{for more than a}} decade after the move. The Grizzlies averaged 13,737spectators in their first season in Memphis; the first season in which they exceeded Vancouver attendance levels was 2012–13, when they averaged 16,624.|$|E
5|$|The {{vessels that}} {{eventually}} became the Iowa-class battleships were born from the US Navy's War Plan Orange, a Pacific war plan against Japan. War planners {{anticipated that the}} US fleet would engage and <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Central Pacific, with {{a long line of}} communication and logistics that would be vulnerable to high-speed Japanese cruisers. The chief concern was that the US Navy's traditional 21-knot battle force would be too slow to force these Japanese task forces into battle, while faster carriers and cruiser escorts would be outmatched by the Japanese Kongō-class battlecruiser, which had been upgraded in the 1930s to fast battleships. Even during the development process of the North Carolina-class and South Dakota-class battleships, designs that could achieve 30 knots were seriously considered.|$|E
5|$|When Fall Gelb (Case yellow) {{began on}} 10 May 1940, the Stuka helped swiftly neutralise the {{fortress}} of Eben Emael, Belgium. The {{headquarters of the}} commander responsible for ordering {{the destruction of the}} Belgian Army-held bridges along the Albert Canal was stationed in the village of Lanaken (14km/mi to the north). However, the Stuka demonstrated its accuracy when the small building was destroyed by four direct hits. As a result, only one of the three bridges was destroyed, allowing the German Army to rapidly <b>advance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening days of the Battle of Belgium. The Ju 87 proved to be a useful asset to Army Group B in the Low Countries. In pitched battles against French armoured forces at Hannut and Gembloux Ju 87s effectively neutralised artillery and armour.|$|E
