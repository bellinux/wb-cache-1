25|$|Each {{science has}} its own unique sets of {{laboratory}} equipment. In the atmosphere, there <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> or qualities of the atmosphere that can be measured. Rain, which can be observed, or seen anywhere and anytime {{was one of the}} first atmospheric qualities measured historically. Also, two other accurately measured qualities are wind and humidity. Neither of these can be seen but can be felt. The devices to measure these three sprang up in the mid-15th century and were respectively the rain gauge, the anemometer, and the hygrometer. Many attempts had been made prior to the 15th century to construct adequate equipment to measure the many atmospheric variables. Many were faulty in some way or were simply not reliable. Even Aristotle noted this in some of his work as the difficulty to measure the air.|$|E

500|$|Hans Lundgren {{was born}} on 3 November 1957 in Spånga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (née Tjerneld), a {{language}} teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spånga {{until the age of}} 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Ångermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and vented his frustration on his wife and eldest son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a [...] "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, [...] "I still love my father, no matter what happened. There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with." [...] He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.|$|E
500|$|Several {{established}} {{actors were}} {{considered for the}} leading role of Rusty Sabich. Kevin Costner turned down the role, and Robert Redford was vetoed by Pollack due to his age. When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, all the action takes place around him. Things happen to him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> I found I could express with that short haircut. Simplest of all, I wanted to tell the audience to leave their baggage at home — not to expect the Harrison Ford they've seen before." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chomsky {{was always}} {{critical}} of the Soviet Union and he does now accept that Mao's regime in China was responsible for 'a huge death toll, {{in the tens of}} millions'. However, back in 1960s, Chomsky was considerably less {{critical of the}} communist movements in Asia, noting what he considered to be grassroots elements within both Chinese and Vietnamese communism. In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, [...] "I don't feel that they deserve a blanket condemnation at all. There <b>are</b> <b>many</b> <b>things</b> to object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable." [...] Chomsky continued: [...] "There are even better examples than China. But I do think that China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which {{a good deal of the}} collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step." [...] He said of Vietnam: [...] "Although there appears to be a high degree of democratic participation at the village and regional levels, still major planning is highly centralized in the hands of the state authorities." ...|$|E
