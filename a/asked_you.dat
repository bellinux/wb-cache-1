25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E

Though still married to actor Danny Keough, whom she had wed in 1988 and had two children with, Presley replied that she would. After a pause, Jackson exclaimed {{that he had to}} use the bathroom. Having apparently relieved himself, the singer explained to his new fiancee that his love for her was genuine and she had to believe him. In 2010, Presley acknowledged to Oprah Winfrey that Jackson did formally propose one day in the library, taking out a 10 carat diamond ring and getting down on his knees.|$|E

And we instantly, before we got off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.'

500|$|Jackson {{first met}} Lisa Marie Presley (and Elvis Presley) in 1974, during a Jackson 5 {{engagement}} at the MGM Grand. In November 1992, Jackson was reconnected with Presley through a mutual friend, staying in contact {{almost every day}} by telephone. As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs. She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it." [...] In one phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional.

So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear.

[...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here.

500|$|Interpretations of the song's meaning {{vary from}} one {{listener}} to the next; some people {{view it as}} a song about love and desire, while others understand it as a political metaphor, the lyrics being addressed as much to the Chinese nation as to a girlfriend. University of Florida scholar Jonathan Matusitz describes the song's lyrics as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that could not be stated through any other medium. In this interpretation, the lyrics near the beginning, [...] "I've <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> without end / When will you go with me / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to my name" [...] ("") are taken to express the [...] "humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal freedom", the [...] "sense of loss and disorientation" [...] among China's youth in the 1980s. Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as [...] "recast the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole." [...] The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase yī wú suŏ yŏu, an idiomatic chengyu. It literally means [...] "to have nothing" [...] and has no grammatical subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as meaning [...] "I have nothing" [...] (implying that it is a song about two people), or [...] "we have nothing" [...] (understanding it as social commentary).|$|E
