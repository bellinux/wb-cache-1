25|$|During this time, Microsoft was in {{the midst}} of {{developing}} their Jet database system. Jet combined three primary subsystems; an ISAM-based database engine (also named Jet, confusingly), a C-based interface allowing applications to <b>access</b> <b>that</b> data, and a selection of driver dynamic-link libraries (DLL) that allowed the same C interface to redirect input and output to other ISAM-based databases, like Paradox and xBase. Jet allowed using one set of calls to access common microcomputer databases in a fashion similar to Blueprint, by then renamed DataLens. However, Jet did not use SQL; like DataLens, the interface was in C and consisted of data structures and function calls.|$|E

The program debuted on December 29 at 12:31 a.m Eastern (December 28, 9:31p.m. Pacific).

Over the next year, many of the leading BBS software providers went bankrupt {{and tens of thousands of}} BBSes disappeared. Today, BBSing survives largely as a nostalgic hobby in most parts of the world, but it is still an extremely popular form of communication for Taiwanese youth (see PTT Bulletin Board System) and in China. Most BBSes are now accessible over Telnet and typically offer free email accounts, FTP services, IRC and all of the protocols commonly used on the Internet. Some offer access through packet switched networks or packet radio connections.|$|E
25|$|The Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) is the 32-bit {{protected}} mode kernel {{at the core}} of Windows 9x. Its primary responsibility is to create, run, monitor and terminate virtual machines. The VMM provides services that manage memory, processes, interrupts and protection faults. The VMM works with virtual devices (loadable kernel modules, which consist mostly of 32-bit ring 0 or kernel mode code, but may include other types of code, such as a 16-bit real mode initialisation segment) to allow those virtual devices to intercept interrupts and faults to control the <b>access</b> <b>that</b> an application has to hardware devices and installed software. Both the VMM and virtual device drivers run in a single, 32-bit, flat model address space at privilege level 0 (also called ring 0). The VMM provides multi-threaded, preemptive multitasking. It runs multiple applications simultaneously by sharing CPU (central processing unit) time between the threads in which the applications and virtual machines run.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 2000s, {{publishers}} {{finally found}} it feasible to start commercially supporting manga production: Kaza and Lazhari Labter, both publishers of youth literature, began publishing manga in 2011, and Z-Link, the first publisher dedicated entirely to manga was founded in 2007. Among these, the most notable is Z-Link: with a specific focus on developing new artists and bringing them to the market, it predominantly publishes small-format, softcover, black and white manga books with a small DZ-manga icon in the bottom left corner of their jackets. These run either as independent volumes or, on rare occasions, as installments in a small series (like Victory Road). They are printed on low-quality paper, allowing locally published volumes to remain affordable. This combination of publication strategies has enabled Algerian manga to circumvent the financial barrier to <b>access</b> <b>that</b> young Algerian consumers face with imported manga and even local BD albums. Easy to serialize, Z-Link's low-cost medium has also helped artists to compete – at least on a local level – with foreign manga that admittedly are more intricate and include higher quality graphics.|$|E
