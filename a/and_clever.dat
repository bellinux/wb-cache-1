5|$|January Jones became {{pregnant}} {{in between the}} fourth and fifth season of the series. Instead of writing in a pregnancy for the Betty Francis character, the writers opted to write in a weight gain. January Jones wore a fat suit during the filming of this episode, the same technique used by Elizabeth Moss during the first season when her character encountered a similar weight gain (though in that instance, the character was actually pregnant). Make-up tricks <b>and</b> <b>clever</b> camera angles were also used to create the dramatic impression of Betty's weight gain. A body double was used for the scene in which Betty rises from the bathtub.|$|E
5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style <b>and</b> <b>clever</b> plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of Jane Austen, one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E

5|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with many considering it a highlight from the album. Many reviewers complimented its production <b>and</b> <b>clever</b> interpolation of the DeBarge sample, while some criticized it {{for being too}} simple for an artist of Carey's caliber. Though expected by critics to have surely become Carey's 19th chart-topping single in the United States, the track only managed to reach a peak position of number fifty-eight on the Billboard Hot 100. Throughout other countries where it was released, the song achieved relatively weak charting, peaking within the top forty in Japan and Slovakia, and peaking at numbers sixty-nine and eighty-four in Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia {{reached a}} level of {{accuracy}} comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate {{the length of time}} they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair <b>and</b> <b>clever</b> old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.|$|E
5|$|Since the Bronze Age of Comics, the Joker {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as an archetypal trickster, displaying talents for cunning intelligence, social engineering, pranks, theatricality, and idiomatic humor. Like the trickster, the Joker alternates between malicious violence <b>and</b> <b>clever,</b> harmless whimsy. He is amoral and not driven by ethical considerations, but by a shameless and insatiable nature, and although his actions are condemned as evil, he is necessary for cultural robustness. The trickster employs amoral and immoral acts to destabilize {{the status quo and}} reveal cultural, political, and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore. However, the Joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself. The Joker possesses abnormal body imagery, reflecting an inversion of order. The trickster is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman, a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind. In Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker serves as Batman's trickster guide through the hero's own psyche, testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the Asylum to Batman.|$|E
