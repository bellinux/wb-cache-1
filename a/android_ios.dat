5|$|The idea {{to develop}} a remake came when Oyamada, due to the Mana series' 25th anniversary in 2016, thought about how he would like players {{to be able to}} play through the series in {{sequential}} order on modern game platforms. The platforms – <b>Android,</b> <b>iOS</b> and PlayStation Vita – were decided on from the beginning. Initially, there were some arguments at Square Enix about whether to create the game using 2D or 3D graphics; they settled on 3D, as Oyamada thought that 3D games are easier to control on smartphones. Additionally, the development team thought that a 3D version would be better, as it could be used as a base for potential remakes of other Mana games; depending on the reception of Adventures of Mana, Oyamada said that he would like {{to develop a}} remake of Seiken Densetsu 3, and would consider one of Secret of Mana depending on demand.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we examine}} the IO {{characteristics}} of two smartphone platforms: Android and Tizen. We compare how the two platforms differ in using the filesystem, using the database, and accessing the storage. We collected the IOs from select seven different apps that are commonly available on both platforms. By analyzing the collected the IOs on both platforms, a dominant fraction of writes are 4 KB synchronous. On Android and Tizen, respectively, 65 % and 45 % of all write IO counts 4 KB; 47 % and 75 % of all writes accesses are SQLite related files such as database, rollback journal, WAL (Write Ahead Log), and etc.; 81 % and 86 % of all IOs are random accesses; and 90 % and 52 % of all writes counts are synchronous IO mode. According to our <b>IO</b> analysis, <b>Android</b> <b>IO</b> stack is more sophisticated then Tizen one: (i) disables a time updates, (ii) adopts journal asynchronous commit, and (iii) adopts fdatasync() in SQLite.

40|$|This work is {{dedicated}} to resolve the Journaling of Journal Anomaly in <b>Android</b> <b>IO</b> stack. We orchestrate SQLite and EXT 4 filesystem so that SQLite’s file-backed journaling activity can dispense with the expensive filesystem intervention, the journaling, without compromising the file integrity under unexpected filesystem failure. In storing the logs, we exploit the direct IO to suppress the filesystem interference. This work consists of three key ingredients: (i) Preallocation with Explicit Journaling, (ii) Header Embedding, and (iii) Group Synchronization. Preallocation with Explicit Journaling eliminates the filesystem journaling properly protecting the file metadata against the unexpected system crash. We redesign the SQLite B-tree structure with Header Embedding to make it direct IO compatible and block IO friendly. With Group Synch, we minimize the synchronization overhead of direct IO and make the SQLite operation NAND Flash friendly. Combining the three technical ingredients, we develop a new journal mode in SQLite, the WALDIO. We implement it on the commercially available smartphone. WALDIO mode achieves 5. 1 × performance (insert/sec) against WAL mode which is the fastest journaling mode in SQLite. It yields 2. 7 × performance (inserts/sec) against the LS-MVBT, the fastest SQLite journaling mode known to public. WALDIO mode achieves 7. 4 × performance (insert/sec) against WAL mode when it is relieved from the overhead of explicitly synchronizing individual log-commit operations. WALDIO mode reduces the IO volume to 1 / 6 compared against the WAL mode. We {{would like to thank}} the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and feedback. Special thanks go to our shepherd Theodore Ts’o whose constructive comment and advice have made our work further mature and rigorous.

40|$|Treballs Finals de Grau d'Enginyeria Informàtica, Facultat de Matemàtiques, Universitat de Barcelona, Any: 2013, Director: Oriol Pujol VilaIn a {{very few}} years, the mobile phones have evolved at a vertiginous pace, {{starting}} as communication devices and turning into small computers (Smart Phones) <b>Android</b> and <b>iOs</b> are ones of the most known operating systems for mobile terminals. In this project, we focused on Android platform, which is Open Source and uses the Java programming language. This project introduces the concepts of capturing, processing and image recognition. The aim of {{the plan is to}} make an able software to automatically recognise an image, or part of it, and show the closest image to it by comparing the original in a local database of the terminal. In order to make this possible, the project has been divided in two big points. The first one, was performed using the MATLAB, mathematical software tool. From an image stored on the user’s image gallery, and through a program created with the tool MATLAB, the five more similar images to the original one, were extracted from a database local computer hard drive. This process was done by the edge detection algorithm "Canny" and the "Bwdist", both of them calculate the distance of every pixel in the image to the nearest white pixel. At a later time we will be back to explain these algorithms and how the program runs. The second point of the project was to perform an Android app with the same goal as the first point. The difference is in the database, in this case, lies in the mobile SD card, so the image provided by the user may come from the phone's picture gallery or the camera of the terminal. This app uses calculations performed in Matlab and stored in a txt file, which in turn is stored in the phone's SD memory. This application may be a starting point for future extensions of the app, such as: become a client-server application; be able to expand the comparison data base by uploading photos in real time; allow internet connection; GPS location of the source image; etc...|$|R
