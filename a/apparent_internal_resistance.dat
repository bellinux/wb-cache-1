The method of measuring battery’s <b>internal</b> <b>resistance</b> and voltage is analyzed and studied in this paper, {{and the two}} methods are optimized.

It is impossible to directly measure the <b>internal</b> <b>resistance</b> of a battery, but it can be calculated from current and voltage data measured from a circuit.

It was {{shown that the}} impact of RGO on electrical characteristics of PS manifests a reduction (about and order in magnitude) of the <b>internal</b> <b>resistance</b> of hybrid structures.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to clarify the <b>internal</b> <b>resistance</b> of the PMFC. To characterize <b>internal</b> <b>resistances</b> of the PMFC current interrupt and polarization were used, and partial resistances were calculated. The <b>internal</b> <b>resistance</b> consisted mainly of anode resistance and membrane resistance which both decreased during current interrupt. The anode resistance was the result of mass transfer resistance in the electrochemically active biofilm. The membrane resistance was the result of accumulation of cations in the cathode. The polarization showed a distinct hysteresis which was explained by the increase of the <b>internal</b> <b>resistance</b> during polarization. The increase of this resistance makes it difficult to interpret the maximum power output of the PMFC...|$|R

Battery status is monitored and simulated by battery pack test bench. Through using ideal battery model and fitting the data of measured voltage and current, the battery <b>internal</b> <b>resistance</b> and open-circuit voltage are estimated. The average relative error between battery statistic <b>internal</b> <b>resistance</b> and pulse <b>internal</b> <b>resistance</b> is less than 15 % in different state of charge. Relative error is influenced by dispersion and symmetry of charge or discharge current. Average of absolute error in open-circuit voltage is about 5 % respectively.

To increase power output of the P-MFC <b>internal</b> <b>resistances</b> need to be reduced. With a flat-plate P-MFC design we tried to minimize <b>internal</b> <b>resistances</b> compared to the previously used tubular P-MFC design.
