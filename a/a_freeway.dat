5|$|The {{intersection}} of Route 14 with Via Princessa in Santa Clarita {{is an unusual}} design, with long flyover ramps for the connections. This {{is the result of}} <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> revolt by the residents of Santa Clarita, that canceled plans for <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> extension of Route 126. While the Via Princessa alignment of Route 126 was canceled, a different alignment is being constructed with proposed connections to Route 14.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the road}} was {{originally}} designed to be <b>a</b> <b>freeway,</b> budget limitations precluded the construction of overpasses; apart from the interchanges with Highway401, Laird Road, and Wellington Street West (Highway7 and former Highway24), all junctions are at-grade intersections. There are also two railway crossings near the northern terminus, though both are for spur lines. The Hanlon is graded and landscaped similarly to <b>a</b> <b>freeway,</b> with broad flat shoulders and an open median.|$|E
5000|$|Oregon Route 22 is <b>a</b> four-lane divided <b>freeway</b> from Salem east to {{just north}} of Aumsville.

5|$|In the 1980s, Congressman William J. Hughes {{proposed}} <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> {{along the}} US 40 corridor {{in order to}} alleviate increased traffic along that route following the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City. This freeway, {{which was to be}} maintained by the New Jersey Expressway Authority, was to run from the Delaware Memorial Bridge east to Atlantic City. The NJDOT determined that the traffic volume on US 40 did not justify the construction of <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> along the corridor. The Cardiff Circle along US 40/US 322 at CR 563 and CR 608 in Egg Harbor Township was eliminated in a $3.7 million project completed in 2002.|$|E
5|$|On September15, 1960, the Shook's Hill interchange, {{a unique}} rotary junction, was {{completed}} {{at what is}} now Erin Mills Parkway. It was opened to traffic the following day, and completed the program to make the QEW <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> between Burlington and Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Plans for <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> {{along the}} Route 21 {{corridor}} between Newark and Paterson {{date back to}} the early 1930s and became official in 1951. In 1958, the highway was extended northward as <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> along {{the west bank of the}} Passaic River to an interchange with Park Avenue in Nutley. Route 21 was extended to the Passaic Park interchange in 1962,Main Avenue in 1968, and Monroe Street in 1973. With the completion of the freeway, a portion of the former route was briefly known as Route 21A.|$|E

5|$|Since {{at least}} 1936, Route 17 (then Route 2) was planned for {{upgrading}} to <b>a</b> <b>freeway,</b> not only north of U.S. Route 46, but also {{south to the}} Newark area. The first plan for <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> {{along the length of}} the route was halted due to World War II, and the second plan for <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> in the 1960s was cancelled due to the disruption it was projected to cause to businesses and residents along its path. In 1972, there were plans to extend Route 17 past Route 3 to Interstate 280 in Harrison. The plans for this five-mile (eight kilometer), $50 million extension were cancelled due to the defeat of a transportation bond that would have funded the proposed freeway. The interchange at Route 3 was built to allow for this southern extension. Another extension of Route 17 to the New Jersey Turnpike was brought up in 1987, but was ultimately scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1996, Traverse City-area {{residents}} and tourists requested <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> bypass the city. These residents {{decided to not}} build the highway. In 2001, The idea was revived, but MDOT abandoned these plans in June of that year.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>freeway</b> {{along the}} I-475 {{corridor}} was {{proposed in the}} 1950s. The 1955 Yellow Book, an early proposal for {{what would become the}} Interstate Highway System, contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Flint area, including a loop route freeway near the downtown area. Designated as part of the Interstate Highway System in 1957, I-475 construction was funded by the federal government.|$|E

Congestion pricing has been used since 2007 during rush hours {{in order to maintain}} reasonable speeds within the city core.|$|E
5|$|From 1974 to 1977, Oceanside police {{kept track}} of over 1,000 {{accidents}} that occurred along SR 76. A citizen action group known as Concerned Citizens for Highway 76 formed soon after. Caltrans began holding hearings again in 1979, proposing the building of an expressway as opposed to <b>a</b> <b>freeway</b> or to widening Mission Avenue. At one hearing, local officials criticized the delay, while others criticized the routing, the decision to build an expressway instead of <b>a</b> <b>freeway,</b> and building a route through an environmentally sensitive area. In May 1980, the state Assembly Transportation Committee approved a resolution that requested an answer from the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, and Caltrans as to why certain projects, including SR76, had not been started.|$|E
5|$|From I-805 to SR163, {{the highway}} goes through {{an area with}} visible Pliocene {{sedimentary}} rocks estimated to be 10million years old.
