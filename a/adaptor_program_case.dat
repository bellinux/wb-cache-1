We investigated three questions using these tools: 1) How do subjects organize templates? 2) How well can subjects understand and locate templates in the template library? 3) Does the template library help subjects reuse templates to solve new problems?

40|$|The {{essence of}} {{architectural}} styles is component communication. In this paper, we relate architectural styles to adaptors in the GenVoca model of software construction. GenVoca components are refinements {{that have a}} wide range of implementations, from binaries to rule-sets of program transformation systems. We explain that architectural styles can (1) be understood as refinements (like other GenVoca components) and (2) that they are generalizations of the OO concept of adaptors. By implementing <b>adaptors</b> as <b>program</b> transformations, complex architectural styles can be realized in GenVoca that simply could not be expressed using less powerful implementation techniques (e. g., object adaptors).
