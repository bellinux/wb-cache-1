5|$|In December 1921, the Australian Air Board {{prepared}} to form its first five squadrons and allocate aircraft to each, {{as well as}} to the nascent flying school. The plan was for No.1 FTS to receive twelve Avro 504Ks and four Sopwith Pups, and the squadrons a total of eight Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, eight <b>Airco</b> DH.9s, and three Fairey IIIs. Funding problems forced the Air Force to disband the newly raised squadrons on 1July 1922 and re-form them as flights in a composite squadron under No.1 FTS. The same month, Flight Lieutenant Frank McNamara, VC, took command of the school.|$|E
5|$|Kenney {{remained}} {{for a time}} with the Allied occupation forces in Germany, and was promoted to captain on 18 March 1919. He returned to the United States in June 1919. He was sent to Kelly Field, near San Antonio, Texas, and then to McAllen, Texas. As commander of the 8th Aero Squadron, he flew reconnaissance missions {{along the border with}} Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. Poor aircraft maintenance, rough landing strips and bad weather led to the squadron losing 22 of its 24 <b>Airco</b> DH.4 aircraft in just one year.|$|E
5|$|On 7 May {{he became}} the 107th non-commissioned officer to receive his CFS certificate. He passed as Second Class Flier. He {{was good enough to}} be {{selected}} as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself. Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching a student in the <b>Airco</b> DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 1917, No. 2 Wireless School {{was formed}} at Penshurst. It {{operated}} {{a variety of}} aircraft, including <b>Airco</b> DH.6, Avro 504K, Avro 504N, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c and B.E.2e, Sopwith Camel and Sopwith Snipe. Aircrew attended the school for a one-week-long course in wireless telephony procedures. The school was disbanded on 23 March 1919. Knotley Hall was offered for sale in May 1919. In September 1919, {{it was announced that}} Penshurst had been disposed of by the Royal Air Force, and that it could be considered as an emergency landing ground for civil aircraft.|$|E
5|$|No. 1 Squadron {{returned}} to Australia on 5March 1919, and was disbanded. In 1921, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) was {{established as a}} separate branch of the military, and on 1January 1922, the squadron was re-formed on paper. Its planned strength, approved by the Air Board in December 1921, was three officers and five airmen, operating four <b>Airco</b> DH.9s. Funding problems for the fledgling Air Force resulted in the disbandment on 1July of No.1 Squadron and other units established at the same time, their aircraft and personnel instead forming a single squadron of six flights {{under the control of}} No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS) at Point Cook. No.1 Squadron was reactivated as an operational unit of the RAAF reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF), at Point Cook on 1July 1925. Its commanding officer was Flight Lieutenant Harry Cobby.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} {{moved to}} Shawbury {{the day after}} it was formed and then to Ternhill on 29 June. On 1 September it {{became part of the}} 1st Training Wing when that unit was established to command the four AFC training squadrons in England (the others being No.5, No.7 and No.8 Squadrons). In January 1918 the squadron was redesignated No.6 Squadron AFC; the other AFC units were also renamed at this time. No. 6 Squadron moved to Minchinhampton on 25 February. The squadron used several different types of aircraft to train pilots, including the Bristol Scout D, Sopwith 1½ Strutter, Sopwith Pup, Avro 504, <b>Airco</b> DH.5, Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 and Sopwith Camel. While most of these aircraft types were outdated and suitable only for elementary flight training, the S.E.5s, Sopwith Pups and Sopwith Camels were up to date and in service with combat units in France.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{take any}} further part in the war as an infantryman, Phillipps would {{normally}} have been repatriated to Australia, but instead engineered a transfer to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as adjutant of No.2 Squadron. After getting a taste of flying as a passenger, the twenty-five-year-old applied for pilot training, altering his birthdate from 1892 to 1896. The official age limit for pilots in the AFC was thirty, but the preferred age was under twenty-three. Phillipps' application was accepted in May 1917 and, after qualifying for his wings, his proficiency was considered such that in August he was attached to No.32 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps to gain operational experience in France. Within three days of arriving he crash-landed his <b>Airco</b> DH.5 after it was hit by anti-aircraft fire near Ypres, but he escaped injury; {{by the time he}} completed his attachment in September he was leading combat patrols.|$|E
5|$|Walker courted Marguerite Potter, a {{sorority}} {{member and}} sociology graduate at the Norman {{campus of the}} University of Oklahoma. The two were married in September 1922. In lieu of a honeymoon, they boarded a troop transport to the Philippines on 12 December 1922. Walker initially became Commander of the Air Intelligence Section at Camp Nichols. He was then posted to the Philippine Air Depot, where he served at various times as property officer, supply officer, adjutant, and depot inspector, before ultimately being assigned to the 28th Bombardment Squadron in 1924. In August 1923 he crashed an <b>Airco</b> DH.4 on take off but walked away unhurt. The Walkers had two sons, Kenneth Jr., born in February 1927, and Douglas, born in January 1933.|$|E
5|$|AirSpace officially {{opened to}} the public on 12 July 2008. Over 30 {{aircraft}} are on display, dating back to the First World War; early aircraft include rare examples of an <b>Airco</b> DH.9 and a Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8. The former is one of only six surviving DH9s and the only example on display in the UK, and the latter is the only complete and original R.E.8 in existence. More recent notable aircraft include a Hawker Siddeley Harrier which served during the Falklands War with No. 1 Squadron RAF, and a Panavia Tornado, which flew the highest number of bomber sorties of any Tornado in the 1991 Gulf War. Also on display is a British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2 strike aircraft, one of only two survivors from the cancellation of the project in 1965. Recent additions include Eurofighter Typhoon DA4, one of seven Typhoon development aircraft, which was donated to the museum by the Ministry of Defence in 2008 and went on display in June 2009. Civil aircraft include the Duxford Aviation Society's Concorde and Comet described above.|$|E
5|$|In February 1920, a Notice to Airmen {{was issued}} advising pilots {{that had made}} {{emergency}} landings at Penshurst that they could use the War Office telephone to inform the police of their arrival and to obtain conveyances for their passengers {{to take them to}} Penshurst station. On 5 June 1920, the first air mail flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired <b>Airco</b> DH.9 with 300 letters on board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not to land at Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced to land at Penshurst due to a combination of the weather and running low on fuel. A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the letters on to London. A linen windsock was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921. On 24 September 1921, a de Havilland DH.18 aircraft diverted to Penshurst as Croydon was fogbound.|$|E
5|$|No.6 Squadron was disbanded in March 1919. Along {{with many}} other Australian Flying Corps {{personnel}} including Colonel Watt, Major Roy King, and Captain Garnet Malley, Holden departed for Australia on 6 May aboard the troopship Kaisar-i-Hind, disembarking in Sydney on 19 June. He was discharged from the AFC on 18 August 1919. After {{taking part in the}} Commonwealth Government's Peace Loan flights, he joined Holden's Motor Body Builders as its Sydney manager. In May 1921, he served with Malley and other veteran pilots as a pall-bearer at Watt's funeral in Randwick. Holden married Kathleen Packman at St Mark's Anglican Church in Darling Point on 3 June 1924; the couple had three daughters. On 19 June 1925, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) established the Citizen Air Force as a part-time active reserve, and Holden became one of its first recruits. Ranked flight lieutenant, he served as a pilot with No.3 Squadron, which operated <b>Airco</b> DH.9s and S.E.5s. Formed at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, it transferred to the newly opened RAAF Richmond, New South Wales, during 29–30 June; Holden and Malley touched down at Richmond with the first two S.E.5s on the 30th.|$|E
5|$|After {{commissioning}} {{too late}} {{to participate in the}} First World War, Argus was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from Furious. The first landing on the ship was made on 1 October 1918 by a Sopwith Ship Strutter. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups. Argus was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush {{with the rest of the}} flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. Argus joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying eight Ship Strutters, four Sopwith Camel fighters, two <b>Airco</b> DH.9A bombers and two Fairey floatplanes. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.|$|E
5|$|Malley relinquished his {{appointment}} in the Commonwealth Military Forces on 18June 1925. The following day, he was commissioned a flight {{lieutenant in the}} Citizen Air Force, the part-time active reserve of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He served as a pilot with No.3 Squadron, which operated <b>Airco</b> DH.9s and Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s. Formed at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, the squadron transferred to the newly opened RAAF Richmond, New South Wales, on 30June. From 1925 to 1928, Malley was {{vice president of the}} Australian Flying Corps Association. In January 1928, he was promoted to honorary squadron leader, and temporarily commanded No.3 Squadron in March–April. That year, he gave up his position with Malley's to become an aviation consultant to Australian National Airways (ANA), as well as a director of the company. In January–February 1929, he again temporarily commanded No.3 Squadron. That April, {{he was a member of}} the citizens' committee responsible for organising and funding the search for the Southern Cross and its crew, Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, who had force-landed in North West Australia during a flight from Richmond to England. Les Holden eventually located the missing airmen near the Kimberley region. In 1930, Malley transferred to the (inactive) RAAF Reserve.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{cessation}} of hostilities, {{the large number of}} war-surplus machines, sharp fluctuations in business confidence, and the government's failure, unlike those of USA and France, to provide any form of support, <b>Airco</b> became unprofitable. Thomas endeavoured to sell <b>Airco</b> to a car manufacturer. <b>Airco</b> and BSA, parent company of Daimler, announced on 1 March 1920 that <b>Airco</b> had amalgamated with Birmingham Small Arms Company.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Airco</b> DH.16 was a British four-seat {{commercial}} biplane of the 1910s {{designed by}} Geoffrey de Havilland, the chief designer at <b>Airco.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the war Daimler {{had built}} {{enormous}} numbers of aero engines and aircraft {{and by the}} end was building 80 <b>Airco</b> de Havilland bombers a month. In February 1920 BSA amalgamated with what was the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, Aircraft Manufacturing Company (<b>Airco),</b> Airco's main plant at Hendon had employed between 7,000 and 8,000 people. The <b>Airco</b> group of companies had turned out a new aircraft every 45 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The first DH.18 was {{delivered}} to Aircraft Transport and Travel for use on the Croydon-Paris service, but was wrecked in a forced landing shortly after takeoff from Croydon on 16 August 1920. Two more aircraft were under construction by <b>Airco</b> for Aircraft Transport and Travel when the bankrupt <b>Airco</b> was purchased by BSA, who {{did not wish to}} continue aircraft development or production. Geoffrey de Havilland, the chief designer of <b>Airco</b> then set up the de Havilland Aircraft Company, completing the two partly completed aircraft as DH.18As, with improved engine mountings and undercarriages.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Airco</b> DH.9C was a British {{passenger}} aircraft.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 453 DH.2s were {{produced}} by <b>Airco.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Airco</b> DH.1A - Around 70 {{built with}} Beardmore engines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Airco</b> DH.3A - Second {{prototype}} with a Beardmore engine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Airco</b> DH.9 (1917) – Two-seat biplane day bomber {{with single}} tractor propeller.|$|E
25|$|<b>Airco</b> DH.15 Gazelle (1919) - One DH.9A {{aircraft}} {{converted into}} an engine test-bed.|$|E
25|$|The Aircraft Manufacturing Company Limited (<b>Airco)</b> was a British {{aircraft}} manufacturer operating from 1912 to 1920. <b>Airco</b> produced thousands of aircraft for the British military during the First World War, {{most of which}} were designed by their chief designer, Geoffrey de Havilland. Advertised in 1918 as the largest aircraft company in the world, <b>Airco</b> established the first airline in the United Kingdom, Aircraft Transport and Travel Limited, as a subsidiary. A glut of war surplus aircraft and a lack of government interest in aviation caused the company to become unprofitable, and in 1920 it was sold to Birmingham Small Arms Company, who had its operations liquidated later that year.|$|E
25|$|A British Royal Air Force {{contingent}} comprising <b>Airco</b> DH.4 bombers, Fairey Campania and Sopwith Baby seaplanes {{along with}} a single Sopwith Camel fighter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Airco</b> DH.10 Amiens (1918) – Two-engine biplane bomber. First {{prototype}} used pusher propeller; second prototype {{and production}} aircraft used tractor propellers. Manufactured by Daimler.|$|E
25|$|By December 1918, Holt Thomas {{claimed in}} an {{advertisement}} that <b>Airco</b> {{was the largest}} aircraft {{company in the world}} and was building aeroplanes, engines and propellors in large numbers, as well as airships and flying boats. The engines being built included licensed production of Gnome and Le Rhone rotary engines. The company's works at Hendon employed between 7,000 and 8,000 people and had the latest metal-working machinery, a materials testing laboratory, and a wind tunnel. <b>Airco</b> was completing on average a new aircraft every 45 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{reported}} otherwise, a few Liberty engines did see action in France as power for the American version of the <b>Airco</b> DH.4.|$|E
25|$|Posted to No. 32 Squadron, {{he scored}} his first aerial victory on 14 May 1917 while flying a <b>Airco</b> DH.2 single-seat fighter in Arthur Coningham's flight. His {{squadron}} was re-equipped with the <b>Airco</b> DH.5, {{in which he}} scored twice more in early July, before he was appointed a flight commander on 13 July 1917, with the acting rank of captain. He shared in three more victories before a report of his being wounded in action on 31 July was published on 16 August 1917.|$|E
25|$|Royal New Zealand Air Force – Three <b>Airco</b> DH.9s {{in service}} with the New Zealand Permanent Air Force from 1923 to 1929 as {{advanced}} training aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft Transport and Travel, a {{subsidiary}} of <b>Airco,</b> started the world's first regular daily international service on 25 August 1919, between Hounslow Heath Aerodrome and Le Bourget. DH.16s were used for this service.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Airco</b> DH.9 (from de Havilland 9) – {{also known}} after 1920 as the de Havilland DH.9 – was a British single-engined biplane bomber {{developed}} and deployed during the First World War.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, the Aircraft Operating Company, an {{official}} contractor to the British Ordnance Survey for aerial survey work overseas, required {{a replacement for}} the converted <b>Airco</b> DH.9s that formed {{the majority of its}} fleet.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{told the}} Commons that whereas an army {{campaign}} in Somalia {{would have cost}} £6,000,000 the air force expedition had cost £70,000. It had involved 6 <b>Airco</b> DH9 bombers {{and a total of}} less than 250 aircrew.|$|E
25|$|As a result, in 1925 {{the entire}} country's attack air force (3rd Attack Group that is, as {{differentiated}} from the bomber force) consisted of fourteen <b>Airco</b> DH-4 machines, inadequate even for training, let alone for combat.|$|E
25|$|The Vickers Type 131 Valiant was a British {{general-purpose}} biplane {{produced by}} Vickers in 1927, {{with the intention}} of replacing the Royal Air Force's <b>Airco</b> DH.9As, but was unsuccessful, with only a single example built, which was sold to Chile.|$|E
