Word of their experimentation spread and in 1969, a British guitarist and multi-instrumentalist named Phil Lithman and the mysterious (and perhaps apocryphal) N. Senada (whom Lithman had picked up in Bavaria where the aged avant-gardist was recording birds singing) paid them a visit, and decided to remain.|$|E

Condon, for instance, wrote of being amazed by Beiderbecke's piano playing: [...] "All my life I had been listening to music [...] But I had never heard <b>anything</b> <b>remotely</b> like what Beiderbecke played. For the first time I realized music isn't all the same, it had become an entirely new set of sounds" [...] "I tried to explain Bix to the gang," [...] Carmichael wrote, but [...] "t was no good, like the telling of a vivid, personal dream [...] the emotion couldn't be transmitted." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{weeks of}} nominal homelessness, Gibson {{was hired as}} the manager of Toronto's first head shop, a {{retailer}} of drug paraphernalia. He found the city's émigré community of American draft dodgers unbearable owing to the prevalence of clinical depression, suicide, and hardcore substance abuse. He appeared, during the Summer of Love of 1967, in a CBC newsreel item about hippie subculture in Yorkville, Toronto, {{for which he was}} paid $500 – the equivalent of 20 weeks rent – which financed his later travels. Aside from a [...] "brief, riot-torn spell" [...] in the District of Columbia, Gibson {{spent the rest of the}} 1960s in Toronto, where he met Vancouverite Deborah Jean Thompson, with whom he subsequently traveled to Europe. Gibson has recounted that they concentrated their travels on European nations with fascist regimes and favorable exchange rates, including spending time on a Greek archipelago and in Istanbul in 1970, as they [...] "couldn't afford to stay anywhere that had <b>anything</b> <b>remotely</b> like hard currency".|$|E
500|$|The games' {{graphics}} and audio also received praise and criticism from reviewers. IGN's {{review of the}} PSP version of My Spanish Coach noted {{that the fact that}} the game appeared on multiple platforms contributed to its [...] "sparse look and feel" [...] because the games' {{graphics and}} audio were made for the Nintendo DS. Eurogamer praised the games' [...] "clean, crisp visuals" [...] and [...] "jolly accordion music and jolly fiesta music". In contrast, IGN's review of the DS versions of both games called the music [...] "catchy but repetitive" [...] and the graphics [...] "cute but nothing to write home about". GameZone noted that [...] "he visual concept was obviously not a front runner in [...] conception", and that the audio of neither game [...] " [...] <b>anything</b> <b>remotely</b> special". Nintendo World Report made note of the games' narrator during the lessons, praising its [...] "clear and coherent glory" [...] in terms of pronouncing the words correctly.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack for Monaco was {{composed}} by Grammy-nominated Austin Wintory, {{who had previously}} worked as the composer for games such as flOw and Journey. The original soundtrack and a remixed album called Gentleman's Private Collection were released on April 24, 2013. The soundtrack incorporates pianos and drums into what Christian Donlan (Eurogamer) thought was one of Wintory's best works yet. The Gentleman's Private Collection contains remixes of the original soundtrack by other notable composers, including Peter Hollens, Tina Guo who played the violin in the Journey soundtrack, and Chipzel who composed the soundtrack for Super Hexagon. When Wintory was approached by Schatz, he was excited by the request because it involved using humorous [...] "old-timey piano". [...] "When else am I {{ever going to be}} asked to write <b>anything</b> <b>remotely</b> like this?", he exclaimed. Schatz originally wanted to use licensed music thinking that the project was too small to warrant its own soundtrack, but after discussions, Wintory persuaded him that an original soundtrack was warranted. The full soundtrack and Gentleman's Private Collection were released onto Wintory's Bandcamp microsite.|$|E

[...] DVD Talk's Jeffrey Robinson writes that [...] "if anything, it will bore you and leave you wondering why you wasted {{an hour and a}} half of your life." [...] Writing in JoBlo.com, Adam Quigley poked fun at the film's themes, declaring that [...] "if there's a lesson to be taken from these films, it's that women are objects, and should always be treated as such." [...] IGNs Hock Teh gave the film 5/10, writing that it [...] "stays very close to the American Pie formula," [...] while criticizing the story as [...] "devoid of <b>anything</b> <b>remotely</b> semi-compelling or even noteworthy."

500|$|... "New York" [...] was {{met with}} mixed reviews by many critics. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "We didn't {{actually}} expect the New Directions to win nationals, but the episode just {{felt like it was}} going through the motions rather than seizing the opportunity to do something truly spectacular." [...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff called the episode a [...] "good piece of television", and gave it a [...] "B+". He said it [...] "wasn't as good" [...] as the first-season finale, [...] "Journey to Regionals", [...] "largely because it wasted {{a lot of time on}} performances designed solely to show off how the show was actually in New York and also because it borrowed a lot of that episode's set pieces without finding <b>anything</b> <b>remotely</b> as powerful as the performance of 'Bohemian Rhapsody. Robert Canning of IGN gave [...] "New York" [...] a [...] "good" [...] grade of 7.5 out of 10 and stated, [...] "while not as epic as Nationals in New York should have been, 'New York' was a decent close to an enjoyable season." [...] The Atlantic Meghan Brown said the episode was [...] "an uneven end to an uneven season, with a few killer numbers, strange resolutions, and head-scratching plot devices", while her colleague Kevin Fallon opined that the season finale was [...] "no exception" [...] to Glee having [...] "been undeniably frustrating in season two", though [...] "there was still ample reason to tune in and enjoy".|$|E
500|$|On December 14, 2012, {{academic}} and writer Judith Reisman stated {{in a piece}} for WorldNetDaily that in her view Wales had received revenue from a website which dealt in pornography. Relatively soon after the article was published, Wales wrote to WorldNetDaily to object to this characterization: [...] "This is absolutely and categoricallly [...] false. I have never made any 'fortune', as a pornography trafficker or otherwise, and I have never been a 'pornography trafficker' at all. ... I demand an immediate edit to that story to remove the lie about me." [...] WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah personally replied to Wales to explain that Wikipedia's coverage {{of the history of}} Bomis acknowledged at the time that: [...] "Bomis ran a website called Bomis Premium at premium.bomis.com until 2005, offering customers access to premium, X-rated pornographic content." [...] Wales sent an email to Farah stating Wikipedia: [...] "doesn't say <b>anything</b> <b>remotely</b> like me making a 'fortune' from 'pornography." [...] Wales inquired to Farah {{what he was going to}} do next about what Wales characterized as [...] "libel". Farah responded to Wales' reply with a subsequent email asking: [...] "Let me get this straight: You admit making money from pornography, but you feel defamed because you didn’t make enough for it to be considered a 'fortune'?" [...] Wales then repeated his original request to Farah and again asserted the original article was [...] "defamatory", writing in an email: [...] "This is a defamatory falsehood.

500|$|On October 19, 2010, Scribner {{published}} {{a collection of}} short stories, Palo Alto, by Franco. The book is named after the California city where Franco grew up and is dedicated to many of the writers he worked with at Brooklyn College. Inspired by some of Franco's own teenage memories Palo Alto, and memories written and submitted by high school students at Palo Alto Senior High School, consists of life in Palo Alto as experienced by a series of teenagers who {{spend most of their time}} indulging in driving drunk, smoking weed and taking part in unplanned acts of violence. Each passage is told by a young narrator. The book has received mixed reviews; Los Angeles Times called it [...] "the work of an ambitious young man who clearly loves to read, who has a good eye for detail, but who has spent way too much time on style and virtually none on substance". The Guardian said that Franco's [...] "foray into the literary world may be met with cynicism in some quarters, but this is a promising debut from a most unlikely source". Writing in The New York Times, reviewer and fellow author Joshua Mohr praised Franco for how, in the story [...] "American History", he juxtaposed historical parts with a present-day social commentary that [...] "makes the we wonder how much we've actually evolved in post-bellum America". At least one editor of a literary journal testified he would not publish Franco's stories, claiming he has been published due to his star power, not literary talent. Publishers Weekly reviewed the collection, stating [...] "The author fails to find <b>anything</b> <b>remotely</b> insightful to say in these 11 amazingly underwhelming stories".|$|E
