5|$|In 1975–76 Shero {{guided the}} Flyers to a 51–13–16 record {{highlighted}} by a 36–2–2 home ice record. Again {{they won the}} Patrick division and finished first overall in the Campbell Conference. The season saw the club set franchise records in points and winning percentage. The season also witnessed an exhibition game, that {{would become one of}} the most famous games in Flyers history. In 1976 the Soviet Red Army team toured North America and played four games against NHL clubs. On January 11, 1976, the Russians matched up against the Flyers at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Entering the game the Red Army team was unbeaten, defeating both Boston and the Rangers and registering a tie against the Canadiens. Shero had studied the Soviet style of play, even traveling to the Soviet Union during different off-seasons. Shero even implemented some of the Russian style into his own system, altering it slightly. With his knowledge of the Russian system, Shero devised <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan.</b> The Russian system involved making several passes often to where a player had just moved from. Shero instructed the Flyers' players not to chase the puck, but rather hold their positions. While in the offensive zone the Flyer forwards were to hold the puck as much as possible to avoid counter-attacks. The Flyers won the game by a final of 4–1 and outshot the Red Army 49–13. The victory led some to see the Flyers as the best team in the world. Following the playoffs that distinction would not last. Bernie Parent had suffered a back injury that limited him to eleven regular season games; he was able to return for the first-round series win versus Toronto. But the pain became too much for Parent to continue to play in subsequent series, and Shero was forced to use his back-up goaltender, Wayne Stephenson. The Flyers were also without second-line centre MacLeish, resulting in a depletion of scoring depth. Despite these setbacks Shero led Philadelphia past Boston in the semi-finals and back to the Stanley Cup Finals. However, the Flyers fell short of winning three straight cups, losing to Montreal in four consecutive games.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 2008, Margarito {{engaged in}} a rematch with Cintron, who had won the IBF Welterweight title belt {{following}} his loss to Margarito in 2005. In the early rounds, Cintron struck Margarito with several flush power shots to the head, but Margarito remained unhurt and continued to execute <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan</b> of continuously moving forward and pressuring Cintron. In the sixth round, Margarito landed a liver shot, knocking Cintron out and taking the IBF title. As the referee counted Cintron out, HBO cameras captured Margarito from a neutral corner, gesturing upward with his arms and urging Cintron to get up so {{that the two men}} could continue fighting.|$|E
25|$|Like Dickey at Florida, Rodgers {{sought to}} shift Georgia Tech's offense from a {{wishbone}} attack {{to a more}} passing-oriented offense. And also like Dickey, Rodgers's efforts did not produce immediate results. The Yellow Jackets began the season 1-5-1 and did not score more than 14 points against a Division 1-A opponent over its first seven games. Spurrier, {{who had not been}} tasked with constructing <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan</b> and had seldom been allowed to call plays up to that point, asked Coach Rodgers for a larger role on the staff and was allowed {{to take control of the}} offense for the eighth game of the season, against Duke. Georgia Tech surprised Duke with a more aggressive offense than they'd run all year, and the Yellow Jackets won, 24-14. With Spurrier continuing to call plays, Georgia Tech won the next two games as well, scoring over 20 points in both contests and setting a Georgia Tech record for passing yardage in a season. But the campaign ended with a 16-3 loss to archrival Georgia, dropping Georgia Tech to 4-6-1 overall and leading to Rodgers' dismissal.|$|E

25|$|The Buccaneers took {{an early}} lead on Mike Washington's 29-yard {{interception}} {{return for a}} touchdown, after which he left {{the game with a}} pulled stomach muscle. Ricky Bell chipped a shoulder bone on his only play of the game. A Gary Fencik interception set up a Matt Suhey touchdown run that evened the score at 7–7. The Buccaneers' special teams broke down for the second week in a row. Jeff Fisher's 88-yard punt return touchdown broke the record for the longest punt return by a Tampa Bay opponent, a record that had been set by J. T. Smith just the previous week. A long Theo Bell punt return was called back for a penalty. The Buccaneers scored again on the first drive of the second half, which ended in a Kevin House touchdown reception. However, the Bears were able to dominate possession of the football {{for the rest of the}} game, with Walter Payton moving into fourth-place all-time in NFL rushing yardage. Despite <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan</b> that Jimmie Giles described as the best he'd seen against the Bears, the Buccaneers found themselves prone to errors at critical moments. They outperformed the Bears in most major offensive categories, compiling 450 yards of offense. Several players blamed mental errors and the lack of a killer instinct for the failure to put away what they felt to be an inferior team, while others noted that the large number of injuries left the team without enough personnel to do the things they wanted to. The game left all NFC Central teams tied at 1–2.|$|E
500|$|The match {{attracted}} fervent debate amongst journalists, pundits {{and football}} players alike. Former referee Jeff Winter defended Riley's performance and described fixtures between Manchester United and Arsenal as [...] "impossible" [...] to manage. Premier League refereeing chief Keith Hackett added: [...] "We {{know this is}} one of the tough encounters of the season. Mike clearly had <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan</b> to try not to suppress the match. He wanted it to breathe and perhaps went in with the intention of getting through the game without having to dismiss any players. In the back of his mind was trying to get through a game without having a blow-up and I think Mike did extremely well to keep a lid on things." ...|$|E
500|$|Shero was an innovator, {{aside from}} being the first coach to employ systems, and {{known as one of}} the first Western coaches to study Soviet influences, he was the first coach to study film. His son Ray even recalls his father {{breaking}} down games from radio broadcasts. He was also the first to have his players use in season strength training, with the use of an Apollo machine, a precursor to Nautilus equipment. As well as one of the first coaches to adopt the morning skate. He was one of the first coaches to have <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan</b> specifically designed on how to attack opposing teams, although not all of them worked to plan. Bernie Parent recalls a game against Montreal in which Shero decided to out skate the highly skilled Canadiens. After the first period, during which the Flyers' goaltender faced 21 shots, he jokingly summed it up by saying, [...] "the Zamboni didn't even need to resurface the other end of the ice." [...] Yet it illustrates Shero's understanding that he didn't know everything about coaching and his pursuit to learn more.|$|E

500|$|In the 1974–75 season Shero led the Flyers to a 51–18–11 record. They won {{the newly}} formed Patrick Division, were first in the new Campbell Conference, and first overall in the NHL. In their opening series the Flyers swept the Toronto Maple Leafs, setting up a semi-final match-up against the New York Islanders. After taking a 3–0 series led, the Flyers lost three {{straight}} {{to set up a}} deciding seventh game. Before game seven, Shero wrote a quote by Dag Hammarskjöld – [...] "Only he deserves power who every day justifies it." [...] on the blackboard. Though Shero never admitted it, the quote was believed to be directed at centre Rick MacLeish who had underperformed in the series. MacLeish responded and in game seven he registered a hat-trick as the Flyers won the game 4–1. The win set up a Stanley Cup Finals match-up with Buffalo. Shero and the coaching staff again devised <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan.</b> This time it was to stop Buffalo's French Connection line. The first part of the plan was to keep Sabre's centre Gilbert Perreault out of the middle of the rink and to take away his passing options. The Flyers' centres were instructed to play close to Perreault and be physical against him, {{to the point where it}} bordered on a penalty. The second part involved wearing down the French connection. Shero made numerous line changes to keep fresh players out against the Sabre's trio. A perfect example of this part of the strategy was in game one. The French Connection took a 97-second shift and the Flyers made three line changes during that time. Shero's strategy worked, and the Flyers won their second consecutive Stanley Cup.|$|E

2500|$|In the Super Bowl, the Patriots {{faced the}} heavily favored St. Louis Rams, led by league MVP Kurt Warner and known as [...] "The Greatest Show on Turf", who had beaten the Patriots {{in the regular}} season in Foxboro. The Patriots were {{introduced}} second, and rather than coming out player-by-player, which was customary at the time, they were introduced collectively as a team. [...] The team introduction was met with great praise and admiration, and has since been used by each team at the Super Bowl. [...] In contrast to the regular season game, Bill Belichick devised a defensive game plan that used the blitz very sparingly, but called for chipping the Rams receivers and running back Marshall Faulk as they went into their patterns, <b>a</b> <b>game</b> <b>plan</b> very similar to the one he employed against the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV. This disrupted the Rams' precise passing routes and the entire rhythm of the offense and caused the usually cool-under-pressure Warner to look shaky in the pocket, being sacked several times. The Patriots forced three turnovers, all of which led to scores (including an interception returned by Ty Law for a touchdown in the 2nd quarter).|$|E
