5|$|Any nonrational {{power of}} a complex number has an {{infinite}} number of possible values because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm. The principal value is a single value chosen from these by a rule which, amongst its other properties, ensures powers of complex numbers with a positive real part <b>and</b> <b>zero</b> imaginary part give the same value as does the rule defined above for the corresponding real base.|$|E

40|$|We use the {{behavioural}} {{approach and}} commutative algebra {{to define and}} characterize poles <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> of multidimensional (nD) linear systems. In {{the case of a}} system with a standard input output structure we provide new definitions and characterizations of system, controllable <b>and</b> uncontrollable <b>zeros</b> <b>and</b> demonstrate strong relationships between the controllable poles <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> <b>and</b> properties of the system transfer matrix, and we show that the uncontrollable zeros are in fact uncontrollable poles. We also show that we can regard the zero as a form of pole with respect to an additional form of input output structure imposed on the zero output sub-behaviour. In the case when the behaviour has a latent variable description we make a further distinction of the zeros into several other classes including observable, unobservable <b>and</b> invariant <b>zeros.</b> In addition we also introduce their corresponding controllable <b>and</b> uncontrollable <b>zeros,</b> such as the observable controllable, unobservable controllable, invariant controllable, observable uncontrollable, unobservable uncontrollable and invariant uncontrollable etc. We again demonstrate strong relationships between these and other types of <b>zeros</b> <b>and</b> provide physical interpretations in terms of exponential and polynomial exponential trajectories. In the 1 D case of a state-space model we show that the definitions and characterizations of the observable controllable <b>and</b> invariant <b>zeros</b> correspond to the transmission <b>zeros</b> <b>and</b> the invariant <b>zeros</b> in the classical 1 D framework. This then completes the correspondences between the behavioural definitions of poles <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> <b>and</b> those classical poles <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> which have an interpretation in nD...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} identifying transfer functions from Bode plots is made. From this approach, a parameter estimation algorithm is developed. The major and novel contributions of this algorithm are: Using transfer function poles <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> as parameters allowing to immediately obtain the factorized form; Automatic poles <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> detection; Poles <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> estimation only requiring the magnitude curve. Transport delays, if any, can be easily estimated by means of a simple least squares that uses the additional information supplied by the phase curve. The poles <b>and</b> <b>zeros</b> estimator minimizes a quadratic criterion of the amplitude diagram error. The minimization is performed by a modified Newton Raphson method that explores the hessian structure to drive the estimates through a descendant direction. The algorithm is designed to estimate transfer functions with real or complex poles <b>and</b> <b>zeros.</b> It was developed through a long process from which resulted two other parameter estimation algorithms: one to all real pole plants and the other to models with real poles <b>and</b> <b>zeros.</b> Both are described in this dissertation [...] .

5|$|After {{expanding}} on Neuromancer {{with two}} more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson collaborated with Bruce Sterling on the alternate history novel The Difference Engine (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre steampunk. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, postindustrial society, and late capitalism. Following {{the turn of the}} century and the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly realist novels—Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007), <b>and</b> <b>Zero</b> History (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, The Peripheral (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had largely}} {{abandoned}} short fiction by the mid-1990s, Gibson returned to writing novels, completing his second trilogy, the Bridge trilogy {{at the close}} of the millennium. After writing two episodes of the television series The X-Files around this time, Gibson was featured as the subject of a documentary film, No Maps for These Territories, in 2000. Gibson has been invited to address the National Academy of Sciences (1993) and the Directors Guild of America (2003) and has had a plethora of articles published in outlets such as Wired, Rolling Stone and The New York Times. His third trilogy of novels, Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007) <b>and</b> <b>Zero</b> History (2010) have put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time.|$|E

5|$|RIRP {{rests on}} several assumptions, {{including}} efficient markets, no country risk premia, <b>and</b> <b>zero</b> {{change in the}} expected real exchange rate. The parity condition suggests that real interest rates will equalize between countries and that capital mobility will result in capital flows that eliminate opportunities for arbitrage. There exists strong evidence that RIRP holds tightly among emerging markets in Asia and also Japan. The half-life period of deviations from RIRP have been examined by researchers and found to be roughly six or seven months, but between two and three months for certain countries. Such variation in the half-lives of deviations may be reflective of differences {{in the degree of}} financial integration among the country groups analyzed. RIRP does not hold over short time horizons, but empirical evidence has demonstrated that it generally holds well across long time horizons of five to ten years.|$|E
