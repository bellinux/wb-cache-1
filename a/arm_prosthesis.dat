40|$|During {{the past}} few years there was a rapid {{development}} in robotic prosthetic limb technology to be used for the upper limb amputees. Anthropomorphic transhumeral <b>arm</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is proposed in this thesis to assist the activities of daily living of amputees. The prosthesis generates elbow flexion/extension, forearm supination/pronation, wrist ulna/radial deviation, wrist flexion/extension and another 11 DoF at the terminal device. In order to generate the wrist flexion/extension and ulna/radial deviation, a novel wrist mechanism is proposed based on the parallel prismatic manipulators. Two wrist motions occur in two different axes. The wrist design also follows the human anatomical structure. It is expected to realize high speed operation, higher positional accuracy and anthropomorphic features using the proposed mechanism. The <b>arm</b> <b>prosthesis</b> consists of an under-actuated hand as the terminal device with intrinsic actuation. A novel under-actuated mechanism is introduced as the finger designs, except for the thumb. The mechanism is capable of generating 3 DoF for the finger design. It further poses the capability of adjusting the finger joint angles passively, according to the geometry of the grasping object. With the intention of verifying the effectiveness of the mechanisms in motion generation, motion simulation and kinematic analysis are carried out. The results proved that the mechanisms are capable of generating the required DoFs to generate the lost motions of the human upper limb. Several experiments are carried out using the prototype of the <b>arm</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Experimental results also proved the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms for expected motion generation.

40|$|Rejection {{rates of}} body-powered hands {{are higher than}} that of hooks. Body powered hands are inefficient. As a result they require an uncomfortable high {{activation}} force, and produce a relatively low pinch force in return (< 15 N). Also they have stiff fingers, which do not adapt to the shape of the grasped object. Despite all the drawbacks of the current hands, the design of body powered hand prostheses almost has not changed since the 1950 ’s. The activation force has not been reduced. The pinch force is still low, and hand prostheses are still quite heavy. There have been attempts to increase the efficiency of body powered hand prostheses, by using hydraulics.

40|$|High {{rejection}} rates indicate that prosthetic users are {{not satisfied with}} the performance of their <b>arm</b> <b>prostheses.</b> In theory, {{one of the advantages of}} shoulder controlled prosthesis, compared to myo-electric prostheses, is that the user gets direct proprioceptive feedback about opening width and pinch force of his prosthetic hand. However, commercially available voluntary closing prostheses require too high operating forces, which leads to discomfort and disturbs the direct proprioceptive feedback. The purpose of this study is to find an optimal operation force, at which the prosthetic user gets the best force feedback during comfortable prosthesis operation. During experimental research, subjects where asked to reproduce a certain reference force, with and without a visual representation of the force produced. The subject’s performances of blind generated forces regarding the reproducibility, stability and repeatability were evaluated to find an optimal cable force. The performances of male and female subjects, as well as the performances of subjects with and without arm defect were compared. As a result the optimal operation force level was found between 20 and 30 N for male and female subjects without arm defect. No differences in stability and repeatability performance were found between subjects with and without an arm defect. However, subjects with arm defect were found to have difficulties to reproduce high force levels. In line with this, the reproducibility optimum was found between 10 and 20 N for subjects with arm defect. It is concluded that of today’s commercially available <b>arm</b> <b>prostheses</b> only one is capable of creating pinch forces at the optimal cable activation force level of 20 - 30 N. The created pinch forces with this prosthesis are not sufficient to handle objects in daily life. Future prosthesis design should not exceed cable forces of 30 N when realizing the desired pinch forces for daily activities. Therefore transmission ratios or servo mechanisms might be needed to optimize prosthesis design. BMD/BCDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Physical {{impairment}} {{can limit}} the physical function or fine/gross motor ability of limbs of an individual. Such individual then {{can be called}} as a handicap. In cases of individuals with loss of limbs and next to nothing residual capacity, {{it is very difficult}} for them to associate with daily activities as well as employment, education, independent living, etc. This paper will depict the information relating the substitution of the upper limb of an amputee by Myoelectric Prosthetic <b>Arm.</b> <b>Prosthesis</b> is a part of Rehabilitation Engineering which means, the reintegration of an individual with impairments into society. The primary purpose of an <b>arm</b> <b>prosthesis</b> is to mimic the appearance and replace the function of a missing limb. It requires effective usage of assistive systems to restore the motor functions of an amputee and also it should be cosmetically appealing. These requirements and advances in science and technology have led to development of externally powered prosthesis that interface directly with the neuromuscular system and recreate some of a normal hand’s sophisticated proprioceptive control. This concept of extended physiologic proprioception (EPP) is introduced for the control of gross arm movement whereby the central nervous system is retrained through residual proprioception to coordinate gross actions applying to the geometry of the new extended limb. This device known as Myoelectric Arm is based on biological electronic sensors, is battery operated, controlled by microprocessor and driven by motors. Once it is attached, the prosthetic uses electronic sensors to detect minute muscle, nerve, and EMG activity. It then translates this muscle activity as triggered by the user into information via microcontroller and filtering circuit, which its electric motor...|$|E

This adaptive system monitors the change is angular velocity thus controlling the second and third derivatives of position. The implication of actively controlled angular velocity lends itself to minimize jerk, combined with reduced power consumption, and an increase in parts life and reliability. This control is applicable to all externally powered prosthetic limbs, regardless of user interface. Introduction to Jer...|$|E
40|$|IEEE Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a 21 degree-of-freedom, nine degree-of-actuation, gas-actuated <b>arm</b> <b>prosthesis</b> for transhumeral amputees. The arm incorporates a direct-drive elbow and three degree-of-freedom wrist, in addition to a 17 degree-of-freedom underactuated hand effected by five actuators. The anthropomorphic device includes full position and force sensing capability for each actuated degree of freedom and integrates a monopropellant-powered gas generator to provide on-board power for untethered operation. Design considerations addressed in this paper include the sizing of pneumatic actuators based on the requisite output energy at each joint; the development of small low-power servovalves for use with hot/cold gases; the design of compact joints with integrated position sensing; and the packaging of the actuators, on-board power, and skeletal structure within the volumetric envelope of a normal human forearm and elbow. The resulting arm prototype approaches the dexterous manipulation capabilities of its anatomical counterpart while delivering approximately 50 % of the force and power output of an average human arm.

40|$|Abstract—To achieve {{significant}} improvement in the function of electric-powered, upper-limb prostheses, {{we believe it is}} necessary to develop better control interfaces with inherent sensory feedback. Small cineplasties, or other surgical proce-dures that also externalize the force and excursion of a muscle, could potentially provide this superior control. Connecting a muscle to a prosthetic component via a controller that embod-ies the concept of extended physiological proprioception (EPP) would enable the physiological sensory feedback inherent in the skin, muscle, and other tissues of the cineplasty to inform the user {{of the state of the}} prosthesis. Multiple miniature fore-arm tunnel cineplasties, each with an EPP controller, might enable meaningful independent multifinger control of hand prostheses. At higher levels of amputation (e. g., transhumeral), small pectoral or deltoid cineplasties could augment existing control sources to improve control of multifunctional total <b>arm</b> <b>prostheses.</b> To explore the feasibility of these ideas, we quanti-fied the control capabilities of individuals with preexistin...|$|R
40|$|Management of the {{high-level}} bilateral arm amputee poses {{many challenges}} to the prosthetist and rehabilitation team.

Heckathorne and Uellendahl have recommended a framework for component and control strategy selection when designing prostheses for high level bilateral arm amputees. 1 - 3 This strategy calls for use of dissimilar components on each side to enhance prosthesis usefulness and control schemes that provide dedicated control of as many components as possible allowing simultaneous control when functionally desired. Uellendahl has used this approach for over 15 years for clinical fittings. The long-term success of this fitting philosophy demonstrates the clinical efficacy of this approach.

Moreover, being percutaneous, it does not require power and data telemetry modules. Four of these electrodes were chronically implanted in the forearm of an able-bodied human volunteer for testing their characteristics. The implants showed significantly lower impedance and greater robustness against mechanical interference than traditional surface EMG electrodes used for myoelectric control. Moreover, the EMG signals detected by the proposed systems allowed more stable control performance across sessions in different days than that achieved with classic EMG electrodes.
