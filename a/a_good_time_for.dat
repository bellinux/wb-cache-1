Although Lateiner, Horowitz, and Shumer kept writing, and {{occasionally}} managed {{to put on a}} play, it was not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Yiddish theater – or any theater – in Romania, and would only become worse as the economy continued to decline.|$|E

(Minto was married to Grey's sister, Mary Caroline Grey.) The appointment came at <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Grey, {{as a series of}} failed investments in South Africa had left him penniless; a gift from his wife's aunt, Lady Wantage (widow of the Lord Wantage), was used to supplement his salary as governor general.|$|E
25|$|With {{the front}} being stable so far, it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Finland {{to seek a}} way out of the war. At the {{beginning}} of August President Ryti resigned to allow Finland to sue for peace again, which the new government did in late August. The Soviet peace terms were harsh, but the $600,000,000 reparations demanded in the spring were reduced to $300,000,000, most likely due to pressure from the United States and Britain. However, after the ceasefire the Soviets insisted that the payments should be based on 1938 prices, which doubled the amount. This sum constituted half of Finland's annual gross domestic product in 1939.|$|E

William Holmes, the Chief Whip, then called Huskisson to one side.

The opening of the trade came at <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> New England's merchants. It provided a way to escape the depression that had followed the American Revolutionary War.

500|$|Born in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, Byrom {{started his}} career at the Blackburn Rovers centre of {{excellence}} after being spotted playing for local junior side Oswaldtwistle United {{at the age of}} 14. He progressed through the youth system at Ewood Park, and captained the under–17 side, before graduating into the reserve team after impressing in the FA Youth Cup in 2004. However, he failed to break into the first-team and was subsequently released in 2006. He signed for League Two outfit Accrington Stanley on a six-month contract ahead of the 2006–07 season, after impressing manager John Coleman whilst on trial, a trial which Byrom had requested. He made his debut for the Lancashire side in a 1–1 draw against Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy in October 2006. However, Byrom found it difficult to break into the first-team, making one further appearance for Stanley, featuring as a substitute in a 3–3 draw with Shrewsbury Town. He was subsequently released in January 2007, after being deemed surplus to requirements at the Crown Ground. Byrom later stated at this stage in his career he [...] "considered just getting a job and playing for fun", and that his time at Accrington [...] "wasn't really <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> me.

After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but I think you should do it in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1970, Rove used a false {{identity}} to enter the campaign office of Democrat Alan J. Dixon, who was running for Treasurer of Illinois.

(Dixon eventually won the election.) Rove's role would not become publicly known until August 1973 when Rove told the Dallas Morning News. In 1999 he said, [...] "It was a youthful prank {{at the age of}} 19 and I regret it."

Anorthosis continued the momentum, the Renaissance merely a passive role, with the Laborde 20', Rezek 22' have two other good moments. The Rezek 37' near-scoring after a superb Laborde unstoppable energy, the Colombian taking the baton in lost opportunities in the latter stages of the first part 38',42'. The same setting and repeat Anorthosis to have absolute control over the match and lost two consecutive opportunities with Okkas 46',47' and the Andic 51', Laban 54' and Rezek 63'. In the last 20 minutes and especially after the exit of Laborde (forced change) Anorthosis lost the aggressiveness and speed ... threw in performance. The looseness came close to cost, by Milan Belić (82') having <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> guests, like Shaka Bangura in the last minute of normal time the match. Eventually the 1-0 remained until the end of Anorthosis with anxiety to celebrate the victory in a game that could clean it up sooner. MVP: Ricardo Laborde. The Colombian returned several appetite after absence for punishment, with its good performance to seal it with a certain artistic goals and actions. The defense of the Renaissance especially in the first part with anything they could to limit the action of Laborde.|$|E

2500|$|... “The [...] was mysterious for the Indians." [...] It {{was good}} when the Indians {{did not know}} the ways of the white man. It made the Indians like one family. Bad Indians could not become Hunka. It was not the white man’s way of teaching. Sometimes many Indians camped {{together}} to perform the ceremony. Then there were good times. This was usually in the summer time. The winter was not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the ceremony, because food was not plenty during the winter. When many Indians gathered together for the ceremony, the old men counseled and the young men played games. The women provided plenty to eat. The children were happy and were never hungry. The young people made lover. Many sought a vision, and talked with the spirits. The good spirits attended such gatherings. The bad spirits also come. The Lakotas here practiced this ceremony for many years. It was not always the same. The shamans first learned how to perform it right. These shamans became Oglalas. The other Lakota learned how to perform it from the Oglalas. Other Indians are Hunkas, but they are not full Hunkas like the Oglalas. The young people do not become Hunka now. It is of no use to them. The old people do not pay attention to the Hunka now. The Hunka are not what they were in old times. Some old Indians could perform the ceremony right. An old Indian who wears the gee string and leggings could perform it. He might be afraid to talk like the Indians did before they lived on a reservation. It would not be right to teach the young Indians what was taught to the Hunka in old times. There are some secret things taught to a Hunka. These secrets are not good now. They are not about the spirits. The spirits will not come now. These are the spirits of the skies of the Earth, of the clouds, of the Thunder, of the land of pines, of the coming light of the sunset of the south, of the winds, of the waters, of flying things, of the beasts, of the insects, and of the spider. There are bad spirits also. There are ghosts and the man from the land of the pines. One spirit is stronger than another. One spirit is chief, and can influence all other spirits. These spirits come no more to the Indians of the reservation. It involved things that would not be allowed now. The Oglala did not think these things were wrong, but the white people do. For example a Hunka was taught how to steal horses and steal women from other Indians than Lakota.” “White men have their Bible and their Christ to guide them to the life to come. We Indians have our White Cow traditions and brave deeds. Let us wait, my friend, and see who gets there first.” ...|$|E
