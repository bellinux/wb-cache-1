40|$|Abstract — Solenoid valves {{are used}} in air braking system in heavy vehicles. This is {{essentially}} used to prevent skidding in vehicles. Traditionally the coil uses copper wounded coils for producing the working flux for plunger attraction. Recent Cu price increases motivate careful examination of approaches to minimize Cu use. Approaches that can reduce Cu use without increasing losses include careful winding design, trading winding volume for core volume; replacing Cu with Al. Al wire is particularly attractive. The cost of Al is lower than it might appear from the cost per unit mass when the much lower density of Al is also considered, and the disadvantage of higher resistivity becomes less important. This paper shows the design details of a solenoid valve with aluminum wiring along with {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of copper and aluminum. It also includes the testing and performance results of aluminum <b>air</b> <b>solenoid.</b> Index Terms — solenoid valve, air braking system, Standard wire gauge, actuation, Retraction, on leak test, off leak test...|$|E

30|$|Height and {{leveling}} adjustment {{during the}} lifting procedure: In the lifting process, the charging solenoid valve or the compressor is opened, thus the compressed air can {{flow into the}} four air springs. If the vehicle body does not maintain at an appropriate posture, the control signals for the four <b>air</b> spring <b>solenoid</b> valves would be reassigned to reduce the air mass flow rates flowing into the air springs whose height lifting speed are relatively fast.|$|R

40|$|In some turbochargers, boost {{pressure}} {{is reduced by}} opening the wastegate valve. In a modern turbo charged car, the most common way for opening the wastegate is with a pneumatic actuator and an <b>air</b> control <b>solenoid,</b> controlled by the ECU. In the control systems studied the ECU utilizes a static feedforward and a PID controller, {{for the purpose of}} making the {{boost pressure}} follow its reference value. With no systematic method for tuning the controller, this can be time consuming, and a set of well defined experiments to determine PID parameters are desired. When test time in a real engine is limited or expensive, it is advantageousto work in a simulation environment before doing live tests. A model for thewastegate actuator and <b>air</b> control <b>solenoid</b> is developed in the thesis. This is used to simulate controller performance before any tests in a real car is performed. In the thesis a tuning method for the PID controller based on step responsesis proposed. The tuning method evaluated is the IMC-choice of controller fora second order system, and it has a single design parameter not given by theexperiments.

40|$|We present VacuumTouch, a novel haptic {{interface}} architecture for touch screens that provides attractive force {{feedback to the}} user’s finger. VacuumTouch consists of an <b>air</b> pump and <b>solenoid</b> <b>air</b> valves that connect {{to the surface of}} the touch screen and suck the air above the surface where the user’s finger makes contact. VacuumTouch does not require the user to hold or attach additional devices to provide the attractive force, which allows for easy interaction with the surface. This paper introduces the implementation of the VacuumTouch architecture and some applications for enhancement of the graphical user interface, namely a suction button, a suction slider, and a suction dial. The quantitative evaluation was conducted with the suction dial and showed that the attractive force provided by VacuumTouch improved the performance of the dial menu interface and its potential effects. At the end of this paper, we discuss the current prototype’s advantages and limitations, as well as possible improvements and potential capabilities.

The field strength during an exposure was then given by the product of this constant and the current flowing. Evaporation of Zn and Cd in the short (6 cm) positive column of a helium discharge tube gave the desired lines. The Zeeman patterns were photographed with a Fabry-Perot interferometer.

5000|$|The [...] "poppet valve" [...] (or simply [...] "poppet") design {{functions}} {{similarly to}} a mechanical blowback or Autococker-style marker; when the trigger is pulled, low-pressure <b>air</b> from the <b>solenoid</b> brings the bolt forward to chamber the paintball and also sends a connected, weighted ram into a pin valve, which opens to allow high-pressure {{air into the}} chamber, launching the ball. Then, either additional <b>air</b> from the <b>solenoid</b> in a [...] "two-way" [...] design, or a spring in a [...] "FASOR" [...] (Forward Air, Spring-Operated Return) design, returns the bolt and ram to the open position. Another paintball drops into the open chamber and the action is ready to fire again. Poppets are typically valued for high gas efficiency, as the low-pressure system to move the ram and the limited time the high-pressure valve is open saves gas compared to most competing designs. However, {{the nature of the}} mechanism produces very loud [...] "pops" [...] when the marker is fired, and the movement of the ram and bolt and the sudden high-pressure release of air can increase recoil, affecting accuracy during rapid fire. They are also more mechanically complex; most designs require two regulators, one to adjust the [...] "high-pressure" [...] air launching the ball, and a second one to further lower the pressure to operate the ram.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is {{performed}} {{with a very}} large instrument that allows the patient to be inserted into a region of uniform magnetic field. The field is generated either by an electromagnet (resistive or superconductive) or by a permanent magnet.

These “dedicated ” apparati could be smaller and based on resistive magnets that are manufactured and operated at very low cost particularly if they utilise an iron yoke to reduce power requirements. In order to obtain a good field uniformity without the use of a set of shimming coils, we propose both a particular construction of a dedicated magnet, using four independently controlled pairs of coils, and an optimization-based strategy for computing,...|$|R
50|$|Internally, the Ion {{features}} a spool-valve design, {{similar to a}} Shocker SFT or a Dye Matrix. However, {{the operation of the}} Ion is somewhat simpler than a Shocker SFT or Matrix in that it does not use a 4-way solenoid valve. The Ion's solenoid valve only has three hoses: one to provide <b>air</b> to the <b>solenoid,</b> one to provide air to a reservoir chamber behind the bolt, and the other which provides air {{to the front of the}} bolt to hold it back while the marker is at rest. The <b>solenoid</b> thus directs <b>air</b> either to the front of the bolt when not firing, or to the air reservoir behind the bolt, to blow it forward.|$|R
40|$|Two efficient, senti-automatic elutriators for {{assaying}} {{soil samples}} for nematodes are described. The first apparatus is a four-unit elutriator which combines conventional extraction methods {{with the following}} major features: atttomatic mixing of 500 - to 1, 500 -cm³ soil samples with water (± air); "turbinate" sample splitters from which fractions of 1 / 15 or greater are passed onto 26 - or 38 -μm sieves for collection of larvae and adult nematodes; the capacity for collecting roots, intact egg ntasses, and cysts on 250 - 425 -μm sieves; and a variable speed motorized sieve-shaker. Nematodes, after being collected on 38 -μm sieves, are separated from debris by centrifugation or by Baermann trays. Secondary features include: <b>air</b> cylinders, <b>solenoid</b> valves, and time clock for atttomatic dumpittg residual soil and water; relay-controlled coarse spray nozzles activated for 5 sec every 30 sec for washing nematodes through 250 - 425 -μm sieves; adjustable rates of water amt air flow, and tinting. The second type of elutriator operates on similar principles but costs less to construct. It requires somewhat more operator participation; sieve spraying is {{carried out by the}} operator, anti elutriators are dumped manually.

40|$|The {{construction}} {{of a set of}} controlled-humidity chambers for single plants is described. Accurate control of relative humidity (r. h.) between 40 % and 99 % was achieved by mixing dry air with a saturated <b>air</b> stream using <b>solenoid</b> valves controlled by a programmable data logger. At values of r. h. > 90 %, mean values over periods greater than 1 min were constant to within ± 0 - 1 % and spot measurements at 3 s intervals were within 0 - 3 % of the mean value. The system responded to a step change of r. h. in about 6 - 10 min and diurnal changes of r. h. were reproduced, similar to those observed in nature. The stability of control made it possible to differentiate between the requirement of liquid water and very high humidity (98 % r. h.) for conidial germination and subsequent infection of groundnut by Phaeoisariopsis personata, the cause of late leaf spot disease...|$|R
40|$|The torque {{response}} of an engine {{is important for}} driver acceptance. For turbocharged spark ignited (TCSI) engines this is tightly connected to the boost pressure control, which is usually achieved with a wastegate. A challenging scenario is when the throttle is fully open and the load is essentially controlled by the wastegate. First {{a model for the}} pneumatic wastegate actuator and <b>air</b> control <b>solenoid</b> is developed. The wastegate model consists of three submodels; the actuator pressure, the static position, and an additional position dynamics. A complete engine model is constructed by including the actuator model in a Mean Value Engine Model (MVEM) for a TCSI engine. This model describes the transient boost pressure response to steps in wastegate control inputs. The subsystems and complete MVEM are validated on an engine test bench and it explains the overshoot seen in the step responses. The model is used to study the system response and give insight into the dominating phenomena and it points out that the engine speed is important for the response. Further, for each speed it is sufficient to model the system as a second order linear system, that captures an overshoot. A controller consisting of a mapped feedforward loop and a gain scheduled feedback loop is developed together with a tuning method based on the IMC framework for the feedback loop. The controller and tuning method is shown to achieve the desired boost pressure behavior both on the complete MVEM and on real engines. The experimental validation is carried out both in an engine test cell and in a vehicle. Keywords: Engine modeling, engine control, turbocharging, internal model control, PID. 1...|$|R
40|$|The current {{problem with}} energy backup and grid {{stabilization}} systems {{is that both}} either require fuel and constant maintenance, such as diesel generators, or cannot perform at their peak operation and need constant replacement, like batteries. Our solution and {{the goal of the}} StorWatts senior design project was to design and create a small-scale compressed air energy storage system to be used in place of traditional energy backup and grid stabilization systems. The StorWatts system does not need fuel in order to store and generate power and therefore does not require constant refueling and maintenance. It also can work in most any climate, not needing environmental control like its battery counterparts. This allows for a standalone system that can perform reliably for years at a time. This StorWatts CAES system will convert electrical energy into mechanical energy by compressing air into a set of air storage tanks. When power is needed, the air will be released from the storage tanks through an expander. The expander, connected to a DC generator, will convert the stored energy into usable electric power. The StorWatts team, with a generous donation from the Biederer family, repurposed an old Briggs and Stratton four stroke gas engine into an air expander. The existing cylinder head was removed and redesigned to allow room for a thermocouple, a pressure transducer, a 500 psi safety release valve and two fast acting solenoids, one for inlet air and one for outlet exhaust <b>air.</b> The <b>solenoids</b> were controlled by an arduino with set open and close times. However, due to safety concerns and time restrictions, we unable to test the system above 70 psi. This created problems as the arduino was set for an inlet pressure of 500 psi.

50|$|A {{rack and}} pinion with two racks and one pinion is used in actuators. An example is {{pneumatic}} {{rack and pinion}} actuators {{that can be used}} to control valves in pipeline transport. The actuators in the picture on the right are used to control the valves of large water pipeline. In the top actuator, a gray control signal line can be seen connecting to a solenoid valve (the small black box attached to the back of the top actuator), which is used as the pilot for the actuator. The solenoid valve controls the air pressure coming from the input air line (the small green tube). The output <b>air</b> from the <b>solenoid</b> valve is fed to the chamber in the middle of the actuator, increasing the pressure. The pressure in the actuator's chamber pushes the pistons away. While the pistons are moving apart from each other, the attached racks are also moved along the pistons in the opposite directions of the two racks. The two racks are meshed to a pinion at the direct opposite teeth of the pinion. When the two racks move, the pinion is turned, causing the attached main valve of the water pipe to turn.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "spool valve" [...] ("spoolie") {{typically}} {{uses the}} bolt itself to hold {{air in a}} filling chamber. This high-pressure air is either self-balancing {{so there is no}} net force to open the bolt (a [...] "balanced" [...] spool valve), or is kept in check by additional <b>air</b> from the <b>solenoid</b> pushing backward on the bolt (an [...] "unbalanced" [...] or [...] "dump-valve" [...] spool). When the trigger is pulled, the solenoid of a balanced system pushes the bolt forward, or in a dump-valve vents the air from the forward pressure chamber. As the bolt moves forward, it seals off the inlet allowing high-pressure gas into the filling chamber, and then releases the stored charge of air through the bolt into the main chamber to launch the ball. The solenoid then resets the bolt by allowing air to re-enter the forward chamber and pushing the bolt backwards to re-seal the filling chamber and open the inlet. Spool valves are typically valued for their quieter and smoother operation, and their reduced mechanical complexity (often the only major moving part is the bolt), but are often less gas-efficient than poppet valves due to the large charge of air behind the bolt and the single operating pressure used both to move the bolt and launch the ball.|$|R
40|$|Unloading-induced myofiber atrophy is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs in the aging population, bed-ridden patients and astronauts. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether or not dynamic foot stimulation (DFS) applied to the plantar surface of the rat foot can serve as a countermeasure to the soleus muscle atrophy normally observed in hindlimb unloaded (HU) rats. Thirty mature adult (6 -month-old) male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into ambulatory control (AMB), hindlimb unloaded alone (HU), or hindlimb unloaded with the application of DFS (HU+DFS) groups. A dynamic pattern of pressure was applied to the right foot of each HU animal using a specially fabricated boot containing an inflatable air bladder connected to a <b>solenoid</b> <b>air</b> pump controlled by a laptop computer. The anti-atrophic effects of DFS were quantified morphometrically in frozen cross-sections of soleus muscle stained using the metachromatic-ATPase fiber typing technique. Application of DFS during HU significantly counteracted the atrophic response observed in the soleus by preventing approximately 85 % of the reduction in Type I myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) observed during HU. However, DFS did not protect type II fibers of the soleus from HU-induced atrophy or any fiber type in the soleus muscle of the contralateral control leg of the DFS-treated HU animals. These results illustrate that the application of DFS to the rat foot is an effective countermeasure to soleus muscle atrophy induced by HU...|$|R
