40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the factors which discriminate between local and global <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> in Nigeria. The rationale was to examine how the globalization process differs in Nigeria and contribute to the discourse on globalization. Design/methodology/approach – The research is quantitative, using discriminant analysis to differentiate the global <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> from the local ones. The study used a random sample of 92 <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> in Nigeria, examining various characteristics of the firms through a questionnaire. Findings – There was a strong distinction between global and local firms. Compared to the local <b>architectural</b> <b>firms,</b> the global firms were larger, and mostly run by sole principals who were more experienced. The internet was used more to communicate with other professionals, but less to communicate with clients and in designing and drafting. The global firms also placed higher value on developing expertise in specific building types. Research limitations/implications – Data are obtained from <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> in Nigeria only. The results suggest that global <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> are peculiar and exhibit certain characteristics which further differentiate them from local ones. Practical implications – The implications for <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> seeking to operate globally include building size advantage, building expertise in specific specializations, having principals with high level experience and employing alliances with other professionals in operating internationally. Originality/value – This paper adds to the body of knowledge on <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> which are under-researched. The importance of this paper lies in its empirical nature in investigating the characteristics of global <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> using a sample of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|This study set out {{to examine}} the {{characteristics}} of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> in Nigeria. This involved {{the examination of the}} staff, principals, clientele and cultural profiles of the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms.</b> It also involved the examination of the IT characteristics, the strategic issues and the organizational structures of the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms.</b> The study found that the profiles of the firms in Nigeria were different from the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> in other countries in some respect and similar in others. <b>Architectural</b> <b>firms</b> can also no longer be assumed to be homogeneous; there are indeed different types of <b>firms.</b> <b>Architectural</b> <b>firms</b> were not very similar but could be grouped into certain typologies.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the {{organizational}} structure of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> where the mode of coordination had been unclear. The types of organizational structure in <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> were identified using data obtained from 92 <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> in Nigeria. The findings show that sizes of the firms influenced the organizational structures adopted by the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms.</b> Although, sizes of the firms also had direct influence on the performance, no interaction of this variable or any internal firm characteristic with organizational structure led to any significant change in performance. Although the environment did not directly influence organizational structure, it appeared that particular organizational structures worked best when some external influences are high and resulted in higher profit. The results show that while adhoc structure leads to better performance in firms where the influence of other professionals is considered high, the administered structure is more effective highly influenced by government privatization programmes. Only the adhoc structure was however not suitable for firms strongly influenced by increasing concerns for sustainable environment. The results of the study suggest that while larger <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> may record higher profit, <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> that adapt their organizational structures to environmental conditions to reap improved profi...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith <b>architectural</b> <b>firms,</b> {{owners are}} often {{managers}} whose characteristics {{may influence the}} firm structure. This study investigated the relationships between ownership characteristics, organizational structure, and performance of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms.</b> Utilizing a sample of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> from Nigeria, a questionnaire survey of 92 <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> was carried out. Data were analyzed using multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) and regression analyses. A generally low level of specialization of duties was observed even though professional service firms were defined as highly specialized firms. For most of the firms, level of formalization was moderate or high, while level of centralization was mostly low. Results revealed a direct significant relationship between legal ownership form and formalization dimension of structure. In addition, the centralization dimension of structure influenced firm performance. However, no direct relationship between ownership characteristics and performance was noted, although different fits of ownership characteristics and structural variables were observed. The results suggest that principals of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> should match their characteristics with the firm structure to enhance performance in relation to profit...|$|R
40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> in Nigeria. The study thus {{explored}} the characteristics of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> in Nigeria empirically using the systems approach to the study of organizations. The study investigated the organizational profiles, cultures, strategies and structures of the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms.</b> The tasks and information technology characteristics of the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> as well as the external influences on the firms were also investigated, culminating in the investigation of the types of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> that existed in Nigeria. This study thus took an approach which was exploratory and descriptive. Therefore, the research was mainly inductive. The architectural practice was studied as a professional organization and the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> were studied holistically, taking the systems approach. The sample size was derived from the list of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> registered by Architects Registration Council of Nigeria (ARCON, 2006). The purposive and random sampling methods were employed. The survey and qualitative methods were used, with the firm as the unit of analysis. The survey instrument was the structured questionnaire, while the qualitative instrument was the interview schedule. The ninety-two (92) questionnaires collected were analyzed using frequencies, cross tabulations, the chi-square test, principal component analysis, the coefficient of correlation (Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient), Multiple Analysis of Variance, (MANOVA), discriminant analysis, regression analysis and cluster analysis. The data from the interview were analyzed using content analysis. The five types of firms identified by the study included male-dominated firms, amorphous firms, conventional firms, stable/ traditional firms and versatile firms. The most important causes of differences between the types of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> in Nigeria were level of specialization of activities, and varieties of services offered, which accounted for more than half of the differences between the firms. Most of the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> sampled in Nigeria were found to be more than ten (10) years old, small sized, and owned by a sole principal. They had the culture of innovation, but not the culture of aggression in the pursuit of business opportunities or concern for profit. The study found that most of the clients of the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> were private individuals in Nigeria and most of their projects were residential projects. Most of the clients of the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> were sourced through personal contact and the projects most of the firms carried out were those that they were able to obtain commissions for. Most of the firms were engaged in projects which used the design and build method and these firms were found to have more residential projects. Also participation in design and build method appeared to be a survival strategy as the firms that had existed for more than 15 years did not participate in projects which used this method. The firms mostly used competence in design, followed by AUTOCAD and information technology literacy as criteria for the selection of staff. Findings of the study indicated that information technology facilities were highly available in most of the firms, and the internet was mostly used for sourcing information. The results also suggest that the internet was used as a tool for centralization. The study further found that the external influences on most of the <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> were not so strong and the greatest influences were those exerted by clients, advances in information technology and the national economy. The characteristics of the firms most affected by these external influences were the staff management culture of the firms, the strategic goals of the firms and the qualification and experience of the principal. The study concluded that <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> need to take advantage of the opportunities provided by information technology to operate on a global level. There is a need for architectural schools in Nigeria to fully integrate internship into the study of architecture as well as train students extensively in construction methods to meet the demands of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms.</b> The study further concluded that there is a need for the business training of architects as this was a factor responsible for the success of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms.</b> The systems approach to the study of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> had been useful and practical. More studies are required, using the systems approach, on peculiarities of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> and their management strategies. ...|$|R
40|$|There is now no {{shortage}} of strategic management advice on offer to <b>architectural</b> <b>firms,</b> from either consultants or books -although one may have to search for it. Much of this advice is based on typologies of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms.</b> This allows the consultant or the reader to assign a firm to one or another type, and read off the strategic recommendation. The simplicity and decisiveness of these typologies gives them a certain authority. In this article we argue that the typology of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> is unfounded, lacking convincing empirical evidence and sufficient complexity to reflect the actual nature of <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> and the markets they operate in. Specifically, while most strategy literature is written as if there are relatively few sellers and many buyers, architects must compete among many sellers for work from comparatively few buyers. Drawing on {{the language of the}} resource based view of strategic management (RBV), we offer an alternative account of strategy options for <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> based on understanding the market in terms of demand, competition and segmentation, and the firm in terms of values, capabilities, differentiation, and branding. We suggest that the typological systems do not allow for sufficient differentiation, and that <b>architectural</b> <b>firms</b> must strive to present themselves as having identifiable differences in capabilities from their many competitors. RBV also allows a architects to specifically address issues such as market segmentation, diversification and specialisation...|$|R
