5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
25|$|Single-sideband {{modulation}} (SSB) is a {{refinement of}} <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> that more efficiently uses electrical power and bandwidth. Single-sideband modulation produces a modulated output signal {{that has a}} bandwidth identical {{to that of the}} original baseband signal, unlike <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> which has double the bandwidth.

40|$|Speech is an {{acoustic}} signal with inherent <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> in the 1 - 9 Hz range. Recent models of speech perception propose that this rhythmic nature of speech {{is central to}} speech recognition. Moreover, rhythmic <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> {{have been shown to}} have beneficial effects on language processing and the subjective impression listeners have of the speaker. This study investigated the role of <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> in the political arena by comparing the speech produced by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the three presidential debates of 2016. Inspection of the modulation spectra, revealing the spectral content of the two speakers’ amplitude envelopes after matching for overall intensity, showed considerably greater power in Clinton’s modulation spectra (compared to Trump’s) across the three debates, particularly in the 1 - 9 Hz range. The findings suggest that Clinton’s speech had a more pronounced temporal envelope with rhythmic <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> below 9 Hz, with a preference for modulations around 3 Hz. This may be taken as evidence for a more structured temporal organization of syllables in Clinton’s speech, potentially due to more frequent use of preplanned utterances. Outcomes are interpreted in light of the potential beneficial effects of a rhythmic temporal envelope on intelligibility and speaker perception...|$|R

In this study, phase noise is modelled using white Gaussian noise filtered by an analog shaping filter which has a transfer function specified by the shape of the phase noise power spectrum density. Using this model, simulation results show that an optimum trade-off between AWGN and phase noise robustness for the loop bandwidth can be determined. Furthermore, novel decision areas related to Quadrature <b>Amplitude</b> <b>Modulations</b> are determined in order to improve the performance of the carrier recovery algorithm in presence of phase noise and frequency offset. ...|$|R
25|$|It has {{recently}} been proposed that even if phases are not aligned across trials, induced activity may still cause event-related potentials because ongoing brain oscillations may not be symmetric and thus <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> {{may result in a}} baseline shift that does not average out. This model implies that slow event-related responses, such as asymmetric alpha activity, could result from asymmetric brain oscillation <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations,</b> such as an asymmetry of the intracellular currents that propagate forward and backward down the dendrites. Under this assumption, asymmetries in the dendritic current would cause asymmetries in oscillatory activity measured by EEG and MEG, since dendritic currents in pyramidal cells are generally thought to generate EEG and MEG signals that can be measured at the scalp.|$|R

To investigate whether these modulations could be considered as manifestations of the same underlying mechanism, we developed a neural mass model.

Within model components, slow and fast activity engage in phase-frequency coupling in conditions of low ambient noise level and with high noise level engage in phase-amplitude coupling. Between model components, these couplings can be coordinated via slow activity, giving rise to more complex modulations.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the dependence of}} information transfer by neurons on the Type I vs. Type II classification of their dynamics. Our computational study is based on Type I and II implementations of the Morris-Lecar model. It mainly concerns neurons, {{such as those in}} the auditory or electrosensory system, which encode band-limited <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> of a periodic carrier signal, and which fire at random cycles yet preferred phases of this carrier. We first show that the Morris-Lecar model with additive broadband noise (“synaptic noise”) can exhibit such firing patterns with either Type I or II dynamics, with or without <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> of the carrier. We then compare the encoding of band-limited random <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> for both dynamical types. The comparison relies on a parameter calibration that closely matches firing rates for both models across a range of parameters. In the absence of synaptic noise, Type I performs slightly better than Type II, and its performance is optimal for perithreshold signals. However, Type II performs well over a slightly larger range of inputs, and this range lies mostly in the subthreshold region. Further, Type II performs marginally better than Type I when synaptic noise, which yields more realistic baseline firing patterns, is present in both models. These results are discussed in terms of the tuning and phase locking properties of the models with deterministic and stochastic inputs...|$|R

30|$|QAM/APSK {{modulation}} {{symbols are}} {{defined in terms}} of phase and amplitude variations and are represented {{in the form of a}} constellation diagram. This diagram is extracted from the analytic form of the IF signal after down conversion to the baseband. Many features exist in literature that exploit different aspects of the constellation diagram for classification of 16, 32, and 64 QAM modulations[38 – 42]. In this article, a new feature based on partitioning magnitude of constellation diagram is proposed. This feature makes use of the observation that the noise-free normalized constellation points of PSK and FSK modulations are on the unit circle, whereas the normalized constellation points of QAM and APSK modulations may lie on, inside, and/or outside the unit circle. Therefore, this feature is useful in separating near constant <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> from <b>amplitude</b> varying <b>modulations,</b> and also in determining the order of <b>amplitude</b> varying <b>modulations.</b>|$|R
25|$|Local {{oscillators}} typically {{generate a}} single frequency signal that has negligible <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> but some random phase modulation. Either of these impurities spreads {{some of the}} signal's energy into sideband frequencies. That causes a corresponding widening of the receiver's frequency response, which would defeat the aim {{to make a very}} narrow bandwidth receiver such as to receive low-rate digital signals. Care needs to be taken to minimize oscillator phase noise, usually by ensuring that the oscillator never enters a non-linear mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} data that can be {{transmitted}} (and therefore the number of channels) is directly affected by channel capacity and the modulation method of the channel. The modulation method in DVB-T is COFDM with either 64 or 16-state Quadrature <b>Amplitude</b> <b>Modulation</b> (QAM). In general, a 64QAM channel is capable of transmitting a greater bit rate, but is more susceptible to interference. 16 and 64QAM constellations can be combined in a single multiplex, providing a controllable degradation for more important program streams. This is called hierarchical modulation.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, {{it may be}} {{desirable}} to maintain some degree of compatibility with simple AM receivers, while still reducing the signal's bandwidth.

This mode is called compatible (or full-carrier) SSB or <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulation</b> equivalent (AME). In typical AME systems, harmonic distortion can reach 25%, and intermodulation distortion can be much higher than normal, but minimizing distortion in receivers with envelope detectors is generally considered less important than allowing them to produce intelligible audio.|$|E

We show that appropriate <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulations</b> dividing nanosecond laser pumps into picosecond-long pulse trains inhibit SBS at any power. In contrast, phase-modulated pulses with comparable spectral width undergo multiple filamentation and earlier beam collapse due to modulational instabilities.
