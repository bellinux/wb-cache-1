5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close <b>apposition</b> of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E

40|$|Lélia Picabia - <b>Appositions</b> nominales et déterminant zéro : le cas des <b>appositions</b> frontales Nominal <b>appositions</b> exhibit anaphoric {{properties}} and {{are linked to}} their antecedent by a BE-type relation. The initial assumption {{of this paper is}} that nominal <b>appositions</b> behave as nonref erring, nominal predicates. The comparison of fronted <b>appositions</b> and specificational sentences reveals that in both constructions, the fronted (nonrefe- rential) phrase receives a list-reading, a type of interpretation typically associated with an event-type, stage-level predicate. It further appears that apposed nominals which include a null determiner are steadily associated with a stage-level reading, whatever their linear position with respect to their antecedent; contrastively, apposed nominals which include the overt indefinite determiner (un) are associated with an individual-level readin. A correlate appears to exist between the type of determiner and the syntactic locus of the apposed nominal : the null determiner occurs in fronted <b>appositions</b> (even though these may be moved to the right), while the indefinite determiner occurs in postposed <b>appositions.</b> These descriptive results lead us to conclude that the null and indefinite determiners must have their own syntactic function, and more precisely, must correspond to some functional heads.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: The {{objective}} was to demonstrate close <b>appositions</b> between serotonin-immunoreactive boutons and laryngeal constrictor (LCon) motoneurons in Sprague-Dawley rats. Study Design: Animal experimental. Methods: LCon motoneurons were identified functionally by their antidromic responses to stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and postinspiratory modulation and were filled by intracellular injection of biotin amide (n = 6). The medulla was sectioned and, using immunohistochemical analysis, examined by light microscopy. Results: Serotonin <b>appositions</b> were found on all 6 LCon motoneurons, with an average number of 17 ± 6 close <b>appositions</b> per neuron. Conclusion: In comparison with the authors' previous study of inspiratory laryngeal motoneurons, the number of serotonin close <b>appositions</b> with LCon motoneurons {{was similar to that}} found with posterior cricoarytenoid motoneurons, but significantly less than that found with cricothyroid motoneurons.

25|$|Appositions are {{separated}} from the referred element with a comma (or a colon), {{if they are in}} the same grammatical position as the referred element. If the <b>apposition</b> gets further back in the sentence, the comma will precede it directly. If the <b>apposition</b> is followed by a pause in speech, a comma may be placed after it, too. If a descriptive phrase is added to a personal name but only the last part takes the suffixes (in which case it is not called an <b>apposition),</b> no comma is used after the personal name. For example: Nagy Elemérnek, városunk díszpolgárának ‘to Elemér Nagy, honorary citizen of our town’ – because of the possessive structure, both element take the suffixes, and the second part can only be an <b>apposition,</b> so a comma is needed. On the other hand: Nagy Elemér díszpolgárnak ‘to Elemér Nagy honorary citizen’ – the whole structure takes one suffix at the very end, thus it cannot be appositive, and no comma is used. If the <b>apposition</b> or the referred element is a derivative of the word maga (“himself” etc.), the comma is not used. However, adverbs used like appositions take the comma.|$|E

In the present study, we examined the catecholaminergic input to expiratory laryngeal motoneurons in the caudal nucleus ambiguus by combining intracellular labeling of single identified motoneurons, with immunohistochemistry to reveal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (catecholaminergic) terminal varicosities. Close <b>appositions</b> {{were found between the}} two structures, with 18 [*]±[*] 5 close <b>appositions</b> per motoneuron (n[*]=[*] 7).

Retrogradely labeled neurons, located in the ipsilateral nucleus tractus solitarius and the area postrema, were tyrosine hydroxylase-positive. Our results not only demonstrate details of the extent and distribution of potential catecholamine inputs to the expiratory laryngeal motoneuron, but further indicate that the inputs, at least in part, originate from the dorsomedial medulla, providing a potential anatomical basis for previously reported catecholaminergic effects on the laryngeal adductor reflex. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|SummaryTo {{integrate}} {{information from}} different presynaptic cell types, dendrites receive distinct patterns of synapses from converging axons. How different afferents in vivo establish specific connectivity patterns {{with the same}} dendrite is poorly understood. Here, we examine the synaptic development of three glutamatergic bipolar cell types converging onto a common postsynaptic retinal ganglion cell. We find that after axons and dendrites target appropriate synaptic layers, patterns of connections among these neurons diverge through selective changes in the conversion of axo-dendritic <b>appositions</b> to synapses. This process is differentially regulated by neurotransmission, which {{is required for the}} shift from single to multisynaptic <b>appositions</b> of one bipolar cell type but not for maintenance and elimination, respectively, of connections from the other two types. Thus, synaptic specificity among converging excitatory inputs in the retina emerges via differential synaptic maturation of axo-dendritic <b>appositions</b> and is shaped by neurotransmission in a cell type-dependent manner...|$|R
25|$|The mode of {{formation}} of the cell wall was controversial in the 19th century.

Each theory was improved in the following decades: the <b>apposition</b> (or lamination) theory by Eduard Strasburger (1882, 1889), and the intussusception theory by Julius Wiesner (1886).|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{assessed}} {{the extent of}} the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) input to motoneurons in the ambigual, facial, and hypoglossal nuclei of the rat using a combination of intracellular recording, dye filling, and immunohistochemistry. Twelve motoneurons in the rostral nucleus ambiguus were labelled by intracellular injection in vivo of Neurobiotin (Vector). Seven out of 12 ambigual motoneurons displayed rhythmic fluctuations of their membrane potential in phase with phrenic nerve discharge, whereas the other five had no modulations of any kind. Seven facial motoneurons and seven hypoglossal motoneurons were also filled with Neurobiotin. All three motor nuclei contained TRH-immunoreactive varicosities, with the largest numbers found in the nucleus ambiguus. Close <b>appositions</b> were seen between TRH-immunoreactive boutons and every labelled motoneuron. Respiratory-related motoneurons in the nucleus ambiguus received the largest number of TRH <b>appositions</b> with 74 +/- 38 appositions/neuron (mean +/- S. D.; n = 7). In contrast, nonrespiratory ambigual motoneurons received significantly fewer TRH <b>appositions</b> (11 +/- 5; n = 5; P < 0. 05; Mann-Whitney U test). Facial motoneurons received about the same number of TRH <b>appositions</b> as nonrespiratory ambigual motoneurons, with 13 +/- 4 (n = 7). Hypoglossal motoneurons received the fewest <b>appositions</b> from TRH-containing boutons, with 8 +/- 2 (n = 7). There were no differences in the TRH inputs to respiratory and nonrespiratory motoneurons in the facial and hypoglossal nuclei.

Previous anatomical and pharmacological studies indicate a role for acetylcholine {{at the level of the}} nucleus ambiguus in the modulation of laryngeal motoneuron (LMN) activity. The present study investigated the anatomical nature of cholinergic input to inspiratory- (ILM) and expiratory-modulated (ELM) laryngeal motoneurons in the loose formation of the nucleus ambiguus. Using combined in vivo intracellular recording, dye filling, and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that LMNs identified in Sprague–Dawley rat receive several close <b>appositions</b> from vesicular acetylcholine transporter-immunoreactive (VAChT-ir) boutons. ELMs receive a significantly greater number of close <b>appositions</b> (mean ± standard deviation [SD]: 47 ± 11; n = 5) than ILMs (32 ± 9; n = 8; t-test P < 0. 05). For both LMN types, more close <b>appositions</b> were observed on the cell soma and proximal dendrites compared to distal dendrites (two-way analysis of variance [ANOVA], P < 0. 0001). Using fluorescence confocal microscopy, almost 90 % of VAChT-ir close <b>appositions</b> (n = 45 boutons on n = 4 ELMs) were colocalized with the synaptic marker synaptophysin.

To discover how these papillae may function, acoustic microscopy was used to contrast their in vivo elastic properties with those of ineffective normal papillae and contiguous cell wall. Raster and line scans showed intense acoustic activity at sites of preformed papillae; scans in selected focal planes identified this activity with the papillae, not with subtending cell wall.

25|$|The {{second type}} is named the {{superposition}} eye. The superposition eye {{is divided into}} three types; the refracting, the reflecting and the parabolic superposition eye. The refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom, and no side wall. Each lens takes light at an angle to its axis and reflects it to the same angle on the other side. The result is an image at half the radius of the eye, which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are. This type of compound eye, for which a minimal size exists below which effective superposition cannot occur, is normally found in nocturnal insects, because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent <b>apposition</b> eyes, though at the cost of reduced resolution. In the parabolic superposition compound eye type, seen in arthropods such as mayflies, the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array. Long-bodied decapod crustaceans such as shrimp, prawns, crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes, which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fusion}} process, the lipid head group {{is not only}} {{involved}} in charge density, but can affect dehydration and defect nucleation. These effects are independent {{of the effects of}} ions. The presence of the uncharged headgroup phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) increases fusion when incorporated into a phosphatidylcholine bilayer. This phenomenon has been explained by some as a dehydration effect similar to the influence of calcium. The PE headgroup binds water less tightly than PC and therefore may allow close <b>apposition</b> more easily. An alternate explanation is that the physical rather than chemical nature of PE may help induce fusion. According to the stalk hypothesis of fusion, a highly curved bridge must form between the two bilayers for fusion to occur. Since PE has a small headgroup and readily forms inverted micelle phases it should, according to the stalk model, promote the formation of these stalks. Further evidence cited in favor of this theory is the fact that certain lipid mixtures have been shown to only support fusion when raised above the transition temperature of these inverted phases. This topic also remains controversial, and even if there is a curved structure present in the fusion process, there is debate in the literature over whether it is a cubic, hexagonal or more exotic extended phase.|$|E

In the present study, we morphologically examined local inhibitory inputs to corticospinal neurons (CSNs) in motor areas using transgenic rats in which GABAergic neurons expressed fluorescent protein Venus.

We then investigated the connections of FS 1, FS 2, somatostatin (SOM) -immunopositive, and other (non-FS/non-SOM) interneurons to CSNs that were retrogradely labeled in motor areas. When close <b>appositions</b> between the axon boutons of the intracellularly labeled interneurons and the somata/dendrites of the retrogradely labeled CSNs were examined electron-microscopically, 74 % of these <b>appositions</b> made symmetric synaptic contacts.
