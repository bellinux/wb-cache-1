Salvarsan's targeted microorganism, not yet recognized as a bacterium, was still thought to be a parasite, and medical bacteriologists, believing that bacteria were not susceptible to the chemotherapeutic approach, overlooked Alexander Fleming's report in 1928 on the effects of penicillin.|$|E

40|$|Summary Cats {{are popular}} pets but until {{recently}} their perioperative and trau-matic pain was seriously underestimated and under treated. There are several causes of this under treatment. First, {{it may be}} difficult to detect pain in cats, be-cause they do not demonstrate overt pain-associated behaviour. Secondly, there are relatively few <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs</b> with market authorisation for cats. Thirdly, cats have an unfortunate reputation for toxicity from <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs,</b> particularly opioid-induced mania and classical non steroidal anti inflammatory drug toxicity. Fourthly, cats are deficient in some metabolic pathways used to metabolise <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs</b> in other species; this may lead to genuine toxicity or to lack of effect. Recently, understanding of feline behaviour and physiology has improved, leading to better clinical management of this enigmatic species. Behavioural methods are proving to be the best means of assessing pain, and knowledge of unique feline physiology has enabled rational treatment protocols to be developed specifically for cats. 2004 ESFM and AAFP.

A series of 30 analgesic trials (caudal epidural analgesia) were conducted in sheep with 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride (LH), 2 % lignocaine hydrochloride with adrenaline (LHA) and 0. 5 % bupivacaine hydrochloride (BH) in Veterinary Clinic, BAU, Mymensingh during January to April 2007. Analgesic injection was administered into low epidural space in 3 groups (A, B and C), each consisting of 10 apparently healthy sheep aged between 1 and 1. 5 years. Effects of <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs</b> on heart rate, respiration rate and rectal temperature were monitored. Heart rates significantly decreased but respiration rates decreased nonsignificantly and rectal temperature non significantly increased during low epidural analgesia with 0. 5 % BH.

40|$|Intradermal {{injection}} of pruritogens such as serotonin, histamine and compound 48 / 80 {{into the skin}} and then, {{the evaluation of the}} scratching behavior is the commonly used animal model to advance pruritic research and drug development. However, predictive validity of this model is poorly documented. There is a close interaction between itch and pain sensations with regard to mediation through an anatomically and functionally identical neuronal pathway. One approach is whether the existing animal model of itch differentiates itch or pain to show efficacy of clinically effective <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs</b> as a back translation. In this study, we explored the effects of different group of <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs</b> on serotonin and compound 48 / 80 -induced scratching behavior in Balb-C mice. Serotonin (25 μg) and compound 48 / 80 (100 μg) was injected intradermally in a volume of 50 μl into the rostral part of skin on the back of male mice and scratches were counted for a 30 -min observation period. Morphine (1, 3, 10 mg/kg), tramadol (20, 40, 80 mg/kg), cannabinoid agonist CP 55, 940 (0. 1, 0. 3, 1 mg/kg), paracetamol (100, 200, 300 mg/kg) and diclofenac (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) were given intraperitoneally 30 min prior to pruritogen injection. The <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs</b> dose dependently blocked serotonin and compound 48 / 80 -induced straching behavior with exerting complete inhibition at certain doses.

40|$|Introduction. The {{incidence}} {{of cancer in}} recent years has increased significantly. It is therefore particularly important today is the issue of provision for patients with malignancies with drugs. It is important to research the level of organization of availability of the anesthetic therapy to ensure the availability of pharmacotherapy for cancer patients worldwide. Material and methods. For {{the purpose of the study}} analyzed legislation, regulations of some states in the US that provide availability of narcotic <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs</b> for patients with malignant neoplasms. The paper used the following methods: comparative, documentary, legal, medical, pharmaceutical and graphical analysis. Results and discussion. Noted the increase in expenditure on pharmaceutical provision for patients with malignancies on an outpatient basis in the US. During the study of the legislative and regulatory acts of the USA found that payments for treatment possible by insurance companies as part of the agreement, which in turn depend on the patient’s age, number of family members, their total income and so on. Coupons can be used to pay for the cost of medicines, but not all pharmacies accept coupons.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in 2000 into the use of <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs</b> by veterinarians in South Africa. This survey was repeated in 2005 to establish whether the use of <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs</b> has increased and which <b>analgesic</b> <b>drugs</b> are being used for acute pain and osteoarthritis. The number of sterilisations performed {{and the number of}} new cases of osteoarthritis in dogs and cats was estimated. It is estimated that approximately 260 000 cats are operated on each year in South Africa and that 150 000 cats are sterilised. Five hundred thousand dogs undergo surgery, of which 242 000 are sterilised. It appears that the number of surgical procedures performed in South Africa has decreased. The estimated death rate following anaesthesia has remained unchanged at 1 : 1004. Overall, the use of analgesics by South African veterinarians has increased significantly. Fifty-six per cent of cats and 74 % of dogs were given peri-operative analgesics but this increased to 94 % and 84 % after including pre-anaesthetic medications with analgesic properties. The use of opioids (morphine and buprenorphine) and propofol has increased significantly. Approximately 253 000 dogs and 33 000 cats with osteoarthritis are seen by veterinarians in South Africa annually. The recognition by veterinarians of osteoarthritis in cats appears to be poor and is in need of attention.
