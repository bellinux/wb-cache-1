Operating a squeezed light source under high vacuum has the advantages of reducing optical losses and phase noise compared to techniques where the squeezed light is introduced from outside the vacuum. This will ultimately provide enhanced sensitivity for modern interferometric gravitational wave detectors that will soon become limited by quantum noise across much of the detection bandwidth. Here we describe the optomechanical design choices and construction techniques of a near monolithic glass optical parametric oscillator that has been operated under a vacuum of 10 − 6 mbar. The optical parametric oscillator described here has been shown to produce 8. 6 dB of quadrature squeezed light in the <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> down to 10 Hz.

40|$|Thermal noise {{generally}} greatly exceeds {{quantum noise}} in optomechanical devices unless the mechanical frequency {{is very high}} or the thermodynamic temperature is very low. This paper addresses the design concept for a novel optomechanical device capable of ultrahigh quality factors in the <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> with negligible thermal noise. The proposed system consists of a minimally supported millimeter scale pendulum mounted in a Double End-Mirror Sloshing (DEMS) cavity that is topologically equivalent to a Membrane-in-the-Middle (MIM) cavity. The radiation pressure inside the high-finesse cavity allows for high optical stiffness, cancellation of terms which lead to unwanted negative damping and suppression of quantum radiation pressure noise. We solve for the optical spring dynamics of the system using the Hamiltonian, find the noise spectral density and show that stable optical trapping is possible. We also assess various loss mechanisms, {{one of the most}} important being the acceleration loss due to the optical spring. We show that practical devices, starting from a centre-of-mass pendulum frequency of 0. 1 Hz, could achieve a maximum quality factor of 10 ^ 14 with optical spring stiffened frequency 1 - 10 kHz. Small resonators of mass 1 μg or less could achieve a Q-factor of 10 ^ 11 at a frequency of 100 kHz. Applications for such devices include white light cavities for improvement of gravitational wave detectors, or sensors able to operate near the quantum limit. Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures.

40|$|Frequency {{filters are}} widely used in {{communications}} systems today. Historically they have been constructed from inductors, capacitors and resistors and such circuits are well understood. However they suffer from the disadvantages of large physical size and high cost. A monolithic realisation of frequency filters would greatly {{reduce the cost of}} systems in which filters are used and would increase their reliability in hostile environments. In this thesis a novel approach to the realisation of sampled-data monolithic frequency filters is presented. The method is based on the use of sampled analogue signals and is related to the wave digital filter in its design techniques. The eventual monolithic realisation in NMOS technology {{is in the form of}} a switched-capacitor structure. While the main body of the research is concerned with the implementation of filters which are based on distributed prototype networks, some work on integratable filters which are based on lumped element prototypes is also presented. For either type the design model is exact and the resulting filter is optimally insensitive to parameter variations. The filters are implemented using a technique which ensures that performance is limited by capacitor ratios, which are moderate as compared with alternative published approaches. A prototype integrated circuit suitable for use in the <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> has been designed to demonstrate the validity of the approach for the filters based on distributed prototypes and contains. filters of third, fifth and seventh order. Results are presented for these filters and also for a pseudobandpass filter which uses the periodicity of the prototype distributed network. The seventh order filter had a cut-off frequency of one eighth of the filter sample rate and achieved a stop band attenuation of well over 70 dB An implemetation of a wave filter based on a lumped element prototype is also described and results are presented. This work is expected to form the basis of a novel implemetation of bandpass filters. The responses achieved for all the wave filters constructed show excellent agreement with the theory...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{precision}} measurements {{have become}} one of the most important tools in physics to test the fundamental laws and to probe the universe around us. Often such experiments require high finesse cavities, and optical loss in these cavities is a critical parameter. In particular, for those cavities that deal with quantum systems, minimizing the cavity loss is crucial because any loss can easily degrade the fragile quantum states. One such example is a quantum noise filter cavity for gravitational wave (GW) detectors, where an optical cavity is necessary for producing frequency-dependent squeezed states of light to improve the sensitivity over their broad audioband frequency [1]. To test the feasibility of quantum noise filter cavities for GW detectors, we characterized the optical loss of state-of-the-art mirrors using a 2 m long high-finesse cavity. Using multiple loss measurement techniques, we studied loss dependence on laser beam sizes and positions. Within the 1 to 3 mm beam spot size we measured, we found that the mirror loss is almost constant at around 5 ppm, and that the loss depends more on the beam position on the mirror than on the beam size 121. While intra-cavity optical loss is one of the key parameters informing the design of quantum noise filter cavities, we also need to account for other quantum noise degradation mechanisms such as the phase noise, losses outside of the cavity, and mode-matching. We developed an analytical model of frequency-dependent squeezing with a quantum noise filter cavity to explore the practical degradation mechanisms in detail 131. Finally, by coupling a squeezed light source to the 2 m long high-finesse cavity, we demonstrated frequency-dependent squeezed states where 6 dB of squeezing in the squeezed quadrature was rotated by 90 degrees in the <b>audio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> 141. The techniques used are directly applicable to squeezed light sources for GW detectors, and the measurements validated the model. The loss measurement results, the analytical model, and this demonstration, are now the basis for the design of a realistic quantum noise filter cavity for use in GW detectors in the near future to improve their sensitivity. by Tomoki Isogai.

Our best approach achieved 75. 27 % combined overall classification accuracy, which is rank 5. 1 IMPLEMENTATION 1. 1 Feature Extraction We extract 3 feature sets from audio data, using algorithms implemented in MATLAB. The algorithms process audio tracks in standard digital PCM format with 44. 1 kHz or 22. 05 kHz sampling <b>frequency.</b> <b>Audio</b> compressed with e. g. the MP 3 format will be decoded by an external program in a pre-processing step. Audio with multiple channels will be merged to mono. Prior to feature extraction, each audio track is segmented into pieces of 6 seconds length. The first and the last segment are skipped, in order to exclude lead-in and fade-out effects. In the MIREX setting, only every third segment is processed. For each set of features, the characteristics of an entire piece of music are computed by averaging the feature vectors from the segments (using median or mean).

The results are used in Matlab to represent the radiation patterns of the antennas in both the azimuth and elevation plane, but with the use of interpolation to define the most likely form of the radiation diagram. It is also possible to see from the results where the directivity of the antennas is pointing. The results show that the logging of the positions should be improved to create a better resolution of the radiation patterns. It should also be developed a program in Matlab that can display the radiation patterns in three-dimensional graphs, in this way creating a better picture of the coverage of the antennas. Also, to make the system more versatile, it should be tested for other types of antennas and with other frequencies, so it can be explored if the system is durable for all types of antenna measurements...|$|R
