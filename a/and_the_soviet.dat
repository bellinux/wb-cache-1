5|$|The Punch-up in Piestany was {{a notable}} {{instance}} of fighting in international play. A 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships game between Canada <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union {{was the scene}} of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.|$|E

5|$|According to Meek, Pokhlebkin <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore {{political}} boundaries.... The faint {{outline of}} the Tsarist-Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock, and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and, in emigration, from Brooklyn to Berlin.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, 26 April {{marks the}} end of this battle, {{although}} less severe and isolated clashes in that region continued until 30 April.

5|$|After {{the station}} opened, Soviet protests persisted. The issue was raised at {{official}} {{visits to the}} Soviet Union by Norwegian politicians in 1966, 1967 and 1968.

5|$|Although {{the poet}} was {{moving away from}} Surrealism, his {{adherence}} to strict Marxism-Leninism was reportedly questioned by both the PCF <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. Semiotician Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of Utopia, which combined communist messages with Freudo-Marxist psychoanalysis and made use of particularly violent imagery. Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the party line, maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.|$|E

After a June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum demanding Bessarabia, Bukovina, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hertza region from Romania, <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> entered these areas, Romania caved to <b>Soviet</b> demands <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> occupied <b>the</b> territories.|$|R

5|$|As the {{relations}} between the West <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union deteriorated with the US and the UK backing Turkey, Soviet claims were out of the agenda by 1947.
