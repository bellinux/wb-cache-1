50|$|Easterly also {{highlights}} the problematic nature of structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>loan</b> programs—aid given under certain conditions—which became {{very popular in}} the 1980s. Rather than initiating true economic reform, states only pretended to adjust their policies. Because shortfalls would elicit increased loans and donors demonstrated little interest in revoking aid, there was little incentive for states to improve their policies. Debt forgiveness regimes produced the same moral hazard, as authoritarian governments considered forgiveness as a free pass to continue to steal from their peoples’ futures. Easterly suggests that aid should be tied to prior achievement rather than promises of political leaders, and that aid should increase with further improvement (similar to the incentive structure of the Earned Income Tax Credit).|$|E

Venezuela also used its large and previously untapped reserves at the IMF in 1989, when the IMF disbursed the first installment of a threeyear Extended Fund Facility in the amount of US$4.8 billion. These new funds helped ease the country's painful transition to a more open economy, a transition undertaken largely on the advice of the IMF and the World Bank. Another multilateral agency, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), also continued to fund Venezuela's development in highway construction, forestry programs, water and sanitation projects, mining, and other infrastructure projects. In cumulative terms, the IDB provided approximately US$1.3 billion from 1961 to 1990.|$|E

Though the country achieved targeted successes in the horticulture and apparel industries, overall Kenya’s trade liberalization failed to produce sustained growth, promote decent employment opportunities, or lessen the incidence of poverty and inequality.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quantitative analysis of adjustment programmes. This {{is done by}} charting changes in various performance indicators following the receipt of the first <b>adjustment</b> <b>loan,</b> and by further contrasting the results with those for the comparator group of countries that did not receive adjustment loans. It is found that the average decline in the GDP growth rate in the loan-recipient countries was less than in the comparator groups. Similar results were obtained in regard to per capita GDP. At the same time, in both cases, a majority of loan-recipient countries experienced an improvement in their relative position vis-d-vis the non-recipients. It is further apparent that the loan-recipient countries made an adjustment effort in the period following the first loan. To begin with, economic expansion was concentrated in the traded goods sectors, industry and agriculture, both of which experienced an improvement in the loan-recipient countries relative to the comparator groups. Also, the growth of consumption declined substantially in absolute terms as well as relative to the non-recipient countries. In turn, an acceleration is observed {{in the growth of}} investment that holds the promise for future economic growth. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to map today's debate about the {{effectiveness}} of conditionalities and adjustment lending back into the older balanced versus unbalanced growth debate. A 'Christmas tree ' of conditionalities on an <b>adjustment</b> <b>loan</b> is in general ineffective in developing 'ownership ' or in generating sustainable change. Development agencies need to select for genuine commitment to policy reforms on the part of client governments rather than think that such commitments can be 'bought ' with aid. This raises the question of "How does a country get from here to there? " and this is where the Hirschmanian notion of unbalanced growth can be 'rediscovered. ' A country that has already developed a "good policy environment " and can implement a 'Christmas tree ' of conditionalities is like a country that can implement the "balanced growth plans " of the earlier debate. Such a country would be well on its way to development. When the central government lacks this capability, the Hirschmanian approach is to look for "hidden rationalities " in the small or in the periphery, and then to help the small beginnings to spread using, where possible, the natural pressures of linkages. Rather than trying to put all the pieces of a puzzle together at once to make it look like the picture on the box, one starts in the small where the pieces are starting to fit together and then builds outward using the linkages between the pieces.

This twin island {{is also one of the}} foremost global exporters of methanol and ammonia to the U. S market (IHS Chemical, World Methanol Analysis 2013; FERTECON Ammonia Outlook 2014). However, some may argue that this resource-rich country remains heavily reliant on revenues generated by gas production. Although Trinidad and Tobago have succeeded, to a limited extent, in diversifying the economy from energy to manufacturing, services and eco-tourism, it currently faces a major economic insecurity. More recently, several local economists including Hosein (2016) have issued statements warning the Trinidad and Tobago Government that failure to reform the economy particularly in areas of economic diversification can result in a repeat of the 1989 IMF Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Loan</b> fiasco. Hosein (2016) and others argue that economic diversification will reduce risk and ensure long-term industrial development. In this vein, I use my presentation to examine the concept and importance of economic diversification in light the brief situation analysis outlined above.

After explicitly controlling for external shocks and nonprogram determinants of performance, the authors find that adjustment lending programs have usually increased the growth rate of GDP and the ratio of exports to GDP, and have increased the saving-to-GDP ratio over early 1980 s levels. But the average ratio of investment to GDP has fallen below 1970 s levels. For countries that have reduced most of their policy inefficiencies, achieving a sustainable growth rate in the 1990 s will require higher investment rates than those achieved in the 1980 s.

40|$|In the 1980 s {{development}} assistance shifted largely from financing investments (such as roads and dams) to promoting policy reform. This change came {{because of a}} growing awareness that developing countries were held back more by poor policies than {{by a lack of}} finance for investment. After nearly 20 years'experience with policy-based or conditional lending, there have now been many studies of adjustment lending, most of which take a case-study approach. Many conclude that policy-based lending works if countries have decided on their own to reform. The authors examine a database of 220 World Bank-supported reform programs to identify why adjustment programs succeed or fail. They find that a few political economy variables can successfully predict the outcome of an <b>adjustment</b> <b>loan</b> 75 percent of the time. Variables under the World Bank's control [...] resources devoted to preparation and supervision or number of conditions [...] have no relationship with an adjustment program's success or failure. What development agencies must do, then, is select promising candidates for adjustment support. When the candidates is a poor selection, devoting more administrative resources or imposing more conditions will not increase the likelihood of successful reform. To improve its success rate with adjustment lending, the World Bank must become more selective and {{do a better job of}} understanding which environments are promising for reform and which are not. That is likely to lead to fewer adjustment loans, unless there is a significant change in the number of promising reformers. To become more effective at supporting policy reform, the agency must be willing to accept that this may lead to smaller volumes of lending.

40|$|Many {{development}} strategies assume (or desperately hope) that {{a country}} already {{has the capacity to}} plan and implement institutional reform or that such institutional reform can be pushed through with the external pressures of aid and conditionalities.

A"Christmas tree"of conditionalities hung on an <b>adjustment</b> <b>loan</b> is generally ineffective in getting a country to develop"ownership"of reform or in generating sustainable change.

There is evidence that some policy variables under adjustment lending are counter-cyclical, but no evidence that the cyclical component of those policy variables affects poverty. The author speculates that the poor may be ill placed to take advantage of new opportunities, created by structural adjustment reforms, just as they may suffer less from the loss of old opportunities in sectors that were artificially protected before reform. Poverty's lower sensitivity to growth under adjustment lending, is bad news when an economy expands, and good news when it contracts. These results could be interpreted as giving support to either the critics, or the supporters of structural adjustment programs.
