40|$|Meniscal lesions {{often occur}} in the {{avascular}} area of the meniscus with little chance of spontaneous repair. An <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> in the meniscal tissue can function as an entrance for ingrowing repair tissue from the vascular periphery of the meniscus to the lesion in the avascular zone which again induced healing of the lesion. Implantation of a porous polymer in a full-thickness <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> induced healing. However, a better integration between meniscal tissue and the implant might be achieved with {{the combination of the}} newly developed porous polymers and a modified surgical technique. This might improve meniscal lesion healing and the repair of the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> with neo-meniscal tissue. Longitudinal lesions were created in the avascular part of 24 canine lateral menisci and a partial-thickness <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> was formed to connect the lesion with the meniscal periphery. In 12 menisci, the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> was left empty (control group), while in the remaining 12 menisci the polymer implant was sutured into the <b>access</b> <b>channel.</b> Repair of the longitudinal lesions was achieved with and without polymer implantation in the partial-thickness <b>access</b> <b>channel.</b> Polymer implants induced fibrous ingrowth with cartilaginous areas, which resembled neo-meniscal tissue. Implantation did not prevent articular cartilage degeneration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

However, the paper assumed that any Random Access packet arrival events, involving multiple packets from co-channel Mobile Stations, would result in lost packets. In this paper, closed form equations are developed for the collision statistics of the W-CDMA Random <b>Access</b> <b>channel</b> and for the average SINR of a multi-packet collision in a generalized fading channel, with diversity reception at the Base Station. These equations are then used to calculate the overall Random <b>Access</b> <b>channel</b> packet throughput. The results of the analysis show that considerable improvement in the Random <b>Access</b> <b>channel</b> performance can be achieved when multiple arrival collisions, on the same timeslot and with the same signature code, are partially resolved. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{maintenance}} dredging an <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> to a canal estate in Deception Bay, Australia, {{on the nearby}} seagrasses was monitored over 18 months with a Before/After, Control/Impact, Repeated measures (BACIR) sampling design. Three seagrasses were collected in the study area; Zostera capricorni Aschers., Halophila ovalis (R. Br.) Hook. f. and Halophila spinulosa (R. Br.) Aschers. All seagrasses were found less than 700 m offshore. The biomass of Z. capricorni, the numerically dominant seagrass, was significantly lower in the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> border compared with the control area before dredging, which was attributed to direct or indirect effects associated with the channel. There was no significant effect of maintenance dredging statistically detected for Z. capricorni biomass in the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> border even though seagrass was absent in the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> 14 months after dredging. This {{was due to the}} high background variability of seagrass biomass in the control area. In contrast the biomass of H. ovalis declined at a significantly higher rate in the control area than in the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> border but had also disappeared from the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> border 14 months after dredging. Without a control we may have concluded that the disappearance of seagrass from the <b>access</b> <b>channel</b> border was due to the effects of dredging, whereas with a BACIR sampling program there remained a possibility that the decline in seagrass was due to larger scale changes in the bay...|$|R
