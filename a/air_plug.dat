40|$|In this paper, the {{formation}} and breakup process of compound pendant drops (CPDs, pendant drops with smaller drops or bubbles in them) {{at the tip of}} a glass capillary and its effect on upstream velocity fluctuation are experimentally investigated. The formation process of an air/water compound drop from a CPD consists of four main stages. First, an <b>air</b> <b>plug</b> in the capillary flows into the small liquid pendant drop to initialize a small CPD. Next, a liquid slug flows into the CPD, and the liquid in the CPD accumulates. Subsequently, an <b>air</b> <b>plug</b> flows into the CPD, and it coalesces with the existing air bubble in the CPD. The accumulation and coalescence stages repeat, until the CPD reaches a critical weight, then the CPD finally breaks up to produce a compound drop. For the air/SDS-solution system, the bubbles in the CPDs do not coalesce, and the contact line of the CPDs initially climbs along the capillary and then moves downwards with the growth of the CPDs. The upstream velocity fluctuates during the periodical formation and breakup of the CPD due to Laplace pressure variation {{at the tip of the}} glass capillary. By adding surfactant into water, the fluctuation of the upstream velocity decreases. The size distribution of the compound drops produced by the breakup of CPDs is quantified, and the results show that the current system is able to produce monodisperse compound drops. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a novel resonance absorber is described. The vibrating elements of the "membrane absorber" are the perforation membrane, the <b>air</b> <b>plug</b> in the hole, the impermeable covering membrane with the air cushion enclosed in the chamber behind functioning as a spring. This complex resonator does not require any additional absorbing material to achieve a broad-band effect {{in the range of}} medium and low frequencies. Since the membrane absorber is hermetically sealed all around against its environment and has completely smooth outer surfaces, it is especially suitable for application in fields where high demands on hygiene conditions and fire protection, low frictional losses and small volume and weight are important. Silencer splitters completely made of stainless steel are described as an example for the application of the membrane absorber under harsh conditions in coal mines and air cleaning devices for industrial plants...|$|E

It was shortly found (by Ching-Wu Chu) that replacing the lanthanum with yttrium, i.e. making YBCO, raised the critical temperature to 92 K, which was important because liquid nitrogen could then be used as a refrigerant (at atmospheric pressure, the boiling point of nitrogen is 77 K). [...] This is important commercially because liquid nitrogen can be produced cheaply on-site with no raw materials, and is not prone to some of the problems (solid <b>air</b> <b>plugs,</b> etc.) of helium in piping.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} {{efficacy of the}} combined application of Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) and intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (iMRI) navigation in frameless biopsy of intracranial lesions. Method: 1 H-MRS was {{used to analyze the}} metabolism of the lesions and to locate appropriate biopsy point. We selected target points with the highest Cho/NAA ratio as shown by 1 H-MRS for frameless biopsies. Thirty-one cerebral biopsy procedures were performed to identify the pathological diagnosis {{with the help of a}} 1. 5 T iMRI and a navigation system. After the biopsy, we routinely injected 0. 5 - 1. 0 ml of air to the target zone through the biopsy needle. It can either serve as a marker and confirm that the targeted tissue has already been acquired, or form an <b>air</b> <b>plug</b> for local hemostasis. Results: Frameless biopsies were successfully performed in all 31 cases, and pathological diagnosis were made in 30 patients, with a success rate of 96. 8 % (30 / 31). None of the patients suffered from significant complications, such as intracranial bleeding or new neurological deficit. Conclusion: 1 H-MRS assists in finding the best biopsy lesion point and iMRI can guide biopsy accurately. The combined application of 1 H-MRS and iMRI navigation is technically feasible and safe for frameless biopsy of intracerebral lesions...|$|E
40|$|Improvements in the {{fabrication}} capability have {{given rise to}} micro systems for heat and mass transfer operations. The flow of uniform/oscillating menisci or air-plug in liquid-filled tube is a hydrodynamics problem with interesting practical applications like Pulsating heat pipes, Fuel cells, Lab-on-chip devices, Electro-wetting, Microfluidics etc. Understanding the hydrodynamics of such flows will help us in manipulating the performance parameters, which will further improve the efficiency of multiphase micro-systems. Sufficient literature is available for uniform-unidirectional contact line motion for fully wetting fluids under isotropic homogeneous conditions, especially at low Capillary numbers. The present work aims to study the interfacial contact line behavior of a sinusoidally oscillating (at 0. 5 Hz) (i) single meniscus (liquid-air) and, (ii) <b>air</b> <b>plug</b> formed between two different liquid slugs, in a square glass capillary having hydraulic diameter of 3. 0 mm through high speed videography and subsequent image analysis. Such flows have not been reported sufficiently in the literature. To highlight important discerning physical phenomena, experiments are done with two different fluids, water and silicon oil. It was found that the contact line, in case of silicon oil, gets totally pinned whereas the contact line of deionized water shows partial pinning. The interplay of surface tension, viscous forces and inertia forces is playing important role in meniscus/air-plug shapes and thin film dynamics at different orientation of the capillary. This has profound implications on heat transfer. It was found that the sinusoidally oscillating contact line motion does not follow the classical Hoffman-Tanner Law which relates the advancing contact angle with the Capillary number.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{conventional}} cleaner power generation technology, concentrating solar power systems have introduced remarkable opportunity. In a solar power tower, solar energy concentrated by the heliostats at a single point produces very high temperature. Falling solid particles or heat transfer fluid passing through that high temperature region absorbs heat to generate electricity. Increasing the residence time will result in more heat gain and increase efficiency. A novel design of solar receiver for both fluid and solid particle is approached in this paper which can increase residence time resulting in higher temperature gain in one cycle compared to conventional receivers. The helical tubular solar receiver placed at the focused sunlight region meets the higher outlet temperature and efficiency. A vertical tubular receiver is modeled and analyzed for single phase flow with molten salt as heat transfer fluid and alloy 625 as heat transfer material. The result is compared to a journal paper of similar numerical and experimental setup for validating our modeling. New types of helical tubular solar receivers are modeled and analyzed with heat transfer fluid turbulent flow in single phase, and granular particle and <b>air</b> <b>plug</b> flow in multiphase to observe the temperature rise in one cyclic operation. The Discrete Ordinate radiation model is used for numerical analysis with simulation software Ansys Fluent 15. 0. The Eulerian granular multiphase model is used for multiphase flow. Applying the same modeling parameters and boundary conditions, the results of vertical and helical receivers are compared. With a helical receiver, higher temperature gain of heat transfer fluid is achieved in one cycle for both single phase and multiphase flow compared to the vertical receiver. Performance is also observed by varying dimension of helical receiver. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} in oil-water pipe flow descends from its importance in petrochemical industries; pumping power requirements during oil transportation is considerably reduced in the core-annular flow regime. In petroleum transportation pipelines, an additional phase {{of natural gas}} frequently flows with the oil. The prediction of pressure drop and stability characteristics of the three-phase flow in these lines is important for proper operation of the transportation plants at reduced power consumption. Results from a set of experiments of three-phase flow of high viscosity oil, water and air in horizontal pipes of two different diameters are presented in the paper. Pressure drop measurements are related to three phase flow patterns observations in a defined range of specific flow rates of water, oil and air. When air is supplied in a wavy-stratified flow of oil and water, the presence of <b>air</b> <b>plugs</b> hinders stratification and ensures a lower resistance as respect the corresponding oil-water case; disturbances induced by the gaseous phase grow rapidly with increasing air specific flow rate and the tendency is reversed by a higer flow rate of air.

40|$|Biofilms {{represent}} {{a highly successful}} life strategy of bacteria in a very broad range of environments and often have negative implications for industrial and clinical applications, as their removal from surfaces and the prevention of biofouling {{in the first place}} represent formidable and to date unmet challenges. At the same time, biofilms modulate important natural processes, including nutrient cycling in rivers and streams and the clogging of porous materials. Biofilm development is a dynamic process, dependent on a host of cellular and environmental parameters that include, among others, hydrodynamic environment and the communication among cells (QS). Here we used microfluidics and micro-contact printing, paired with video-microscopy and image analysis, to study several aspects relating to the temporal dynamics of bacterial biofilms. Beyond reporting on specific findings from these experiments, we demonstrate how these innovative technologies can aid in obtaining a new layer understanding on biofilm processes and biofilm removal, thanks to unprecedented control over the biofilm's microenvironment. In a first set of experiments (chapter 2), we cultured Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in a microfluidic channel for different times, after which we used the passage of an <b>air</b> <b>plug</b> as a mechanical insult to drive detachment. We found that the adhesion properties of an early-stage biofilm have a strong correlation with the time of growth and that biofilm detachment can occur in a spatially heterogeneous manner characterized by a regular pattern of 'holes' in the original biofilm. The resulting spatial distribution of bacteria correlates with the distribution of the extra polymeric substance (EPS) matrix before the insult, indicating that the locations of the holes correspond to where there was the least EPS. These results demonstrate that the detachment mechanism is a competition between the shear force exerted by the external flow and the local adhesion force of a given patch of biofilm, in turn governed by the local amount of EPS. This mechanism, and the observed heterogeneity in the detachment, imply that even at rather high shear rates, where the bulk of the biofilm is removed, local strongholds survive detachment, and may represent seeds for the colony to reform. In a second set of experiments (chapter 3), we examined the effects of patch size and hydrodynamic environment on QS induction on spatially defined patches of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm. We found that the smaller biofilm patches start QS earlier than those in the larger patches. However at later times the proportion of auto-induced bacteria (normalized by the surface area covered by the cells) is higher in the larger patches. We expanded on these findings by investigating the contribution of flow to QS induction on the patches. The effect of ambient fluid flow was to accelerate the induction of quorum sensing compared to static conditions at moderate flow rates, due to the increase in the convective supply of nutrients and to quench quorum sensing at high flow rates, due to the autoinducer signal being washed out by flow. These findings establish microfluidics as a new tool in the study of biofilms, which enables both accurate control over microenvironmental conditions and direct observation of the dynamics of biofilm formation and disruption. Chapter 4 deepens the exploration of the role of micro-spatial heterogeneity on microbial processes by presenting a numerical model of how heterogeneity and microbial behavior (chemotaxis) affect trophic in a microbial food web. Results show that the intensity of the trophic transfer strong depends on the motile behavior of the different trophic levels: trophic transfer is enhanced when directional motility towards resource patches outweighs the random component of motility inherent in all microbial locomotion. Finally, in the Appendices, we demonstrate how the methods developed in this thesis can help in the assessment of the antifouling capabilities of new-generation surfaces, designed to prevent fouling and in the assessment of the cell adhesion on surfaces, fabricated with an arrangement of spatially localized hydrophobic patterns. In summary, this thesis demonstrates that use of new micro-technology and associated mathematical modeling enables new insights into the colonial life form of microorganisms and may provide impetus for new approaches to prevent biofouling on surfaces or remove biofilms from surfaces. by Hongchul Jang.

40|$|Authors: Wei Zou ### Abstract Fatty acids {{are major}} energy {{provider}} {{for the human}} body. Over intake of fatty acids causes obesity. ### Reagents 1. CM mixture: chloroform: methanol: butylated hydroxytolune (BHT) = 2 L : 1 L : 100 mg. - 0. 5 N methanolic sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (10 g NaOH in 500 mL methanol) : mix the solution for 15 minutes with a stir bar. Don’t heat the mixture because methanol is highly flammable. - 14 % Boron Trifluoride (BF 3) in methanol (commercially available from Sigma) - HPLC grade petroleum ether (3. 3 mg BHT in 100 mL petroleum ether) - Saturated aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl) : Add some NaCl into 500 mL D. I. water. Stir the solution until it is clear. Add more NaCl until it does not disappear any more. Wait until the NaCl crystal precipitate. Pour the clear solution into a glass bottle. - Anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 - Internal standard (10 mg nonadecanoic acid in 100 mL CM mixture 2 : 1 = 100 ng/µL, 200 mg heptadecanoic acid in 100 mL CM mixture 2 : 1 = 2000 ng/µL) As ISTD, C 17 : 0 is better than C 19 : 0 because {{the peak of the}} former one has better resolution than that of the latter one. Procedure: Weigh 10 mL beaker (about 8 g), add some nonadecanoic acid into it, weigh it again to get net weight of 10 mg. Add some CM mixture (2 : 1) into the beaker to dissolve the powder. Weigh 200 mg C 17 : 0 in the same way. Pool the solution into a 100 mL volumetric flask. Wash the beaker 10 times and pool the washing solution into the flask. Tip off the flask to the mark with CM mixture. Shake the flask to dissolve the nonadecanoic acid totally. Wrap the mouth of the flask with Teflon tape. Wrap the flask with alumnium foil. ### Procedure **I. External Standard Curve Setting Up** 1. Estimate the ranges of fatty acids species in the sample and determine calibration points. For example: ![E 1]([URL] "E 1 ") 2. Make standard FAME solutions for the calibration curves (FAME standards are from Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc.) : - Choice 1 : Weigh the 10 ml beaker, write down the value. Add about 100 mg 1 A in the 10 ml beaker, weigh again and write down the value. Wash the 10 ml beaker with petroleum ether more than 5 times. Collect the wash in a 100 ml volumetric flask. Weigh about 100 mg 3 A in the same way. Collect the wash in the same 100 ml volumetric flask. Tip to the marker with petroleum ether. Calculate the theoretic amount (ng/inj. vol.) - Choice 2 : Weigh the 10 ml beaker, write down the value. Add about 100 mg 68 A in the 10 ml beaker, weigh again and write down the value. Wash the 10 ml beaker with petroleum ether more than 5 times. Collect the wash in a 10 ml volumetric flask. Tip to the marker with petroleum ether. Calculate the theoretic amount (ng / inj. vol.) 3. Preparation and injection of different concentrations of standard FAMEs: Concentrate or dilute the standard FAMEs according to the values of the calibration points. At least 3 injections are needed at each concentration level for each fatty acid. Average the peak area for the injections. Type the theoretic amount and average peak area into the calibration table. Save the method. 4. Make standard FAME solutions for the determination of the retention time (RT) : Weigh the 10 ml beaker, write down the value. Add about 100 mg 68 D in the 10 ml beaker, weigh again and write down the value. Wash the 10 ml beaker with petroleum ether more than 5 times. Collect the wash in a 10 ml volumetric flask. Tip to the marker with petroleum ether. Calculate the theoretic amount (ng / inj. vol.). 68 D is better for the determination of the RT because it has a unique fatty acids profiles. **II Procedure**: i. Pre-experiment: 1. Turn on the boiling water bath, the evaporator’s water bath, and the centrifuge. - Check the tube mouth carefully and wash with CM mixture and dry. - Put the sample in ice. - Check the pipette or syringe accuracy before pipetting. ii. Extraction of fatty acids: - Proper amount of sample and internal STD should be determined for each kind of biological sample. If GC system conditions are changed, this step should be done also. Less sample amount won’t show all interested peaks, while greater sample amount will introduce some unknown peaks and affect the baseline and resolution. - The data should be in the range of calibration curves. Otherwise, the new calibration curve should be done. For lymph/bile/serum: 1. Use the 100 µL automatic pipette to add 100 µL lymph into the 16 × 100 mm tube. Wash the tip with 100 µL D. I. water. - Use 5 mL dispenser to add 4 mL CM mixture (2 : 1) into the tube. - Use 250 µL syringe to add 200 µL internal standard (C 19 : 0 or C 17 : 0) into the tube. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. Wait 30 minutes. To denature protein and extract fatty acids. - There are two ways {{to get rid of the}} aqueous residue: - I. “Water Washing”: - Fill the dispenser with fresh D. I. water everyday. Use dispenser to add 900 µL D. I. water. Shake the tube upside down 3 times. - Let the tube stand at RT for 10 min until two distinct layers show. Siphon off the upper aqueous layer with negative pressure system. - Evaporate the lower solvent layer under N 2. - II. “Filtering”: - Apply 0. 45 mm PTFE filter to filter the lipid extract. - Evaporate the solvent under N 2. For tissue lipid extract: 1. Use the 500 µL syringe to add 500 µL tissue lipid extraction into the 16 × 100 mm tube. - Use 500 µL syringe to add 500 µL internal standard (C 19 : 0 or C 17 : 0) into the tube. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. - Evaporate under the N 2. Typical applications for different tissues: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") iii. Sample preparation: 5. Add 2 mL 0. 5 N methanolic NaOH into the tube. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. Cap tightly. 6. Heat the tube in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes. 7. While waiting, prepare another set of 12 × 100 tubes. Add 0. 15 g anhydrous Na 2 SO 4. Prepare pasteur pipettes. 8. After cooling the tube for 5 minutes, add 2 mL 14 % BF 3. Vortex vigorously 9 seconds. Cap tightly. After using the BF 3, blow some N 2 into the BF 3 bottle and seal it. 9. Heat another 15 minutes. Cool down the tube in ice for 5 minutes. 10. Use a dispenser to add 2 mL petroleum ether and 2 mL automatic pipette to add 2 mL saturated aqueous NaCl into the tube. 11. Vortex the tube vigorously for 2 minute with the “vortex rack”. Centrifuge the tube for 5 minutes. 12. Use a pasteur pipette to transfer carefully the upper petroleum ether layer into the tube with anhydrous Na 2 SO 4. Cap the tube and vortex 9 seconds. Let the tube stand for 20 minutes. Petroleum ether is very easy to drop from the pipette. Be careful! Don’t take all of the upper layer. It is better not to disturb the lower layer. 13. While waiting, choose a set of brown color glass vials and check the mouth of the tube. Wash the tubes with CM mixture and Pet ether. The cap of the vial should be Teflon. 14. Transfer the solution with pasteur pipette into the vials. Wash the tubes once with 2 mL petroleum ether. Add the washing solution into the vials. Be careful not to transfer the aqueous layer, otherwise the evaporation will take much longer time and there will be NaSO 4 residue on the wall of the vial. The residue might affect the GC separation of fatty acids. 15. Evaporate the vials at 30 - 40 C under a very gentle stream of N 2. Stop evaporating immediately after the vials are dry because FAMEs are very easy to evaporate. 16. Take out the vial and put it into the ice box to cool down for 15 seconds. Put the bottle of petroleum ether with BHT in ice also to avoid evaporating. 17. Use 250 µL syringe to add exactly 100 µL petroleum ether with BHT into the vial. Vortex gently. Cap tightly. Wrap the cap with Teflon tape. 18. Wait 3 - 4 hours for GC injection, otherwise the recovery rate will be low. From my experience, overnight standing is OK. iv. GC injection: For the GC 6890 system, check handbooks for the installation and hardware information. Check the online tutorial and printout help files for the software information. 19. Check if the gas tanks are full. The tanks should be changed to avoid GC column contamination if the pressure is below 400 psi. 20. Before GC warming on, check if the septa need to be changed. To change the new septa, wash it with HPLC graded methanol and put it on the inlet. Set GC temperature to 250 °C for 30 min. to clean the residues from the new septa. 21. GC warming up. At least half an hour before the sample injection, click the icon “instrument 1 online” on the desktop. In the popup windows, type in the name of the operator. In the ChemStation desktop, click the menu “File” – “Load Method” to choose the right method. After the warming up, run the “Instrument” – “StartColumnComRun” to set blank injection. 22. Click the “RunControl” – “Sample Info” to change the name of the operator, file prefix, and subdirectory for the file storing, etc. 23. Before injection, wash the 10 µL GC syringe with D. I. water, then acetone, then petroleum ether. 24. Put the vials in ice. Apply “Hot Needle Solvent Flushing Method” to inject sample into the GC. Wash 10 µL GC syringe with petroleum ether, take 2 µL pet ether, pull the needle a lot bit more in the air to make a small <b>air</b> <b>plug</b> in the syringe, then take exactly 3 µL sample final solution into the syringe (try to avoid contacting the vial with bare hands), measure the amount exactly, wipe the syringe needle with tissue paper, pull again to take some air into the syringe to avoid evaporation of the solution. Push the syringe needle into the GC inlet. Count 9 (3 seconds) to make the needle hot. Inject the sample as fast as you can. Pull the syringe out quickly. Push the “Start” button on the GC panel. 25. For the purpose of quality control, inject external STD first, then inject samples, finally inject external STD again to check if the GC is stable. Inject one ESTD for every 10 samples. 26. After injection, wash the 10 µL GC syringe with D. I. water, then acetone. Detailed information regarding the Gas Chromatography Method can be found in the following Word Document.

40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} ponded {{infiltration}} tests in quasi-saturated soils (containing entrapped air) exhibit the same three-stage temporal variability for the flow rate and hydraulic conductivity. However, the {{values for the}} hydraulic conductivity may differ {{by as much as}} two orders of magnitude due to differences in the geometry and physics of flow when different laboratory and field methods are applied. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate this variability using a comparison of results of ponded infiltration tests conducted under laboratory conditions using confined cores, with results of field tests conducted using partially isolated cores and double-ring infiltrometers. Under laboratory conditions in confined cores, during the firs stage, the water flux decreases over time because entrapped <b>air</b> <b>plugs</b> the largest pores in the soils; during the second stage, the quasi-saturated hydraulic conductivity increases by one to two orders of magnitude, essentially reaching the saturated hydraulic conductivity, when entrapped air is discharged from the soils; during the third stage, the hydraulic conductivity decreases to minimum values due to sealing of the soil surface and the effect of biofilms sealing the pores within the wetted zone. Under field conditions, the second stage is only partially developed, and when the surface sealing process begins, the hydraulic pressure drops below the air entry value, thereby causing atmospheric air to enter the soils. As a result, the soils become unsaturated with a low hydraulic conductivity, and the infiltration rate consequently decreases. Contrary to the laboratory experiments in confined cores, the saturated hydraulic conductivity cannot be reached under field conditions. In computations of infiltration one has to take into account the variations in the quasi-saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities, moisture and entrapped air content, and the hydraulic gradient in the quasi-saturated or unsaturated soils...|$|R

50|$|This plant {{manufactured}} spark <b>plugs,</b> <b>air,</b> oil {{and fuel}} filters, instrument clusters and other parts. It opened around the mid-1920s {{in the former}} Dort (automobile) plant. The Dort Highway plant became known as Flint East when AC took over the old Chevrolet manufacturing operations on Chevrolet Avenue in 1987. In 1988 AC Spark Plug merged with GM's Rochester Products Division, and was renamed AC Rochester. World headquarters remained in Flint, soon moving to the Great Lakes Technology Center. In the late 1980s, parts of Flint East were turned over to GM's Delco Electronics. In 1994, AC Rochester merged with Delco Remy and became the short-lived AC Delco Systems.|$|R

40|$|A heat-transfer design {{analysis}} {{has been made}} of an air-cooled plug-nozzle system for a supersonic-cruise aircraft engine. The proposed 10 deg half-angle conical plug is sting supported from the turbine frame. Plug cooling is accomplished by convection and film cooling. The flight profile studied includes maximum afterburning from takeoff to Mach 2. 7 and supersonic cruise at Mach 2. 7 with a low afterburner setting. The calculations indicate that, for maximum afterburning, about 2 percent of the engine primary flow, removed after the second stage of the nine-stage compressor, will adequately cool the plug and sting support. Ram air may be used for cooling during supersonic-cruise operations, however. Therefore, the cycle efficiency penalty paid for <b>air</b> cooling the <b>plug</b> and sting support should be low...|$|R
40|$|Sulfuric acid {{is present}} in most coal flue gases because a {{percentage}} of the SO 2 produced (typically 0. 5 to 1. 5 %) is further oxidized in the boiler to SO 3, which combines with flue gas moisture to form vapor-phase or condensed sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid in the flue gas can potentially lead to <b>air</b> heater corrosion, <b>plugging</b> and fouling; duct corrosion; and a visible plume. These effects are exacerbated if selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is retrofitted for NOX control, as SCR catalysts further oxidize a portion of the flue gas SO 2 to SO 3. This project tested the effectiveness of alkaline reagents injected into the furnace of coal-fired boilers for controlling sulfuric acid emissions. The project was co-funded by the U. S...|$|R
40|$|Having {{established}} that cut flowers last longer by adding such solutions as sugars, bactericides or acids to the vase water, their {{mechanism of action}} was investigated. Bacteria and fungi had a direct plugging effect, but also acted indirectly on the water conduction of the flower stalk by secreting toxins. A third kind of plugging occurred independent of micro-organisms {{as a reaction to}} wounding and intrusion of <b>air.</b> This <b>plugging</b> could be limited by reducing 02 concentration, lowering the pH and by adding Ca(N 0 3) 2. The addition of sugar prevented disintegration of cells through lack of respiratory substrate. In times of higher respiratory activity of the flower parts, the optimum sugar concentration needed in the water increased. Attempts to decrease respiratory activity of the flower by adding respiratory inhibitors failed. Only in Matthiola could the respiratory activity be decreased by gibberellic acid; {{at the same time the}} flowers lasted longer. Boron had a favourable effect in Convallaria, Dianthus, Lathyrus and Syringa. Its addition decreased the optimum sugar concentration. In Dianthus it acted on the distribution of dry matter within the flower during development. The possibilities were discussed of practical application of chemicals to make cut flowers last longer. <p/...|$|R
5000|$|These are bolt-action [...] "sniper" [...] rifles. Before each shot is fired, {{the shooter}} has {{to pull the}} bolt, cock the piston and load a BB into the chamber. All three {{versions}} of the VSR-10 share the same stock, same internals and same air chamber. The Pro-sniper version has a black stock, 430 mm long inner barrel and is the most accurate of the three versions. The Real Shock version has a metal weight in the piston to simulate recoil. Real Shock has a simulated wooden stock and the same 430 mm long inner barrel. However, due to the vibration caused by the heavier piston's impact, Real Shock is the least accurate of the three, albeit only by less than an inch difference at 20 m distance. G-spec is shortened version with a silencer attached. Inner barrel is 303 mm long, but has a slightly tighter bore. Due to short inner barrel its accuracy is close to Real Shock, but a couple mm more accurate. A needle-like contraption called air brake protrudes from the piston. The <b>air</b> brake <b>plugs</b> the cylinder before piston impacts, trapping {{a small amount of}} air between the piston and cylinder. This reduces impact vibration and adds to VSR series' unique accuracy.|$|R
40|$|An {{elongated}} hollow string {{is disposed}} in an exhaust nozzle combustion chamber and communicates {{with an air}} source through hollow struts at one end. The {{other end of the}} string is bell-mouth shaped and extends over the front portion of a nozzle plug. The bell-mouth may be formed by pivotally mounted flaps or leaves which are used to vary the exhaust throat area and the area between the plug and the leaves. Air from the engine inlet flows into the string and also between the combustion chamber and a housing disposed around the chamber. The <b>air</b> cools the <b>plug</b> and serves as a low velocity inner core of secondary gas to provide noise reduction for the primary exhaust gas while the other air, when it exits from the nozzle, forms an outer low velocity layer to further reduce noise.

40|$|Air blast, {{a sudden}} mass {{movement}} of air, {{can occur in}} underground mining system where caving develops an extensive mass of unsupported rock spanning a large void. Air blast can result in injury to mine personnel, damage to equipment or disrupts mine operation. Evaluation of air blast parameters is, therefore, an essential part to develop strategies to mitigate the hazard. The properties of a muckpile or a caved zone are significant factors affecting the magnitude of air blast in particular on the undercut and extraction levels. This research investigates the effect of muckpile properties on air flow using the numerical code, PFC 2 D. The critical parameters such as thickness, block size and porosity (swell factor) of the muckpile have been studied to quantify how much they could change the magnitude of air pressures and velocities while the air flows through the muckpile. It {{was found that the}} porosity of the muckpile is the most effective parameter on the magnitude of air blast and by designing a thick layer of blasted rock with low porosity in the caved zone, the intensity of the air blast can be significantly reduced. The findings of this study can be used to design <b>air</b> blast <b>plugs</b> or bulkheads in order to isolate any potential air blast from the active workings, or to quantify the minimum thickness of the muckpile above extraction levels to manage air blast hazards...|$|R

40|$|The airway {{epithelium}} {{is known}} to play an integral role in the airway defense via the mucociliary system and mechanical barriers. The airway epithelial cells can be activated to produce and release biological mediators important in the pathogenesis of multiple airway disorders. And {{it is known that}} the epithelium is fundamentally disordered in chronic airway disorders such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and cystic fibrosis. One of the hallmarks of these airway disorders is the over-production of mucus by airway epithelial cells, and disruption of physiologic mucociliary clearance by the over-production of mucus can lead to mucus <b>plugging,</b> <b>air</b> trapping, and atelectasis which is often complicated by infection. The major macromolecular components of mucus are the large glycoproteins known as mucins. Currently, 20 MUC genes have been identified and their encoded glycoproteins classified as gel-forming, secreted, or cell-associated mucins. The representative mucins are MUC 1 and MUC 5 AC as cell-associated and gel-forming mucin, respectively. In this study, I focused on these 2 mucin genes and clarified the regulation mechanisms.
