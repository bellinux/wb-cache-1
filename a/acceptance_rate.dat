Columbia is a racially diverse school, with approximately 52% of all students identifying themselves as persons of color. Additionally, 50% of all undergraduates received grants from Columbia. The average grant size awarded to these students is $46,516. In 2015–2016, annual undergraduate tuition at Columbia was $50,526 with a total cost of attendance of $65,860 (including room and board).|$|E

30|$|As {{noted in}} Section 1, {{there are many}} studies on {{increasing}} LSP <b>acceptance</b> <b>rates</b> by minimizing interference between LSPs. In addition, these studies also {{address the problem of}} establishing LSPs that satisfy one or more QoS constraints. Critically, the majority of these studies do not aim to conserve energy. In [48], Hong et al. propose Multiple Constraint-based Shortest Path First (MCSPF), which is based on the widely used Constraint Shortest Path First (CSPF) [49] algorithm. MCSPF aims to select LSPs that satisfy bandwidth and end-to-end delay constraints while maximizing LSP <b>acceptance</b> <b>rates.</b> In [50], the authors present a modification to the Wang-Crowcroft (WC) algorithm [51] in an effort to increase LSP <b>acceptance</b> <b>rates</b> by taking into account the order of arriving LSP requests.

30|$|This paper investigates whether popular {{initiatives}} {{signed by}} {{a larger share}} of the population have higher <b>acceptance</b> <b>rates</b> at the subsequent vote. The main analysis is based on all Swiss federal initiatives voted between 1978 and 2000 with a panel of aggregate voting data at cantonal level. The results suggest that petition signing is positively and significantly related to <b>acceptance</b> <b>rates</b> at ballot. I address potential omitted variable bias from underlying preferences which might be driving both signatures and <b>acceptance</b> <b>rates</b> in three ways. First, the panel structure of the data allows to control for time-constant preferences via fixed effects. Second, results are robust to various proxies for voter preferences. Third, using the doubling of the signature requirement in 1978 as an instrumental variable confirms the above result. The findings imply that petition signing can serve as an effective partisan campaigning tool.|$|R
