25|$|The <b>aurora</b> <b>trout,</b> S. f. timagamiensis, is a {{subspecies}} {{native to}} two lakes in the Temagami District of Ontario, Canada. The silver trout, (Salvelinus agassizii or S. f. agassizii), is an extinct trout species or subspecies last seen in Dublin Pond, New Hampshire, in 1930. It {{is considered by}} fisheries biologist Robert J. Behnke as a highly specialized form of brook trout.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to chemical pollution and algae growth caused by runoff containing chemicals and fertilizers, air pollution {{has also been}} a significant factor in the disappearance of brook trout from their native habitats. [...] In the U.S., acid rain caused by air pollution has resulted in pH levels too low to sustain brook trout in all but the highest headwaters of some Appalachian streams and creeks. Brook trout populations across large parts of eastern Canada have been similarly challenged; a subspecies known as the <b>aurora</b> <b>trout</b> was extirpated from the wild by the effects of acid rain. [...] Today, {{in many parts of the}} range, efforts are underway to restore brook trout to those waters that once held native populations, stocking other trout species only in habitats that can no longer be recovered sufficiently to sustain brook trout populations.|$|E
50|$|Naturalised {{populations of}} <b>aurora</b> <b>trout</b> have been {{introduced}} into about a dozen lakes in northeastern Ontario as refugia. In the late 1980s, the original lakes were treated with lime to raise the pH to circumneutral conditions, and <b>aurora</b> <b>trout</b> were reintroduced. Natural reproduction of <b>aurora</b> <b>trout</b> has been documented in the original lakes since the reintroduction, but the pH in the lakes has since begun to decline again, presumably because of reservoirs of acidic particulate depositions in the watershed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>aurora</b> <b>trout</b> is {{distinguished}} from the brook trout by its unique coloration. <b>Aurora</b> <b>trout</b> are generally without spots, the colouration grading from a magenta hue on the back to a bright, nearly fluorescent orange along the belly, especially in mature males. The life history of the fish is essentially identical {{to that of the}} brook trout. Adults average about 0.5 to 1.5 kg, although individuals up to 4 kg are known.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} species, {{and even more}} populations, that are {{isolated}} {{from each other and}} morphologically different. However, since many of these distinct populations show no significant genetic differences, what may appear to be a large number of species is considered a much smaller number of distinct species by most ichthyologists. The trout found in the eastern United States are a good example of this. The brook trout, the <b>aurora</b> <b>trout,</b> and the (extinct) silver trout all have physical characteristics and colorations that distinguish them, yet genetic analysis shows that they are one species, Salvelinus fontinalis.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>aurora</b> <b>trout</b> {{occupied}} a very restricted range, probably occurring {{in only two}} lakes, Whitepine and Whirligig, and their inflowing streams. The subspecies was extirpated from the original lakes by the ravages of acid rain in the late 1950s, but was saved from extinction by Paul Graf, a hatchery manager at the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. He had brought a brood stock of the fish into the hatchery at Hill's Lake near Charlton, Ontario. He sometimes feared the fish might have been taking up valuable space in the hatchery and, on several occasions, thought about getting rid of them, until they {{were found to have}} been extirpated from the wild.|$|E

50|$|The <b>aurora</b> <b>trout,</b> Salvelinus fontinalis timagamiensis, is {{a variant}} or {{subspecies}} of the brook trout native to two lakes in the Temagami District of Ontario, Canada. The {{existence of the}} fish {{was brought to the}} attention of the angling world by four American anglers who were taken by Archie King of Latchford, Ontario, into Ontario's Lady Evelyn River system in 1923. Recognising the fish as different or unique, the anglers took a specimen back to the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh, in the United States, where Dr. Arthur W. Henn was asked to identify the fish. He wrote about the fish in 1925 wherein he and Rinckenbach identified it as a distinct species, Salvelinus timagamiensis, but since a seminal re-examination of the material by Sale in 1967, taxonomists now agree the fish is, in a fact, at most a subspecies of the brook trout, named Salvelinus fontinalis timagamiensis. Genetic data have not so far supported its taxonomic distinction.|$|E
