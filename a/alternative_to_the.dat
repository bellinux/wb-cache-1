40|$|<b>The</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public {{criminal}} prosecution {{have changed the}} criminal laws. Contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional way of settling the disputes which puts emphasis on analyzing the committed crimes, the most significant factor in <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public prosecution is the conditions, in which the crime happens. The present research seeks <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> problems and challenges {{in the way of}} developing and increasing <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{criminal prosecution}} by taking the England’s laws into consideration. <b>The</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal prosecution are an intermediate approach that are substituted for criminal prosecution and filing the criminal record away unconditionally. In this way, the aim of the punishments is achieved without imposing <b>the</b> punishment. <b>The</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal prosecutions are based on the ideological, criminological and practical principles. There are many similar cases of imposing <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal prosecutions on the defendants in Islamic teachings. But <b>the</b> <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal prosecutions have not properly developed in Iran. Their development faces with many theoretical and practical challenges. According the investigations, we can define the theoretical challenges faced with <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criminal prosecutions as the series of the factors and reasons that impede the development of this idea and runs it into the problem. In other words, lack of intention and will <b>to</b> apply these <b>alternatives...</b>|$|R

5|$|A lighter <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> turret, {{particularly}} {{popular with the}} French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to plunging fire, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and {{with the addition of}} an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.|$|E

5|$|As an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{time-consuming}} task {{of creating}} a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the walkways behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook {{the interior of a}} castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the launch}} of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega {{announced}} the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade board, which served as a cheaper <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sega Model 3. NAOMI shared the same technology as the Dreamcast—albeit with twice as much system, video, and audio memory and an 160 Mbyte flash ROM board in place of a GD-ROM drive—allowing nearly identical home conversions of arcade games. Games were ported from NAOMI to the Dreamcast by several leading Japanese arcade companies, including Capcom (Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Project Justice), Tecmo (Dead or Alive 2), Treasure (Ikaruga), and Sega itself (F355 Challenge and Crazy Taxi).|$|E

5|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical front-wheel steering and those with strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard hydrogen electrode {{in addition to being a}} secondary reference electrode.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Harvard, Whitehead {{produced}} his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote Science and the Modern World, which was immediately hailed as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cartesian dualism that plagued popular science. Lectures from 1927–28, were published in 1929 as a book named Process and Reality, which has been compared (both in importance and difficulty) to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.|$|E

In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{the first}} {{proposal}} was launched {{for using a}} bus service as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> train. This was rejected because buses {{were not able to}} give the comfort and reliability of a train. The idea was proposed again in 1922 by the director of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Among the strongest opponents to the bus alternative was Ingolf Elster Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who stated that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid part of the regional financing of the Bergen Line on condition that they receive a branch line to the Sognefjord.|$|E
