25|$|Although the {{suggestion}} is often made, Krøyer denies having {{been inspired by}} this Barks story. Some sources claim Krøyer was denied a Dutch patent registration (<b>application</b> <b>number</b> NL 6514306) for his invention {{on the grounds that}} the Barks story was a prior publication of the invention. However no definite proof of this story is available. Krøyer later successfully raised another ship off Greenland using the same method, and several other sunken vessels worldwide have since been raised by modified versions of this concept. The television show MythBusters also tested this method and was able to raise a small boat.|$|E
500|$|Deutsche Gold- und Silber-Scheideanstalt (German Gold and Silver Refinery; Degussa) became sole {{owners of}} Degesch in 1922. There, {{beginning}} in 1922, , Bruno Tesch, and others worked on packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters {{along with a}} cautionary eye irritant and adsorbent stabilizers such as diatomaceous earth. The new product was also labelled as Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Heerdt was named the inventor of Zyklon B in the Degesch patent <b>application</b> (<b>number</b> DE 438818) dated 20 June 1922. The German Patent Office awarded the patent on 27 December 1926. Beginning in the 1920s, Zyklon B was used at U.S. Customs facilities along the Mexican border to disinfect the clothing of [...] border crossers.|$|E

60|$|This was {{the result}} of <b>application</b> <b>number</b> one: and we may imagine that Mr. Harry read the reply to his {{petition}} with rather a blank face. Never mind! There was kind, jolly Uncle Warrington. Only last night his aunt had kissed him and loved him like a son. His uncle had called down blessings on his head, and professed quite a paternal regard for him. With a feeling of shyness and modesty in presence of those virtuous parents and family. Harry had never said a word about his wild doings, or his horse-racings, or his gamblings, or his extravagances. It must all out now. He must confess himself a Prodigal and a Sinner, and ask for their forgiveness and aid. So Prodigal sate down and composed a penitent letter to Uncle Warrington, and exposed his sad case, and besought him to come to the rescue. Was not that a bitter nut to crack for our haughty young Virginian? Hours of mortification and profound thought as to the pathos of the composition did Harry pass over that letter; sheet after sheet of Mr. Amos's sixpence-a-sheet letter-paper did he tear up before the missive was complete, with which poor blubbering Gumbo (much vilified by the bailiff's followers and parasites, whom he was robbing, as they conceived, of their perquisites) went his way.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between fees charged by MBA programmes and the <b>number</b> of <b>applications</b> to these programmes, using a panel dataset comprising universities from countries across the world. Using Three-Stage-Least-Squares methods for simultaneous equations, we find a two-way relationship between fees and applications: higher <b>application</b> <b>numbers</b> encourage universities to charge higher fees in the future, but higher fees in turn curtail <b>application</b> <b>numbers.</b> Of particular note are the results pertaining to additional explanatory variables that potentially represent MBA programme quality signals to applicants. We find evidence that higher GMAT scores of existing students increase applications, as do higher post MBA salaries. Meanwhile, university and programme professional accreditations do not impact on student application choices, nor do alumni ratings of programme quality. Published MBA programme rankings appear to have little impact on applications, and where an effect can be identified, it appears that a better ranking discourages applications...|$|R
