5|$|Blake {{decided to}} compose his score {{to match the}} key of the Schubert Mass, {{in order for the}} music to {{continue}} seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key.|$|E
5|$|Brian Eaton {{was born}} in Launceston, Tasmania, on 15December 1916, to Sydney and Hilda Eaton. The family later moved to Canterbury, Victoria, and Brian was educated at Carey Grammar. His early {{ambition}} {{to be a doctor}} was curtailed when his father died <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave school early. He enlisted as an air cadet in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 20January 1936, undergoing flying training at RAAF Station Point Cook.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Uman (15 July – 8 August 1941) Strachwitz {{received}} {{a head injury}} on 29 July and was hit again by shrapnel in the arm the next day. He received first aid {{in the field and}} stayed with his men. The injured arm became infected <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> receive medical attention in a field hospital on 10 August. He released himself again on 12 August returning to the regiment which had been led by Oberleutnant von Kleist during his absence.|$|E

50|$|Costner:To me, it's like {{picking a}} {{football}} team. The story made sense, {{to play the}} game made sense, and it was obvious that I should play quarterback or end. I mean, Cochran is a role that I should play... The movie needed Anthony Quinn more than it needed me. I mean, there are probably five or six guys who could play Cochran's role, but who else is there who could play the role of Tibbey? The Tiburon character <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be really charming and Anthony has that in spades. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> danger <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> presence. Anthony <b>has</b> that because <b>he's</b> been a leading man all his life. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be that age.|$|R
5|$|He has {{represented}} England at the under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-20 levels. In 2006, he scored {{what was then}} the fastest goal by a substitute in Premier League history, scoring after being on the pitch for 15 seconds. With an Indian father, he was also the first player of Indian parentage to play and score in the Premier League. A gambling addiction made him fall in severe debt <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> seek professional help to overcome his addiction.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 {{he began}} to {{experience}} hip and leg problems; one of his legs had shortened {{an inch and a}} half <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> learn to walk again. Although he remained otherwise in good health this was a sign of his increasing age, and the disabilities that came with it began to affect his judgments as well. While speaking at Cumberland Lodge in 1980 he forgot the details of the case, something shocking for a judge noted for his excellent memory.|$|E
5|$|In the Tour de France, Cancellara came {{in third}} of stage one's {{individual}} time trial. On the second stage, he was donned the yellow jersey {{thanks to a}} third place, which gave him four bonus seconds. He {{was involved in a}} mass pile-up on the third stage, and finished the race slowly. After a visit to the hospital, it was revealed that he had suffered two transverse process fractures in two vertebrae in his lower back <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> abandon.|$|E

5|$|The Count of Artois did {{not join}} the court-in-exile in Hartwell, preferring to {{continue}} his frivolous life in London. Louis's friend the Count of Avaray left Hartwell for Madeira in 1809, and died there in 1811. Louis replaced Avaray with the Comte de Blacas as his principal political advisor. Queen Marie Joséphine died on 13 November 1810. That same winter, Louis suffered a particularly severe case of gout, which was a recurring problem for him at Hartwell, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{be put in a}} wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{called a}} church council at London in June 1160, which dealt partly {{with the issues}} of the papal schism; his health was poor <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be taken to the council in a litter. A further cause of {{distress}} to Theobald was what he saw as the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Within days, the blacksmith, postman, and laundress were persuaded or {{volunteered to}} stop serving Boycott. Boycott's young nephew volunteered {{to act as}} postman, but he was intercepted en route between Ballinrobe and Lough Mask, and told {{that he would be}} in danger if he continued. Soon, shopkeepers in Ballinrobe stopped serving Boycott, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> bring food and other {{provisions}} by boat from Cong.|$|E

5|$|Although Chaplin {{still had}} plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s {{he was very}} frail. He {{experienced}} several further strokes, which {{made it difficult for}} him to communicate, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|Born April 22, 1994 in York, Maine, Robinson {{is the son}} of the Elisabeth and Jeffrey Robinson and the {{youngest}} of their three children (after sister Marta and brother Eli). Jeffrey, who is , had played one season for the Maine Black Bears men's basketball team. Robinson grew up on the remote New Hampshire island of New Castle where his Maude H. Trefethen Elementary School 6th grade graduating class was composed of four students <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave the island to continue his education. He attended Rye Junior High School and elected to attend The Governor's Academy rather than Portsmouth High School, which was the public high school for students in New Castle. Without Robinson, Portsmouth still reached four consecutive New Hampshire Interscholastic Athletic Association final fours and won the 2012 state championship.|$|E
5|$|By lap 20, Sebastian Vettel {{was closing}} the gap to the two Red Bulls ahead of him, coming within three second of Verstappen. On lap 22, Nico Hülkenberg retired when his power unit caught fire <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stop on the sidelines. While Massa had fought from 18th on the grid into tenth, his {{teammate}} Bottas was lying fifth by lap 25, ahead of Sainz. On lap 28, Ricciardo was again {{the first of the}} front runners to pit, taking on the soft compound. Vettel came in two laps later, making the same choice in tyres. This left Verstappen to lead Kimi Räikkönen, as it emerged that both would run on a different strategy, pitting only twice in contrast to the three stopping Vettel and Ricciardo. On lap 34, the gap between the two leaders was 2.1 seconds, before Verstappen came in on the following lap. Räikkönen responded one lap later, emerging behind Verstappen. On lap 39, Vettel came in for his third and final stop, while Ricciardo stayed out for another four laps. When he returned to the track, he was behind Vettel, but on fresher tyres.|$|E

5|$|Depp {{collaborated with}} costume {{designer}} Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, {{the other characters}} did not wear leather hats. A rubber version {{was used for the}} scene in Dead Man's Chest when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed frock coat throughout the series, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line is that none of the costumes from The Curse of the Black Pearl survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England. It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to silkscreen it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.|$|E
5|$|Despite its ferocity, {{the fire}} was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often {{overshot}} the infantry front lines—in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation—and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly {{to create the illusion}} that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery—the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, {{the castle}} was armed with nine 36-pounder guns, {{supported}} by further artillery batteries placed along the beach. To protect Deal, units of infantry and cavalry, called fencibles, were formed in 1794 by William Pitt the Younger– then both the Prime Minister and the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports– and in 1802 units of bombardiers recruited by Pitt carried out military exercises at the castle. The politician and banker Lord Carrington carried out {{improvements to the}} castle in 1802, apparently as a rival project to his friend Pitt's work at Walmer. According to Samuel Wilberforce, Carrington had hoped to charge {{the cost of the}} work to the Treasury, but when he attempted to submit the claims, they were rejected by Pitt <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay for the improvements himself.|$|E

5|$|During {{the middle}} of the run-chase, Priest was {{incorrectly}} given out stumped by Healy after the television umpire Asad Rauf had pressed the wrong button, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> retract his decision. Soon after New Zealand were at 5/36 after 11 overs, leaving them with 71 runs to score from the last 54 balls, and Australia were in the ascendancy. However, New Zealand's chances were revived by Nicola Browne and Sophie Devine, who put on 41 from as many balls. In the 18th over, Healy caught Browne from Perry's bowling, and Australia went on to win by three runs after New Zealand ended on 6/103.|$|E
5|$|Goble was {{promoted}} twice in 1917, to flight commander in June, then squadron commander in December. He led No. 5 Squadron {{for the latter}} part of the year and into 1918. His unit supported the British Fifth Army as it bore the brunt of the German Spring Offensive, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> evacuate his airfield when it was shelled by advancing enemy artillery. Relocating twice to other landing grounds, he kept his squadron on the attack, and was subsequently recognised by a commendation circulated to all RNAS combat units. When the RNAS merged with the British Army's Royal Flying Corps on 1 April 1918, Goble became a major in the newly formed Royal Air Force. Twice mentioned in despatches, he finished the war an ace, with ten victories. Although himself forced to crash land on two occasions, he had avoided any injury during his active service.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to become}} a schoolteacher, Kimball spent one {{semester}} at the University of Arizona {{in the spring of}} 1917, but he received an army draft notice later that year. During that time, he courted Camilla Eyring (18941987), a schoolteacher at Gila Academy (modern Eastern Arizona College), where Kimball had attended high school. They began dating in August 1917 and exchanged letters regularly after Kimball left for a semester at Brigham Young University (BYU) the next month. After one month at BYU, Kimball was notified that his call into the army was imminent, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave the university and return to his hometown. He returned to Arizona, but his army group was never called up for duty before World War I, ended with the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918.|$|E
