5|$|Guevara grows {{sick and}} by Day 280 can barely breathe {{as a result}} of his <b>acute</b> <b>asthma.</b> Nevertheless, he {{continues}} to lead his group towards the other column of revolutionaries. On Day 302, the Bolivian Army wipes out the other column, killing Tania Bunke, Juan Acuña Ñunez, and several others in an ambush as they attempt to cross the Vado del Yeso after a local informant tells the Bolivian troops about the movements of the rebels. By Day 340, Guevara is trapped by the Bolivian Army in the Yuro Ravine near the village of La Higuera. Che is wounded and captured. The next day, a helicopter lands and Cuban American CIA agent Félix Rodríguez emerges to interrogate Che, but without success. The Bolivian high command then phones and orders Guevara's execution. He is shot on 9 October 1967, and his corpse lashed to a helicopter's landing skids and flown out.|$|E

40|$|The {{incidence}} of anaphylaxis is under-reported. Children with asthma are frequently atopic {{and prone to}} allergic reactions.

Two cases of fatal anaphylaxis are reported who were initially diagnosed as <b>acute</b> severe <b>asthma,</b> and responded poorly to bronchodilator treatment. Survivors of "acute asphyxic asthma" should be screened for reactions to common allergens that provoke anaphylactic reactions.

Moreover, conventional aggressive management might be futile in <b>acute</b> severe <b>asthma</b> requiring intubation and invasive ventilation. The aim of this review is to detail evidence on the use of ketamine in childhood asthma exacerbations. A search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was performed, using different combinations of the following terms: ketamine, asthma, use, exacerbation, and childhood. In addition, we searched the references of the identified articles for additional articles. We then reviewed titles and included studies that were relevant to the topic of interest. Finally, the search was limited to studies published in English and Spanish from 1918 to June 2015. Due to the scarcity in the literature, we included all published articles. The literature reports conflicting results of ketamine use for <b>acute</b> severe <b>asthma</b> in children. Taking into consideration the relatively good safety profile of the drug, ketamine might be a reasonable option in the management of <b>acute</b> severe <b>asthma</b> in children who fail to respond to standard therapy. Furthermore, pediatricians and pediatric emergency clinicians administering ketamine should be knowledgeable about the unique actions of this drug and its potential side effects.
