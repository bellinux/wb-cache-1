5|$|Chester {{had planned}} to retire in June 2009, and the {{congregation}} embarked on {{a search for a}} new senior rabbi in 2008.

5|$|Crittenden {{supporters}} {{sought to}} make him the National Republican nominee for governor in the election of 1828.

5|$|In 1788, Hamilton served yet <b>another</b> <b>term</b> in what {{proved to}} be the last session of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation. When the term of Philip Schuyler was up in 1791, elected in his place was the {{attorney}} general of New York, one Aaron Burr. Hamilton blamed Burr for this result, and ill characterizations of Burr appear in his correspondence thereafter.

5|$|Instead of {{vying for}} <b>another</b> <b>term</b> in the State House, Coolidge {{returned}} home to his growing family and ran for mayor of Northampton when the incumbent Democrat retired. He was well liked in the town, and defeated his challenger {{by a vote of}} 1,597 to 1,409. During his first term (1910 to 1911), he increased teachers' salaries and retired some of the city's debt while still managing to effect a slight tax decrease.

5|$|Sanford's {{opponent}} in the 1992 election was Lauch Faircloth, a former Democrat turned Republican who had served as state Highway Commissioner in Sanford's gubernatorial administration. Enjoying substantial backing from Sanford's Senate colleague, Jesse Helms, Faircloth accused Sanford of being a tax-and-spend liberal bound to special interests. While initial polls showed that Sanford had a comfortable lead over his rival, he lost supporters after an operation for an infected heart valve kept him from campaigning for much of October and raised doubts {{as to whether he}} was capable of serving <b>another</b> <b>term.</b> On November 3, 1992, Faircloth won the election by a 100,000-vote margin.|$|E
