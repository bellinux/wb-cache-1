5|$|<b>A</b> <b>musical</b> {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound {{can be considered}} <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes <b>a</b> <b>musical</b> instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments {{may have been used}} for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
