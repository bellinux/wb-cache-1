5|$|Meyer {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} companion book to Twilight called Midnight Sun, {{which would be the}} story of Twilight told from Edward Cullen's point-of-view. She stated that Twilight was the only book that she planned to rewrite from Edward's perspective. However, a rough draft of Midnight Sun's first twelve chapters was leaked on the internet. Meyer has since put these twelve chapters on her website so that her fans could read them for free, but has put the project on hold indefinitely due to her feelings about the situation. She stated, If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely. Though she has no current plans to do so, Meyer has also stated that if she were to continue writing in the same universe she would write from the perspective of either Leah Clearwater or Bella and Edward's daughter, Renesmee Cullen.|$|E

25|$|Conflicted romantic {{infidelity}} {{takes place}} {{when a person}} both {{falls in love with}} and has a strong sexual desire for multiple people at one time, even though s/he may already be committed to a partner. In this circumstance the person feels s/he cannot tell his/her committed partner <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> but is nevertheless unable to resist the compulsion; this lack of open discussion is usually what separates conflicted romantic infidelity from things like a well-defined open relationship or polyamory.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the rest}} of Quer√©taro's notable sites are located in the {{historic}} center, which is pedestrian-friendly and filled with colonial architecture. The local government maintains this area well, with cleaning crews to keep the streets clean and regulating vendors so that they do not block streets and sidewalks. In the evening, the area fills with people strolling the plazas and walkways and frequenting the area's restaurants, cafes and food stands. One way to see this part of town is the Noche de Leyendas (Night of Legends), which is a hybrid between interactive theater and a recounting of history. A group of actors guide visitors through the streets of the city narrating stories <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in these places. This event begins at the main plaza, the Plaza de Armas {{in the center of the}} city with a reenactment of the legend of Carambada. Then the show wanders the street all the while telling tales related to bandits, loves and myths. These tales demand audience participation providing lines and provoking debate.|$|E

When Dale finds the room, the man flees, leaving her and the money locked inside. The others find her there, unconscious. Anderson reappears and accuses Wells of {{stealing}} the money and killing Richard. Cornelia begins to present an alternative theory, but is interrupted when the unknown man comes upstairs and Anderson asks him about his amnesia. Cornelia says that she sees a man on the roof, and most of the group leaves to look for him. Cornelia uses the distraction to tell Dale, Jack and the unknown man that she thinks the money is still in the room. When they search for the money, Jack finds the body of Courtleigh Fleming, who was killed only recently. As Cornelia, Dale and Jack argue <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> the unknown man locks the door and orders them to be quiet. When the masked man sneaks in through a window, the unknown man apprehends him and reveals that he, the unknown man, is the real Detective Anderson; the Bat (the masked man) had pretended to be Anderson.|$|E

500|$|In October, {{two former}} first ministers voiced their {{concern about the}} {{direction}} of the party. Jack McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader, and described Labour as [...] "a political machine that is angry <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in Scotland in the recent past". Shortly afterwards, his predecessor, Henry McLeish suggested Labour had ceded [...] "enormous ground to the SNP unnecessarily" [...] because its supporters no longer understood [...] "what the party stands for". Margaret Curran, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, said that although the party was changing, it needed to reconnect with its [...] "socialist principles". Lamont's deputy, Anas Sarwar, later suggested that during the referendum campaign, Labour [...] "had stopped being a movement for change and fell into a trap of being defenders of the past and defenders of the establishment". The New Statesman claimed that Labour had spent [...] "decades treating Scotland {{as little more than a}} one-party state" [...] and needed to [...] " [...] itself [...] relevant again for the people whom it was established to represent". Stephen Daisley, political editor of STV News, suggested that Labour had [...] "responded to the Nationalist advance by electing a succession of decent but ineffectual Holyrood leaders who were dominated by the Westminster party machine".|$|E
500|$|Scotland voted by a 10% margin against independence, but the {{referendum}} returned [...] "Yes" [...] votes in some traditional Labour strongholds, particularly Glasgow and North Lanarkshire, prompting media speculation about Lamont's future as the party's leader. Shortly after {{the referendum}}, a Daily Mail article claimed that Shadow International Development Secretary Jim Murphy was being {{lined up to}} take over from her, while The Herald reported that party delegates concerned about the results had started to view Murphy as a possible successor. Lamont had attempted to quash rumours of a leadership challenge at the 25 September 2014 session of First Minister's Questions, {{the first of the}} post-referendum era. [...] "When the First Minister is long gone I will still be doing my job on behalf of the people of Scotland." [...] Her position remained uncertain. Alan Cochrane wrote that many Labour MPs in Scotland feared losing their seats at the 2015 general election without a change of leadership. In October, two former first ministers voiced their concern about the direction of the party. McConnell expressed fears that Labour would experience increased difficulty in regaining the confidence of Scottish voters following the election of Sturgeon as SNP leader, and described the party as [...] "a political machine that is angry <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in Scotland in the recent past".

2500|$|At a New Year's Eve party, Mercy kisses Fatboy to put Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) off {{flirting with}} him. [...] As the party continues, Fatboy cuts {{his finger and}} Kim starts to crawl along the bar {{offering}} to kiss him. Enraged by this, Mercy walks over and pushes Kim off the bar onto the floor below. She takes a liking to Seb Parker (Tommy Bastow), which leaves Fatboy jealous, and later he accuses them of having sex, to which Mercy does not reply. She then reveals she may face deportation as she only has a Nigerian passport and her visa has expired but she {{has lived in the}} United Kingdom since the age of nine. When Fatboy mentions this to his father Ashley Chubb (Colin Mace), Ashley reports Mercy to the UK Border Agency. Seb ends his relationship with Mercy, and then she is approached by Daniel Mansard (Richard Galazka) from the Agency, saying she is four months past her permit. She decides to leave the country before she has been asked to and says an emotional goodbye to Fatboy, but as he sees her saying goodbye to Grace and leaving in a taxi, he stops the car and asks Mercy to marry him. Mercy agrees in the hope she will stay in the country. Mercy confides in her friend Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) that the wedding is a sham. She later says she is worried about going to court as she feels she is being treated like a criminal. On the morning of the wedding, Mercy feels guilty when everyone comments on how much she loves Fatboy. She tells Lauren that she wants to do the right thing, {{and there will be no}} wedding. However, they do marry, and Mercy soon learns that she is able to stay in the country.

However, he finds out and tries to stop her. They say an emotional farewell before she leaves in a black cab. Mercy's sister Faith (Modupe Adeyeye) later arrives in Walford to tell Fatboy that Mercy has had the marriage annulled.|$|E
