25|$|The usual {{waveform}} of {{alternating current}} in most electric power circuits is a sine wave. In certain applications, different waveforms are used, such as triangular or square waves. Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. These types of alternating current carry information encoded (or modulated) onto the <b>AC</b> <b>signal,</b> such as sound (audio) or images (video).

A power plane is the counterpart to a ground plane and behaves as an <b>AC</b> <b>signal</b> ground while providing DC power to the circuits mounted on the PCB.

The capacitor allows the <b>AC</b> <b>signal</b> to pass, but blocks the DC bias voltage established by resistors R1 and R2 so that any preceding circuit is not affected by it. Q1 and Q2 form a differential amplifier (an amplifier that multiplies the difference between two inputs by some constant), in an arrangement known as a long-tailed pair. This arrangement is used to conveniently allow the use of negative feedback, which is fed from the output to Q2 via R7 and R8.|$|E

The motor speed switching uses a separate <b>AC</b> <b>signal,</b> rather than the DC voltage control of the 122. In operation, the noticeable differences between the 122 and the 147 are the 122's lower susceptibility to induced noise, and a delay between operation of the speed control and the actual change in speed. As with the 122 and 142, the 145 {{is identical to the}} 147, except that it is housed in a [...] cabinet, and thus slightly easier to move. As with the 122, Hammond-Suzuki manufactures a modern replacement, the 147A. The model X-77, released in 1968, was designed to accompany Hammond's new tonewheel / transistor organ, the X-66.

2500|$|There are, however, {{components}} of electrical circuits {{which do not}} obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their I–V curve) is nonlinear (or non-ohmic). [...] An example is the p-n junction diode (curve at right). [...] As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode. [...] One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of [...] "resistance" [...] is not constant {{as a function of}} applied voltage. [...] Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative. [...] The ratio V/I for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the static, or chordal, or DC, resistance, but as seen in the figure the value of total V over total I varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen. [...] This means the [...] "DC resistance" [...] V/I at some point on the curve {{is not the same as}} what would be determined by applying an <b>AC</b> <b>signal</b> having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the <b>AC</b> <b>signal</b> applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the dynamic, small-signal, or incremental resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the derivative of current with respect to voltage). [...] For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Organophosphate {{developmental}} neurotoxicity involves multiple mechanisms converging on neural cell replication and differentiation. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated mechanisms {{contributing to the}} adverse effects of chlorpyrifos (CPF) on DNA synthesis, cell number and size, and cell signaling mediated by adenylyl cyclase (AC) in PC 12 cells, a neuronotypic cell line that recapitulates the essential features of developing mammalian neurons. RESULTS: In undifferentiated cells, cholinergic receptor antagonists {{had little or no}} protective effect against the antimitotic actions of CPF; however, when nerve growth factor was used to evoke differentiation, the antagonists showed partial protection against deficits in cell loss and alteration in cell size elicited by CPF, but were ineffective in preventing the deterioration of <b>AC</b> <b>signaling.</b> Nicotine, which stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors but also possesses a mixture of prooxidant/antioxidant activity, had adverse effects by itself but also protected undifferentiated cells from the actions of CPF and had mixed additive/protective effects on cell number in differentiating cells. The antioxidant vitamin E also protected both undifferentiated and differentiating cells from many of the adverse effects of CPF but worsened the impact on <b>AC</b> <b>signaling.</b> Theophylline, which prevents the breakdown of cyclic AMP, was the only agent that restored <b>AC</b> <b>signaling</b> to normal or supranormal levels but did so at further cost to cell replication. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show definitive contributions of cholinergic hyperstimulation, oxidative stress, and interference with <b>AC</b> <b>signaling</b> in the {{developmental neurotoxicity}} of CPF and point to the potential use of this information to design treatments to ameliorate these adverse effects...|$|R

This set-up uses a normal op-amp {{with an additional}} AC amplifier that goes alongside the op-amp. The chopper gets an <b>AC</b> <b>signal</b> from DC by switching between the DC voltage and ground at a fast rate (60Hz or 400Hz). This signal is then amplified, rectified, filtered and fed into the op-amp's non-inverting input. This vastly improved the gain of the op-amp while significantly reducing the output drift and DC offset. Unfortunately, any design that used a chopper couldn't use their non-inverting input for any other purpose. Nevertheless, the much improved characteristics of the chopper-stabilized op-amp made it the dominant way to use op-amps. Techniques that used the non-inverting input regularly would not be very popular until the 1960s when op-amp ICs started {{to show up in}} the field.|$|E
