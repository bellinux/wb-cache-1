40|$|ABSTRACT: Distribution of Fe in {{the fine}} {{fractions}} of four Czech bentonites was investigated by M 6 ssbauer spectroscopy. The spectra t room and liquid nitrogen temperatures revealed that most Fe present in the samples is structurally bound in smectite. Microcrystalline and/or Al-substituted goethite was identified in all fine fractions, comprising 8 to 50 % of total Fe. This mineral was partly magnetically ordered in the Rokle sample even at room temperature. Two per cent of total Fe was bound in hematite in the Kr~. sn~r Dvore~ek sample. Only octahedral Fe(IlI) {{was found in the}} Rokle and Stebno samples, while Kr~isn 2 ~ Dvore~ek and Hrozn 6 tfn contained 9 and 38 %, respectively, of the total Fe as octahedral Fe(II) and 14 % of total Fe was found as tetrahedral Fe(III) in Kr~isn 3) Dvore~ek. Several bentonite deposits are located in the Northwest part of the Czech Republic. The parent rocks are ultrabasic and basic ef fus ives and pyroclastics of basanite, olivinic basalt and tephrite types. Their <b>autohydrothermal</b> decomposition has led mainly to formation of Fe-bearing smectites, members of the beidellite-nontronite series (FranCe, 1983; Konta, 1986; Kraus & Kuf~vart, 1987; Cf 6 el et al., 1992 a). Fine fractions of bentonites are rarely mono-mineralic. Size fractionation increases the clay content {{in the fine}} fraction, but usually does not completely remove all admixtures. Some of the admixtures can be identified easily by X-ray diffraction (XRD), but those which are present in minor amounts and/or are amorphous or poorly-crystalline may escape detection. Typical examples are Fe oxides/hydroxides, frequently found in bentonites, nontronites or illites (e. g. Murad, 1987...|$|E
