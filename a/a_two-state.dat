5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought <b>a</b> <b>two-state</b> solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E

For the past few years, {{the idea of a}} “parallel states” structure has been discussed, suggesting a scenario with <b>a</b> <b>two-states</b> structure on the same land, both states covering the whole territory, both providing the freedom for their citizens – Israelis and Palestinians – to live between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River...|$|R

We review the effective low energy description of a single BEC ring. In particular, it is demonstrated that such system has a set of metastable current states which, for certain range of parameters, form <b>an</b> effective <b>two-state</b> system, or <b>a</b> qubit. We show how this qubit can be initialized and manipulated with currently available laser-trapping techniques. We also discuss mechanisms of coupling several such ring qubits as well as measuring individual qubit-ring systems...|$|R
