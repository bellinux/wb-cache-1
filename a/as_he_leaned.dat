5|$|The {{collapse}} left Barnett and captain Yardley {{as the new}} men at the crease. Both players {{attacked the}} bowling but could not get their shots through the field for runs. Soon after, Lindwall {{was forced to leave}} the field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again. Barnett hit one four before Johnston bowled him for eight off the inside edge <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> onto the front foot. This brought Evans to the crease with the score at 60/6, and he attempted to disrupt the Australians' line and length by counter-attacking with a series of shots in front of the wicket. He drove the ball forward of point to the boundary for four, and was then given two lives. He hit Johnston hard to cover, but the catch went through Bradman for another boundary. The second chance of a catch went through Bradman's hand and struck the Australian captain in the abdomen. However, the missed opportunities cost the tourists little; Evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at short leg by Morris. Without further addition to the score, Toshack trapped Yardley, who had lingered at the crease for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs, leg before wicket (lbw) with a ball that straightened after pitching, leaving the score at 74/8.|$|E
500|$|Batting {{out of the}} number-five spot in {{the batting}} order {{for the first time}} in his career on Opening Day, 2007, Molina {{collected}} two hits. [...] In a game against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 15, Molina picked Prince Fielder off first base <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> far off the bag, tipping off Molina and first baseman Albert Pujols to a hit and run the Brewers were planning. [...] Four days later, Molina faced his brother Bengie {{for the first time in}} a game against the San Francisco Giants. [...] It was also the first time they had seen each other in about three and one-half years.|$|E
2500|$|Wilkerson {{also agreed}} with the {{interviewer}} that Cheney's frequent trips to the CIA would have brought [...] "undue influence" [...] on the agency. [...] When asked if Cheney was [...] "the {{kind of guy who}} could lean on somebody" [...] he responded, [...] "Absolutely. And be just as quiet and taciturn about it as-- he-- <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> on 'em. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> on the Congress recently-- in the-- torture issue." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{video clip}} [...] "goes from a female student longing for her teacher to her taking direct action by kissing him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> over her in class." [...] The actor playing {{the part of}} the teacher was Magnus Härenstam.|$|R
5000|$|Later appraisals {{have been}} more favourable. Peter Sharkey in 2005 called it [...] "possibly the {{greatest}} dramatic portrayal of football ever seen on our screens", praising details like players arriving clutching cigarettes and the goalkeeper arguing with his girlfriend <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> against the posts, {{as well as the}} atmosphere of alcohol and bad pitches.|$|R

The campus hedges {{can be seen in}} the background, along with a parked car. Original {{resource}} is a black and white photograph. Beer Bike started in 1957...|$|R
2500|$|Jones made {{up another}} 15 {{minutes in the}} [...] stretch from Grenada to Winona, Mississippi. [...] The {{following}} [...] stretch (Winona to Durant, Mississippi) had no speed-restricted curves. By {{the time he got}} to Durant ( [...] into the run), Jones was almost on time. He was quite happy, saying at one point, [...] "Sim, the old girl's got her dancing slippers on tonight!" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> on the Johnson bar.|$|E

40|$|Drawing shows {{a deputy}} collector, or civil servant, smoking <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> {{on the back}} two legs of his chair, feet near a fireplace. Taylor {{traveled}} extensively in Europe between 1844 and his death in 1879. Original title: A deputy collector. See: DRWG/US - Taylor, no. 40 (A size). Gift; Charles F.

40|$|Two {{children}} {{are standing on}} a sidewalk with Riley. He is wearing a suit and overcoat, and holding a cigar <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> on a gate. The little girl and boy both wear hats. On {{the back of the}} picture is written: All three were born on Oct. 7. James Whitcomb Riley and two "playmates" before his home on Lockerbie Street—calling to celebrate a birthday with him...|$|R

5000|$|Highway Patrol stars Broderick Crawford as Dan Mathews, the gruff and {{dedicated}} {{head of a}} police force in an unidentified Western state. A signature shot of the series is fedora-wearing Mathews barking rapid-fire dialogue into a radio microphone <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> against {{the door of his}} black and white patrol car. Mathews growls [...] "21-50 to headquarters" [...] and the invariable response is [...] "Headquarters by" [...] (as in, standing by).|$|R
6000|$|... "I supposed, sergeant," [...] Mr. Tulkinghorn resumes <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> on {{one side}} of his chair and crosses his legs, [...] "that Mr. Smallweed might have {{sufficiently}} explained the matter. It lies in the smallest compass, however. You served under Captain Hawdon at one time, and were his attendant in illness, and rendered him many little services, and were rather in his confidence, I am told. That is so, is it not?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Rosie, jealous and angry, {{dreams of}} violent ways to murder Albert ("One Hundred Ways Ballet"). Rosie and Hugo plot {{to ruin the}} broadcast. Conrad sings on The Ed Sullivan Show ("One Last Kiss"), and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> in to kiss Kim, Hugo runs onstage and punches him in the face. On live television, Conrad faints, Rosie breaks up with Albert, and Albert, trying to cover for the mishaps of the evening, leads a chorus of [...] "Normal American Boy".|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a sad}} {{interruption}} to your wedding," [...] remarked the pastor, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> {{against the}} Fort gate, and examined his weapon.|$|E
6000|$|... "No wonder poor Edith was alarmed," [...] said Stanley sadly, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> on his fowling-piece and {{surveyed}} the scene of desolation and death.|$|E
6000|$|The captain, who was stooping {{with his}} hand on the rope, felt the {{vibration}} cease, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> over he heard Dick call out: ...|$|E
60|$|The words took Bertram fairly by surprise. He was wholly unacquainted {{with that}} rank form of provincialism {{which we know}} <b>as</b> patriotism. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> across towards her {{with a look of}} deep pain on his {{handsome}} face.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps Schwantz had {{a feeling}} {{something}} bad was about to happen. Going into 130R, Gardner barely manages {{to pass on the}} brakes and move into second place, while Doohan brakes for all he’s worth, getting the back wheel in the air, and loses the front end <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> it in. Unfortunately, he’s inside of Lawson when he falls, so Doohan’s bike hits Lawson’s rear wheel hard, taking him out too. Lawson, who came out of 1989 without a race crash, begins the season with a DNF and a broken left ankle.|$|R
6000|$|... "But what sudden {{noise is}} that he hears within the house? Why do those heavy steps press so rapidly against the stairs? What feet are they which are so busy in the room above him? He opens the sitting-room door, but he can see nothing. He has been left there without a candle. He peers up the stairs, but a faint glimmer of light shining through the keyhole of his wife's door is all that meets his eye. 'Oh, my aunt! my aunt!' <b>he</b> says <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> against the banisters. 'My aunt, my aunt, my aunt!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That I {{killed the}} deer,” {{answered}} the young man, {{with a little}} haughtiness, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> on another long rifle {{similar to that of}} Natty.|$|E
60|$|She {{caught the}} flash of his eyes in the half gloom <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> over her, his arm about her waist drawing her to him.|$|E
6000|$|Like {{a frightened}} bird, she stayed, not stirring, gazing {{at his back}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> in the window, till, turning round on her again, he said: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{left-hand}} wing shows Mary {{dressed in}} a violet-white robe, looking at the infant Christ <b>as</b> <b>he</b> returns her gaze. Beside them a seated Saint Joseph is dressed in red with a long head-dress, dozing <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> on a staff. The hem of Mary's robe is inscribed in golden script containing text from the [...] "Canticle of Mary" [...] of Luke 1:46–48.; My soul doth magnify the Lord.... This panel was long {{assumed to be a}} Nativity until described by art historian Erwin Panofsky as a simple representation of the Holy Family. The accompanying reliefs show moments of the Life of Christ; key events from his infancy to the Presentation at the Temple.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of two men}} {{listening}} to a "talking book", [s. d. ]. The men sit opposite each other with the thin, standing radio speaker at center in between them. The man on the left crosses his legs {{in a dark suit}} and glasses. The man on the right wears a lightly-colored suit <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> against the near arm of his chair and follows the book in his hands. The man on the left props his left arm on to a glass table just behind them where two more books lie closed. A piano can be seen on the tile floors in the background...|$|R
50|$|The three {{figures in}} a calm green meadow are linked by looks and {{touching}} hands. The Virgin Mary is shown wearing a gold-bordered blue mantle set against a red dress and with her right leg lying along a diagonal. The blue symbolizes {{the church and the}} red Christ's death, with the Madonna the uniting of Mother Church with Christ's sacrifice. With her eyes fixed on Christ, her head is turned to the left and slightly inclined, and in her hands she holds up Christ, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> forward unsteadily to touch the miniature cross held by John. The poppy refers to Christ's passion, death and resurrection.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] said Leger, {{and then}} started visibly, while Ingleby, who saw his face, closed one hand a trifle <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> forward in his chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a lovely}} city!" [...] he said <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> over the bulwark {{and looked at}} the town {{standing}} on the steep hills sloping down to the river.|$|E
60|$|Dominey set {{his teeth}} for a moment. He felt the doctor's keen grey eyes glowing {{from under his}} shaggy eyebrows <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> forward, his hands upon his knees.|$|E
60|$|He {{served them}} both and filled their glasses with wine. Then, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> ate, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> {{back in his}} chair and watched them. For all her strange beauty, Julia, too, was one of the {{suffering}} children of the world. The lines of her figure, which should have been so subtle and fascinating, were sharpened by an unnatural thinness. Aaron's cheeks were almost like a consumptive's, his physique was puny. There was something in their expression common to both. Maraton was conscious of a wave of pity <b>as</b> <b>he</b> withdrew his eyes.|$|R
500|$|As with van Eyck's Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, {{the panel}} creates an {{intimate}} setting between the donor and Virgin. This is emphasised by the donor's physical {{proximity to the}} Virgin which, according to art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith, [...] "mentally and pictorially [...] the barriers between heaven and earth" [...] and implies the [...] "patrons are visually immortalized as meriting the Virgin and Child's personal attention." [...] The intimacy is further enhanced by small details such as the overlap between the donor and Saint George, who casts a shadow on van der Paele and seems to have accidentally stepped on his surplice <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> forward to introduce the canon to the Virgin.|$|R
50|$|The story {{then returns}} to Mears and Petrie {{at the church}} in Guatemala two years later. It quickly becomes clear that {{they are on the}} run from the {{surviving}} vampires from Salem's Lot, who have been relentlessly pursuing them. Their supplies of holy water glow whenever a vampire is nearby. Realising that they have been tracked down yet again, Mears and Petrie return to their lodgings to collect their belongings. However, once there, Mears finds Susan lying in his bed. Now a vampire, she prepares to bite him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> down to kiss her, but he drives a stake through her heart. Filled with grief, he and Petrie leave, knowing that vampires will forever hunt them.|$|R
