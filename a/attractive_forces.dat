25|$|The <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> between polymer chains play a {{large part}} in {{determining}} polymer's properties. Because polymer chains are so long, these interchain forces are amplified far beyond the attractions between conventional molecules. Different side groups on the polymer can lend the polymer to ionic bonding or hydrogen bonding between its own chains. These stronger forces typically result in higher tensile strength and higher crystalline melting points.|$|E
25|$|Propositions 70–84 {{deal with}} the <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> of spherical bodies. The section {{contains}} Newton's proof that a massive spherically symmetrical body attracts other bodies outside itself as if all its mass were concentrated at its centre. This fundamental result, called the Shell theorem, enables the inverse square law of gravitation {{to be applied to}} the real solar system to a very close degree of approximation.|$|E
25|$|In {{large scale}} electrostatics problems, {{such as the}} {{simulation}} of proteins and cellular assemblies in structural biology, the Coulomb potential has the same form as the gravitational potential, except that charges may be positive or negative, leading to repulsive as well as <b>attractive</b> <b>forces.</b> Fast Coulomb solvers are the electrostatic counterpart to fast multipole method simulators. These are often used with periodic boundary conditions on the region simulated and Ewald summation techniques are used to speed up computations.|$|E

25|$|Ethene, however, has no {{permanent}} dipole. The <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> between polyethylene chains arise from weak van der Waals forces. Molecules {{can be thought}} of as being surrounded by a cloud of negative electrons. As two polymer chains approach, their electron clouds repel one another. This has the effect of lowering the electron density on one side of a polymer chain, creating a slight positive dipole on this side. This charge is enough to attract the second polymer chain. Van der Waals forces are quite weak, however, so polyethylene can have a lower melting temperature compared to other polymers.|$|E
25|$|When a {{substance}} undergoes a phase transition (changes from one {{state of matter}} to another) it usually either takes up or releases energy. For example, when water evaporates, the increase in kinetic energy as the evaporating molecules escape the <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> of the liquid is reflected in a decrease in temperature. The energy required to induce the phase transition is taken from the internal thermal energy of the water, which cools the liquid to a lower temperature; hence evaporation is useful for cooling. See Enthalpy of vaporization. The reverse process, condensation, releases heat. The heat energy, or enthalpy, associated with a solid to liquid transition is the enthalpy of fusion and that associated with a solid to gas transition is the enthalpy of sublimation.|$|E
25|$|Other {{interactions}} that induce leaching are electrostatic and ionic interactions. Electrostatic interactions occur between charged molecules, which have repulsive or <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> between each other. The pectin within ketchup will have negative and neutral charges along the molecule {{due to the}} hydroxyl groups and relative pH, which is 3.9 on average. Pectin is most stable at a pH of 3.5, so the more basic pH within ketchup will protonate the hydroxyl side chains and therefore create a less viscous gel. Acetic acid within vinegar also has hydroxyl groups {{that will have a}} dispersed amount of negative and neutral charges along each molecule. The acetic acid and pectin will display repulsive interactions between the negatively charged oxygens on each molecule. The hydroxyls on each molecule will be able to form hydrogen bonds with the water in the product. The addition of salt will reduce the repulsive interactions between the negatively charged side chains of acetic acid and pectin within solution because they will create bonds with the dissociated sodium and chloride ions. The hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions will encourage leaching because the formation of bonds associated with the need for molecules to be in the lowest energy state are not always bonds that happen between different molecules and instead are formed between like molecules, causing aggregation.|$|E

25|$|The Principia deals {{primarily}} with massive bodies in motion, initially under {{a variety of}} conditions and hypothetical laws of force in both non-resisting and resisting media, thus offering criteria to decide, by observations, which laws of force are operating in phenomena that may be observed. It attempts to cover hypothetical or possible motions both of celestial bodies and of terrestrial projectiles. It explores difficult problems of motions perturbed by multiple <b>attractive</b> <b>forces.</b> Its third and final book deals with the interpretation of observations about the movements of planets and their satellites. It shows how astronomical observations prove the inverse square law of gravitation (to an accuracy that was high by the standards of Newton's time); offers estimates of relative masses for the known giant planets and for the Earth and the Sun; defines the very slow motion of the Sun relative to the solar-system barycenter; shows how the theory of gravity can account for irregularities in the motion of the Moon; identifies the oblateness of the figure of the Earth; accounts approximately for marine tides including phenomena of spring and neap tides by the perturbing (and varying) gravitational attractions of the Sun and Moon on the Earth's waters; explains the precession of the equinoxes as an effect of the gravitational attraction of the Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge; and gives theoretical basis for numerous phenomena about comets and their elongated, near-parabolic orbits.|$|E
500|$|Epitome of Copernican Astronomy {{was read}} by astronomers {{throughout}} Europe, and following Kepler's death {{it was the}} main vehicle for spreading Kepler's ideas. In the period 1630 - 1650, this book was {{the most widely used}} astronomy textbook, winning many converts to ellipse-based astronomy. [...] However, few adopted his ideas on the physical basis for celestial motions. In the late 17th century, a number of physical astronomy theories drawing from Kepler's work—notably those of Giovanni Alfonso Borelli and Robert Hooke—began to incorporate <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> (though not the quasi-spiritual motive species postulated by Kepler) and the Cartesian concept of inertia. This culminated in Isaac Newton's Principia Mathematica (1687), in which Newton derived Kepler's laws of planetary motion from a force-based theory of universal gravitation.|$|E

After some initial successes against their enemy, they learn that the Asurans have retreated back {{to the safety of}} their homeworld to rebuild their numbers. Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) works with Todd, a Wraith prisoner (Brendan Penny, Christopher Heyerdahl) to create a computer virus to deactivate the Asurans, but they do not succeed. However, McKay develops an alternate plan to enhance the <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> between the Asuran nanites, pulling them together into a superdense mass that the Expedition can then implode by overloading ZPMs around it. To carry out this plan, he creates another humanoid Replicator to serve as a nucleus, later dubbed [...] "FRAN" [...] ("Friendly Replicator Android", played by Michelle Morgan).|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of a capillary phase in segregating mixed polymer solutions confined between two planar walls is modeled by using a lattice mean-field theory for flexible polymers in solution. A capillary-induced phase separation (CIPS) may appear in systems where the two polymer components display different preference for the wall, the preference being either of energetic or entropic origin. A long-range <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> operating between the walls across the polymer solution {{is associated with the}} CIPS. The CIPS phenomenon is discussed for two different polymer systems. The effects of the chain length asymmetry, the solution composition, and the interactions with the walls on the range and the magnitude of the <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> are presented. For compositions near the binodal curve and far from the critical point, the <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> is very long-ranged and its range exceeds far the dimension of the polymer chains.

2500|$|Returning to nomenclature, {{different}} texts {{refer to}} different things {{using the term}} [...] "van der Waals force".

2500|$|The above {{discovery}} {{goes right}} {{to the heart of}} the matter as to what exactly the -body problem is physically: as Newton realized, it is not sufficient to just specify the initial position and velocity, or three orbital positions either, to determine a planet's true orbit: the gravitational interactive forces have to be known too. Thus came the awareness and rise of the -body [...] "problem" [...] in the early 17th century. These gravitational <b>attractive</b> <b>forces</b> do conform to Newton's Laws of Motion and to his Law of Universal Gravitation, but the many multiple ( [...] -body) interactions have historically made any exact solution intractable.

To explain this, <b>attractive</b> <b>force</b> between two alumina particles with different shape combinations, i. e., sphere-sphere (S-S), sphere-plane (S-P), plane-plane (P-P), was calculated based on the theory of spontaneous cavitation.
