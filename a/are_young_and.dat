5|$|The edibility of {{the fruit}} bodies of Agaricus deserticola is not known definitively, and there are {{conflicting}} opinions in the literature, with some sources claiming that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should be avoided. However, one popular field guide to North American mushrooms suggests they are edible when they <b>are</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> have a pleasant odor and mild taste.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they <b>are</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> healthy.|$|E
5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they <b>are</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E

The doctor or WHNP may also be able to suggest lifestyle changes to increase the chances of conceiving.|$|E
25|$|The swimbladders of {{deep sea}} fish are either absent or {{scarcely}} operational, and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations. Filling bladders at such great pressures incurs huge energy costs. Some deep sea fishes have swimbladders which function while they <b>are</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> inhabit the upper epipelagic zone, but they wither or fill with fat {{when the fish}} move down to their adult habitat.|$|E
25|$|The {{regional}} {{governments are}} responsible for the operation and maintenance (O) of major public hydraulic infrastructure (i.e., headwork such as dams and inter-basin transfers transferred to them as part of the decentralization process) and have some responsibilities for water quality. The regional government responsibilities poses a challenge for IWRM, since the administrative boundaries of the region do not coincide with those of the river basins. An additional challenge is that the regions <b>are</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> lack fundamental technical capacity and human resources to undertake IWRM.|$|E

25|$|Soil {{chemical}} and physical characteristics are {{strongly related to}} above ground productivity and forest structure and dynamics. The physical properties of soil control the tree turnover rates whereas chemical properties such as available nitrogen and phosphorus control forest growth rates. The soils of the eastern and central Amazon {{as well as the}} Southeast Asian Rainforest are old and mineral poor whereas the soils of the western Amazon (Ecuador and Peru) and volcanic areas of Costa Rica <b>are</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> mineral rich. Primary productivity or wood production is highest in western Amazon and lowest in eastern Amazon which contains heavily weathered soils classified as oxisols. Additionally, Amazonian soils are greatly weathered, making them devoid of minerals like phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, which come from rock sources. However, not all tropical rainforests occur on nutrient poor soils, but on nutrient rich floodplains and volcanic soils located in the Andean foothills, and volcanic areas of Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central America.|$|E
25|$|Intermediates are {{workers with}} fully {{developed}} ovaries. These wasps are non-inseminated laying females, {{and they are}} present throughout the entire colony cycle. Intermediates lay eggs, but the eggs are eaten either by themselves or by other colony members. It is possible that non-inseminated laying females are always present {{in order to provide}} extra energy in the colony. Their eggs may be used for trophic purposes, since male production is controlled entirely by queens. This oophagy (egg eating behavior) can provide additional sustenance for the colony. Inseminated workers are typically older and are likely to have been potential queens at colony initiation. Therefore, non-inseminated egg layers <b>are</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> seem to be about to swarm. In a study on P. exigua foraging activity, a higher proportion of workers than intermediates were observed in all the colonies. Their study observed 12 colonies in Bom Jesus da Lapa, Bahia, Brazil.|$|E

When the fruit bodies <b>are</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> fresh, the caps are reddish brown and can glisten, especially if wet. As the mushroom matures, {{the outer edge of}} the cap turn a greyish color while the center remains reddish brown. Radial grooves extend from the center of the cap to the margins. The caps have minute hairs (setae) that are visible through a hand lens.|$|E

[...] The track then changes to a stomping Europop beat. Gaga bids her ex-lovers farewell with a bitter-hearted pre-chorus where she sings: [...] "You know that I love you, boy/Hot like Mexico, rejoice!/At this point I've got to choose/Nothing to lose." [...] By {{the end of the}} song, the three protagonists – Alejandro, Fernando, and Roberto – are bidden farewell by Gaga.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} story, the staff wanted to {{incorporate}} Hibiki Ganaha and Takane Shijō, {{who had already}} been introduced in The Idolmaster SP, but because the two games were being developed simultaneously, Hibiki's and Takane's role in the main story of Dearly Stars was kept to a minimum. For the dance sequences during performances, Kujioka chose to employ talent star Fumi Sakura, as opposed to professional dancers who {{had been used in}} The Idolmaster games up to that point. Kujioka wanted the dance sequences to be closer to what he calls an [...] "idol's aura"—a certain emotional charm that is not a part of an idol's skill at dancing, according to him. Also, because of the idols in Dearly Stars <b>are</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> are just starting out, Kujioka told Sakura to purposefully mess up some dance portions to reflect this inexperience.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Time magazine, Jay Cocks {{observed}} {{the show to}} integrate [...] "sleek high tech and smooth dance rhythm into an evening of snazzy soul with a social conscience." [...] Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times remarked that Jackson's choreography [...] "represents the pinnacle {{of what can be}} done in the popping 'n' locking style—a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements." [...] Several critics noted Jackson lip synced portions of the show, in a similar fashion to her contemporaries. Jon Pareles commented, [...] "most lip-synched shows are done by video-era pop performers whose audiences <b>are</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> television trained. They fill arenas to enjoy a spectacle like what they saw on television—the dancing... the stage effects and incidentally the songs." [...] Michael MacCambridge considered it a [...] "moot point" [...] stating, [...] "Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre-recorded vocals, to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles." ...|$|E

La Plante played {{roles in}} more than 50 films before starring in The Cat and the Canary. According to film historian Gary Don Rhodes, her part in The Cat and the Canary was typical for women in horror and mystery films: [...] "The female in the horror film ... becomes the hunted, the quarry. She has little to do, and so the question becomes 'What will be done with her?'" [...] Rhodes adds, [...] "The heroines <b>are</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> beautiful, but represent more a prize to be possessed—whether “stolen” by a villain or “owned” by a young hero at the films' conclusions." [...] Following The Cat and the Canary, La Plante maintained a career with Universal, but she {{is described as a}} [...] "victim of talkies." [...] She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame before her death in 1996 from Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
