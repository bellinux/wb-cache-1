5|$|A new wooden {{northern}} jetty {{was added}} in 1872 which allowed {{the removal of}} the original western landing place. Another jetty was built on the south west corner in 1898 which reached deep water even at low tide, thus allowing steamers to use the pier at all states of the tide. This was damaged in a gale in 1903, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>it</b> was rebuilt in 1909, it closed in 1916 and was dismantled in 1923. The northern jetty had also been damaged in the 1903 storm but was replaced by the present steel structure in 1905.|$|E

Due to the discriminatory laws in force at the time, Saunders had fewer rights as a citizen than the white Australians he led. He was wounded in the knee by Japanese gunfire during fighting around Maprik, and was hospitalised for three weeks as a result.|$|E

On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E.

Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>it</b> spread to the station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire in the tunnel.|$|E

On {{the day of}} the storm, the forecast from the Halifax weather office was for light winds, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>it</b> was amended to highlight severe conditions, boats in the region had no radio to learn of the threat. There were many salmon in the region, which prompted fishermen to set sail. As the storm approached, there were about 45 boats in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.|$|E

G.ambigua has larger spores that are about 22–30µm long. The saddle-shaped cap of G.infula might also lead to confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of black}} and white is {{regarded}} as dramatic, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>it</b> may have been influenced by 1940s and 1950s works of Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell, it is more likely a commentary on Mondrian's 1917 Composition in Black and White.

This complementary source art was common of Lichtenstein's 1960s work on frequently advertised objects. Lichtenstein describes his sources as Mondrian Plus and Minus paintings.|$|E

It was classified as a tropical depression on August 17, <b>and</b> <b>although</b> <b>it</b> quickly intensified into a tropical storm, harsher environmental conditions caused it to begin weakening as the cyclone moved northward. On August 19, Ignacio transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it approached California, where its remnants produced unprecedented August rainfall, numerous traffic accidents, and 78,000 power outages.|$|E
