40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{aspects of}} foraging and reproductive ecology of little penguins Eudyptula minor {{in the eastern}} Great Australian Bight. Little penguins are permanent residents in this region and the link between their ecology and their local food source is poorly understood in the Great Australian Bight. Most little penguin colonies in South Australia are small in population (< 4000 breeding individuals) and they are almost all found on islands. Despite similarities in breeding seasons and diet among colonies, the foraging ecology of penguins from offshore colonies differed from inshore colonies in the same region. Natural variation in diet and foraging behaviour at eight colonies was attributed to differences in food availability. Inter-colony differences in foraging behaviour and effort, which were consistent between years, were related to differences in penguin morphology, growth and body size. Breeding penguins from the offshore colony travelled up to 3 times further from shore (39 vs. 13 - 21 km) and for greater durations (3 vs. 1 days), and spent more time diving (56 vs. 37 % of foraging time). Results suggest that food availability is depleted, or not profitable in near colony waters, possibly {{as a consequence of}} increased or prolonged predation by the large penguin population. This study also indicated that increased foraging effort at the colony level was reflected in the growth parameters of offspring, because offshore colonies had smaller offspring and adults, and delayed development of sexual size differentiation in bill morphology. Increases in foraging distance and duration were also linked to poorer breeding success. Little penguins at different colonies exhibited low variation in their diet because juvenile <b>Australian</b> <b>anchovies</b> Engraulis australis were mainly targeted as a food source. Dive behaviour was similar among colonies, despite differences in the depths around colonies. The regional availability and abundance of anchovies may be responsible for the unusual pattern of winter breeding that is apparent in South Australia. Little penguin diet, breeding and foraging parameters may provide quantitative indicators of the health of local anchovy stocks, especially if an anchovy fishery develops in South Australia. Baseline information on these penguin parameters parameters may also inform management decisions aimed at conserving penguin populations across the region. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|We {{investigated}} ontogenetic, {{temporal and}} spatial patterns in the composition and size of prey in the diet of crested terns, Sterna bergii. Diet analyses indicated that crested terns are a generalist predator on surface-schooling clupeids (<b>Australian</b> <b>anchovy</b> Engraulis australis, sardine Sardinops sagax and blue sprat Spratelloides robustus), Degens leatherjacket Thamnaconus degeni, southern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir, Australian herring Arripis georgianus, slender bullseye Parapriacanthus elongatus and barracouta Thyrsites atun. Ontogenetic differences in prey size indicated that adults are constrained in their foraging behaviour during the early chick-provisioning period {{by the need to}} self feed and select smaller prey that can be ingested by their chicks. Chicks consumed significantly higher proportions of clupeids than adults, which consumed mainly Degens leatherjackets and barracouta, suggesting that adults may select higher quality prey for their chicks compared to what they consume themselves. Spatial differences in prey composition were driven by differing proportions of sardine, <b>Australian</b> <b>anchovy</b> and Degens leatherjacket and could reflect local differences in the abundances of these prey. The size of prey taxa consumed by adults also reflected a North–South gradient in prey size. The large component of juvenile sardine in the diet of crested terns suggests future dietary measures may inform fisheries managers about changes in local juvenile sardine abundance. These data could assist in highlighting any fishery-related decreases in sardine recruitment and help ensure commercial fishing practices address principals of Ecologically Sustainable Development developed for Australian fisheries.

40|$|Little {{penguins}} {{have shown}} an overall pattern of decline throughout their distribution, {{thus it was}} considered unusual for a new colony to establish themselves recently near {{the heart of a}} city at St Kilda, Victoria, Australia. Since they were first observed in the 1970 ’s, this colony has grown from a few breeding pairs to ~ 1000 individuals. It is the factors that have contributed to this population success that this study aims to examine, specifically the relationships between colony’s foraging behaviour, diet and subsequent reproductive success. Penguin foraging behaviour was studied during three breeding seasons by satellite transmitters, global positioning system (GPS) loggers and time-depth recorders (TDR). Results revealed that the penguins have a small foraging area ~ 1500 ha in the north of Port Phillip bay. Maximum distance travelled from the colony each day is ~ 13 kms and total horizontal distance covered is ~ 34 km, less than that cited for other penguin colonies. Diving was conducted mostly to depths ≤ 10 m, with ~ 800 dives performed in a day, comparable to other little penguin colonies. Use of the combined GPS and TDR revealed that the penguins spent a disproportionately high amount of time foraging in the artificially dredged shipping channels that occur within their foraging area. This foraging study also found that the combined loggers providing more accurate and useful data at the small scale than separately deployed satellite transmitters and TDRs. Diet at the penguin colony was monitored continuously over a two year period using stomach content and stable isotope analysis. Stable isotopes were better able to detect seasonal variation in diet, while stomach contents were useful for determining dietary diversity and age cohorts of the prey consumed. The diet was dominated by <b>Australian</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis australis) and southern garfish (Hypohamphus melanochir). Australian anchovies were common during the pre-breeding and early stages of breeding throughout spring and early summer. Southern garfish increased in the diet from chick-rearing through the non-breeding season. Adult penguins switched from <b>Australian</b> <b>anchovy</b> to southern garfish to feed their chicks, presumably due to the higher energetic, protein and fat content of this species. Reproductive success determined by the number of chicks fledged per pair and peak chick weights was similarly low in all years of this study. The mean egg-laying date was earlier in 2008 than other years, and the reproductive success was also greatest in this year, being considered ‘average’ for little penguins. Double brooding was highest in 2006, but this was also the year with the latest mean egg-laying date and the lowest fledging rate from first clutches. Successful breeding was associated with quality prey rather than increased double brooding. St Kilda little penguin colony {{is an example of a}} native animal population that has successfully exploited changes in both the terrestrial (breakwater) and marine (shipping channel) environments. Prey availability in close proximity to their colony is essential for the continuation of this population; their survival in the urban environment can be supported through the careful management of their prey stocks...|$|E
40|$|Pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) form {{spawning}} aggregations {{during the}} austral spring/summer in three adjacent, sheltered, coastal embayments in southwestern Australia (Cockburn Sound, Warnbro Sound and Owen Anchorage). Larval fishes were sampled in these embayments, {{as well as}} in the more exposed adjacent waters of Five Fathom Bank, to ascertain which teleost species utilised these areas for spawning concurrently with P. auratus. Obliquely towed bongo nets (500 μm mesh) were used to collect icthyoplankton in November 2007 over three days during the new moon period when spawning of P. auratus is known to peak. A total of 13 270 larvae from 30 teleost families was collected with an overall mean larval fish concentration of 1. 91 m - 3 (± s. e. 0. 28). Larval fish assemblages were significantly different in each of the three embayments and Five Fathom Bank, reflecting the degree of shelter, water-circulation patterns and associated benthic habitats. The highest larval fish concentrations were recorded in Cockburn Sound (3. 69 m - 3 ± s. e. 0. 05) and the lowest along Five Fathom Bank (0. 16 m - 3 ± s. e. 0. 02). P. auratus larvae were only present in samples from the three embayments. The most abundant larvae were those of the <b>Australian</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis australis), which occurred predominantly in Cockburn Sound and, to a lesser extent, Owen Anchorage. The most ubiquitous larvae included the longspine dragonet (Callionymus goodladi) and leatherjackets (Monacanthidae). This study provides circumstantial evidence that eggs and larvae of P. auratus and other teleosts are retained in the sheltered waters of Cockburn and Warnbro Sounds during spring/summer...|$|E
40|$|Journal {{compilation}} © 2009 The Fisheries Society of the British IslesThe spawning biomass of <b>Australian</b> <b>anchovy</b> Engraulis australis in {{gulf and}} shelf waters of South Australia was compared using the {{daily egg production}} method (DEPM). The total survey area was 128 700 km 2 with recorded spawning areas in gulf and shelf waters of 4898 and 44 618 km 2, respectively. High egg densities in the warm, shallow gulf waters were produced by small, young (< 1 year old) E. australis that spawned relatively small batches of eggs (c. 855) approximately every 3 days. In cooler, deeper shelf waters, where larger, older E. australis are found, lower egg densities occurred despite individuals producing much larger batches of eggs (c. 15, 572) approximately every 7 days. In shelf waters, the highest densities were recorded at inshore sampling stations. Spawning appeared to peak between 0000 and 0100 hours. Females were more abundant than males in samples from both gulf and shelf waters with sex ratios of 0. 61 and 0. 56, respectively. The spawning biomass of E. australis in shelf waters was 101 522 t, whereas the estimate for gulf waters was 25 374 t. Due to the differences in mean size of the spawning females, however, c. 6 x 10 (9) E. australis were present in each region. The results {{support the hypothesis that}} variability in habitat conditions may directly influence E. australis reproduction. A large reserve of young fish in the relatively stable gulf environment may increase the resilience of the E. australis population in South Australia to unfavourable interannual changes in offshore environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comGonosomatic indices and egg and larval densities observed from 1986 to 2001 suggest that the peak spawning season of the <b>Australian</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis australis) in South Australia occurs during January to March (summer and autumn). This coincides with the spawning season of sardine (Sardinops sagax) and the period when productivity in shelf waters is enhanced by upwelling. Anchovy eggs were abundant throughout gulf and shelf waters, but the highest densities occurred in the northern parts of Spencer Gulf and Gulf St Vincent where sea surface temperatures (SST) were 24 – 26 °C. In contrast, larvae > 10 mm total length (TL) were found mainly in shelf waters near upwelling zones where SSTs were relatively low (15 mm TL were collected only from shelf waters near upwelling zones. The high levels of larval abundance in the upwelling zones may reflect higher levels of recruitment to later stages in these areas compared with the gulfs. The sardine spawns mainly in shelf waters; few eggs and no larvae were collected from the northern gulfs. The abundance of anchovy eggs and larvae in shelf waters increased when sardine abundance was reduced by large-scale mortality events, and decreased as the sardine numbers subsequently recovered. We hypothesize that the upwelling zones provide optimal conditions {{for the survival of}} larval anchovy in South Australia, but that anchovy can only utilize these zones effectively when the sardine population is low. At other times, northern gulf waters of South Australia may provide a refuge for the anchovy that the sardine cannot utilize. W. F. Dimmlich, W. G. Breed, M. Geddes and T. M. War...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the functional {{relationships between the}} diet, foraging behaviour and life history traits of crested tern populations in South Australia between 2004 and 2008. Diet analyses indicated that crested terns are a generalist predator on surface-schooling fishes. Clupeiform fish (<b>Australian</b> <b>anchovy</b> Engraulis australis, sardine Sardinops sagax) comprised a large component of the diet of crested terns. Ontogenetic differences in prey size indicated that adults selected small prey for their chicks during early provisioning but increased the size and rate of prey delivered throughout the breeding season as chicks grew. Adults also selected higher quality prey for their chicks compared to what they consumed themselves. Chick and adult diets may have reflected spatial differences in the species composition of prey assemblages near colonies and a North-South gradient in prey size. I also investigated the provisioning patterns of crested terns and how reproductive timing and adult body condition affect the growth and survival of crested tern chicks. Provisioning rates {{were related to the}} daily mass change of chicks, and chick growth was correlated with asymptotic mass, suggesting that prey availability and adult foraging proficiency influences fledgling size. Parental ‘quality’ affected reproductive performance. Adults with good body condition hatched chicks earlier and early breeding was positively related to hatchling mass, fledgling condition and chick survival. Adults aged < 7 years had significantly poorer body condition and hatched their chicks later compared to adults ≥ 7 years. However, adult body condition also varied within cohorts, indicating that reproductive performance is affected by phenotypic differences in parental quality. Consequently, the growth of crested tern populations may be most sensitive to the foraging behaviour and reproductive output of high quality adults ≥ 7 years old. Disease-related mortality events in 1995 and 1998, which killed ~ 70 % of adult sardine Sardinops sagax biomass, provided an opportunity to assess whether crested tern populations were affected by decreases in prey abundance. Age-specific information collected from adults indicated that chicks reared during poor prey conditions caused by the first sardine mortality event in 1995 exhibited lower rates of recruitment to the breeding colony. Females from cohorts reared 0. 5 mg. m⁻³). Intra-specific variations in foraging behaviour reflected either prior knowledge of where prey aggregations exist, distinctions in individual niche use driven by the types or sizes of prey available, and/or alternate behavioural states (self feeding and provisioning). The restricted foraging range of crested terns while breeding may make them sensitive to competition with fisheries that operate within their foraging range. Diet and demographic information collected from crested tern populations may provide ecological performance indicators to enhance conservation strategies for crested tern populations and augment current fisheries management approaches.
