Entertainment Weekly reviewing the tenth season of the show acknowledged that, [...] "the second season is still the show’s best season to date." [...] The site added, [...] "I do want to talk about what season 10 could learn from what I believe is the show’s best season to date: season 2." [...] calling in all the signature elements of the show that it did the best with listing all the best moments from the season, [...] "the elevator", [...] "the walkway", [...] "Joe’s bar, [...] " [...] Meredith’s [...] "Pick me" [...] speech". and the [...] "memorable patients" [...] adding, [...] " [...] I want two people stuck on a pole (Into You Like a Train) or two Amish best friends having to say goodbye, and I want those stories to be given ample time to resonate. More than <b>anything,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> them to affect our doctors in heartbreaking and beautiful ways." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of The Wraith: Shangri-La, Bruce {{admitted}} that he was considering not completing the production of Hell's Pit. He is quoted as describing Shangri-La as [...] "{{the end of the}} road. It's the end of the Joker's Cards. After this I could do <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>want,</b> {{for the rest of my}} life. The positivity was so unbelievable". On August 31, 2004, Insane Clown Posse released their ninth studio album, Hell's Pit, the second exhibit of The Wraith, intended to warn listeners of the horrors of Hell. Bruce described the album as the darkest, most painful work he had ever done. Two versions of the album were released, each containing a different DVD. One release featured a live concert and a twelve-minute music video for the song [...] "Real Underground Baby", and another featured a short film for the song [...] "Bowling Balls", which was the first 3-D film shot in high-definition video. In 2005, D12 and Insane Clown Posse ended their feud, with the help of member Proof. Attempts to officially end the feud between Eminem and Insane Clown Posse have been unsuccessful, but Bruce states that the rivalry has ended.|$|E

Markhasev wrote to Brodie that he had killed Cosby and that he wanted {{to do the right thing}} by confessing. [...] "Although my appeal is in its {{beginning}} stages, I don't want to continue with it because it's based on falsehood and deceit," [...] wrote Markhasev, who is incarcerated at California State Prison, Corcoran. [...] "I am guilty, and I want to do the right thing ... More than <b>anything,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to apologize to the victim's family.

2500|$|The {{record label}} speculated that Eminem {{would be the}} first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These {{expectations}} placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, [...] "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before <b>anything,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> respect. [...] " [...] After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote [...] "The Way I Am" [...] as his way of saying, [...] "Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is. ' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. [...] " [...] However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became [...] "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer reflected, [...] "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Grohl {{described}} this song as such; [...] "Wind Up {{is about the}} press. It {{has to do with}} me reading about people that... I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking just quit and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about <b>anything,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than <b>anything,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to try to figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never really said a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? You might have to certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to find out (if there's a problem). I think you need to talk to all of them. If it comes up to 50 percent, then, hey, maybe we've got a problem. I'd like to know what the problem is because I can't be any fairer than I've been." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{prospect}} {{of creating a}} Richard Donner cut of Superman II did not begin to gain momentum until the 2001 restoration of Superman for DVD. At this time, six tons of footage for Superman and six tons of footage for Superman II was discovered in vaults in England by Michael Thau, including much [...] "lost" [...] footage filmed by Richard Donner. Soon after, Donner was approached by Warner Bros. to do an extended version of Superman II, but remained reluctant to revisit the movie. In May 2001, he told the website IGN, [...] "At the time, the studio {{wanted me to go}} back in and re-cut the film and add <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to add or do <b>anything</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do.
