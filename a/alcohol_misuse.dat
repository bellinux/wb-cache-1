5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse</b> and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse</b> was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse,</b> which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{focussed}} on {{the role}} of alcohol related metacognitions on craving in individuals who were <b>misusing</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Specifically it focussed on discovering whether alcohol related metacognitions have a stronger role in the perseveration of craving for alcohol than more general metacognitions. The results partially predicted the hypotheses. Alcohol related metacognitions are better predictors of craving in individuals <b>misusing</b> <b>alcohol</b> than general metacognitions. More specifically, negative alcohol related metacognitions relating to the belief that ones thoughts about alcohol are uncontrollable were uniquely associated with craving in individuals <b>misusing</b> <b>alcohol</b> after controlling for other alcohol related negative metacognitions, such as those relating to harm, positive alcohol related metacognitions, and metacognitions in general. Therefore, treating negative alcohol related metacognitions regarding uncontrollability from a metacognitive framework may be a valuable step forward in reducing craving in individuals who misuse alcoho...|$|R
5|$|The {{exact number}} of cases of {{rhabdomyolysis}} is difficult to establish, because different definitions have been used. In 1995, hospitals in the U.S. reported 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis. Up to 85% of people with major traumatic injuries will experience some degree of rhabdomyolysis. Of those with rhabdomyolysis, 10–50% develop acute kidney injury. The risk is higher in people with a history of illicit drug use, <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse</b> or trauma when compared to muscle diseases, and it is particularly high if multiple contributing factors occur together. Rhabdomyolysis accounts for 7–10% of all cases of acute kidney injury in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse</b> (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{database}} {{would not}} hold case or assessment material or any subjective observations. The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from the child or the child’s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note that the child was receiving help from 'sensitive services' and would not say what this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse</b> by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E

5|$|The various health {{problems}} associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle accidents (due to drunk driving), domestic violence, and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, an incurable and damaging condition. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol abuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug abuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified {{the cost to the}} UK of all forms of <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse</b> in 2001 as £18.5–20 billion.

25|$|Chronic use of tranquilizers and {{sleeping}} pills such as benzodiazepines {{has been linked}} to onset of agoraphobia. In 10 patients who had developed agoraphobia during benzodiazepine dependence, symptoms abated within the first year of assisted withdrawal.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{research}} {{examines the}} specific contribution of occupation and work organization conditions to <b>alcohol</b> use and <b>misuse.</b> It {{is based on}} a social-action model that takes into account agent personality, structures of daily life, and macro social structures. Methods Data come from a representative sample of 10, 155 workers in Quebec, Canada. Multinomial regression models corrected for sample design effect have been used to predict low-risk and high-risk drinking compared to non-drinkers. The contribution of occupation and work organization conditions (skill used, decision authority, physical and psychological demands, hours worked, irregular work schedule, harassment, unionization, job insecurity, performance pay, prestige) have been adjusted for family situation, social network outside the workplace, and individual characteristics. Results Compared to non-qualified blue-collars, both low-risk and high-risk drinking are associated with qualified blue-collars, semi-qualified white-collars, and middle managers; high-risk drinking is associated with upper managers. For constraints-resources related to work organization conditions, only workplace harassment is an important determinant of both low-risk and high-risk drinking, but it is modestly moderated by occupation. Family situation, social support outside work, and personal characteristics of individuals are also associated with <b>alcohol</b> use and <b>misuse.</b> Non-work factors mediated/suppressed the role of occupation and work organization conditions. Conclusion Occupation and workplace harassment are important factors associated with <b>alcohol</b> use and <b>misuse.</b> The results support the theoretical model conceptualizing <b>alcohol</b> use and <b>misuse</b> as being the product of stress caused by constraints and resources brought to bear simultaneously by agent personality, structures of daily life, and macro social structures. Occupational alcohol researchers must expand their theoretical perspectives to avoid erroneous conclusions about the specific role of the workplace. </p...|$|R

25|$|Wright {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} individuals with psychotic illnesses {{who had been}} in contact with services in the London borough of Croydon over the previous 6 months. Cases of alcohol or substance misuse and dependence were identified through standardized interviews with clients and keyworkers. Results showed that prevalence rates of dual diagnosis were 33% for the use of any substance, 20% for <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse</b> only and 5% for drug misuse only. A lifetime history of any illicit drug use was observed in 35% of the sample.|$|E
25|$|According to this model, {{substance}} abuse problems may arise under two different personality traits: low BIS and high BAS. Since the BAS promotes {{the individual to}} pursue actions that may result in reward, BAS sensitivity {{is involved in the}} initiation of addiction. Significant associations have been found between high BAS such as <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse</b> in school girls, hazardous drinking in men, illicit drug abuse, and tobacco use. BAS sensitivity is a significant predictor of reactivity to substance cues, or cravings. Conversely, BIS sensitivity is involved in avoiding negative situations or affect (such as withdrawal). Low BIS has been positively associated with continuing the addiction to relieve feelings of withdrawal, or for continued use to alleviate negative affect.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that alcohol {{dependence}} relates directly to cravings and irritability. Another study has shown that alcohol use is a significant predisposing factor towards antisocial behavior in children. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder are disorders commonly reported by alcohol dependent people. Alcoholism is associated with dampened activation in brain networks responsible for emotional processing (e.g. the amygdala and hippocampus). Evidence that the mental health disorders are often induced by <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse</b> via distortion of brain neurochemistry is indicated by the improvement or disappearance of symptoms that occurs after prolonged abstinence, although problems may worsen in early withdrawal and recovery periods. Psychosis is secondary to several alcohol-related conditions including acute intoxication and withdrawal after significant exposure. Chronic <b>alcohol</b> <b>misuse</b> can cause psychotic type symptoms to develop, more so than with other drugs of abuse. Alcohol abuse {{has been shown to}} cause an 800% increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a 300% increased risk of psychotic disorders in women which are not related to pre-existing psychiatric disorders. This is significantly higher than the increased risk of psychotic disorders seen from cannabis use making alcohol abuse a very significant cause of psychotic disorders. Approximately 3 percent of people who are alcohol dependent experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal. Alcohol-related psychosis may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as psychosocial impairments. However, moderate wine drinking has been shown to lower the risk for depression.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} cost and {{cost-effectiveness}} of referral to an alcohol health worker (AHW) and information only control in <b>alcohol</b> <b>misusing</b> patients. The study was a pragmatic randomised controlled trial conducted from April 2001 to March 2003 in an {{accident and emergency department}} (AED) in a general hospital in London, England. A total of 599 adults identified as drinking hazardously according to the Paddington Alcohol Test were randomised to referral to an alcohol health worker who delivered a brief intervention (n = 287) or to an information only control (n = 312). Total societal costs, including health and social services costs, criminal justice costs and productivity losses, and clinical measures of alcohol consumption were measured. Levels of drinking were observably lower in those referred to an AHW at 12 months follow-up and statistically significantly lower at 6 months follow-up. Total costs were not significantly different at either follow-up. Referral to AHWs in an AED produces favourable clinical outcomes and does not generate a significant increase in cost. A decision-making approach revealed that there is at least a 65 % probability that referral to an AHW is more cost-effective than the information only control in reducing alcohol consumption among AED attendees with a hazardous level of drinking...|$|R
40|$|Three {{hundred and}} four {{departments}} of anaesthesia in UK and Ireland were sent questionnaires about {{alcohol and drug}} abuse in anaesthetists over the preceding 10 -year period.

The survey achieved a high response rate of 71. 7 % and a total of 130 cases were reported, of whom 34. 6 % were consultants and 43. 2 % were trainees. Over 50 % of respondents felt a lack of confidence in dealing with <b>alcohol</b> or drug <b>misuse</b> amongst colleagues. The results of this survey demonstrate that over one anaesthetist per month has presented with significant <b>alcohol</b> or drug <b>misuse</b> in the UK and Ireland over the last 10 years.

25|$|Alcohol abuse, as {{described}} in the DSM-IV, is a psychiatric diagnosis describing the recurring use of alcoholic beverages despite its negative consequences. Alcohol abuse is sometimes referred to by the less specific term alcoholism. However, many definitions of alcoholism exist, and only some are compatible with alcohol abuse. There are two types of alcoholics: those who have anti social and pleasure-seeking tendencies, and those who are anxiety-ridden- people who are able to go without drinking {{for long periods of time}} but are unable to control themselves once they start. Binge drinking is another form of alcohol abuse.

In Westminster, she pushed for an introduction of minimum unit pricing for alcohol, arguing that a 50p minimum unit price would save almost 3,000 lives a year and save the NHS over £6bn over ten years while costing a moderate drinker only £12 extra per year. When plans to introduce minimum pricing were shelved by the Government in 2013, Wollaston strongly criticised David Cameron and Department for Health Ministers, saying that the change in policy was due to lobbying by Conservative Party strategist Lynton Crosby, whose firm had strong ties to the alcohol industry. Following her comments, she was named MP of the Month by Total Politics for her tough stance.|$|E

40|$|Background When {{a person}} with alcohol use {{disorder}} commits suicide, do the immediate family members (parents, spouses, and children) react differently from the relatives of non-alcohol-related suicides? Methods From a series of 427 psychological autopsies conducted in Estonia we selected 261 cases of suicide where the key informants were close relatives. Of the 261 suicides, 148 met the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol use disorder (alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence), while 113 did not. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the association in terms of emotions. Results The spouses of <b>alcohol</b> <b>misusing</b> suicides {{were significantly more likely}} to react with anger than those when alcohol did not complicate the picture (adjusted OR = 3. 8, 95 % CI = 1. 4 - 0. 4). The children of persons with alcohol use disorder, who committed suicide were less likely to feel guilty (adjusted OR = 0. 2, 95 % CI = 0. 1 - 0. 8) or abandoned (adjusted OR = 0. 2, 95 % CI = 0. 1 - 0. 7) than children of non-alcohol-related suicide victims.
