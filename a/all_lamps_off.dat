40|$|The students’ Work Experience Programme (SWEP) is part {{of effort}} geared towards {{promoting}} practical application of acquired theoretical knowledge so as to develop students’ innovative and creative abilities as well as skills relevant to their chosen career. During the 2012 / 2013 SWEP activities, students were given practical exposure in key aspects of engineering such as mechanical, civil and electrical. This report clearly describes the electrical activities carried out during the 2012 / 2013 Students’ Work Experience Programme (SWEP) undertaken at Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti, Nigeria. Electrical activities undertaken include: construction of extension boxes and wiring of lighting points in series and parallel using 2. 5 mm flexible wire, 2. 5 mm 3 core-cable, sockets, 3 × 6 mm pattress boxes, 13 amps plug, 13 and 15 amp fuse,Junction boxes, etc. Performance evaluations of the developed materials were carried out with electric current flowing through the extension boxes when powered. Also, wires connected in parallel produces very bright illumination because the voltage is the same and not shared but the current varies hence, when one <b>lamp</b> goes <b>off,</b> others are not affected unlike series connection in which the same current flows and the voltage is divided between the lamps producing very dull illumination. Also, when one <b>lamp</b> goes <b>off,</b> <b>all</b> the <b>lamps</b> are put <b>off</b> as well because the current is broken...|$|R

5000|$|<b>All</b> {{fluorescent}} <b>lamps</b> contain mercury, {{and at this}} time, no suitable replacement {{has been}} found. Many US states have banned disposal of lamps containing mercury, and have established regulations requiring that lamps containing mercury are identified as such. This has not caused problems for manufacturers, however, as lamps are not produced locally, and often not in the US. There have been several efforts to label <b>all</b> <b>lamps</b> that contain mercury with a universally accepted symbol, Hg. [...] Old lamps should be handled as would be any hazardous material in your locality, and persons should take special precautions when dealing with broken lamps to avoid contact with mercury. This is particularly true for pregnant women. [...] These laws and guidelines are not unique to tanning lamps, and apply to <b>all</b> fluorescent <b>lamps,</b> other lamps that contain mercury, {{as well as other}} products that contain mercury with the exception of pharmaceuticals. Proper disposal or recycling will prevent the small mercury content of the lamps from entering the environment.|$|R

At the next eighth of a minute, he turns it on again, and he continues thus, flicking the switch each time after waiting exactly one-half the time he waited before flicking it previously. The sum of this infinite series of time intervals is exactly two minutes.|$|R

30|$|This rule {{consists}} of two parts: a precondition (before the symbol ::) and a performance (after the symbol ::). The precondition {{consists of}} a rd on the bag States containing the logical state off and a rd on the bag Sensors of the TelosB object to detect a presence. When the <b>lamp</b> is <b>off,</b> the rule waits for a resource indicating {{a presence in the}} room. This triggers the performance. The performance {{consists of two}} transactions (between {}). The first transaction verifies if the presence is still detected (line 5), sends the command to the lamp (line 6) and updates its logical state (lines 7 and 8). LINC ensures that all the actions are done or none of them. Hence, if the put operation fails on the actuator (e.g., communication error, actuator failure), the <b>lamp</b> stays <b>off</b> in the bag States.|$|R
