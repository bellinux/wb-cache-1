25|$|There was {{negative}} player feedback after release concerning {{the handling of}} playable characters, in particular that Alisha was not playable {{through most of the}} game despite her prominent presence in early promotional material. It was further inflamed by the announcement of Alisha After Episode, with many players saying that Alisha's absence from {{the second half of the}} main game was an excuse to monetize the character. During an appearance at the Taipei Game Show, Baba said that the appearance of characters in promotional material reflected their order of appearance in the game rather than their importance or prominence in the game. He also stated that the story did not have a specific heroine, leaving players the freedom to choose one for themselves. Later, Baba elaborated to Famitsu that the material sent to publications did not specifically refer to Alisha as the game's heroine, although the development team for mobile spin-off Tales of <b>Asteria</b> included information describing Alisha as Zestirias heroine, much to Baba's regret. He further stated that Alisha's story role is important despite her early departure, and that the ability for Rose to wear Alisha's DLC costumes was kept quiet to avoid spoiling the story. Bandai Namco kept this situation in mind while considering whether to release Alisha After Episode with the main game or as a standalone product in the west.|$|E

500|$|Kagame {{was born}} on 23 October 1957, the {{youngest}} of six children, in Tambwe, Ruanda-Urundi, a village located {{in what is now}} the Southern Province of Rwanda. His father, Deogratias, {{was a member of the}} Tutsi ethnic group, from which the royal family had been derived since the eighteenth century or earlier. Deogratias had family ties to King Mutara III, but he chose to pursue an independent business career rather than maintain a close connection to the royal court. Kagame's mother, <b>Asteria</b> Rutagambwa, was also a Tutsi, descended from the family of the last Rwandan queen, Rosalie Gicanda. At the time of Kagame's birth, Rwanda was a United Nations Trust Territory; long-time colonial power Belgium still ruled the territory, but with a mandate to oversee independence. Rwandans were made up of three distinct groups: the minority Tutsi were the traditional ruling class, and the Belgians had long promoted their supremacy, while the majority Hutu were agriculturalists. The third group, the Twa, were a forest-dwelling pygmy people who are descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants and formed less than [...] of the population.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{long-term}} angler-led {{tagging programme}} was to gain information about seasonal changes in distribution of the starry smooth-hound shark Mustelus <b>asterias,</b> along theDutch coast for management and conservation purposes. Between 2011 and 2014, M. <b>asterias</b> comprised 92 · 6 % (n= 2418) of the total elasmobranch catch (n= 2612) by the licenced group of taggers within the Dutch Delta of which 2244 M. <b>asterias</b> were fin-tagged with plastic rototags. Sex and total length (LT) composition inside the eastern tidal basin(Oosterschelde) were significantly different, i. e. more females and larger individuals, than outside indicating a pupping ground, which was confirmed by the capture of 30 newborn pups (≤ 32 cm). The distribution pattern of reported recaptured M. <b>asterias</b> (return-rate 3 · 6 %, n= 80) showed a circannual migration between summering in the southern North Sea and wintering in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, and suggests that M. <b>asterias</b> is philopatric. The Dutch angling season for M. <b>asterias</b> runs from approximately mid-May to mid-October when the water temperature is above 13 ∘ C. Recaptures of eight mature females, but no males in the Bay of Biscay, indicate partial spatial segregation by sex, where mature females migrate over larger distances than immature females and males. These observations, with the absence of recaptures in other known summering areas (i. e. the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel), suggest that the southern North Sea is used by a separate population. Implications for management and recommendations to improve and expand the study approach are discussed...|$|R
