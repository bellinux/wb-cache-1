He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E

25|$|Public {{institutions}} in the U.S. have also drawn fire for accommodating Islam {{at the expense of}} taxpayers. The University of Michigan–Dearborn and a public college in Minnesota have been criticized for accommodating Islamic prayer rituals by constructing footbaths for Muslim students using tax-payers' money. Critics said this special accommodation, which is made to satisfy the needs of Muslims alone, is a violation of Constitutional provisions separating church and state. Along the same constitutional lines, a San Diego public elementary school is being criticized for making special accommodations, specifically for American Muslims, by adding Arabic to its curriculum and giving breaks for Muslim prayers. Some critics said exceptions have not been made for any religious group in the past, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> this as an endorsement of Islam.|$|E

Peter obtains a record of his favorite song, The Trashmen's [...] "Surfin' Bird" [...] from the restaurant (which {{was about to be}} thrown away because it was released in 1963). Peter repeats the song over and over on the way home in bed and even when waking up Lois, annoying his family.

2500|$|Phillip Phillips {{became the}} fifth {{consecutive}} white male {{to win the}} show, which led to some viewers and critics accusing American Idol of having gender and ethnic biases.

The string of white guitar-playing male winners includes David Cook, Kris Allen, Lee DeWyze, and Scotty McCreery who won seasons 7, 8, 9, and 10 respectively.
