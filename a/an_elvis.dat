5|$|The {{album was}} {{created as a}} ploy by Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, to self-release <b>an</b> <b>Elvis</b> Presley album through his own label, Boxcar Records. As it would not consist of content that contractually belonged to RCA Records, Parker was {{theoretically}} able to retain the profits from the album. Having Fun with Elvis on Stage was first distributed at Elvis Presley concerts, but RCA would later package and distribute it.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} the idea of Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager. Parker wished to release <b>an</b> <b>Elvis</b> Presley album through Boxcar Records—a company that he formed to manage Presley's {{commercial}} rights, so that he could profit directly from it. However, since Presley was signed to RCA Records, any recordings made would legally belong to RCA. To circumvent this restriction, Parker compiled audio of Presley talking—material over which RCA could not claim rights.|$|E

5000|$|<b>As</b> <b>Elvis</b> {{starts to}} have another go at Bugs, he falls for Bugs dressed as a pretty hillbilly lady. Very soon, however, he realises its Bugs and shoots at him, Bugs diving into his rabbit hole. Elvis points his rifle in the hole and demands Bugs come out. Bugs refuses. <b>As</b> <b>Elvis</b> gives Bugs the count of four, Bugs {{attaches}} some pipes {{from the end of}} the rifle to where the father buzzard is lounging in his cottage. After the countdown is up, Elvis shoots his father in the face. <b>A</b> misunderstanding makes <b>Elvis</b> shoot his father repeatedly, the continuity made by Bugs, dressed for golf, singing the Art Mooney tune [...] "I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover That I Overlooked Before...

5|$|The {{influence}} of US pop forms has been strong {{since the end}} of World War II. Lavish Broadway-show numbers, big bands, rock and roll, and hip hop continue to be popular. Latin music, especially Brazilian bossa nova, is also popular, and the Puerto Rican genre of reggaeton is rapidly becoming a mainstream form of dance music. It is now not uncommon for modern Italian pop artists such as Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, Zucchero or Andrea Bocelli to release new songs in English or Spanish in addition to, or instead of, Italian. Thus, musical revues, which are standard fare on current Italian television, can easily go, in a single evening, from a big-band number with dancers to <b>an</b> <b>Elvis</b> impersonator to a current pop singer doing a rendition of a Puccini aria.|$|E
