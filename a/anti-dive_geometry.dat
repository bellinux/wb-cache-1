25|$|The {{development}} of the Watt's linkage rear suspension came first. This {{was followed by the}} front anti-dive modifications. The {{development of}} the <b>anti-dive</b> <b>geometry</b> was actually done quite quickly. To meet AMC’s schedule, Kaplan copied the basic design of the inner fender components from a Mustang. He added two more degrees of anti-dive to the Mustang’s 4 degrees, made the drawings, and sent them to the factory. The manufacture of the parts was then contracted to Central Stamping. Despite succeeding in developing the parts as a rush job, however, there was no capacity to fit the components to the unibody on the 1969 assembly line, so it fell to Kaplan to incorporate them into the cars when they arrived in his shop as bodies in white. Other related suspension pieces were also acquired through specialty manufacturers who were also building performance parts for Ford.|$|E
2500|$|The XJ6, using 2.8-litre (...) and 4.2-litre (...) straight-six {{cylinder}} {{versions of}} Jaguar's renowned XK engine, replaced most of Jaguar's saloons – which, in the 1960s, had expanded to four separate ranges. Apart from the engines, other main assemblies carried over from previous models were the widest version of Jaguar's IRS unit from the Mark X and the subframe mounted {{independent front suspension}} first seen in the 1955 2.4-litre with new <b>anti-dive</b> <b>geometry.</b>|$|E

50|$|Chapman's efforts {{produced}} one of {{the most}} remarkable and successful designs in F1 history. Taking the stressed engine layout technique from the Lotus 49 and adding advanced aerodynamics produced a car that was years ahead of its rivals. To begin with however, problems with the handling of the car had to be overcome, due to a lack of 'feel' caused by the <b>anti-dive</b> suspension <b>geometry</b> - which was designed to prevent the nose of the car dipping significantly under braking - and the anti-squat set-up at the rear, which was supposed to stop the car 'squatting down' under acceleration. Once the suspension was modified, there were no further problems. The car caused a sensation amongst the media and fans, with many people clamouring to see the remarkable car in action.|$|R
50|$|At the knuckle end, single {{ball joints}} are {{typically}} used, {{in which case}} the steering loads have to be taken via a steering arm, and the wishbones look A- or L-shaped. An L-shaped arm is generally preferred on passenger vehicles because it allows a better compromise of handling and comfort to be tuned in. The bushing in line with the wheel can be kept relatively stiff to effectively handle cornering loads while the off-line joint can be softer to allow the wheel to recess under fore-aft impact loads. For a rear suspension, a pair of joints can be used {{at both ends of the}} arm, making them more H-shaped in plan view. Alternatively, a fixed-length driveshaft can perform the function of a wishbone as long as the shape of the other wishbone provides control of the upright. This arrangement has been successfully used in the Jaguar IRS. In elevation view, the suspension is a 4-bar link, and it is easy to work out the camber gain (see camber angle) and other parameters for a given set of bushing or ball-joint locations. The various bushings or ball joints do not have to be on horizontal axes, parallel to the vehicle centre line. If they are set at an angle, then <b>anti-dive</b> and anti-squat <b>geometry</b> can be dialled in.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} Independent damper struts {{with separate}} coil springs and gas-pressurised shock absorbers, triangular lower control arms with <b>anti-dive</b> <b>geometry</b> and stabiliser bar.|$|E
50|$|The car has race-derived pushrod {{suspension}} with <b>anti-dive</b> <b>geometry</b> and is {{complemented by}} Multimatic’s Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve (DSSV) adjustable dampers and anti-roll bars front and rear, driver-adjustable anti-lock braking, and variable traction control.|$|E

50|$|The brakes are {{ventilated}} carbon ceramic discs, 398 mm six-piston callipers in {{the front}} and 360 mm four-piston callipers in the rear. The suspension is a lightweight aluminium front subframe with hollow castings with independent double wishbones incorporating <b>anti-dive</b> <b>geometry,</b> coil springs, anti-roll bar, and monotube adaptive dampers {{in the front}} and independent double wishbones with anti-squat and anti-lift geometry, coil springs, anti-roll bar, and monotube adaptive dampers in the rear. It has a three-stage adjustable adaptive damping system including normal, sport and track modes. The tires are Pirelli P Zeros, 255/ZR20 {{in the front and}} 305/30 ZR20 in the rear.|$|E
50|$|The Bronco was {{designed}} under engineer Paul G. Axelrad. The axles and brakes from the Ford F-100 {{four wheel drive}} pickup truck were used, but the front axle was located by radius arms (from the frame near {{the rear of the}} transmission forward to the axle). A lateral track bar allowed the use of coil springs that gave the Bronco a 34 ft turning circle, long wheel travel, and an <b>anti-dive</b> <b>geometry,</b> which was useful for snowplowing. The rear suspension was more conventional, with leaf springs in a typical Hotchkiss design. A shift-on the-fly Dana transfer case and locking hubs were standard, and heavy-duty suspension was an option.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the front}} <b>anti-dive</b> <b>geometry</b> which was introduded on the Lotus 31, and the rear {{anti-squat}} geometry with unparallel radius arms (that counters the rear camber and toe-in reductions under braking) which was introduced with the 41C, were fully developed on the 41X (which had multiple suspension arm attachment points), and the setup {{found to be}} the best is incorporated into the 59 frame. While the 59 used Triumph Herald front uprights, the 59B used the Formula Two version Lotus 41X uprights and brakes shared with Lotus 47A. Hubs and wheels were knock-off type with spin-on central lock nut, except for the Formula Ford version, which had the Ford production 4 lugnut configuration as per the formula.|$|E
