5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of <b>American</b> <b>values.</b> The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E
5|$|The Depression {{began in}} the United States in October 1929 and grew {{steadily}} worse to its nadir in early 1933. President Herbert Hoover feared that too much intervention or coercion by the government would destroy individuality and self-reliance, which he considered to be important <b>American</b> <b>values.</b> His laissez-faire views appeared to be shared by the Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon. To combat with the growing economic decline, Hoover organized a number of voluntary measures with businesses, encouraged {{state and local government}} responses, and accelerated federal building projects. However his policies had little or no effect on economic recovery. Toward the end of his term, however, Hoover supported several legislative solutions which he felt might lift the country out of the depression. The final attempt of the Hoover administration to rescue the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act (which provided funds for public works programs) and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) (which provided low-interest loans to businesses).|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the role of cultural values in the resilience of Mexican American college students. Utilizing mixed methodology, 124 self-identified Mexican American college {{students were asked to}} complete an online survey, including a demographic questionnaire, the Resilience Scale, Mexican <b>American</b> Cultural <b>Values</b> Scale, and 2 open-ended questions concerning overcoming adversity and cultural values. As hypothesized, Mexican <b>American</b> traditional cultural <b>values</b> (Familismo, Respeto, Religiosidad, and Traditional Gender Roles) predicted resilience, with Familismo accounting {{for the majority of the}} variance. Consensual qualitative research (Hill, Thompson, & Nutt Williams, 1997) was used to identify emergent domains and themes within the open-ended question responses. Traditional Mexican <b>American</b> <b>Value</b> themes included Familismo, Ethnic Identity, Religiosidad, Perseverance, and Respeto. Results highlight the important role that certain Mexican <b>American</b> cultural <b>values</b> play in roviding strength for overcoming adversities. © 2013 American Psychological Association...|$|R
40|$|Based on the CAD Triad Hypothesis (Rozin, Lowery, Imada, & Haidt, 1999), {{the authors}} {{hypothesized}} relationships between specific values and display rules for specific emotions. In particular, the authors proposed that Conservation and Self-Enhancement would {{be related to}} the display rule to express contempt, Conservation would {{be related to the}} display rule to express disgust, and Openness to Change and Self-Transcendence would be related to the display rules to express anger and sadness. To test this framework and its cross-cultural applicability, the present study examines values and emotional display rules among 106 U. S. Americans and 77 Germans. As predicted, <b>Americans</b> <b>valued</b> Conservation and Self-Enhancement more than did Germans, who valued Openness to Change and Self-Transcendence more than did <b>Americans.</b> These <b>value</b> differences were associated with differences in display rules; Americans endorsed contempt and disgust expressions more than did Germans, who endorsed anger and sadness expressions more than did <b>Americans.</b> <b>Values</b> mediated (“unpackaged”) many of these country differences in display rules. Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

The results of this year's survey demonstrate that education remains a top priority for voters despite concerns over a conflict with Iraq, the threat of international terrorism, rising medical insurance costs, and growing unemployment.

40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{postulate}} {{that the cultural}} differences in age-related relationship orientation are moderated by values. The sample included 268 European Americans and 268 Chinese Americans, aged 20 - 90 years. Age positively correlated with relationship orientation (Ren Qing) among Chinese Americans but not among European <b>Americans.</b> However, <b>values</b> moderated these age differences. The association between age and relationship orientation became positive among European <b>Americans</b> who <b>valued</b> Tradition (seeking group acceptance) more. Conversely, the positive association between age and relationship orientation was weaker among Chinese <b>Americans</b> who <b>valued</b> Hedonism (seeking individual pleasure) more. These findings suggest that people from each culture develop their relationship orientation with age according to what they value. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
