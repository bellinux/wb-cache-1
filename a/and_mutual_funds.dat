25|$|The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) {{reported}} that growth for stock and commodities traders was forecast {{to be greater}} than 21% between 2006 and 2016. In that period, stock traders would benefit from trends driven by pensions of baby boomers and their decreased reliance on Social Security. U.S. Treasury bonds would also be traded on a more fluctuating basis. Stock traders just entering the field suffer since few entry-level positions exist. While entry into this career field is very competitive, increased ownership of stocks <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> drive substantial career growth of traders. Banks were also offering more opportunities for people of average means to invest and speculate in stocks. The BLS {{reported that}} stock traders had median annual incomes of $68,500. Experienced traders of stocks <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> {{have the potential to}} earn more than $145,600 annually.|$|E
25|$|However, this {{simplicity}} {{depends on}} the absence of deductions of any kind being allowed (or at least no variability in the deductions of different people). Furthermore, if income of differing types are segregated (e.g., pass-through, long term cap gains, regular income, etc.) then complications ensue. For example, if realized capital gains were subject to the flat tax, the law would require brokers <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> to calculate the realized capital gain on all sales and redemption. If there were a gain, a tax equal to 15% {{of the amount of}} the gain would be withheld and sent to the IRS. If there were a loss, the amount would be reported to the IRS. The loss would offset gains, and then the IRS would settle up with taxpayers {{at the end of the}} period. Lacking deductions, this scheme cannot be used to implement economic and social policy indirectly by tax credits and thus, as noted above, the simplifications to the government's revenue collection apparatus might be offset by new government ministries required to administer those policies.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} dynamic {{relationship}} between stock returns <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> flows in India by using a generalised VAR model. We find that spillover shocks-that is, stock return shocks <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> flow shocks together explain as much as 20 % of the total forecast error variance of stock returns <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> flows. We create a spillover index of shocks emanating from stock returns <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> flows <b>and</b> tests whether it can actually predict stock returns <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>fund</b> flows.

40|$|<b>Mutual</b> <b>funds</b> {{underwent}} some {{rapid development}} during 2008 - 2011, this was {{indicated by the}} escalation {{of a number of}} NAB and its inclusion units value. However, <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> still experience efficiency inconsistency on their operating activities. This research’s purpose is to analyse the efficiency level on each <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> to compare efficiency between stock <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> stock <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> stock <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> fixed-income <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> <b>funds.</b> There are eighty-nine <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> used as samples done by purposive sampling on this research; twenty-nine stock <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> twenty-nine fixed-income <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> twenty-one mixed <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> nine protected <b>mutual</b> <b>funds.</b> This research used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. A Unit Kegiatan Ekonomi (UKE) is considered efficient if the efficiency value reachs perfection (100 percent), on the contrary when the efficiency value is less than 100 percent, then the UKE is rated as inefficient. The variables on this research are chosen based on intermediation approach. The input variables are standard deviation of return, investation processing services cost ratio, custodian services cost ratio, other fees cost ratio, and redemption cost; and the output variables are average return and assets growth toward return. To find out the efficiency value difference on each <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> the research used Mann Whitney U test. The result of analysis using DEA method indicated that fixed-income <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011 incline to have efficiency increase even though it’s fluctuating with the average of 84. 03 percent in fixed-income <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> 81. 04 percent in mixed <b>mutual</b> <b>funds.</b> Mann Whitney U hypothesis testing shows that there is no efficiency difference between stock <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> fixed-income <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> stock <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011; but there is an efficiency difference between stock <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed <b>mutual</b> <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 201...|$|R

2500|$|Nevertheless, {{although}} {{hedge funds}} {{go to great}} lengths to reduce the ratio of risk to reward, inevitably a number of risks remain. Systemic risk is increased in a crisis if there is [...] "herd" [...] behaviour, which causes a number of similar hedge funds to make losses in similar trades. In addition, while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage, hedge funds differ from many other market participants, such as banks <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds,</b> in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage, and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy. [...] The extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis, particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments. The close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers, typically investment banks, can lead to domino effects in a crisis, and indeed failing counterparty banks can freeze hedge funds. These systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets. [...] The global hedge fund industry has over $2 trillion in assets, and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage, which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested.|$|E
2500|$|While {{shareholders}} have {{a privileged}} position in UK corporate governance, most are themselves institutions - mainly asset managers - holding [...] "other people's money" [...] from pension funds, life insurance policies <b>and</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>funds.</b> Shareholding institutions, who are entered on the share registers of public {{companies on the}} London Stock Exchange, are mainly asset managers and they infrequently exercise their governance rights. In turn, asset managers take money from other institutional investors, particularly pension funds, mutual funds and insurance funds, own most shares. Thousands or perhaps millions of persons, particularly through pensions, are beneficiaries from the returns on shares. Historically institutions have often not voted or participated in general meetings on their beneficiaries' behalf, and often display an uncritical pattern of supporting management. Under the Pensions Act 2004 sections 241 to 243 require that pension fund trustees are elected or appointed to be accountable to the beneficiaries of the fund, while the Companies Act 2006 section 168 ensures that directors are accountable to shareholders. However, the rules of contract, equity and fiduciary duty that operate between asset managers and the real capital investors have not been codified. Government reports have suggested, and case law requires, that asset managers follow the instructions about voting rights from investors in pooled funds according to the proportion of their investment, and follow instructions entirely when investors have separate accounts. Some institutional investors {{have been found to}} work [...] "behind the scenes" [...] to achieve corporate governance objectives through informal but direct communication with management, although an increasing concern has developed since the global financial crisis that asset managers and all financial intermediaries face structural conflicts of interest and should be banned from voting on other people's money entirely. Individual shareholders form an increasingly small part of total investments, while foreign investment and institutional investor ownership have grown their share steadily over the last forty years. Institutional investors, who deal with other people's money, are bound by fiduciary obligations, deriving from the law of trusts and obligations to exercise care deriving from the common law. The Stewardship Code 2010, drafted by the Financial Reporting Council (the corporate governance watchdog), reinforces the duty on institutions to actively engage in governance affairs by disclosing their voting policy, voting record and voting. The aim is to make directors more accountable, at least, to investors of capital.|$|E
