50|$|Central {{focusing}} is {{an arrangement}} which involves rotation {{of a central}} focusing wheel to adjust both tubes together. In addition, {{one of the two}} eyepieces can be further adjusted to compensate for differences between the viewer's eyes (usually by rotating the eyepiece in its mount). Because the focal change effected by the <b>adjustable</b> <b>eyepiece</b> can be measured in the customary unit of refractive power, the diopter, the <b>adjustable</b> <b>eyepiece</b> itself is often called a diopter. Once this adjustment has been made for a given viewer, the binoculars can be refocused on an object at a different distance by using the focusing wheel to adjust both tubes together without eyepiece readjustment.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1675 the {{brothers}} Christiaan and Constantine Huygens decided {{to accommodate the}} very long focal length objectives they were creating by eliminating the tube altogether. In the Huygens' [...] "aerial" [...] telescope the objective was mounted inside a short iron tube mounted on a swiveling ball-joint {{on top of an}} <b>adjustable</b> mast. The <b>eyepiece</b> was mounted in another short tube (sometimes on a stand), and the two tubes were kept aligned by a taut connecting string. Christiaan Huygens published designs for these tubeless [...] "aerial telescopes" [...] in his 1684 book Astroscopia Compendiaria, and their invention has been attributed to him and his brother Constantijn, although similar designs were also used by Adrien Auzout; the idea is even sometimes attributed to Christopher Wren.|$|R
