2500|$|Unlike {{previous}} first-person shooters in the Halo franchise, Halo 5: Guardians {{does not}} feature any offline capabilities, including split-screen cooperative campaign and multiplayer modes; {{it also does}} not have any local networking options. Microsoft Studios corporate vice president Phil Spencer commented on the lack of split-screen, stating [...] "We see the robustness of what Xbox Live is today and where people are playing across Xbox Live—you at your house, me <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>house.</b> We know that's {{the vast majority of the}} co-op play. With Halo 5, the team really wanted to focus on making that experience great, both visually on the screen that you're looking at, and all the systems in place." ...|$|E
2500|$|González's parents, Manuel Antonio González and Carmen Alire Alonso, {{migrated}} from the Mexican state of Chihuahua to the U.S. {{in the early}} 1900s. González was born in 1928, the eldest of seven children. Kramer writes that [...] "Gorgo was not the poor Mexican-American that people assumed. He didn't come from a wealthy family, but from a stable middle-class background, probably a lot like mine. He had a great mother {{and there was always}} a warm feeling of family loyalty. If anything, he might have been spoiled as a kid. It's a shame he suffered discrimination because of his Mexican heritage". However, according to other sources, Gonzales's father worked as a house-painter and he, along with his six siblings, were raised in a working-class neighborhood. In his autobiography, González states, [...] "We had few luxuries <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>house.</b> Food wasn't abundant but it was simple and filling, and we never went hungry. Our clothes were just clothes – inexpensive but clean." ...|$|E
2500|$|Madhubala's {{illness was}} known to Kishore, but like all the others, he did not realize its gravity; Ataullah Khan did not approve of his {{son-in-law}} at all, but he had lost the courage to disapprove. Ashok Kumar reminisced in a Filmfare interview: [...] "She suffered a lot and her illness made her very bad-tempered. She often fought with Kishore, and would take off to her father's house where she {{spent most of her}} time." [...] Madhubala's sister echoes this view albeit in a slightly different tone: [...] "After marriage they flew to London where the doctor told her she had only two years to live. After that Kishore left her <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>house</b> saying: 'I can't look after her. I'm on outdoors often'. But she wanted to be with him. He’d visit her once in two months, though. Maybe he wanted to detach himself from her so that the final separation wouldn't hurt. But he never abused her as was reported. He bore her medical expenses. They remained married for nine years.|$|E

2500|$|Geffen {{opted to}} refer to the breakup as an [...] "indefinite hiatus," [...] and label {{president}} Jordan Schur reportedly told Barker that [...] "any press you do, make sure you say everything is cool." [...] Immediately following DeVoe's phone call, Hoppus and Barker began laying down new ideas. Recording in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room, by necessity everything was electronic, with the two musicians experimenting with electronic drums, samples, keyboards and direct computer recordings. While away on a trip in April 2005, Hoppus participated in an interview with MTV News in which he revealed the band's existence, saying [...] "Right now, Travis and I are using the time off to start this project called Plus-44 [...] It's very exciting, like a breath of fresh air." [...] When the two regrouped, they decided to stop giving interviews about the new project. [...] "It was strange to be talking about music that we were just in the very first steps of writing," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "It didn’t feel right to talk about yet." [...] The band's name is a reference to the country code needed when placing a phone call to the United Kingdom, where Hoppus and Barker first discussed making music alone. [...] "When we first started talking about ever doing anything outside of blink was on the last European tour where Tom was telling us that he needed to take a year off from the band. [...] We never did anything about it until Tom quit the band, but that's where it first started," [...] said Hoppus. The basement recordings were ambient and quiet by necessity. [...] "We were recording and we didn't want the cops showing up <b>at</b> <b>our</b> <b>house</b> at 2 a.m. because we were recording drums," [...] remembered Hoppus.|$|E

60|$|Sometimes, I {{was once}} more {{on my way}} to North Villa, after my week's absence <b>at</b> <b>our</b> country <b>house.</b> I saw again the change in Margaret since I had left her--the paleness, the restlessness, the {{appearance}} of agitation. I took the hand of Mannion, and started as I felt its deadly coldness, and remarked the strange alteration in his manner. When they accounted for these changes by telling me that both had been ill, in different ways, since my departure, I detected the miserable lie at once; I knew that an evil advantage had been taken of my absence; that the plot against me was fast advancing towards consummation: and that, at the sight of their victim, even the two wretches who were compassing my dishonour could not repress all outward manifestation of their guilt.|$|R

30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{distance}} of residential properties to the Little Miami Scenic Trail, our results confirm that the Little Miami Scenic Trail generates a premium for houses that lies inside the 10, 000 feet (3048  m) buffer around the rail trail. Using network distances, our SLX results show that decreasing the distance by 1 foot (0.305  m) appreciates property values by 0.00024 %. Taking a closer look <b>at</b> <b>our</b> average <b>house</b> prices <b>at</b> $ 383, 571, decreasing the distance by 1 foot (0.305  m) is equivalent {{to an increase in}} value of $ 0.92 per foot ($ 3.02 per meter). What appears to be only a marginal effect becomes quite significant, when one would compare our $ 383, 571 house that is 7859 feet (2395  m) away from its closest trail to exactly the same house adjacent to the trail. The house adjacent to the trail would be priced 1.89 % ($ 7238) higher.|$|R

40|$|The main {{intention}} {{of this book}} is to instil {{a sense of responsibility}} to the developers and policymakers as well as create an important awareness to the public about the conditions of <b>our</b> <b>housing</b> estates. We are living in a time bomb or a volcano that has shown ripples of signs of eruption. From issues of children dying of accidents and falling from buildings to health hazards for adults as well as the effects air conditioning might have on community interaction and cultural violations which increase inter–racial tensions, we must re–look <b>at</b> <b>our</b> attitude towards our billion ringgit investment. Malaysia is a country that no longer has a third world infrastructure but can be considered as a modern and up–to–date first world infrastructure. But <b>our</b> <b>housing</b> is still left in the throes of this third world mindset of ‘basic shelter’. We have evolved so far as a nation ironically, <b>our</b> <b>housing</b> attitude has not gone a far. The book presents a series of criticism and thoughts on <b>our</b> <b>housing</b> and community architecture based on a series of articles and seminar papers presented. It is hoped that this book might create a rethinking of the way we live in a radically new way...|$|R
