5|$|The city {{consists}} of five areas: Lefty's Bar, a hotel casino, a 24-hour wedding chapel, a discothèque, and a convenience store. The player can walk between {{areas that are}} next to each other, but other areas can only be accessed by hailing a taxi, which costs the player money; {{failure to do so}} results in Larry's being mugged or hit by oncoming traffic. During {{the early stages of the}} game, Larry can survive most premature deaths. In the original release, a compartment opens beneath Larry's body and takes him to a laboratory where heroes from Sierra's computer games—such as King's Quest—are re-assembled; in the remake, Larry's remains are instead thrown inside <b>a</b> <b>blender</b> and reformed.|$|E
