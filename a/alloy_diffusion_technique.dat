40|$|The {{sulfidation}} of Fe-Cr alloys {{has a large}} financial {{significance for}} industries that use fossil fuels, such as the electric utility industry. Therefore, the sulfidation {{of a series of}} Fe-Cr alloys was studied at 600 °C using a solid-state <b>diffusion</b> couple <b>technique.</b> The <b>diffusion</b> couple <b>technique</b> combined Fe 0. 95 S powder and FeCr binary alloys together in a configuration that allowed for post-heat-treatment microanalysis using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). The results showed that only two different diffusion couple microstructures formed in samples spanning the entire Fe-Cr binary range. The Fe-rich <b>alloy</b> <b>diffusion</b> couples contained a surface αFeCr layer and an internal sulfide precipitate layer that contained three different sulfide phases. The Cr-rich <b>alloy</b> <b>diffusion</b> couples also possessed an internal precipitate layer, as well as a thick, triplex interfacial scale. The ternary elemental diffusion was described using diffusion paths plotted on the 600 °C isothermal section of the Fe-Cr-S phase diagram. The results also showed that samples with less than 51 wt Pct Cr were more sulfidation resistant. The accuracy of the existing Fe-Cr-S 600 °C isothermal section was assessed, and it was determined that the τ phase field had a larger composition than previously published...|$|R

30|$|Just like {{in every}} {{communication}} among entities, {{the reliability of}} information exchange between nanomachines depends {{on the characteristics of}} the communication medium. The ability to integrate the knowledge of the medium characteristics into the design and analysis of the nanomachines is dependent on the appropriateness of the model that is used to mimic the propagation behavior. Popular molecular propagation mechanisms include the use of molecular motors [17 – 19], bacteria [20, 21], and molecular diffusion [22, 23]. The focus of this paper is on the molecular <b>diffusion</b> <b>technique</b> for information exchange among nanomachines. In molecular <b>diffusion</b> <b>technique,</b> information in the form of molecular concentration or type is broadcasted and received by a nanoreceiver, which processes and decodes the information based on predefined biochemical algorithms.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{anisotropic}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>technique</b> that is tailored to ultrasound images.

The diffusion method mimics traditional anisotropic diffusion {{in the sense of}} directional sensitivity. As a result, homogeneous regions are smoothed in an intra-region manner and edges can be enhanced and extracted in the presence of speckle. We provide a series of experiments using synthetically developed models of the carotid artery. The experiments investigate the effect of varying edge orientation, level of noise, and amount of image contrast. Results from the novel <b>diffusion</b> <b>technique</b> are compared with the conventional approaches, revealing the efficacy of the proposed method. 1...|$|R
40|$|Typical halftoning {{implementations}} in 600 dpi {{color printing}} systems have significant image quality limitations. Error <b>diffusion</b> <b>techniques</b> frequently exhibit objectionable artifacts that include noise in highlight regions, patterning in mid-tone regions, worming, and edge melting.

We describe a modified error <b>diffusion</b> <b>technique</b> that achieves quality improvements over previous techniques while remaining computationally tractable. The central idea is that the threshold for the ED process is modulated according to a set of spatio-chromatically correlated 2 D screens. We discuss the relative image quality of the algorithm in the context of both single- and multi-channel visual models...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between anisotropic diffusion and local monotonicity. A <b>diffusion</b> <b>technique</b> that has locally monotonic root signals is presented. The enhancement algorithm rapidly converges to a locally monotonic signal of the desired degree. It is shown that the diffusion coefficient used here is the only formation that guarantees idempotence for locally monotonic signals. The signals resulting from locally monotonic diffusion are closer to the original signals than the corresponding median root signals. Furthermore, the diffusion algorithm {{does not have a}} difficulty with alternating signals, as does the median filter. In contrast to other anisotropic <b>diffusion</b> <b>techniques,</b> the <b>diffusion</b> method given here does not preserve outliers and does not require a gradient magnitude threshold in the diffusion coefficient...|$|R
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on foliar fertilization. It is {{nowadays}} {{one of the most}} widespread types of application of commercial fertilizers. Concern of this thesis is the study of plant cuticles as a thin layer on the leaves. These thin membranes are responsible for regulation of water transport and nutrients. Further function of plant cuticles is the mechanical protection of the outer part of the plant. Plant cuticles were characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy, classical optical microscopy and profilometry. The main aim of this thesis is the optimization and verification of experimental methodology aimed to the transport of commercial humic product through plant cuticles by simple <b>diffusion</b> <b>techniques.</b> The results obtained by presented <b>diffusion</b> <b>techniques</b> of humic product through plant cuticles were correlated with the same diffusion experiments through synthetic membranes with defined pore size and density.

The important part of this diploma thesis is the characterization of supported hydrogel matrix by rheology tests, mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanned electron microscopy.
