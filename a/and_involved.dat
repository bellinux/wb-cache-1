5|$|At {{the time}} Britain was still Australia's major trading partner, {{although}} it would be overtaken by Japan and the United States by the 1960s. The two countries still had strong cultural ties, and Menzies was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain was still the largest source of immigrants to Australia, largely because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage. Australian and British troops were fighting the communists together in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be closely integrated with those of Britain, <b>and</b> <b>involved</b> reinforcing the British forces in the Middle East and Far East.|$|E

On 24 January 1940, Ljubljana ran into a reef off the Yugoslav port of Šibenik.

One crew member died, and the captain was arrested pending an investigation.|$|E

The use of ironclads by {{both sides in the}} American Civil War, and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa, had an important influence on the development of ironclad design.|$|E
