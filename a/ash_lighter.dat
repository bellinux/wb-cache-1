40|$|Multi-zone {{models of}} Type I X-ray bursts are {{presented}} that use an adaptive nuclear reaction network of unprecedented size, up to 1300 isotopes. Sequences {{of up to}} 15 bursts are followed for two choices of accretion rate and metallicity. At 0. 1 Eddington (and 0. 02 Eddington for low metallicity), combined hydrogen-helium flashes occur. The rise times, shapes, and tails of these light curves {{are sensitive to the}} efficiency of nuclear burning at various waiting points along the rp-process path and these sensitivities are explored. The bursts show "compositional inertia", in that their properties depend on the fact that accretion occurs onto the ashes of previous bursts which contain left-over hydrogen, helium and CNO nuclei. This acts to reduce the sensitivity of burst properties to metallicity. For the accretion rates studied, only the first anomalous burst in one model produces nuclei as heavy as A= 100, other bursts make chiefly nuclei with A~ 64. The amount of carbon remaining after hydrogen-helium bursts is typically < 1 % by mass, and decreases further as the ashes are periodically heated by subsequent bursts. At the lower accretion rate of 0. 02 Eddington and solar metallicity, the bursts ignite in a hydrogen-free helium layer. At the base of this layer, up to 90 % of the helium has already burned to carbon prior to the unstable ignition. These helium-ignited bursts have briefer, brighter light curves with shorter tails, very rapid rise times (< 0. 1 s), and <b>ashes</b> <b>lighter</b> than the iron group.

50|$|The name White Ash {{derives from}} the {{glaucous}} undersides of the leaves. It is similar in appearance to the Green Ash, making identification difficult. The lower sides of the leaves of White <b>Ash</b> are <b>lighter</b> in color than their upper sides, and the outer surface of the twigs of White Ash may be flaky or peeling. Green Ash leaves are similar in color on upper and lower sides, and twigs are smoother. Despite some overlap, the two species tend to grow in different locations as well; White Ash is a forest tree that commonly occurs alongside Sugar Maple while Green Ash is a pioneer species that inhabits riparian zones and disturbed areas.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The mercury removal {{performance}} of the 150 mesh coal fly ash was evaluated through multiphase flow reactor designed by Shanghai University of Electric Power and different types of fly ash and absorption liquid were analyzed with HYDRA AA. The results showed that UV light almost had no oxidation capacity for gaseous mercury without fly ash, but the removal efficiency was significantly improved from 38. 5 % to 66. 1 % in the UV light by adding fly ash into the simulated flue gas. The fly ash after exposure to UV irradiation can improve the removal efficiency of Hg and the capture capacity of oxidized Hg had been greatly enhanced.

The lava dome, which had {{expanded}} to 250 m long and 120 m high, cracked open and lava began oozing {{into the surrounding}} water.

40|$|When the {{interval}} between a transient <b>ash</b> of <b>light</b> (a "cue") and a second visual response signal (a "target") exceeds at least 200 ms, responding is slowest in the direction indicated by the first signal. This phenomenon is {{commonly referred to as}} inhibition of return (IOR). The dynamic neural field model (DNF) has proven to have broad explanatory power for IOR, effectively capturing many empirical results. Previous work has used a short-term depression (STD) implementation of IOR, but this approach fails to explain many behavioral phenomena observed in the literature. Here, we explore a variant model of IOR involving a combination of STD and delayed direct collicular inhibition. We demonstrate that this hybrid model can better reproduce established behavioural results. We use the results of this model to propose several experiments that would yield particularly valuable insight into the nature of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying IOR...|$|R

50|$|Fraxinus caroliniana, {{commonly}} known as the pop ash, Florida ash, swamp ash, Carolina ash, or water ash, is a species of ash tree native from Cuba through the subtropical southeastern United States from southern Virginia to Texas.

Leaves are compound, opposite, 7-12 in long, leaflets 5-7 in, ovate to oblong, coarsely serrate or entire, 3-6 in long, 2-3 in wide. Fruit is frequently 3-winged (samara) with flat seed portion; seed sometimes a bright violet color.

40|$|The decay {{from the}} photo-induced charge {{separated}} state of a photosynthetic reaction center (RC) depends strongly on the occupancy of the binding {{site of the}} secondary quinone, Q(B). In the case of RCs from the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the kinetics of charge recombination following a single turnover <b>ash</b> of <b>light</b> {{were found to be}} markedly different in detergent micelles and phospholipid vesicles at the same quinone to RC ratio. We ascribed this behavior to a statistical heterogeneity in the number of RC and quinone molecules distributed among the micelle and vesicle population. A general description of this heterogeneity in terms of the distribution functions of RC and quinone among the host particle ensemble was developed and the kinetics of charge recombination were calculated accordingly. The results obtained by assuming that the distribution functions of RC and quinone are gamma-distributions agree with the measured kinetics and show deviations from the behaviour of a homogeneous system. The deviations are particularly strong at a low mean number of proteins and ligands per host particle. The model developed has a general relevance to the study of quinone membrane protein interactions in both artificial and native vesicular systems...|$|R

40|$|Volcanic eruptions {{that shape}} the earth’s surface can have major effect on {{ecosystems}} and, as natural experiments, can yield insights into ecological dynamics. On 04 June 2011, a mega-eruption in the Puyehue volcanic complex (Chile) discharged {{massive amounts of}} ash and pumice. Using long-term data from five North Andean Patagonian lakes (Espejo, Correntoso, Nahuel Huapi, Gutiérrez, and Mascardi) that received differing levels of ash, we show that, in Lakes Espejo, Correntoso, and Nahuel Huapi, these inputs resulted in 1. 5 - to 8 -fold increases in total suspended solids, light extinction, phosphorus concentrations, and phytoplankton biomass relative to pre-eruption conditions. Although <b>ashes</b> affected <b>light</b> scattering, the ultraviolet: photosynthetically active radiation ratio remained, 0. 30 – 0. 35 in all the lakes and no changes were seen in dissolved organic carbon in the affected lakes post-eruption. Thus, no differential specific absorption of the different light wavelengths occurred due to ash input. The results of multiple regression analysis identified light extinction coefficient of PAR (KPAR) as the primary variable that was associated with variation in phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll). Furthermore, incubation experiments demonstrated significant effects of photoinhibition on phytoplankton growth in these lakes at ambient pre-eruption light intensities. Thus, we infer that increased phytoplankton biomass following the eruption likely reflects nutrient (phosphorus) loading and attenuation of excessive ligh...|$|R
