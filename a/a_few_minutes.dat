5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{the student}} {{returned}} with {{the description of the}} Ichthus Heliodiplodokus, or whatever term is used to conceal the common sunfish from vulgar knowledge, family of Heliichtherinkus, etc., as found in textbooks of the subject.|$|E
5|$|At {{least six}} of the U.S. ships—including Laffey, O'Bannon, Atlanta, SanFrancisco, Portland, and Helena—fired at Akatsuki, which drew {{attention}} to herself with her illuminated searchlight. The Japanese destroyer was hit repeatedly and blew up and sank within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E

5|$|Certain {{effects of}} light only last for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> thus the canvases documenting such ephemera {{received}} attention {{for no more}} than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> a day. Further complicating matters, the light of subsequent sunrises, for example, could alter substantially and would require separate canvases within the series. Subsequently, different hues are evident in each painting, and in each work, color is used to describe not only direct but reflected light. At differing times of day and in various seasons stacks absorb the light from diverse parts of the color spectrum. As a result, the residual light that is reflected off of the stacks is seen as ever-changing, and manifests in distinctive coloring.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} morning {{surprise}} attack, on June15, 1914, Thomson {{was shot in the}} chest (despite the fact that rebels were attacking behind him) and died within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> It is probable that an Italian sniper was responsible.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Liverpool {{had a chance to}} score. Callaghan took a throw-in, which he threw to Lawler, his cross into the Leeds penalty area was met by Hunt, but his header went wide of the goal. Liverpool {{continued}} to pressure and only an interception from Bremner, before Stevenson could reach the ball, prevented a Liverpool goal. Leeds had a free-kick <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> later, but Giles' effort was saved by Lawrence. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> later, St. John found Peter Thompson, who ran past Bremner and shot, but it was diverted wide by Sprake. The ball found dropped to hunt, but his cross was gathered by the Leeds goalkeeper.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{into the}} expansion, when the {{temperature}} was about a billion (one thousand million) kelvin and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's deuterium and helium nuclei in a process called Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.|$|E
5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had to {{interact}} with the main characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, the animal was too scared to remain still. They had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog felt comfortable, making a shot that should have taken <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> about three hours long.|$|E
5|$|Flight 663 {{was unable}} to recover from its unusually steep bank and plunged into the icy water of the Atlantic Ocean, where it {{exploded}} with bright orange flames. The Pan American 707 {{was the first to}} relay news of the crash, as it was receiving permission to land. Air Canada Flight 627, which had departed <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> prior to Flight 663, also radioed news of an explosion in the water.|$|E

50|$|Adults are coal-black, the {{forewings}} {{with a deep}} cupreous-black patch in {{the disc}} and a submarginal band of the same colour. There are two intermediate black cinereous-bordered dots and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minute</b> black marginal dots. The hindwings are dark cupreous.|$|R
5|$|Four {{minutes later}} Ian Callaghan put a high {{ball into the}} penalty area towards Toshack. Rainer Bonhof under {{pressure}} from Toshack handled the ball for a penalty. However, Keegan's penalty was saved by Borussia goalkeeper Wolfgang Kleff diving to his right. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> later Borussia's Dietmar Danner's shot hit the post.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, {{members of}} the Armenian Revolutionary Federation {{organized}} the failed Yıldız Attempt, an assassination plot on Sultan Abdul Hamid II {{in the capital of}} the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople (modern day Istanbul); the explosion missed its target by <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> The Dashnaksutiun founder Kristapor Mikaelian was lost by an accidental explosion during the planning of the operation.|$|E

United {{equalised}} in injury-time through Giggs, who converted a Beckham cross: a Teddy Sheringham goal <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{earlier had}} been disallowed. A draw meant that United either {{needed to win}} in Italy, or get a score-draw of 2–2 or greater.|$|E
60|$|You {{may find}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minute</b> faults in Milton's Latin verses; {{but you will}} not persuade me that, if these poems had come down to us as written {{in the age of}} Tiberius, we should not have {{considered}} them to be very beautiful.|$|R
60|$|A prawn or two, and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minute</b> star-fish, {{will make}} your {{aquarium}} complete; though you may add to it endlessly, as one glance at the salt-water tanks of the Zoological Gardens, and the strange and beautiful forms which they contain, will prove to you sufficiently.|$|R
60|$|Only <b>a</b> very <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> {{had gone}} by before Dartnoff {{approached}} the two men by the window.|$|R
5|$|Michigan scored {{first when}} Cameron Gordon {{picked up a}} Purdue fumble and ran it back 58 yards for a touchdown, their first {{defensive}} points of the season. They added to their lead <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> later with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Roy Roundtree. Purdue scored their first points {{late in the first}} quarter with a 20-yard field goal by Carson Wiggs, and then added more points in the second quarter when Ricardo Allen intercepted a Denard Robinson pass and ran it back 94 yards for a touchdown. They then came within a point of a tie <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> later by kicking a 46-yard field goal, but would not come any closer. Early in the third quarter, Michigan's Vincent Smith ran in a 19-yard touchdown, but the extra point failed.

5|$|Mixing monosodium {{phosphate}} (NaH2PO4) {{with a solution}} of actinium in hydrochloric acid yields white-colored actinium phosphate hemihydrate (AcPO4·0.5H2O), and heating actinium oxalate with hydrogen sulfide vapors at 1400°C for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> results in a black actinium sulfide Ac2S3. It may possibly be produced by acting {{with a mixture of}} hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide on actinium oxide at 1000°C.|$|E
5|$|On another occasion, he amused and {{relieved}} the House, irritated {{by the prospect}} of being obliged to listen to the reading of a mass of documents as a preliminary to a resolution, by suggesting that a dozen or so clerks be called in who might read the documents simultaneously and thus dispose of the business in <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
