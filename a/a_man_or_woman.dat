25|$|Some {{texts of}} the Abhidharma state that a paṇḍaka cannot achieve {{enlightenment}} in their own lifetime, but must wait for reincarnation as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>woman.</b> Ananda — Buddha's cousin and disciple — {{was said to be}} a paṇḍaka in one of his many previous lives, as was the Buddhist nun Isidāsī (from the Therigatha). In both cases birth as a paṇḍaka was a result of poor karma, and the idea that being a paṇḍaka stems from bad behaviour in a previous life is common in Buddhist literature. Asanga and Vasubandhu discussed if a pandaka was able to be enlightened or not.|$|E

25|$|Conservative Judaism follows halacha, though {{differently}} than Orthodox Judaism. Reform Jews usually use an egalitarian {{form of the}} Ketubah at their weddings. They generally do not issue Jewish divorces, seeing a civil divorce as both necessary and sufficient; however, some Reform rabbis encourage the couple {{to go through a}} Jewish divorce procedure. Conservative and Orthodox Judaism do not recognize civil law as overriding religious law, and thus do not view a civil divorce as sufficient. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>woman</b> may be considered divorced by the Reform Jewish community, but still married by the Conservative community. Orthodox Judaism does not recognize Reform weddings because according to Talmudic law, the witnesses to the marriage must be Jews who observe halacha, which is seldom the case in reform weddings. Any woman that is married by Jewish Law (i. e., a marriage according to Mosaic rather that imaginative Law), but not divorced by said Jewish Law, and subsequently marries another man and bears a child, that said child is considered a bastard, and is not allowed to marry any Jew.|$|E

The Comment first {{discusses the}} constitutional protection of the right to marry, intersex conditions, and case law regarding intersex, transsexual, and same-sex marriage. It further addresses the consequences for marriage when it is narrowly defined. Further, the Comment proposes an alternative solution to the one many courts have used. This solution allows an intersex person to self-designate her gender and be able to marry either <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman.</b> Finally, this Comment argues that if an intersex person can marry either <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> then a male-to-female transsexual and a genetic woman must also be able to marry either <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> because all are similarly situated and must be treated alike under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment...|$|R
