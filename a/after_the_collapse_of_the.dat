Roman roads are considered the most advanced roads built until the early 19th century. The system of roadways facilitated military policing, communications, and trade. The roads were resistant to floods and other environmental hazards. Even <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central government, some roads remained usable for more than a thousand years.|$|E
5|$|Various Germanic tribes have {{inhabited}} the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed {{a central part}} of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights.|$|E

The first Soviet Plenipotentiary in Vienna was Yan Antonovich Berzin. Diplomatic relations were broken in March 1938 after the German invasion of Austria and its incorporation into Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, the USSR and Austria re-established diplomatic relations {{at the level of}} political representation, which in 1953 was converted into embassies. The preamble of the Austrian State Treaty, signed on 15 May 1955 by the USSR, United States, United Kingdom, France and Austria, established that the treaty formed the basis of Soviet relations with Austria. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations continued between the Russian Federation and the Austrian state.|$|E

Framlingham Castle escaped the slighting that occurred to many other English castles around this time. Hitcham's bequest had meanwhile become entangled in the law courts and work did not begin on the poorhouse until the late 1650s, by which time the internal buildings of castle were being broken up {{for the value of}} their stone; the chapel had been destroyed in this way by 1657.|$|E
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union.|$|E

Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hopewell, Indiana had a low population until {{the rise of}} the Fort Ancient and Mississippian culture around 900 AD. The Ohio River Valley was densely populated by the Mississippians from about 1100 to 1450 AD. Their settlements, like those of the Hopewell, were known for their ceremonial earthwork mounds. Some of these remain visible at locations near the Ohio River. The Mississippian mounds were constructed on a grander scale than the mounds built by the Hopewell. The agrarian Mississippian culture was the first to grow maize in the region. The people also developed the bow and arrow and copper working during this time period.|$|E

With her Buddhist friend Yang Jiangzi (the sister of Xue's fellow courtesan Liu Yin), she made pilgrimages to sacred sites such as Mount Lu and Mount Emei. The date of her death is uncertain; some sources suggest {{that she may have}} lived into the 1650s whilst others put her death in the late 1630s or early 1640s. Qian Qianyi mentions her death in a work published in 1652, so it is evident that she must have died before this date.|$|E
