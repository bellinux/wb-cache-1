5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic <b>and</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI. The forecasts include weekly or monthly assessments of the significant factors that help {{determine the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year.|$|E
5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, <b>and</b> <b>atmospheric</b> stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. William M.

According to CSU, the average season between 1950 and 2000 had 9.6tropical storms, 5.9hurricanes, and 2.3major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 9 to 12named storms, of which five to seven reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes.|$|E
