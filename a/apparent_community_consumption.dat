40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide insight in the {{decision-making}} of organizations deciding whether or not to initiate and employ a virtual <b>community</b> of <b>consumption</b> by examining the potential values and value impediments for community organizers. Design/methodology/approach: By adopting a value creation approach, we identify from the extant literature the values that <b>communities</b> of <b>consumption</b> can provide for both participants and organizers. We then formulate three main theoretical propositions on the impediments to the creation and appropriation of these values for organizations and exploratively test the external validity of these value impediments in an exploratory case study in the Dutch travel industry, as an exemplar industry that would be pre-eminently fit to take advantage of the commercial opportunities of <b>communities</b> of <b>consumption.</b> Findings: Travel organizations in our case study are aware of the potential values that <b>communities</b> of <b>consumption</b> could provide, but are unwilling and expect to be limitedly able to realize and appropriate these values. They identify various value impediments related to our basic propositions that add up to a reluctance to initiate a <b>community</b> of <b>consumption...</b>|$|R

40|$|High {{throughput}} sequencing (HTSeq) {{of small}} ribosomal subunit amplicons {{has the potential}} for a comprehensive characterization of microbial community compositions, down to rare species. However, the error-prone nature of the multi-step experimental process requires that the resulting raw sequences are subjected to quality control procedures. These procedures often involve an abundance cutoff for rare sequences or clustering of sequences, both of which limit genetic resolution. Here we propose a simple experimental protocol that retains the high genetic resolution granted by HTSeq methods while effectively removing many low abundance sequences that are likely due to PCR and sequencing errors. According to this protocol, we split samples and submit both halves to independent PCR and sequencing runs. The resulting sequence data is graphically and quantitatively characterized by the discordance between the two experimental branches, allowing for a quick identification of problematic samples. Further, we discard sequences that are not found in both branches ("AmpliconDuo filter"). We show that the majority of sequences removed in this way, mostly low abundance but also some higher abundance sequences, show features expected from random modifications of true sequences as introduced by PCR and sequencing errors. On the other hand, the filter retains many low abundance sequences observed in both branches and thus provides a more reliable census of the rare biosphere. We find that the AmpliconDuo filter increases biological resolution as it increases <b>apparent</b> <b>community</b> similarity between biologically similar communities, while it does not affect <b>apparent</b> <b>community</b> similarities between biologically dissimilar communities. The filter does not distort overall <b>apparent</b> <b>community</b> compositions. Finally, we quantitatively explain the effect of the AmpliconDuo filter by a simple mathematical model...|$|R

H. influenzae strains were consecutively isolated from the same geographic area, mostly from respiratory specimens from children and adults. Overall, amoxicillin resistance decreased by 8. 4 % (from 38. 6 to 30. 2 %). β-Lactamase production decreased by 15. 6 % (from 33 to 17. 4 %, P = 0. 01), but amoxicillin resistance without β-lactamase production increased by 7. 1 % (from 5. 7 to 12. 8 %). All β-lactamase-positive isolates were TEM- 1, but five different promoter regions were identified, with Pdel being the most prevalent in both years, and Prpt being associated with the highest amoxicillin resistance. A new promoter consisting of a double repeat of 54 bp was detected. <b>Community</b> <b>consumption</b> of most antibiotics decreased, as did the geometric means of their MICs, but amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and azithromycin consumption increased by ca. 60 %. For amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a 14. 2 % increase in the population with an MIC of 2 to 4 μg/ml (P = 0. 02) was observed; for azithromycin, a 21. 2 % increase in the population with an MIC of 2 to 8 μg/ml (P = 0. 0005) was observed.

40|$|Communal {{consumption}} {{has lately}} received abundant research attention. Nevertheless, <b>consumption</b> <b>community</b> management {{has not been}} studied very widely in the discipline of marketing. In particular, {{there are very few}} community management studies that examine the phenomenon {{from the perspective of the}} community supplier. Because the present study adopts this scantily studied perspective, it employs an abductive research approach. In order to give much emphasis on the empirical data, the researcher did not use any specific preselected theoretical framework to classify the findings. However, existing <b>consumption</b> <b>community</b> literature was broadly examined to create preliminary understanding, to provide theoretical background information and to support the researcher's interpretation. The previous community management theory often underlines how difficult, if not impossible, it is to control communities consisting of autonomous actors. Despite this, suppliers cannot settle for the role of a passive onlooker. Since <b>consumption</b> <b>communities</b> can provide substantial commercial and even strategic benefits to suppliers, suppliers must find alternative ways to manage those communities. Therefore, this study aims to specify the role of the supplier in the <b>consumption</b> <b>community</b> as well as analyze how the <b>consumption</b> <b>communities</b> can actually be managed. In this study, <b>consumption</b> <b>communities</b> are seen as heterogeneous social networks that express communality in manifold ways. Altogether five representatives of three successful community suppliers were interviewed. In addition to the depth interviews, a post-review seminar was organized to enrich the empirical data. In the post-review seminar six experts of community management discussed the findings of the analysis in order to verify and enhance researcher's interpretation. Based on the major findings, a framework for <b>consumption</b> <b>community</b> management from the supplier perspective was created. First, the framework summarizes the role of the supplier. Both previous literature and the empirical findings indicate that in the <b>consumption</b> <b>community</b> the role of the supplier is above all a facilitator. This research indicates that the supplier that operates in this facilitative role can manage <b>consumption</b> <b>communities</b> by implementing twelve actions that can be further divided into six action categories. Due to its data driven nature the formed framework provides both theoretical contribution and managerial implications...|$|R

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Gentrification {{is the process}} by which middle-class {{residents}} settle inner city neighborhood previously occupied by working-class. Gentrification has long been viewed as a consumption phenomenon, which is triggered by the urge of a certain fraction of a middle class – gentrifiers – to create and maintain distinction. Taking the case of Cihangir, Istanbul; this study is aimed at understanding the relationship between consumption and gentrification. The research is designed as an ethnographic account to discuss the developments taking place in Cihangir and trace how gentifiers construct, negotiate and experience the meanings of Cihangir. The transformations in the retailscape of Cihangir are also observed in order to gain a further understanding of the relationship between consumption and gentrification. The data are collected through qualitative research methods. These are in-depth interviews and participant observation – a field research of forty-two days over a three-month period. The findings indicate there emerged a strong sense of community among gentrifiers. This community is defined in opposition to various groups of perceived nonresidents. These non-residents are identified as site residents, and “Etiler/Akmerkez types” of “Televole Culture”. As informants draw in- and out-group boundaries in terms of consumption practices, the perceived community of among gentrifiers is regarded as a ‘subculture of consumption’ defined with certain consumption practices and guided by the internal ethos of “Cihangir Cumhuriyeti”. At the core of the “Cihangir Cumhuriyeti” construct lie cosmopolitan tendencies and critical social practices of gentrifiers. The study concludes with a discussion of the contributions, limitations, and implications for future research.

40|$|The food webs {{for three}} Sri Lankan reservoirs, Minneriya (ancient and shallow), Udawalawe (young and shallow) and Victoria (young and deep), were compared. The species {{richness}} of the fish communities was highest in Minneriya (30 species), intermediate in Udawalawe (21 species) and lowest in Victoria (18 species). The fish species belonged to 11 families, with Cyprinidae dominating the community {{in terms of both}} abundance and species richness. The daily quantity of food consumed per fish species was used to distinguish weak from strong trophic interactions in these food webs. The fish <b>community</b> <b>consumption</b> pattern was characterized by a few strong interactions and many weak ones. The number of major consumers (i. e. contributing > 5 % of the total fish <b>community</b> <b>consumption)</b> for each reservoir was small and similar for all three reservoirs. Dawkinsia singhala and Amblypharyngodon melettinus were the two major consumers in all three reservoir food webs. Puntius chola was a major consumer in Minneriya and Victoria, although not in Udawalawe, where it fed less on detritus than for the other two food webs. The fish community fed mainly {{at the bottom of the}} food web, primarily on algae, macrophytes and detritus in all three reservoirs, with very little piscivory occurring. The average food-web length was measured as the mean trophic index weighted for the consumption rates of the various fish populations that together comprised the fish community. The average food-web length in these three Sri Lankan reservoirs relatively short, compared with most other tropical lake/reservoir food webs in Asia and Africa for which relevant data were available. Furthermore, traditionally unexploited species (Oreochromis mossambicus; O. niloticus), in contrast to species of commercial fisheries interest, are major role players in the trophic dynamics of reservoir ecosystems. Thus, based on this study, the potential of their exploitation should be considered in the management of reservoir fisheries. ...|$|R

50|$|Buss {{suggests}} that the Hunting hypothesis also explains the advent of strong male coalitions. Although chimpanzees form male-male coalitions, {{they tend to be}} temporary opportunistic. Contrastingly, large game hunters require consistent and coordinated cooperation to succeed in large game hunting. Thus male coalitions were the result of working together to succeed in providing meat for the hunters themselves and their families. Kristen Hawkes suggests further that obtaining resources intended for <b>community</b> <b>consumption</b> increases a male’s fitness by appealing to the male’s society and thus being in the good favor of both males and females. The male relationship would improve hunting success and create alliances for future conflict and the female relationship would improve direct reproductive success. Buss proposes alternate explanations of emergence of the strong male coalitions. He {{suggests that}} male coalitions may have been the result of group-on-group aggression, defense, and in-group political alliances. This explanation does not support the relationship between male coalitions and hunting.|$|R
