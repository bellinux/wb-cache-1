5000|$|An {{alternative}} view is {{that the}} assertion [...] "I believe that p" [...] often (though not always) functions as an alternative way of <b>asserting</b> [...] "p", so that the semantic content of the assertion [...] "I believe that p" [...] is just p: it functions as a statement about the world and not about anyones state of mind. Accordingly, what someone <b>asserts</b> when they <b>assert</b> [...] "p and I believe that not-p" [...] is just [...] "p and not-p" [...] <b>Asserting</b> the commissive version of Moores sentences is again assimilated to the more familiar (putative) impropriety of <b>asserting</b> a contradiction.|$|R

5|$|A case {{in which}} {{developer}} control was <b>asserted</b> involved Blizzard Entertainment's action against Tristan Pope's Not Just Another Love Story. Blizzard's community managers encouraged users to post game movies and screenshots, but viewers complained that Pope's suggestion of sexual actions through creative camera and character positioning was pornographic. Citing the user license agreement, Blizzard closed discussion threads about the film and prohibited links to it. Although Pope accepted Blizzard's right to some control, he remained concerned about censorship of material that already existed in-game in some form. Discussion ensued about boundaries between MMORPG player and developer control. Lowood <b>asserted</b> that this controversy demonstrated that machinima could be a medium of negotiation for players.|$|E

40|$|Assertions {{are often}} {{used to test the}} {{assumptions}} that developers have about a program. An assertion contains a boolean expression which developers believe to be true at a particular program point. It throws an error if the expression is not satisfied, which helps developers to detect and correct bugs. Since assertions make developer assumptions explicit, assertions are also believed to improve under-standability of code. Recently, Casalnuovo et al. analyse C and C++ programs to understand the relationship between assertion usage and defect occurrence. Their results show that <b>asserts</b> have a small effect on reducing the density of bugs and developers often add <b>asserts</b> to methods they have prior knowledge of and larger ownership. In this study, we perform a partial replication of the above study on a large dataset of Java projects from GitHub (185 projects, 20 million LOC, 4 million commits, 0. 2 million files and 1 million methods). We collect metrics such as number of <b>asserts,</b> number of defects, number of developers and number of lines changed to a method, and examine the relationship between <b>asserts</b> and defect occurrence. We also analyse relationship between developer experience and ownership and the number of <b>asserts.</b> Furthermore, we perform a study of what are different types of <b>asserts</b> added and why they are added by developers. We find that <b>asserts</b> have a small yet significant relationship with defect occurrence and developers who have added <b>asserts</b> to methods often have higher ownership of and experience with the methods than developers who did not add <b>asserts...</b>|$|R
