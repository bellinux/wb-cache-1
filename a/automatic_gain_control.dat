25|$|News reporting, documentary, {{and human}} {{interest}} broadcast operations often used portable Marantz PMD-series recorders for {{the recording of}} speech interviews. The key advantages of the Marantz portable recorders were the accommodation of professional microphones with an XLR connector, normal and double tape speed recording for extended frequency response, Dolby and dbx noise reduction systems, manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> (AGC) level control, peak limiter, multiple tape formulation accommodation, microphone and line level input connections, unbalanced RCA stereo input and output connections, live or tape monitoring, VU meter, headphone jack, playback pitch control, and operation on AC power or batteries optimized for long duration. Unlike less-expensive portable recorders that were limited to <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> (AGC) recording schemes, the manual recording mode preserved low noise dynamics and avoided the automatic elevation of noise.|$|E
25|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> {{circuits}} {{require an}} amplifier's gain {{be controlled by}} the time-averaged amplitude so that the output amplitude varies little when weak stations are being received. The non-linearities are assumed arranged so the relatively small signal amplitude suffers from little distortion (cross-channel interference or intermodulation) yet is still modulated by the relatively large gain-control DC voltage.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{audio level}} control devices, such as <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>controls</b> (AGCs) and compressors, {{generally}} {{have little or}} no advance knowledge of the dynamic characteristics of the remainder of the current audio program. If such advance knowledge is available (i. e., if audio files can be pre-analyzed), it becomes possible to match desired values of overall loudness and dynamics.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the more}} prosaic but {{necessary}} features of almost any information processing system is <b>gain</b> <b>control.</b> All such systems must have some way to adjust the relationship between input, which can vary dramatically depending on changes in the environment, and output, which is almost always required to remain within a limited range of amplitudes. While the volume control on a radio or the brightness control on a computer monitor are not the most exciting or highly touted features, imagine such devices without these forms of <b>gain</b> <b>control.</b> Many an engineer can attest to the large effort required to design <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>controls</b> in telephones, cameras, and radio transmitters...|$|R
25|$|Constant {{false alarm}} rate, {{a form of}} <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> (AGC), is a method that relies on clutter returns far outnumbering echoes from targets of interest. The receiver's gain is {{automatically}} adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter. While this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter, it does help to distinguish strong target sources. In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software controlled and affected the gain with greater granularity in specific detection cells.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} function {{provided by}} the carrier in standard AM, but which is lost in either single or double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, is that it provides an amplitude reference. In the receiver, the <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> (AGC) responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation. On the other hand, with suppressed-carrier transmissions there is no transmitted power during pauses in the modulation, so the AGC must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation. This typically involves a so-called fast attack, slow decay circuit which holds the AGC level {{for a second or}} more following such peaks, in between syllables or short pauses in the program. This is very acceptable for communications radios, where compression of the audio aids intelligibility. However it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming, where a faithful reproduction of the original program, including its varying modulation levels, is expected.|$|E
2500|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{introduction}} of dbx-encoded records, again for the audiophile niche market. These were completely incompatible with standard record playback preamplifiers, relying on the dbx compandor encoding/decoding scheme to greatly increase dynamic range (dbx encoded disks were recorded with the dynamic range compressed {{by a factor of}} two: quiet sounds were meant to be played back at low gain and loud sounds were meant to be played back at high gain, via <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> in the playback equipment; this reduced the effect of surface noise on quiet passages).

30|$|The {{development}} of hearing aids incorporates two aspects, namely, the audiological and the technical point of view. The former focuses on items like the recruitment phenomenon, the speech intelligibility of hearing-impaired persons, or {{just on the}} question of hearing comfort. Concerning these subjects, different algorithms intending to improve the hearing ability are presented in this paper. These are <b>automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>controls,</b> directional microphones, and noise reduction algorithms. Besides the audiological point of view, there are several purely technical problems which have to be solved. An important one is the acoustic feedback. Another instance is the proper automatic control of all hearing aid components by means of a classification unit.

40|$|Knowledge {{is often}} {{thought to be}} {{something}} brought from outside to act upon the visual messages received from the eye in a 'top-down' fashion, {{but this is a}} misleadingly narrow view. First, the visual system is a multilevel heterarchy with connections acting in all directions so it has no 'top'; and second, knowledge is provided through innately determined structure and by analysis of the redundancy in sensory messages themselves, as well as from outside. This paper gives evidence about mechanisms analysing sensory redundancy in biological vision. <b>Automatic</b> <b>gain</b> <b>controls</b> for luminance and contrast depend upon feedback from the input, and there are strong indications that the autocorrelation function, and other associations between input variables, affect the contrast sensitivity function and our subjective experience of the world. The associative structure of sensory message can provide much knowledge about the world we live in, and neural mechanisms that discount established associative structure in the input messages by recoding them can improve survival by making new structure more easily detectable. These mechanisms may be responsible for illusions, such as those produced by a concave face-mask, that are classically attributed to top-down influences...|$|R

With this equipment line levels may be held more constant, the average level in-creased many fold, and the listening pub-lic-both radio and television-subjected less to sudden drastic changes of sound volume.

40|$|When amperometric biosensors drift, their {{sensitivity}} drops with time: {{the same}} difference in detected concentration value ∆ C results in lower sen- sor output current ∆ I as the measurement/monitoring time progresses. This limitation affects {{the longevity of}} biosensors. To counterbalance for the drop in sensitivity, manual adjustment of the I-to-V transimpedance gain is usually applied. This paper presents an <b>automatic</b> transimpedance <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> cir- cuit suitable for switched-capacitor-based current analogue front-ends.

We present an analog single-chip pulse oximeter with 4. 8 -mW total power dissipation, which is {{an order of magnitude}} below our measurements on commercial implementations. The majority of this power reduction is due to the use of a novel logarithmic transimpedance amplifier with inherent contrast sensitivity, distributed amplification, unilateralization, and <b>automatic</b> loop <b>gain</b> <b>control.</b> The transimpedance amplifier, together with a photodiode current source, form a high-performance photoreceptor with characteristics similar to those found in nature, which allows LED power to be reduced.
