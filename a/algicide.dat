40|$|The cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is {{produced}} by several species of cyanobacteria and can be persistent in drinking waters supplies, which is of major concern to water authorities because of its potential to severely compromise human health. Consequently, {{there is a need}} to fully understand the persistence of CYN in water supplies, in particular, to determine whether this toxin is readily degraded by endemic aquatic organisms. This study provides insights into the environmental factors that can influence the biodegradation of this toxin in Australian drinking water supplies. Biodegradation of CYN was only evident in water supplies that had a history of toxic Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii blooms. In addition, lag periods were evident prior to the onset of biodegradation; however, repeated exposure of the endemic organisms to CYN resulted in substantial decreases in the lag periods. Furthermore, the concentration of CYN was shown to influence biodegradation with a near linear relationship (R(2) of 0. 9549) existing between the biodegradation rate and the initial CYN concentration. Temperature was also shown to affect the biodegradation of CYN, which is important since CYN is now being detected in more temperate climates. The presence of copper-based <b>algicides</b> inhibited CYN degradation, which has significant implications since copper-based <b>algicides</b> are commonly used to control cyanobacterial growth in water bodies. The results from this study indicate that the biodegradation of CYN in natural water bodies is a complex process that can be influenced by many environmental factors, some of which include CYN concentration, temperature, and the presence of copper-based <b>algicides.</b> Maree J.

5000|$|Biocides can {{be added}} to other {{materials}} (typically liquids) to protect them against biological infestation and growth. For example, certain types of quaternary ammonium compounds (quats) are added to pool water or industrial water systems to act as an <b>algicide,</b> protecting the water from infestation and growth of algae. It is often impractical to store and use poisonous chlorine gas for water treatment, so alternative methods of adding chlorine are used. These include hypochlorite solutions, which gradually release chlorine into the water, and compounds like sodium dichloro-s-triazinetrione (dihydrate or anhydrous), sometimes referred to as [...] "dichlor", and trichloro-s-triazinetrione, sometimes referred to as [...] "trichlor". These compounds are stable while solids and may be used in powdered, granular, or tablet form. When added in small amounts to pool water or industrial water systems, the chlorine atoms hydrolyze {{from the rest of the}} molecule forming hypochlorous acid (HOCl) which acts as a general biocide killing germs, micro-organisms, algae, and so on. Halogenated hydantoin compounds are also used as biocides.|$|E
40|$|Short-term {{fluctuations}} {{and structure}} of phytoplankton were examined for two months in the dry season (August-September/ 1997) in a eutrophic reservoir of central Brazil. <b>Algicide</b> treatment for the control of Microcystis aeruginosa bloom influenced the short-term variation pattern of the phytoplankton community. <b>Algicide</b> treatment was effective in controlling M. aeruginosa bloom, but it also influenced the Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii population. These species retained low densities, showing small colonies and trichomes, respectively. Drops in Cyanobacteria populations following <b>algicide</b> treatment were succeeded by progressive increase in Chlorophyta.

In this study correspondence analysis of abundance data for phytoplankton assemblage in lake Paranoá revealed that available light, rather than chlorophyll-a, total suspended material, and water temperature, accounted for most of the short-term fluctuation in phytoplankton structure during <b>algicide</b> application.

40|$|Eutrophication of reservoirs, {{lakes and}} rivers is the {{phenomenon}} that induces algal blooms by accumulating nutriments in the water system because of the continuous inflow of pollutants such as domestic sewage and industrial wastewater. This phenomenon is a global environmental problem that threatens water systems, coastal ecosystems and even human life. A recent method {{to solve the problem}} is the use of scaffolding for releasing <b>algicide.</b> Although this method has the effect of controlling algae, it can cause secondary environmental problems such as toxicity to other species and waste of the used scaffold. In this research, to improve the eco-friendliness and efficiency of the algicide-releasing process, biodegradable polymer foam as a carrier of the <b>algicide</b> was prepared. Polylactide is a biodegradable polymer that can be obtained from natural resources such as cornstarch and tapioca starch. Polylactide foam, which has high porosity and surface area because of its open-cell structure, was produced using the salt-leaching method. The most important property of polylactide foam is controlling the pore size to make it suitable for the size of the <b>algicide.</b> The pore size of polylactide foam is controlled {{by the size of the}} used salt particle itself. The pore size and porosity were confirmed by analyzing the morphology of polylactide foam. The <b>algicide</b> was loaded on the polylactide foam using the injection method. A microcosm test of Stephanodiscus was performed to confirm the efficiency of <b>algicide</b> release from the polylactide foam. To investigate the biodegradability of the polylactide foam, an enzymatic degradation test was performed.

40|$|Abstract: Boiling water {{extracts}} of 66 selected Chinese {{medicinal herbs}} were screened for their anticyanobaterial activity against Microcystis aeruginosa by the soft-agar overlayer (SAO) method. Results indicated that extracts from 16 materials could inhibit {{the growth of}} this bacterial species. Among these anticyanobacterial samples, eight extracts showed low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), including four extracts with MICs between 1 and 6 mg/mL, and four extracts with MICs < 1 mg/mL which could be considered useful to prevent the outbreak of cyanobacteria before the appearance of cyanobacterial blooms. Further study showed that three extracts with MIC values < 1 mg/mL induced intensive chlorophyll-a lysis within 7 days at the MIC. The results suggested that highly efficient anticyanobacterial compounds must {{be involved in the}} inhibitory activities.

40|$|The {{tenets of}} {{watershed}} management – {{a focus on}} the land area linked to the water body, the incorporation of sound scientific information into the decision-making process and stakeholder involvement throughout the process – are well-suited for the management of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (C-HABs). The management of C-HABs can be viewed as having two main areas of focus. First, there is mitigation – control and/or removal of the bloom. This type of crisis response is an important compo-nent to managing active C-HABs and there are several techniques that have been successfully utilized, including the application of <b>algicides,</b> physical removal of surface scums and the mechanical mixing of the water column.

40|$|The {{production}} of certain odorous metabolites is an undesirable attribute of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) growth in aquaculture ponds [e. g., channel catfish(Ictalurus punctatus) ] and {{in drinking water}} reservoirs. The most common odorous compounds encountered in catfish aquaculture are geosmin (trans- 1, 10 -dimethyltrans- 9 -decalol) and 2 -methylisoborneol(exo- 1, 2, 7, 7 -tetramethylbicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptan- 2 -ol). These compounds are also frequently encountered worldwide in reservoirs and aqueducts used for municipal drinking water systems(Schrader et al. 2002). In this study, several <b>algicides</b> were evaluated using a rapid bioassay to determine their effectiveness in controlling the MIB-producing cyanobacterium Oscillatoria perornata from a west Mississippi catfish pond and the MIBproducing Pseudanabaena sp.
