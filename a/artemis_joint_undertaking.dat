40|$|With {{the advent}} of manycore {{architectures}} comprising hundreds of processing elements, fault management {{has become a major}} challenge. We present an approach that uses the occam-pi language to manage the fault recovery mechanism on a new manycore architecture, the Platform 2012 (P 2012). The approach is made possible by extending our previously developed compiler framework to compile occam-pi implementations to the P 2012 architecture. We describe the techniques used to translate the salient features of the occam-pi language to the native programming model of the P 2012 architecture. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach by an experimental case study, in which the DCT algorithm is implemented on a set of four processing elements. During run-time, some of the tasks are then relocated from assumed faulty processing elements to the faultless ones by means of dynamic reconfiguration of the hardware. The working of the demonstrator and the simulation results illustrate not only the feasibility of the approach but also how the use of higher-level abstractions simplifies the fault handling. © 2012 IEEE.

40|$|Achieving reduced {{time-to-market}} {{in modern}} electronic designs targeting safety critical applications is becoming very challenging, as these designs {{need to go}} through a certification step that introduces a non-negligible overhead in the verification and validation process. To cope with this challenge, safety-critical systems industry is demanding new tools and methodologies allowing quick and cost-effective means for robustness verification. Microarchitectural simulators have been widely used to test reliability properties in different domains but their use in the process of robustness verification remains yet to be validated against other accepted methods such as RTL or gate-level simulation. In this paper we perform fault injections in an RTL model of a processor to characterize fault propagation. The results and conclusions of this characterization will serve to devise to what extent fault injection methodologies for robustness verification using microarchitectural simulators can be employed.

40|$|Driving is {{a complex}} task {{requiring}} processing on psychomotor, perceptual and cognitive level. An intimate understanding of the occurrence and timing of the processing steps is necessary when modelling driver behaviour and intent in cognitive architectures (e. g., ACT-R, Anderson et al., 2004). However, until now, little research on the decomposition of the driving task into the involved operations has been conducted. The approach of Critical Path Modelling Goals Operators Methods Selection rules (CPM-GOMS, John & Kieras, 1996) provides a framework for describing motor, perceptual and cognitive operators of a task on a granular time level. Thus, we employed CPM-GOMS in order to analyse lane change manoeuvres accomplished on a two-lane highway in real traffic. Here, we present the decomposition of three different types of lane changes (merging to the highway, change {{from right to left}} lane, and back) based on video observation of driver and environment as well as driving data analysis of three participants driving on the German autobahn A 39. The resulting model forms the basis for understanding the aspects of vehicle operations and serves the creation of cognitive models.

40|$|Nowadays, street {{lighting}} accounts for 53 % of outdoor lighting use, {{and the market}} is continuously increasing. In the context of rising energy prices and growing environmental awareness, energy efficiency is {{becoming one of the}} most important criteria for {{street lighting}} systems design. LED-based lights have become the primary option for replacing conventional light bulbs, being digitally controllable, small, highly efficient, and cheap to manufacture. Advanced control strategies adapted to ambient conditions are needed to combine low energy consumption and high-quality light ambience according to changing specifications. This paper describes an outdoor lighting solution aimed at energy-efficient performance in the context of multipurpose outdoor environments, where control is crucial in achieving efficiency improvements. This paper addresses efficiency at the component level, by optimizing the performance of LED drivers, and at the system level, by defining the control strategy and associated hardware infrastructure. The approach designed was tested in a real environment. The performance of the lighting installation was assessed using the Web-based monitoring application, providing real-time consumption information and aggregated historical data.

40|$|Increasingly complex {{microcontroller}} {{designs for}} safety-relevant automotive systems require {{the adoption of}} new methods and tools to enable a cost-effective verification of their robustness. In particular, costs associated to the certification against the ISO 26262 safety standard must be kept low for economical reasons. In this context, simulation-based verification using instruction set simulators (ISS) arises as a promising approach to partially cope with the increasing cost of the verification process as it allows taking design decisions in early design stages when modifications can be performed quickly and with low cost. However, {{it remains to be}} proven that verification in those stages provides accurate enough information {{to be used in the}} context of automotive microcontrollers. In this paper we analyze the existing correlation between fault injection experiments in an RTL microcontroller description and the information available at the ISS to enable accurate ISS-based fault injection.

40|$|A {{complete}} {{methodology for}} energy building monitoring based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed. The method extends the Unfolding or Multiway Principal Component Analysis (MPCA) used in statistical batch process control {{in terms of}} building and neighbourhood monitoring. Relationships between energy consumption and independent variables such as weather, occupancy or any other variables that are significant for monitoring can be gathered in a model using the proposed methodology. Historic data are used to obtain a reference model {{that will be used}} for monitoring. Two unfolding strategies are proposed (time-wise and entity-based) offering complementary views of the building or of the community under consideration. The first, time-wise unfolding, is suitable for detecting behavioural changes over time, whereas entity-wise unfolding allows the identification of entities, e. g. dwellings in a building, that behave substantially differently from others over a period of time. Two simple statistics, T 2 and SPE, are used to define two monitoring charts capable of detecting abnormal behaviours and, furthermore, the isolation of variables that mainly explain such a situation. The paper presents the theoretical background, followed by the methodological principles.

40|$|Safety-relevant {{systems in}} the {{automotive}} domain often implement features such as lockstep execution for error detection, and reset and re-execution for error correction. Light-lockstep has already been adopted in some such systems due to its relatively low-implementation cost given {{that it does not}} require deep changes into nonlockstep hardware. Instead, as only off-core activities (i. e., data/addresses sent) need to be compared across different cores, light-lockstep designs are lowly intrusive. This approach has been proven sufficient to guarantee functional correctness of the system in the presence of errors in the cores, in particular in relation with certification against safety standards such as ISO 26262 in the automotive domain. However, error detection in light-lockstep systems may occur long after the error actually occurs, thus jeopardizing timing guarantees, which are as critical as functional ones in hard real-time systems. In this paper, we analyze the timing behavior of errors due to transient and permanent faults in light-lockstep systems. Our results show that the time elapsed until an error is detected can be inordinately large, especially for permanent faults. Based on this observation and building upon the specific characteristics of light-lockstep systems, we propose lightly verbose (LiVe), a new mechanism to enforce the early detection of errors, due to both transient and permanent faults, thus enabling the computation of tight error detection timing bounds. We also analyze how existing mechanisms for error recovery in multicore systems increase their effectiveness when light-lockstep operates in LiVe mode in the context of mixed-criticality workloads.

40|$|The {{design process}} of {{aerospace}} systems always dealt with multiple factors belonging to different disciplines, being often characterized by conflicting demands as functionality, performance, cost and safety. Actually the Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) {{is applied to}} the design process of complex systems because of the capability of managing and tracing customers' and stakeholders' needs as well as constraints and technical requirements directly within the modelling activity. It allows to predict the system behaviour in several operating conditions, enabling the creation of a consistent model of system, which can be easily applied for verification purposes in all lifecycle phases. This estimation is usually performed by means of a number of tools that are often used separately to investigate specific issues of the analysis. The main drawback of collecting a large number of resultscoming from several sources is that as soon as the system specifications are written, very seldom they can be easily harmonized and included into a final list. This limit might increase the risk of having blank spots and lowers the advantages of the MBSE approach. Therefore a better way to face this problem is to enforce tool's integration, by overcoming some problems related to connection and interoperability. Pursuing the instantiation of a heterogeneous simulation, i. e. a simulation based on interoperability standards, being capable of enabling the communication among tools, is currently a key issue of the development of MBSE. To investigate the real potentiality of this approach and to show its consistency, this methodology was tested and applied within the frame of the <b>ARTEMIS</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>Undertaking</b> project "CRitical sYSTem engineering AcceLeration" (CRYSTAL). The CRYSTAL project addresses the challenge of providing a generic method and tool framework for the engineering of complex systems, based on an industry wide accepted Interoperability Specification. This envisaged specification aims at defining an industry-wide accepted standard for connecting tools, based on linked-data principles and open Web technologies. To ensure wide acceptance, the Interoperability Standard will be defined mainly as collection and extension of existing ones such as OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) or FMI (Functional Mock-up Interface). A preliminary design of a de-icing system for a regional turboprop was developed as a Public Use Case of the CRYSTAL Aerospace domain by a working group composed by academic partners, aerospace industries and IT companies. Requirement analysis, functional modelling and physical modelling were performed for two alternative de-icing concepts. In parallel, activities have started to connect modelling, simulation and trade-off analysis tools via the CRYSTAL Interoperability Standard, to support the envisioned trade-off analysis and the related simulation process. Simulation and trade-off results for the public aerospace use case are herein presented, together with the proposed approach for heterogeneous simulation, trade-off analysis, and for extensions of the standards used for integration of tools, namely the FMI and OSL...|$|E

40|$|The Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) {{is a novel}} {{solid state}} photon {{counting}} detector consisting of a parallel array of avalanche photodiodes biased beyond their breakdown voltage. It has known a fast development {{in the last few}} years as a possible alternative to vacuum photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and conventional avalanche photodiodes (APDs). Indeed, current research in photodetectors is directed toward an increasing miniaturization of the pixel size, thus both improving the spatial resolution and reducing the device dimensions. SiPMs show high photon detection efficiency in the visible and near infrared range, low power consumption, high gain, ruggedness, compact size, excellent single-photon response, fast rise time and reduced sensitivity with temperature, voltage fluctuations, and magnetic fields. Furthermore, solid-state technology owns the typical advantages of the planar integration process, therefore, they can be manufactured at low costs and with high reproducibility. SiPMs performances in photon counting regime have been deeply investigated in literature, using picosecond pulsed lasers. In this regime, they can be used in applications like positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear physics instrumentation, high energy physics. An optical characterization performed via continuous wave (CW) sources has seldom been reported even though this kind of excitation seems to be very useful in several fields such as low power measurements, near-infrared spectroscopy and immunoassay tests. In this Thesis, I perform an electrical and optical analysis of two novel classes of SiPMs in the CW regime. After a brief introduction about the SiPM operating principle, parameters and properties (Chapter 1), I describe my responsivity measurements made with an incident optical power down to tenths of picowatts, monitoring the temperature of the device packages, and on a spectrum ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared (Chapter 2). These measurements allowed to define an innovative criterion to establish the conditions necessary for the device to be usable in CW regime. Chapter 3 continues with an investigation of the SiPM signal-to-noise ratio. Measurements employed a 10 Hz equivalent noise bandwidth, around a tunable reference frequency in the range 1 - 100 kHz, and were performed varying the applied bias and the temperature of the SiPM package. These results were compared with similar measurements performed on a PMT. Once the SiPM is characterized, Chapter 4 reports an innovative application: an optical characterization of a class of photonic crystals infiltrated with a new ethanol responsive hydrogel employing the SiPM as a reference photodetector. This activity shows innovative developments for the ethanol sensing to be applied into inexpensive and minimally invasive breathalyzers. Finally, Appendix A shows an electro-optical characterization of a novel class of Silicon Carbide (SiC) vertical Schottky UV detectors. I performed responsivity measurements as a function of the wavelength and the applied bias, varying the temperature of the SiC package, in the 200 - 400 nm range.
