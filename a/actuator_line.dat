40|$|The <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method made it {{possible}} to describe the near wake of a wind turbine more accurately than with the actuator disk method. Whereas the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> generates the helicoidal vortex system shed from the tip blades, the actuator disk method sheds a vortex sheet {{from the edge of the}} rotor plane. But with the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> come also temporal and spatial constraints, such as the need for a much smaller time step than with actuator disk. While the latter one only has to obey the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, the former one is also restricted by the grid resolution and the rotor tip-speed. Additionally the spatial resolution has to be finer for the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> than with the actuator disk, for well resolving the tip vortices. Therefore this work is dedicated to examining a method in between of <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> and actuator disk, which is able to model the transient behaviour, such as the rotating blades, but which also relaxes the temporal constraint. Therefore a larger time-step is used and the blade forces are swept over a certain area. The main focus of this article is on the aspect of the blade tip vortex generation in comparison with the standard <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> and actuator disk...|$|E

The <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method is an effective modeling approach that gives improtant wake flow characterstics of a wind turbine. In the last few years, numerous studies have been conducted based on this method using Ellipsys 3 D, a computational fluid dynamics (CDF) flow solver based on finitie volume approach.

Researchers were asked to send in results from a simulation of a model turbine in a wind tunnel to compare the different results with the measured values. There was a large spread in the simulation results, showing that additional testing and development {{needs to be made}} in order to increase the accuracy of the modelling methods. This thesis uses the "Blind test 1 " as the set-up for the numerical simulations, and the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> code created by NREL to model the wind turbine. The <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method divides each blade into <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> elements and distributes the forces from the line elements onto the grid. A parameter study has been performed using the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> code, and guidelines have been created describing how to use the code to achieve the best possible results. This thesis has pointed out a few current problems with the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> implementation, including a difficulty with achieving a grid independent solution. The <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> code mostly overestimated both thrust and power compared to the experimental values, and the best results where found from the grid producing the minimum thrust and power values. The numerical results have been compared to the "Blind test 1 " and "Blind test 2 " experimental values, including thrust, power and velocity deficit and turbulent kinetic energy in the wake behind the turbines.

In the actuator methods the blades are represented by lines or a discat which body forces representing the loading are introduced. The body forcesare determined by computing local angles of attack and using tabulated aerofoilcoefficients. The advantage of using the actuator techniques is that theyare not needed to resolve blade boundary layers.

However, the integrated thrust and torque predictions for each rotor are dominated by the blade loading on the outboard sections, where threedimensional (3 D) effects become increasingly significant and {{the accuracy of the}} reduced order methods remains uncertain. To investigate the accuracy of the spanwise blade loading on an individual rotor, <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> and blade boundary layer resolved computations of the Model Rotor Experiments in Controlled Conditions (MEXICO) rotor are presented.

40|$|It is {{imperative}} to include three-dimensional tip flow corrections when using low-order rotor models that rely on the flow independence principle to compute the blade forces. These corrections aim {{to account for the}} effect of pressure equalization at the tips and the accompanying spanwise pressure gradients on the outboard sections, by reducing the computed axial and tangential forces as the blade tips are approached. While Glauert-type corrections are conventionally employed for actuator disc-type computations, alternative corrections are required for <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> computations as they use a finite blade representation. We present <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> computations of the Model Rotor Experiments in Controlled Conditions (MEXICO) rotor to investigate tip corrections. Using the tip correction factor proposed by Shen et al.

Further improvement to the blade loading is achieved by recalibrating the tip correction factor using data extracted from blade resolved computations of the model rotor experiments in controlled conditions rotor. From the rotor resolved computations, the tip loss (reduction in the blade loading on the outboard sections) is found to be more aggressive in the tangential direction than the axial direction. To account for this, we recalibrate the tip correction factor separately in the axial and tangential directions to develop new directionally dependent tip corrections.

The following four cases are considered: the flow in an unexploited, empty channel; flow in a channel containing the rotors; flow in a channel containing the support structure; and flow in a channel with both rotors and support structure. The results indicate that the support structure contributes significantly to the behaviour of the turbine and to turbulence levels downstream, even when the rotors are upstream.

40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{is used in}} this thesis to model wind and tidal stream turbines and to investigate tidal turbine fence performance. There are two primary objectives of this work. The first is to develop and validate an <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method for the simulation of wind and tidal turbines which applies the blade forces to the flow field {{without the need for}} a regularisation kernel. The second is to examine tidal fences using, in part, the newly developed <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method. A potential flow equivalence method for determining the relative velocity to the blade chord and flow angle at the rotor blades in the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method is proposed and validated. Results for simulations using this method compare favourably with those from both experiments and alternative computational methods, although the present model’s results deviate from experimental results {{in the vicinity of the}} blade tips. A CFD-embedded blade element-momentum tool is used to design rotors for operation in infinitely wide tidal fences spanning a tidal channel. Rotors are designed for fences with several different blockage ratios, with those designed for high blockage flows having greater solidity than those designed for operation in fences with lower blockage. It is found that designing rotors for operational blockage conditions can significantly improve the power output achieved by a tidal fence. Improved power output for higher blockage conditions is achieved by the application of greater thrust to the flow. <b>Actuator</b> <b>line</b> simulations of short (up to 8 turbines) fences with varying intra-rotor spacing and number of rotors confirm that hydrodynamic performance of the rotors improves as the spacing is reduced and as rotors are added to a fence.

Also, various turbine configurations are simulated, and the total power production relative to isolated turbines is examined. Staggering consecutive rows of turbines in the simulated configurations allows the greatest efficiency using the least downstream row spacing. Counter-rotating consecutive downstream turbines in a non-staggered array shows a small benefit.

The solver computes the atmospheric boundary layer flow and models turbines with <b>actuator</b> <b>lines.</b> Until recently, the solver {{was limited to}} flows over flat terrain and could only use the standard Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model. In this work, we present our improvements to the flow solver that enable us to 1) use any OpenFOAM-standard subgrid-scale model and 2) simulate flow over complex terrain. We used the flow solver to compute a stably stratified atmospheric boundary layer using both the standard and the Lagrangian-averaged scale-independent dynamic Smagorinsky models. Surprisingly, the results using the standard Smagorinsky model compare well to other researchers' results of the same case, although {{it is often said}} that the standard Smagorinsky model is too dissipative for accurate stable stratification calculations. The scale-independent dynamic subgrid-scale model produced poor results, probably due to the spikes in model constant with values as high as 4. 6.

However, the standard <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> model does not include {{a model for the}} turbine nacelle which can significantly impact turbine wake characteristics as shown in the literature. Another disadvantage of the standard <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> model is that more geometrical features of turbine blades cannot be resolved on a finer mesh. To alleviate these disadvantages of the standard model, we develop a new class of actuator surface models for turbine blades and nacelle to take into account more geometrical details of turbine blades and include the effect of turbine nacelle. In the actuator surface model for blade, the aerodynamic forces calculated using the blade element method are distributed from the surface formed by the foil chords at different radial locations. In the actuator surface model for nacelle, the forces are distributed from the actual nacelle surface with the normal force component computed {{in the same way as}} in the direct forcing immersed boundary method and the tangential force component computed using a friction coefficient and a reference velocity of the incoming flow. The actuator surface model for nacelle is evaluated by simulating the flow over periodically placed nacelles. Both the actuator surface simulation and the wall-resolved large-eddy simulation are carried out. The comparison shows that the actuator surface model is able to give acceptable results especially at far wake locations on a very coarse mesh. It is noted that although this model is employed for the turbine nacelle in this work, it is also applicable to other bluff bodies. The capability of the actuator surface model in predicting turbine wakes is assessed by simulating the flow over the MEXICO (Model experiments in Controlled Conditions) turbine and a hydrokinetic turbine.

This allows to isolate the influence of conservative forces from other effects. The comparison of numerical results with and without conservative loads enables to confirm qualitatively their relevance for the near wake and the rotor performance.

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} one of the most common and {{preferred}} renewable energy sources. Accurate predictions of atmospheric boundary layer flow, wind turbine induced wakes and their interaction are essential to maximize wind power output and efficiently harness wind energy. In this dissertation, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) flow model is developed utilizing a three dimensional weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) high order Finite Volume Model system including Large Eddy Simulation (LES) and the <b>Actuator</b> <b>Line</b> Method (ALM). The developed model system is thus able to accurately capture and simulate wind turbine wakes and their interaction with the atmospheric boundary layer, thereby providing insight into the phenomenon of turbine wake interaction and its effect on the external aerodynamic loads on wind turbines. This enables the wind energy production to be maximized and also minimizes turbine fatigue loading in the evaluation of wind farm layouts. ^ By using LES model to simulate the Atmospheric Boundary Layer flow rather than the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model, the error introduced by turbulence modeling is reduced. The <b>Actuator</b> <b>Line</b> Model, ALM, is used to model the rotor by replacing the rotor with radially distributed body forces.

40|$|Mean and {{turbulent}} {{properties of}} the wake generated by a single wind turbine are studied in this paper with a new large eddy simulation (LES) code, the wind turbine and turbulence simulator (WiTTS hereafter). WiTTS uses a scale-dependent Lagrangian dynamical model of the sub-grid shear stress and <b>actuator</b> <b>lines</b> to simulate {{the effects of the}} rotating blades. WiTTS is first tested by simulating neutral boundary layers without and with a wind turbine and then used to study the common assumptions of self-similarity and axisymmetry of the wake under neutral conditions for a variety of wind speeds and turbine properties. We find that the wind velocity deficit generally remains self similarity to a Gaussian distribution in the horizontal. In the vertical, the Gaussian self-similarity is still valid in {{the upper part of the}} wake, but it breaks down in the region of the wake close to the ground. The horizontal expansion of the wake is always faster and greater than the vertical expansion under neutral stability due to wind shear and impact with the ground. Two modifications to existing equations for the mean velocity deficit and the maximum added turbulence intensity are proposed and successfully tested. The anisotropic wake expansion is taken into account in the modified model of the mean velocity deficit. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budgets show that production and advection exceed dissipation and turbulent transport. The nacelle causes significant increase of every term in the TKE budget in the near wake.

40|$|The {{optimization}} of {{new generation}} of the wind farms is dependent on our understanding of wind turbine wake development, wake dynamics and {{the interaction of the}} wakes. The overall goal of the optimization is decreasing the fatigue loading and increasing the power production of the wind farms. To this end, numerical simulations of the wake of wind turbine are performed by means of applying fourth order finite volume code, EllipSys 3 D along with the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method. The basic idea behind such <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method is representing the blades  by employing the body forces in the Navier [...] Stokes equations. The forces are then determined through a combination of Blade Element Momentum (BEM) method and tabulated airfoil data. In the first part of thesis, the dynamics of the tip vortices behind a single wind turbine is investigated. The generated wind turbine wake is perturbed using small amplitude disturbances. The amplification of the wave along the spiral triggers some modes leading to wake instability. The perturbed wake is then analyzed using modal decomposition in which  the dominant modes leading to the onset of instability can be identified. Two different cases are studied; symmetric configuration, in that the wake is excited by identical perturbation near each blade tip; and non-symmetric configuration, in which general perturbations are used. The corresponding result confirms that the instability is dispersive and the growth occurs only for specific frequencies in symmetric case. However in general non-symmetric case, all the modes have positive spatial growth rate. This can be explained through the fact that breaking the symmetry results in superposition of the unstable modes related to three-bladed, two-bladed and one-blade wind turbine wake. A rotor experiment has been recently carried out at NTNU wind tunnel using horizontal axis model scale rotors, for detailed investigation of the wake development. A single rotor configuration was first tested and then a setup of two rotors inline was investigated.   Previous numerical investigation of single wind turbine wake using <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method shows that the quality of the result depend on the input tabulated airfoil data. Due to absence of the reliable data, a series of experiments using 2 -D airfoil were carried out at DTU wind tunnel to obtain the tabulated airfoil data for the Reynolds number corresponding to NTNU rotor operating conditions. The numerical simulations using <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method together with the new experimental airfoil data were then carried out for studying the  phenomenon of wake interaction between the two wind turbines. Different cases are simulated with various tip speed ratio of the downstream turbine specifically adjusted to match the NTNU experiments. The characteristics of the interacting wakes were extracted including the rotor performance and the averaged velocity and turbulence fields as well as the development of wake generated vortex structures. The obtained  results were in agreement of NTNU experimental data showing that  numerical computations are reliable tools for prediction of wind turbine aerodynamics. The third aim of the project is to perform a comparison between an analytical vortex model and the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> of an isolated horizontal axis wind turbine (simulated with the ACL approach) to assess whether the predictions by the vortex model can substitute more expensive CFD approaches. The model is based on the constant circulation along three blade (Joukowsky rotor) and it is able to determine the geometry of the tip vortex filament in the rotor wake, allowing the free wake expansion and changing the local tip-vortex pitch. Two different wind turbines have been simulated: one with constant circulation along the blade, to replicate the vortex method approximations, and the other with a realistic circulation distribution, to compare the outcomes of the vortex model with real operative wind turbine conditions (Tjæ reborg wind turbine). The vortex model matched the numerical simulation of the turbine withconstant blade circulation in terms of the near wake structure and the local forces along the blade. The simple vortex codeis therefore able to provide an estimation of the flow around the wind turbine similar to the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> code but with anegligible computational effort. The results from the Tjæ reborg turbine case showed some discrepancies between the twoapproaches although the overall agreement is qualitatively good. This could be considered as a validation for the analytical method for more general conditions. QC 20130412 Nordic Consortium: Optimization and Control of large wind farm...|$|E
40|$|Wind {{power is}} a clean and {{renewable}} energy source, which {{plays an important role}} in the world's energy landscape. When developing a wind farm it is beneficial to analyze the flow pattern in order to maximize the total performance of the wind farm, it is also important to predict wake patterns to prevent structural damage on downstream turbines. Traditional fully detailed CFD models will be very computational heavy to utilize for such analysis. In order to perform an analysis with reasonable computational cost, a simplified model is needed. The <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> model is a simplified model, which is available and implemented in OpenFOAM. Since OpenFOAM is an open source software, it is possible to modify the code as needed. The model was tested, and the results were compared to experimental results from a workshop done by NTNU. In order to achieve the results close to the reference data, the solver needed to be modified. The implicit solver proposed, was able to get close to the reference data for the power and thrust calculations. The <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> model was useful to predict the wake and calculate the power and thrust, but require a significant amount of tuning to achieve the desired results. The model is sensitive to parameter changes, and will be difficult to verify without experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the flow}} around wind {{turbines}} {{is a highly}} relevant research question due to the increased interest in harvesting energy from renewable sources. This thesis approaches the topic by means of numerical simulations using the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method and the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in the spectral element code Nek 5000. The aim is to gain enhanced understanding of the wind turbine wake structure and wind turbine wake interaction. A verification study of the method and implementation is performed against the finite volume solver EllipSys 3 D using two types of turbines, an idealized constant circulation turbine and the Tjæreborg turbine. It is shown that Nek 5000 requires significantly lower resolution to accurately compute the wake development, however, {{at the cost of}} a smaller time step. The constant circulation turbine is investigated further with the goal of establishing guidelines {{for the use of the}} <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> method in spectral element codes, where the mesh is inherently non-equidistant and currently used guidelines of force distribution based on Gaussian kernels are difficult to apply. It is shown that Nek 5000 requires a larger kernel width in the fixed frame of reference to remove numerical instabilities. Further, the impact of different Gaussian widths on the wake development is investigated in the rotating frame of reference, showing that the convection velocity and the breakdown of the spiral tip and root vortices are dependent on the Gaussian width. In the second part, the flow around single and multiple wind-turbine setups at different operating conditions is investigated and compared with experimental results. The focus is placed on comparing the power and thrust coefficients and the wake development based on the time-averaged streamwise velocity and turbulent stresses. Further the influence of the tower model is investigated both upstream and downstream of the turbine. The results show that the wake is captured accurately in most cases. The loading exhibits a significant dependence on the Reynolds number at which the airfoil data is extracted. When the helical tip vortices are stable the turbulent stresses at the tip vortices are underestimated in the numerical simulations. This is due to the finite resolution and the projection of the <b>actuator</b> <b>line</b> forces in the numerical domain using a prescribed Gaussian width, which leads to lower induced velocities in the helical vortices.

40|$|A bidirectionally coupled {{magnetoelastic}} model (BCMEM) {{has been}} extended to include electric currents in its magnetic finite element formulation. This enables the model to capture the magnetoelastic behavior of magnetostrictive materials subjected to elastic stresses and magnetic fields applied not only by permanent magnets but also by current carrying coils used often in transducer applications. This model was implemented by combining finite element solutions of mechanical and magnetic boundary value problems using COMSOL Multiphysics 3. 4 (Finite Element Modeling software) with an energy-based non-linear magnetomechanical constitutive model. The BCMEM was used to simulate <b>actuator</b> load <b>lines</b> and four point bending results for Galfenol, which were then compared to experimental data. The model also captured the &# 916;E effect in Galfenol. The BCMEM {{can be used to}} study and optimize the design of future current driven magnetostrictive devices...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{advent of}} commercially {{available}} giant piezoelectric coefficient monocrystalline {{materials such as}} PMN-PT (lead magnesium niobate - lead titanate) or PZN-PT (lead zinc niobate - lead titanate) broadens the gate for silicon-integrated applications (PiezoMEMS). Becoming more compatible with microtechnology batch processes, further advances are expected in terms of miniaturization, optimization, functionality or integration with electronics, all while reducing manufacturing costs. Subsequently, operating voltage will be lower and devices response time will improve dramatically. The paper compiles a base knowledge for composite bimorph <b>actuators</b> in <b>line</b> with a bottom-up approach for further more complex piezoelectric device designs such as "microrobots-on-chips". Material properties and constitutive equations of piezoelectric bimorph cantilevers are initially overviewed. Analytical and finite elements modeling (FEM) are afterwards performed on two designs : classical PZT on copper cantilevers and innovative PMN-PT and PZN-PT on silicon. Comparative results clearly report quantitative improvement of PMN-PT on Si design in terms of tip displacement and blocking force...|$|R
