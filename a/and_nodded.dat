500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I yelled {{at the top of my}} voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me <b>and</b> <b>nodded</b> reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred on the side of caution by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe cytosolic sensors <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> Toll-like receptors (TLRs) {{activate}} defense signaling pathways {{in response}} to microbial stimuli. However, the role of <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> their interplay with TLRs during systemic bacterial infection remains poorly understood. Here, we report that macrophages or mice made insensitive to TLRs by previous exposure to microbial ligands remained responsive to <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 stimulation. Furthermore, <b>Nod</b> 1 - <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 -mediated signaling and gene expression are enhanced in TLR-tolerant macrophages. Further analyses revealed that innate immune responses induced by bacterial infection relied on <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 <b>and</b> their adaptor RICK in macrophages pretreated with TLR ligands but not in naive macrophages. In addition, bacterial clearance upon systemic infection with L.  monocytogenes was critically dependent on <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 when mice were previously stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or E. coli. Thus, <b>Nod</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Nod</b> 2 are important for microbial recognition and host defense after TLR stimulation...|$|R

Hybridization to EcoRI digests of total DNA to nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> probes from R. meliloti show that the nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> sequences are conserved in both R. japonicum and B. japonicum strains regardless of the plasmid or chromosomal location of these genes. In addition, nif DNA hybridization patterns were identical among all R. japonicum strains and with most of the B. japonicum strains examined. Similarly, many of the bands that hybridize to the nodulation probe isolated from R. meliloti were found to be common among R. japonicum strains. Under reduced hybridization stringency conditions, strong conservation of nodulation sequences was observed in strains of B. japonicum. We have also found that the plasmid pRjaUSDA 193, which possess nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> sequences, does not possess sequence homology with any plasmid of USDA 194, but is homologous to parts of the chromosome of USDA 194. Strain USDA 194 is unique, since nif <b>and</b> <b>nod</b> sequences are present on the chromosome instead of on a plasmid as observed with all other strains examined...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{mononuclear cell}} expression {{and function of}} the cytosolic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing receptors, <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2, in very preterm and full-term infants. Methods: <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 gene <b>and</b> protein expression in very preterm infants, term infants and healthy adult, cord and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (C/PBMC) were quantified using qPCR and flow cytometry. Cytokine responses of purified infant and adult monocytes to <b>NOD</b> 1 - <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 -specific agonists were assessed using a multiplex immunoassay (Bioplex). Results: <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 were expressed by a range of infant and adult mononuclear cell types, including T- and B cells, with highest expression in classical (CD 14 ++CD 16 -) and intermediate (CD 14 ++CD 16 +) monocytes. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 expression levels by monocytes from very preterm infant were similar to those in term infants or adults. Monocyte production of TNFα, IL- 6 and IL- 1 β induced by activation of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 was similar between very preterm infants, term infants and adults. Conclusion: Monocyte expression <b>and</b> function of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 in very preterm infants are intact and comparable/equivalent to term infants and adults. Functional deficiencies in monocyte NOD signalling pathways are unlikely to contribute to the increased susceptibility to bacterial sepsis in preterm infants...|$|R
40|$|<b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 (nucleotide-binding {{oligomerization}} domain-containing proteins 1 and 2) {{are related}} innate immune receptors responsible for initiating {{a response to}} bacterial infection. They belong to a class of receptors known as Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs), which are germline encoded immune receptors that mediate various innate immune responses. These receptors recognize conserved microbial motifs known as Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). The PRR-PAMP paradigm forms the bedrock of how innate immunity is understood today. As two of the first intracellular PRRs discovered, <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 came to define an entire subclass of PRRs, the NOD-like receptors (NLRs). PRRs relay their signals through protein:protein interaction motifs that typically adopt a characteristic Death Domain (DD) fold. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signal through their respective CAspase Recruitment Domains (CARDs), which {{are part of a}} DD subfamily. The CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 interact with multiple downstream effectors and are thus situated at a key point for regulation <b>and</b> coordination of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signaling. To better understand this regulation, I structurally and functionally characterized interactions made by the CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2. Receptor Interacting Protein kinase 2 (RIP 2) is an effector of both <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 that activates the NF-ΚB pathway to elicit an inflammatory response. I discovered a new binding interaction between the CARDs of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 <b>and</b> ubiquitin. Furthermore, I elucidated a role for this interaction by showing that ubiquitin binds <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 CARDs competitively with the CARD of RIP 2. Through biophysical and biochemical investigation, I identified mutants of NOD 1 CARD that did not bind ubiquitin and were thus insensitive to its competitive effect on RIP 2 binding. Utilizing this mutant in functional studies defined ubiquitin as a negative regulator of NOD 1 signaling. Characterizing NOD 1 allowed rational design of mutations that uncovered a similar role for ubiquitin in the NOD 2 pathway. This introduces the potential for broader application of these findings in other DD-mediated pathways. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 also bind the autophagy protein ATG 16 L. I investigated the molecular mechanisms of this interaction <b>and</b> found that <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 bind ATG 16 L through their CARDs. I also found that the domain on ATG 16 L responsible for binding <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 is the C-terminal WD 40 Β-propeller. Furthermore, the CARD:Β-propeller interaction is sufficient to mediate interaction between NOD 1 or <b>NOD</b> 2 <b>and</b> ATG 16 L. The finding that the ATG 16 L Β-propeller also binds ubiquitin leaves open the possibility that ubiquitin regulates pathway selection by <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2. Together, these studies advance our understanding of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 signaling <b>and</b> lay the groundwork for further mechanistic investigations into coordination of inflammatory and autophagic signaling pathways by the immune system in general...|$|R

40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 12 months post date of publicationPreterm birth {{remains one}} of the most {{important}} issues facing perinatal medicine today, with chronic inflammation and/or infection being the biggest etiological factor. The nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognize a wide range of microbial products as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor KB (NFKB), a central regulator of the terminal processes of human labor and delivery. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of 1) human labor, proinflammatory cytokines, and bacterial endotoxin LPS on <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 expression <b>and</b> 2) <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 activation on the expression of prolabor mediators in human fetal membranes <b>and</b> myometrium. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 expression was significantly higher in fetal membranes and myometrium after spontaneous labor when compared to nonlaboring tissues. Bacterial endotoxin LPS and the proinflammatory cytokines TNF and IL 1 B significantly increased NOD 2, but not NOD 1, expression. Furthermore, LPS-induced NOD 2 expression was decreased by the NFKB inhibitor BAY 11 - 7082. In both fetal membranes <b>and</b> myometrium, the <b>NOD</b> 1 ligand bacterial iE-DAP <b>and</b> the <b>NOD</b> 2 ligand bacterial MDP significantly increased the expression and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (IL 6 and IL 8), cyclooxygenase (PTGS 2) expression and subsequent release of prostaglandins PGE 2 and PGF 2 alpha, and the expression and activity of MMP 9. The effects of these <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 ligands were mediated via NFKB, as 1) both iE-DAP and MDP significantly increased NFKB activation and 2) the NFKB inhibitor BAY 11 - 7082 attenuated iE-DAP- and MDP-induced expression and secretion of prolabor mediators. In conclusion, <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 are increased in laboring fetal membranes and myometrium and with bacterial infection. Agonist activation of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 by bacterial products leads to NFKB activation and transcription of NFKB induced prolabor genes. <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 may thus represent therapeutic targets for the treatment and/or management of preterm birth.

40|$|Abstract. Nod-like receptors (NLRs) are cytosolic sensors for {{microbial}} molecules. Νucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (<b>NOD)</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 {{recognize the}} peptidoglycan derivatives, meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP) and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), respectively, and trigger host innate immune responses. In the present study, {{we examined the}} function of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 on innate immune responses in human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. The gene expres-sion of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 was examined by RT-PCR. IL- 6 and IL- 8 production in culture supernatants was measured by ELISA. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the activation of NF-κB and MAPK in response to Tri-DAP and MDP. The genes of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 appeared to be expressed in PDL cells. Although the levels of NOD 2 expres-sion were weak in intact cells, MDP stimulation increased the gene expression of NOD 2 in PDL cells. Tri-DAP and MDP led {{to the production of}} IL- 6 and IL- 8 and the activation of NF-κB and MAPK in PDL cells. Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation led to increased gene expression of <b>NOD</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>NOD</b> 2 in PDL cells. Pam 3 CSK 4 (a TLR 2 agonist) and IFN-γ synergized with Tri-DAP and MDP to produce IL- 8 and IL- 6 in PDL cells.
