In December 2012, GAO reported that TSA had not provided guidance to airport operators on its application and approval process, which had been revised to reflect requirements in the Federal Aviation Administration Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. Further, airport operators GAO interviewed at the time generally stated that they faced difficulties completing the revised application, {{such as how to}} obtain cost information. Therefore, GAO recommended that TSA develop <b>application</b> <b>guidance,</b> and TSA concurred. To address GAO's recommendation, TSA updated its SPP website in December 2012 by providing general <b>application</b> <b>guidance</b> and a description of the criteria and process the agency uses to assess airports' SPP applications. The guidance provides examples of information that airports could consider providing to TSA to help assess their suitability for the program and also outlines how the agency will analyze cost information. The new guidance addresses the intent of GAO's recommendation and should help improve transparency of the SPP application process as well as help airport operators determine whether their airports are good candidates for the SPP. ...|$|E

In this paper, the current approaches to revenue recognition under both systems are compared. The most significant difference is the general approach to revenue recognition. There is the Conceptual Framework where revenue is defined, two standards on revenue recognition and interpretations concerning revenue recognition and measurement in the IAS/IFRS. On the other hand, there are many standards and guidance concerning revenue in the US GAAP. Revenue is defined in the Statements of Financial Accounting concepts (CON 5, CON 6). There is not any general standard for revenue recognition under the US GAAP. The most significant differences in revenue recognition concern the long-term contracts and deferred payments. Despite this difference, there are many similarities between both systems.

Elimination of existing differences between US GAAP and IFRSs is demanded, because numerous differences between US GAAP and IFRS can result in significant differences in reported numbers.

40|$|Much of the {{complexity}} and overhead (directory, state bits, invalidations) of a typical directory coherence implementation stems from the effort to make it “invisible ” even to the strongest memory consistency model.

Self-invalidation of the shared data at synchronization points allows us to remove the directory (and invalidations) completely, with just a data-race-free guarantee from software.
