5|$|Homer {{returns to}} {{apologize}} but is turned away by <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> Burns. With no one around, Burns learns {{to do things}} himself and soon becomes completely self-reliant. After thanking Homer for making him learn that he can fend for himself, Burns fires Smithers when he returns from his vacation. Smithers and Homer engage in a fight within Burns' office which ends when Burns accidentally falls out the window. Burns is seriously injured and becomes reliant on Smithers once again. In gratitude, Smithers sends Homer a fruit basket.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, {{during an}} {{appearance}} at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches. In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks. In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards. In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> White House, appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education, and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar of the ocean and the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E

5|$|The {{paintings}} {{of the first generation}} of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the Life of Mary vastly predominate.|$|E
5|$|Treatises {{such as the}} Vishnudharmottara Purana {{and various}} Agamas {{describe}} the iconography of the ayudhapurushas. Shakti is depicted as a red-hued woman seated on a wolf. The Danda is <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> black-complexioned man with wrathful red eyes. The Khadga is also a dark and angry man. Pasha is depicted as a male snake with seven hoods. Dhvaja ("banner") is a yellow-coloured strong man with his mouth wide open. The Trishula is a handsome black-complexioned man with lovely eyebrows. The Shankha {{is described as a}} white male with adorable eyes. The Bana (arrow) is a red-coloured man with beautiful eyes, however the Vaikhaashagama describes it to be a black-complexioned eunuch with three eyes, dressed in white clothes and riding on the wind. The Dhanus (bow) is a red lotus coloured female with a stringed bow on her head. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes Chakra as man with a fat belly and round eyes, decorated with various ornaments and holding a chamara (chowry) and with Vishnu's left hand on his head. The slim-waisted woman Gada holds a chowry in her hands and is adored with ornaments, with Vishnu's right hand resting on her head.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the signs}} of pain in babies are obvious, {{requiring}} no special equipment or training. The baby is crying and irritable when awake, develops a disturbed sleep pattern, feeds poorly, and shows <b>a</b> <b>fearful,</b> distrustful reaction towards care-givers.|$|E
25|$|Neuropeptide Y receptors {{have a great}} {{concentration}} in the amygdala, which {{is involved in the}} modulation of fear. Research where Neuropeptide Y was administered intracerebroventricularly showed that it was important in consolidation of memory because it increased immediate and long-term forgetting. The antagonizing of a subtype of receptor for Neuropeptide Y caused the opposite effects- it decreased the likelihood that <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> memory would be forgotten.|$|E
25|$|The four survivors, David Kilpatrick a {{passenger}} from Paisley, Renfrewshire, William John Simpson, the 19-year-old apprentice, and nephew of the captain, and two able seamen William Mitchell and Duncan McMillan, had to scale steep cliffs {{before they could}} even begin to get help. Kilpatrick was in <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> state and could not climb up but eventually his companions helped him to the top, cutting his feet badly during the climb.|$|E

25|$|Phase two then began. One {{no longer}} felt that the bowler was {{remotely}} interested in the stumps, but having scattered his fielders around the boundary, relied now, {{in the form of}} bait, on a species of poisoned chocolate. Bartlett paid scant heed to these exiled boundary creatures: at alarming rates he drove between, over, and if needs be, through them. He was a firm footed hitter, possessed of a long reach, and the trajectory of his drives was low and of <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> power.|$|E
25|$|After Cao Cao died in March 220, Qu Yan (麴演) {{started a}} {{rebellion}} in Xiping Commandery (西平郡; around present-day Xining, Qinghai). When Su Ze heard about it, he led troops from Jincheng Commandery {{to quell the}} revolt. <b>A</b> <b>fearful</b> Qu Yan surrendered to Su Ze. Cao Cao's son and successor Cao Pi, who became the new de facto head of the Han central government, granted Su Ze the additional appointment of Colonel Who Protects the Qiang (護羌校尉) and enfeoffed him as a Secondary Marquis (關內侯) {{as a reward for}} his success in putting down the rebellion.|$|E
25|$|Stefan reveals Helena (now Constance Towers) {{had ordered}} him to kill Lesley. He instead saved her, though {{she was in a}} {{catatonic}} state. When mother and daughter are reunited, Luke conspires with Tom Hardy (Matthew Ashford) to fake their deaths to keep them safe from Helena. When their ruse is uncovered, the mourning Nikolas, Bobby, and Stefan turn against the family. Stefan threatens to reveal to Luke he could be Nikolas' father, and forces Laura to leave town with Lesley. <b>A</b> <b>fearful</b> Laura takes her mother and Lulu to Switzerland, under the guise of getting better care for Lesley.|$|E

25|$|Another form of {{psychotherapy}} which has shown effectiveness in controlled clinical trials is panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy, {{which focuses on}} the role of dependency, separation anxiety, and anger in causing panic disorder. The underlying theory posits that due to biochemical vulnerability, traumatic early experiences, or both, people with panic disorder have <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> dependence on others for their sense of security, which leads to separation anxiety and defensive anger. Therapy involves first exploring the stressors that lead to panic episodes, then probing the psychodynamics of the conflicts underlying panic disorder and the defense mechanisms that contribute to the attacks, with attention to transference and separation anxiety issues implicated in the therapist-patient relationship.|$|E
25|$|In the {{two years}} {{immediately}} following World War II, the UPWA threatened repeatedly to have its federal workers strike. <b>A</b> <b>fearful</b> Congress passed legislation in 1946 depriving federal workers of their salaries if they belonged to any union which advocated the right of federal workers to strike, and which required them to sign affidavits {{that they did not}} belong to any union which did. In 1947, Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act, which made it illegal for federal employees to strike and penalized them with immediate dismissal. A third federal law, passed in 1955, made it illegal for federal workers to strike, advocate the right to strike, or belong to any organization which advocated the right for them to strike.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer, domesticity {{was just}} not in his line. He began his innings usually as one who, {{suffering}} from violent astigmatism, has not only mislaid his glasses, but had in addition <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> headache. He made a pass or two after the ball had gone past him: he lunged fitfully and missed: he stabbed down just in time at the straight ones: he sliced the rising offside ball over the second slip: he snicked hazily past his leg stump. So, for {{about a quarter of}} an hour, it went on: or, to such an agonized onlooker as I, it seemed to go on. Then suddenly, he would catch a half volley or a long hop such a crack that the bowler, fearful of his own safety, lost all his aggressive intention, and, with it, any idea of length.|$|E
60|$|June saw Irene {{look up at}} {{him through}} her screen of blossoms. It was not the look of a coquette, but--far worse to the {{watching}} girl--of <b>a</b> woman <b>fearful</b> lest that look should say too much.|$|R

25|$|In 1972, Sullivan {{was working}} inside a ranger station in Shenandoah National Park when another strike occurred. It set his hair on fire; {{he tried to}} smother the flames with his jacket. He then rushed to the restroom, but couldn't fit under the water tap and so used a wet towel instead. Although he never was <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a fear of death. For months, whenever he {{was caught in a}} storm while driving his truck, he would pull over and lie down on the front seat until the storm passed. He also began to believe that he would somehow attract lightning even if he stood in a crowd of people, and carried a can of water with him in case his hair was set on fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{advertising}} {{program for the}} Crown Jewels sandwiches featured the slogan Flash, but not too flash which was an inference stating while they cost more than the standard burger offerings at BK, they were {{not as much as}} one would expect to pay at a higher end outlet. The products were introduced in a series of three pairs of commercials in both 15 and 30 second formats. The commercials featured animals such as snails or frogs that are used as exotic cuisine in various regions of the world. As the narrator announces BK is looking for new and more complex ingredients for their new line of sandwiches, the animals are shown reacting in <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> way believing they are the new ingredients. At the end, the narrator declares one of the new flavors and the animal is relieved to find out they are not food, then they are promptly dispatched by the new food item (e.g. the frog is hit with a mango).|$|E
25|$|Freedom fighter Kröd Mändoon (Sean Maguire) {{arrives at}} a safehouse along with his pig-like 'Grobble' servant Loquasto (Steve Speirs), sorcerer friend Zezelryck (Kevin Hart), {{flamboyant}} sidekick Bruce (Marques Ray) and the Pagan warrioress Aneka (India de Beaufort), with whom Kröd is having trouble moving on from following their recent break-up. Kröd insists the group is safe there, but is surprised when innkeeper Hugo (Dominic Coleman) tries to poison him for reward money, as Dongalor is offering a substantial reward for Krod and Aneka, dead or alive. An angry mob arrives to try to capture the pair and Hugo threatens to burn the stronghold down. But when his two wives arrive and meet each other, <b>a</b> <b>fearful</b> Hugo risks his life to help Kröd and his friends escape. Meanwhile, the evil Chancellor Dongalor (Matt Lucas) learns {{at a press conference}} that the Emperor Xanus is sending a weapons inspector to investigate his castle. He orders his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) to hide the Eye of Gulga Grymna, an ancient weapon Dongalor has been secretly studying.|$|E
