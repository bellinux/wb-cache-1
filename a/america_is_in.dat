The 2nd Regiment was assigned to Camp Cooke and the 1st to Camp Beale. Eventually, more than 7,000 soldiers would be assigned to the Filipino Infantry Regiments. While at Camp Beale, there was a mass naturalization ceremony of 1,200 soldiers of the Regiment. As members {{of the armed forces}} they were able to become citizens; in 1924 naturalization of Filipino Americans had been barred, as it was determined that only aliens could be naturalized and Filipinos at the time were nationals.

Collectively, people of Sephardic Bnei Anusim Jewish descent in Latin <b>America</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> the millions.

They may or may not consider themselves Jewish, some may continue to preserve some of their Jewish heritage in secrecy, many others may not even be aware of it. The majority would not be halakhically Jewish, but small numbers of various communities have formally returned to Judaism over the past decade, legitimizing their status as Jews. See also Anusim.|$|E

500|$|Journalist Catherine Putz {{commented on}} the phrase in a 2016 article for the {{international}} news magazine The Diplomat, and compared it to use of whataboutism by businessman and politician Donald Trump: [...] "Criticisms {{of human rights in}} the Soviet Union were often met with what became a common catchphrase: 'And you are lynching Negroes'." [...] She pointed out the folly of its use: [...] "It demands, by default, for a state to argue abroad only in favor of ideals it has achieved the highest perfection in." [...] Writing for the liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli journalist Chemi Shalev made a similar comparison: [...] "Trump told the New York Times this week that <b>America</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> such a mess in terms of civil liberties that it cannot lecture foreign countries anymore, which is an echo of old Soviet propaganda that responded to American reprimands with the retort 'And you are lynching Negroes'." [...] Shalev followed-up on this analysis in a subsequent article, writing: [...] "Trump conducts pro-Russian propaganda along the same lines as the old retort 'And You Hang Blacks' with which the Soviets tried to deflect U.S. criticism of their human rights abuses. He isn't troubled by Putin's political opponents being murdered, because 'people get killed here too'." [...] Writing for ChinaFile after Trump won the 2016 U.S. election, James Palmer feared an increase in racism [...] "would give a brutal new credibility to the old Soviet whataboutism whenever they were challenged on the gulag: 'But in America, you lynch Negroes'." [...] In her work Security Threats and Public Perception, Elizaveta Gaufman characterized the phrase as a form of reversing someone's line of reasoning against them. Gaufman wrote that by using this phrase in an argument, one was tacitly refusing to answer queries posted to them and instead responding with condemnations.|$|E
