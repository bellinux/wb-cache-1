5|$|In a {{fifth and}} final case, (not {{present in the}} {{original}} Game Boy <b>Advance</b> <b>release,</b> but added for the DS and subsequent releases) Phoenix, now running Fey's firm as Wright and Co., is hired by teenager Ema Skye to defend her sister Lana, {{the head of the}} prosecutor's office, in a case where the body of a detective, Bruce Goodman, was found in the trunk of Edgeworth's car. Together with Ema, Phoenix traces the origins of the murder to an incident two years prior, in which a serial killer allegedly murdered Edgeworth's predecessor while trying to escape custody. Damon Gant, a senior police captain, is tricked into admitting that he framed Ema for the murder in order to manipulate Lana into doing his bidding. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she agrees to resign her post in order to face judgement for protecting Gant. With Ema being sent to Europe to continue training as a forensic investigator, Phoenix looks forward to continuing his career defending the innocent.|$|E

500|$|On April 27, 2010, Square Enix {{producer}} Shinji Hashimoto {{stated that}} the development of a remake of Final Fantasy V for the Nintendo DS is at present [...] "undecided" [...] due to [...] "technical issues". However, on June 24, 2010, he added that a remake for the Nintendo 3DS is being considered, but he would first have to [...] "look and see how 3DS does, how it evolves, and then make a decision". [...] In December 2012 Square Enix announced that a remastered version of the game would be released on iOS. The enhanced port, which was developed by Matrix Software, was released on March 28, 2013 on the Apple App Store for iOS devices, with an Android release via the Google Play Store on 26 September. The game features new high resolution graphics with sprites designed by Kazuko Shibuya, who did the original game's artwork, new gameplay features such as movement in eight directions and auto-battle, and contains the Sealed Temple and super-boss Enuo from the Game Boy <b>Advance</b> <b>release.</b> In September 2015 the remaster was released on PC via Steam.|$|E

500|$|The EarthBound fan {{community}} at Starmen.net coalesced {{with the intent}} to have Nintendo of America acknowledge the Mother series. 1UP.com described their intent as reasonable given the company's [...] "frequent dismissal" [...] of the series alongside the community's [...] "monumental efforts to increase American EarthBound awareness". Young felt that their [...] "underdog status" [...] kept Starmen.net vigilant. He also said that he views the community as [...] "a big group of friends having fun together" [...] and sometimes thinks that it is just happenstance that EarthBound was what brought them together, as opposed to another franchise like Pokémon. As the site started in 1999, the community started a petition to have Nintendo release Mother for the Game Boy Color, and collected 1850 physical signatures to this end and bound it in a book for Nintendo. The final word from Nintendo was that the package was received. Other petitions include the 2000 10,000-person petition for a North American Mother 3 release on the Nintendo 64, the 2003 31,000-person petition for a North American Mother 1+2 Game Boy <b>Advance</b> <b>release,</b> and letter and phone campaigns. A source internal to Nintendo later told them that the 2003 campaign was almost successful, but fell out of consideration as the phone campaign ended after a week. The community resolved to never let up again.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the Game Boy <b>Advance</b> <b>release</b> in 2002, Craig Harris of IGN {{wrote that}} Yoshi's Island was both the console's best {{platformer}} {{as well as}} [...] "the best damn platformer ever developed". While acknowledging the game's roots in the Super Mario series, he said the game created enough gameplay ideas to constitute its own franchise. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that the game's story was also interesting as the origin story for the Mario brothers. Harris felt that the FX2 sprite-changing effects gave the game [...] "life" [...] and that the Game Boy Advance cartridge could handle the effects just as well. He added that Yoshi's morphing abilities and sound effects were designed well. Levi Buchanan of IGN said the game struck the right balance of tutorial by trial and error. IGN's Harris also noted a few Game Boy Advance-specific issues: framerate drop in areas where a lot is happening onscreen, camera panning problems due to the screen's lower resolution, and a [...] "poor" [...] implementation of the [...] "dizzy" [...] special effect on the handheld release. Critics wrote that the [...] "coloring book"-style graphics held up well. IGN's Harris felt {{it was the best}} of the Super Mario Advance games. Of the similar version for the Wii U, Watts of Nintendo Life also noticed the framerate issues and problems resulting from the screen's closer crop, which were [...] "not enough to ruin the game, but ... noticeable". Edge felt that game's only disappointment was the linearity of its overworld following the exploratory Super Mario World and that the sequel would [...] "inevitably ... have less impact" [...] in comparison.|$|E
500|$|In May 2014, {{photographer}} Mert Alas {{posted on}} his Instagram account {{that he was}} listening to a new Madonna album, but Billboard clarified {{that she was still}} in the process of recording it in Los Angeles. They later posted a 50-second snippet of an instrumental which media claimed to be from Madonna, but the sample was traced back to Dutch DJ Sander Kleinenberg and his song [...] "We Are Superstars". Oseary confirmed that Madonna looked forward to a 2015 release date for the album. However, on November 28, 2014, two songs titled [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] and [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] were leaked onto the Internet; the songs were immediately taken down, and Oseary tweeted asking for assistance in finding the source of the leaks. On December 17, 2014, a total of thirteen songs were leaked, as well as artwork suggesting the album was to be named Iconic. An aggravated Madonna clarified that the songs were demo versions from earlier recordings; she described the leak as [...] "artistic rape". The singer was also criticized for referring to the hack as [...] "terrorism", due to the then-recent Peshawar school massacre and the Sydney hostage crisis. Madonna said in a Billboard interview that after the leak she and her team tried to trace it back to the source, but ultimately decided to release the finished songs. Referring to the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, she was critical of the Internet and explained that the incident led to her securing her laptop and hard drives, and disabling the Wi-Fi. [...] "I wanted to plan everything in <b>advance.</b> <b>Release</b> the single, shoot a video, start talking about my record. And you know, prepare for the release of the entire album and have everything set up just so... But we sort of were left with no choice", she added.|$|E

2500|$|The 2002 Game Boy <b>Advance</b> <b>release</b> was panned {{by critics}} as well, {{but this time}} due to the game having [...] an [...] "unfinished" [...] game engine, glitched graphics, and an {{unpredictable}} save system. IGN stated that [...] "the action tends to slow down in the most unlikely locations ...and the gameplay's inconsistent...load a game where you instantly die for no apparent reason". GameSpot felt similarly, calling it [...] "unplayable".|$|E

As with the Game Boy <b>Advance</b> <b>release,</b> it is an emulation of the original game, so nothing is changed from the original NES release. Super Mario Bros. {{is also one of}} the trial games available in the [...] "Masterpieces" [...] section in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. Super Mario Bros. was released on the Nintendo 3DS in September 2011 for members of Nintendo's 3DS Ambassador Program, and a general release came through in Japan on January 5, 2012, in North America on February 16, 2012 and in Europe on March 1, 2012.

2500|$|The Game Boy <b>Advance</b> <b>release</b> {{marked the}} first English-language {{appearance}} of Tales of Phantasia, which was met with mostly positive reception in the West, earning a 73% average from GameRankings and 76 out of 100 rating from Metacritic. While websites such as GameSpot felt that the game distinguished itself from other role-playing titles with its action-based combat system, it also overly-relied on too many random battles to [...] "drag down the pacing and pad out the playing time". IGN commented that the battle system was unrefined when compared to later games in the series such as Tales of Symphonia on the GameCube, but that the graphic and audio quality held up [...] "relatively well" [...] eleven years after its original release. The site would also call the story and characters [...] "amazing", but that its dated design would only appeal to players familiar with older games in the genre, calling it a [...] "love/hate" [...] experience. Editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly remarked that [...] "fans of traditional RPGs will appreciate its long, varied dungeons and action-packed, real-time battles," [...] and that it [...] "still has {{an awful lot of}} charm for such an old game". Eurogamer expressed that the title's late release {{near the end of the}} handheld's life hurt it when compared to similar ports on Sony's PlayStation Portable, and that the game's [...] "messy" [...] interface and [...] "rough around the edges" [...] localization paled in comparison to the Super Famicom's unofficial fan translation.|$|E
