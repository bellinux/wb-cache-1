5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm to inflate the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of <b>a</b> <b>ventilator.</b> It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|Several {{setbacks}} {{plagued the}} design process. The mine {{in particular was}} delayed several times from its expected completion from 1771 to 1776. Piloting Turtle, moreover, required great physical stamina and coordination. The operator would have to adjust the bilge {{in order to keep}} from sinking while providing his own propulsion by use of a crank, which worked a propeller located {{on the front of the}} submarine, and direction by use of a lever that would operate and direct a rudder in the back. The cabin also reportedly held air for only thirty minutes of use. Thereafter, the operator would have to surface and replenish the air through <b>a</b> <b>ventilator.</b> Obviously, training would be needed in order to ensure the project's success due to the complex nature of the machine. “The boat was moved from Ezra’s farm on the Westbrook Road to what is now Ayer’s Point in Old Saybrook on the Connecticut River,” writes historian Lincoln Diamant. Bushnell had a Yale connection here that allowed him to run trials in secrecy. Bushnell did the initial testing of his submarine here, choosing his brother, Ezra, as the pilot. Despite Bushnell's insistence on secrecy surrounding his work, news of it quickly made its way to the British, abetted by a Loyalist spy working for New York Congressman James Duane.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{following}} the surgery, {{the patient is}} placed in an intensive care unit for monitoring, normally {{for a period of}} a few days. The patient is put on <b>a</b> <b>ventilator</b> to assist breathing. Nutritional needs are generally met via total parenteral nutrition, although in some cases a nasogastric tube is sufficient for feeding. Chest tubes are put in so that excess fluids may be removed. Because the patient is confined to bed, a urinary catheter is used. IV lines are used in the neck and arm for monitoring and giving medications.|$|E
25|$|The {{anaesthetic}} machine (UK English) or anesthesia machine (US English) or Boyle's {{machine is}} used by anaesthesiologists, nurse anaesthetists, and anaesthesiologist assistants to support the administration of anaesthesia. The {{most common type of}} anaesthetic machine in use in the developed world is the continuous-flow anaesthetic machine, which is designed to provide an accurate and continuous supply of medical gases (such as oxygen and nitrous oxide), mixed with an accurate concentration of anaesthetic vapour (such as isoflurane), and deliver this to the patient at a safe pressure and flow. Modern machines incorporate <b>a</b> <b>ventilator,</b> suction unit, and patient monitoring devices.|$|E
25|$|Botulism {{can result}} in death due to {{respiratory}} failure. However, in the past 50 years, the proportion of patients with botulism who die has fallen from about 50% to 7% due to improved supportive care.

The respiratory failure and paralysis that occur with severe botulism may require a person {{to be on a}} breathing machine (ventilator) for weeks or months.

A passenger seated near Fisher reported that she had stopped breathing; another passenger performed CPR on Fisher until paramedics arrived at the scene.

25|$|On 12 November 2007, a 13-ft long {{reticulated}} python {{was found}} in <b>a</b> <b>ventilator</b> inside the pygmy hippopotamus enclosure in the zoo. According to the zoo officials, the rescued python could have escaped from its enclosure, when it was young, 4 to 5 years ago. When the workers tried to take the reptile, it bit one of the animal keepers, but {{since it was a}} non-poisonous one, the animal keeper was not harmed fatally and was provided treatment for the injury. The reptile was feeding on small mammals, roaming freely inside the zoo, which helped it survive without any problem.|$|E
25|$|In another trial, vaginal {{progesterone}} {{was shown}} {{to be better than}} placebo in reducing preterm birth prior to 34 weeks in women with an extremely short cervix at baseline. An editorial by Roberto Romero discusses the role of sonographic cervical length in identifying patients who may benefit from progesterone treatment. A meta-analysis published in 2011 found that vaginal progesterone cut the risk of premature births by 42 percent in women with short cervixes. The meta-analysis, which pooled published results of five large clinical trials, also found that the treatment cut the rate of breathing problems and reduced the need for placing a baby on <b>a</b> <b>ventilator.</b>|$|E
40|$|Purposes: Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the synchronization of different ventilators with spontaneous breathing under non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) delivered by helmet interface to the diseased lung. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate ventilator synchronization under pathological conditions by testing the difference of trigger sensitivity between <b>an</b> ordinary ICU <b>ventilator</b> and <b>an</b> NPPV <b>ventilator</b> which are used in our intensive care unit. Methods: A simulator was used to set three lung conditions: (1) normal: compliance (C) of 50 mL/cmH 2 O and airway resistance (R) of 5 cmH 2 O/L/sec; (2) obstructive: C 50, R 20; and (3) restrictive: C 20, R 5, respectively. To test trigger sensitivity, pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode and spontaneous/time (S/T) mode were selected for the ordinary and NPPV ventilators. We tested multiple positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP; 5, 10, 15 cmH 2 O) and pressure support (PS; 5, 10, 15 cmH 2 O) settings, and recorded the inspiratory and expiratory trigger delays under each lung condition. Results: With <b>an</b> ordinary ICU <b>ventilator,</b> neither inspiratory nor expiratory trigger delays were significantly affected by PEEP or PS under any lung conditions. In contrast, with <b>an</b> NPPV <b>ventilator,</b> auto-triggers were frequently recorded for some combinations of PS and lung conditions at 5 cmH 2 O of PEEP; inspiratory trigger delays worsened at peak inspiratory pressures ≥ 25 cmH 2 O, and under obstructive conditions, expiratory trigger delays were prolonged in accordance with increasing PS. Conclusions: An ordinary ICU ventilator is superior to <b>an</b> NPPV <b>ventilator</b> in achieving synchronization with spontaneous breathing, especially under obstructive condition and with combination of low PEEP and high PS. We consider that <b>an</b> ordinary <b>ventilator</b> is better choice for such situation than <b>an</b> NPPV <b>ventilator...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Hatlestad Slide was a {{slide of}} mud and rock which {{occurred}} {{in the early morning}} of September 14, 2005 in a rural area in Bergen, Norway, as a result of heavy rainfall. The slide killed three people, wounded seven, and displaced many more, as it hit a row of residential houses in its path while the houses' occupants were asleep. The event is notable not only for the loss of life it caused, but also for how it altered Norwegian policies on environmentalism and housing construction, as well as emergency management. In addition, the question on whether or not to end the treatment of fatally wounded Kristina Hjartåker, who was put on <b>a</b> <b>ventilator</b> until her death in February, sparked national debate, both on the case itself and on the ending of life-prolonging treatment in general.|$|E
