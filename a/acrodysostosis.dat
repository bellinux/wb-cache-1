40|$|<b>Acrodysostosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{skeletal}} dysplasia, {{which has}} not been reported previously in patients of Chinese origin. The PRKAR 1 A gene and PDE 4 D gene {{have been found to be}} causative genes of <b>acrodysostosis.</b> A Chinese girl with <b>acrodysostosis</b> and concomitant multiple hormone resistance was recruited for our study. Clinical and biochemical characters were analyzed. DNA was extracted from leukocytes and was sequenced for GNAS, PDE 4 D and PRKAR 1 A gene mutations. A de novo heterozygous missense mutation (c. 866 G>A/p. G 289 E) was identified in the PRKAR 1 A gene. This mutation coincided with a mutation that had been found in a patient from another ethnic group. Our findings further suggest that the c. 866 G>A/p.

40|$|<b>Acrodysostosis</b> is a dominantly-inherited, multisystem {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} skeletal, endocrine, and neurological abnormalities.

Two of the mutations were demonstrated to have occurred de novo, providing strong genetic evidence of causation. Two additional cases were heterozygous for de novo missense mutations in PRKAR 1 A, which encodes the cAMP-dependent regulatory subunit of protein kinase A and which has been recently reported to be the cause of a form of <b>acrodysostosis</b> resistant to multiple hormones.

40|$|Shortening of the tubular {{bones of}} the hands and feet with cone shaped epiphyses is known as {{peripheral}} dysostosis and is common to several syndromes including <b>acrodysostosis</b> and Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). The underlying defect in AHO {{is known to be}} a reduction in bioactivity of the alpha subunit of the signal transducing protein, Gs, and heterozygous deactivating mutations have been shown in the Gs alpha gene. Because of additional overlapping clinical and radiological features {{it has been suggested that}} <b>acrodysostosis</b> and AHO represent poles of a single diagnostic spectrum. We have measured Gs alpha bioactivity in two unrelated patients with a clinical diagnosis of <b>acrodysostosis</b> and found both to be normal. Mutation analysis of the Gs alpha gene showed no sequence variation in 12 of the 13 exons examined. These results indicate that, at least in a proportion of patients with <b>acrodysostosis,</b> the condition is aetiologically distinct from AHO...|$|E
40|$|Context: <b>Acrodysostosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{skeletal}} dysplasia that {{is associated}} with multiple resistance to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling hormones in a subset of patients. <b>Acrodysostosis</b> is genetically heterogeneous because it results from heterozygous mutations in PRKAR 1 A or PDE 4 D, two key actors in the GPCR-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway. Objective: Our objective was to identify the phenotypic features that distinguish the two genotypes causing <b>acrodysostosis.</b> Patients and Methods: Sixteen unrelated patients with <b>acrodysostosis</b> underwent a candidategene approach and were investigated for phenotypic features. Results: All patients had heterozygous de novo mutations. Fourteen patients carried a PRKAR 1 A mutation (PRKAR 1 A patients), five each a novel PRKAR 1 A mutation (p. Q 285 R, p. G 289 E, p. A 328 V, p. R 335 L, or p. Q 372 X), nine the reported PRKAR 1 A p. R 368 X mutation; two patients harbored a mutation in PDE 4 D (PDE 4 D patients) (one novel mutation, p. A 227 S; one reported, p. E 590 A). All PRKAR 1 A, but none of the PDE 4 D mutated patients were resistant to PTH and TSH. Two PRKAR 1 A patients each with a novel mutation presented a specific pattern of brachydactyly. One PDE 4 D patient presented with acroskyphodysplasia. Additional phenotypic differences included mental retardation in PDE 4 D patients. In addition, we report the presence of pigmented skin lesions in PRKAR 1 A and PDE 4 D patients, a feature not yet described in the <b>acrodysostosis</b> entity. Conclusions: All PRKAR 1 A and PDE 4 D patients present similar bone dysplasia characterizing <b>acrodysostosis.</b> Phenotypic differences, including the presence of resistance to GPCR-cAMP signaling hormones in PRKAR 1 A but not PDE 4 D patients, indicate phenotype-genotype correlations and highlight the specific contributions of PRKAR 1 A and PDE 4 D in cAMP signaling in different tissues.

40|$|<b>Acrodysostosis</b> is {{characterized}} by a peripheral dysostosis that is accompanied by short stature, midface hypoplasia, and developmental delay. Recently, it was shown that heterozygous point mutations in the PRKAR 1 A gene cause <b>acrodysostosis</b> with hormone resistance. By mutational analysis of the PRKAR 1 A gene we detected four different mutations (p. Arg 368 Stop, p. Ala 213 Thr, p. Tyr 373 Cys, and p. Arg 335 Cys) in four of seven affected patients with <b>acrodysostosis.</b> The combination of clinical results, endocrinological parameters and in silico mutation analysis gives evidence to suppose a pathogenic effect of each mutation. This assumption is supported by the de novo origin of these mutations. Apart from typical radiological abnormalities of the hand bones, elevated thyroid stimulating hormone and parathyroid hormone values as well as short stature are the most common findings. Less frequent features are characteristic facial dysmorphisms, sensorineural hearing loss and mild intellectual disability. These results lead to the conclusion that mutations of PKRAR 1 A are the major molecular cause for <b>acrodysostosis</b> with endocrinological abnormalities. In addition, in our cohort of 44 patients affected with brachydactyly type E (BDE) we detected only one sequence variant of PRKAR 1 A (p. Asp 227 Asn) with an unclear effect on protein function. Thus, we conclude that PRKAR 1 A mutations may play no major role in the pathogenesis of BDE...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acrodysostosis</b> {{is a rare}} autosomal-dominant {{condition}} {{characterized by}} facial dysostosis, severe brachydactyly with cone-shaped epiphyses, and short stature. Moderate intellectual disability and resistance to multiple hormones might also be present. Recently, a recurrent mutation (c. 1102 C>T [p. Arg 368 ∗]) in PRKAR 1 A has been identified in three individuals with <b>acrodysostosis</b> and resistance to multiple hormones. After studying ten unrelated <b>acrodysostosis</b> cases, we report here de novo PRKAR 1 A mutations in five out of the ten individuals (we found c. 1102 C>T [p. Arg 368 ∗] {{in four of the}} ten and c. 1117 T>C [p. Tyr 373 His] in one of the ten). We performed exome sequencing in two of the five remaining individuals and selected phosphodiesterase 4 D (PDE 4 D) as a candidate gene. PDE 4 D encodes a class IV cyclic AMP (cAMP) -specific phosphodiesterase that regulates cAMP concentration. Exome analysis detected heterozygous PDE 4 D mutations (c. 673 C>A [p. Pro 225 Thr] and c. 677 T>C [p. Phe 226 Ser]) in these two individuals. Screening of PDE 4 D identified heterozygous mutations (c. 568 T>G [p. Ser 190 Ala] and c. 1759 A>C [p. Thr 587 Pro]) in two additional <b>acrodysostosis</b> cases. These mutations occurred de novo in all four cases. The four individuals with PDE 4 D mutations shared common clinical features, namely characteristic midface and nasal hypoplasia and moderate intellectual disability. Metabolic screening was normal in three of these four individuals. However, resistance to parathyroid hormone and thyrotropin was consistently observed in the five cases with PRKAR 1 A mutations. Finally, our study further supports the key role of the cAMP signaling pathway in skeletogenesis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acrodysostosis</b> without hormone {{resistance}} {{is a rare}} skeletal disorder characterized by brachydactyly, nasal hypoplasia, mental retardation and occasionally developmental delay. Recently, loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterase- 4 D (PDE 4 D) {{have been reported to}} cause this rare condition but the pathomechanism has not been fully elucidated. To understand the pathogenetic mechanism of PDE 4 D mutations, we conducted 3 D modeling studies to predict changes in the binding efficacy of cAMP to the catalytic pocket in PDE 4 D mutants. Our results indicated diminished enzyme activity in the two mutants we analyzed (Gly 673 Asp and Ile 678 Thr; based on PDE 4 D 4 residue numbering). Ectopic expression of PDE 4 D mutants in HEK 293 cells demonstrated this reduction in activity, which was identified by increased cAMP levels. However, the cells from an <b>acrodysostosis</b> patient showed low cAMP accumulation, which resulted in a decrease in the phosphorylated cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein (pCREB) /CREB ratio. The reason for this discrepancy was due to a compensatory increase in expression levels of PDE 4 A and PDE 4 B isoforms, which accounted for the paradoxical decrease in cAMP levels in the patient cells expressing mutant isoforms with a lowered PDE 4 D activity. Skeletal radiographs of 10 -week-old knockout (KO) rats showed that the distal part of the forelimb was shorter than in wild-type (WT) rats and that all the metacarpals and phalanges were also shorter in KO, as the name <b>acrodysostosis</b> implies. Like the G-protein α-stimulatory subunit and PRKAR 1 A, PDE 4 D critically regulates the cAMP signal transduction pathway and influences bone formation in a way that activity-compromising PDE 4 D mutations can result in skeletal dysplasia. We propose that specific inhibitory PDE 4 D mutations can lead to the molecular pathology of <b>acrodysostosis</b> without hormone resistance but that the pathological phenotype may well be dependent on an over-compensatory induction of other PDE 4 isoforms that can be expected to be targeted to different signaling complexes and exert distinct effects on compartmentalized cAMP signaling...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acrodysostosis</b> {{is a rare}} genetic dysostosis, which {{involves}} a pronounced brachydactyly, short stature, craniofacial anomalies with nasal hypoplasia as well as mental retardation and hormonal alterations. Meanwhile, two genes participating in the cAMP-dependent pathway, PRKAR 1 A and PDE 4 D, were identified {{to be associated with}} this disorder. In the present study four patients with <b>acrodysostosis</b> were screened for mutations in the coding sequence of PDE 4 D. With this analysis a novel, not yet reported missense variant was detected in one patient, which was located in exon 15 at the position c. 2030 A>G. This nucleotide change leads to an amino acid substitution in the catalytic domain of the protein at position 677 (p. Tyr 677 Cys). The results of the in silico analysis as well the investigation of the degree of conservation support the hypothesis that the detected variant should be classified as pathogenic. Moreover, this alteration was verified as de novo by analysis of the parental DNA confirming the aforementioned conclusion. Apart from that, sequencing of PDE 4 D in 26 patients with brachydactyly type E (BDE) detected no mutations. In order to discuss the clinical spectrum of PDE 4 D mutation carriers, the clinical data of two further <b>acrodysostosis</b> patients with confirmed PDE 4 D mutations, diagnosed at the Institute of Medical Genetics and Human Genetics Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, were included in this study. Furthermore, literature regarding cases of <b>acrodysostosis</b> indicates a correlation between genotype and phenotype. Apart from brachydactyly and facial anomalies patients with a PDE 4 D mutation usually show normal growth and PTH as well as TSH levels. However, in the majority of these patients mental and psychomotor retardation are observed. In contrast, patients with PRKAR 1 A mutations are often characterized by short stature and hormonal resistance especially to PTH and TSH while abnormalities in psychomotor development are rare or exist only to a milder degree. This genotype-phenotype correlation could be confirmed in this study of the three patients with PDE 4 D mutations. All of these patients showed normal growth, normal PTH and TSH levels as well as abnormalities of the psychomotor development. In summary, sequencing PDE 4 D is indicated in order to confirm the clinically suspected diagnosis of <b>acrodysostosis</b> on the molecular level. Before initiating molecular diagnostic testing a preliminary estimate on the likely underlying gene, PDE 4 D or PRKAR 1 A, respectively, should be made based on the clinical features of the patient. This could support future promising genetic diagnostics. Meanwhile, PDE 4 D seems to have minor relevance in the pathogenesis of BDE. For this reason further investigations on etiological genes are needed...|$|E

However, this classification disregards other related diseases such as <b>acrodysostosis</b> (ACRDYS) or progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH), as well as recent findings of clinical and genetic/epigenetic background of the different subtypes. Therefore, the EuroPHP network decided to develop a new classification that encompasses all disorders with impairments in PTH and/or PTHrP cAMP-mediated pathway. ăDESIGN AND METHODS: Extensive review of the literature was performed. Several meetings were organised to discuss about a new, more effective and accurate way to describe disorders caused by abnormalities of the PTH/PTHrP signalling pathway. ăRESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: After determining the major and minor criteria to be considered for the diagnosis of these disorders, we proposed to group them under the term 'inactivating PTH/PTHrP signalling disorder' (iPPSD). This terminology: (i) defines the common mechanism responsible for all diseases; (ii) does not require a confirmed genetic defect; (iii) avoids ambiguous terms like 'pseudo' and (iv) eliminates the clinical or molecular overlap between diseases.

40|$|The cyclic {{adenosine}} monophosphate (cAMP) intracellular signaling pathway mediates the physiological effects of several hormones and neurotransmitters, acting by the activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and several downstream intracellular effectors, including the heterotrimeric stimulatory G-protein (Gs), the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), and cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Defective G-protein-mediated signaling {{has been associated with}} an increasing number of disorders, including Albright hereditary osteodistrophy (AHO) and pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP), a heterogeneous group of rare genetic metabolic disorders resulting from molecular defects at the GNAS locus. Moreover, mutations in PRKAR 1 A and PDE 4 D genes have been recently detected in patients with <b>acrodysostosis</b> (ACRDYS), showing a skeletal and endocrinological phenotype partially overlapping with AHO/PHP. Despite the high detection rate of molecular defects by currently available molecular approaches, about 30 % of AHO/PHP patients still lack a molecular diagnosis, hence the need to screen patients negative for GNAS epi/genetic defects also for chromosomal regions and genes associated with diseases that undergo differential diagnosis with PHP. According to the growing knowledge on Gsα-cAMP signaling-linked disorders, we investigated our series of patients (n = 81) with a clinical diagnosis of PHP/AHO but negative for GNAS anomalies for the presence of novel genetic variants at PRKAR 1 A and PDE 4 D genes. Our work allowed the detection of 8 novel missense variants affecting genes so far associated with ACRDYS in 9 patients. Our data further confirm the molecular and clinical overlap among these disorders. We present the data collected from a large series of patients and a brief review of the literature in order to compare our findings with already published data; to look for PRKAR 1 A/PDE 4 D mutation spectrum, recurrent mutations, and mutation hot spots; and to identify specific clinical features associated with ACRDYS that deserve surveillance during follow-up. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|E
