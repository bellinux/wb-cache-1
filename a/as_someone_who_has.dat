5|$|Members of {{the current}} and {{previous}} Worldcon are eligible to nominate new writers for the Campbell Award under the same procedures as the Hugo Awards. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, at which point a shortlist is made of the five most-nominated writers, with additional nominees possible {{in the case of}} ties. Voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held. Writers become eligible once they have a work published anywhere in the world which was sold for more than a nominal amount. While final decisions on eligibility are decided by the WSFS, the given criteria for an author to be eligible are specifically defined <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> had a written work in a publication which had more than 10,000 readers and which paid the writer at least 3 cents per word and a total of at least 50 US dollars.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} eight {{members of}} the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency. It encompasses the entire country; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized minorities in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, the Czech and Slovak minorities jointly elect one MP, and all other minorities elect the final two MPs. Minority MPs are elected by simple plurality system (candidates with the most number of votes are elected). The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry, which {{is provided by the}} registrar's office that maintains Croatia's vital records. Voter nationalities are normally officially declared by the parents at birth, but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar's office at least 14 days ahead of elections (not at the polling station). The voter's nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown. During elections, voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized minorities in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list; a voter of unknown or non-declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list; a voter who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list (the same <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> declared themselves a Croat).|$|E
25|$|Swiss {{nationals}} are {{citizens of}} their municipality of origin, their canton {{of origin and}} the Confederation, in that order: a Swiss citizen is defined <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> the bourgeoisie of a Swiss municipality (article 37 of the Swiss Federal Constitution). They are entered in the family register of their place of origin. One's place of origin depends on how one has acquired Swiss nationality. Nationals who are naturalised take the nationality of the municipality {{in which they were}} naturalised; citizens who became Swiss by virtue of their parents or of their marriage to a Swiss national, take the municipality of their father or spouse. It is {{not to be confused with}} the place of birth, which may be different.|$|E

500|$|According to the Upanishad, {{the entire}} {{universe}} evolves by Sankalpa (a thinking, ideation process), one becomes what one thinks, metaphysics affects physics, and it is ideation that helps retain the appearances of the world. Following renunciation from this universe, which is also called a Sankalpa, the meditating mind is {{to be focused on}} the Nirvikalpa (the unchangeable) or the unchangeable part (metaphysical reality). Varaha in verse 2.64 compares the [...] "samsara" [...] (cycle of rebirth) to the domain of karma, states Billington, one that is like a long dream ("swapna"), a delusion, a sea of sorrow. It defines jivanmukta <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> overcome and attained liberation from this samsara through self-knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|Dave Richards, {{chairman}} of the Premier League stated: [...] "Lucas Radebe has done ample to deserve this accolade and is an example for us all to follow <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> not just worked hard {{for the people of}} Leeds, but has also found the time and energy to help the communities of his homeland." [...] Congratulations and plaudits to Radebe following the Award were also made by FIFA President Sepp Blatter, UEFA chief executive Gerhard Aigner, the UK Minister for Sport Richard Caborn and Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{generally}} recognized boundary of space is the Kármán line 100km above sea level. (NASA alternatively defines an astronaut <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> flown more than [...] above sea level.) It is not {{generally recognized}} by the public {{that the increase in}} potential energy required to pass the Kármán line is only about 3% of the orbital energy (potential plus kinetic energy) required by the lowest possible Earth orbit (a circular orbit just above the Kármán line.) In other words, it is far easier to reach space than to stay there. On May 17, 2004, Civilian Space eXploration Team launched the GoFast Rocket on a suborbital flight, the first amateur spaceflight. On June 21, 2004, SpaceShipOne was used for the first privately funded human spaceflight.|$|E

2500|$|The New Hampshire Rebellion, {{likewise}} co-founded by Lessig, is a walk {{to raise}} awareness about corruption in politics. [...] The event began in 2014 with a 185-mile march in New Hampshire. From Jan 11 until January 24, 2014, Larry Lessig and many others, like New York activist Jeff Kurzon, marched from Dixville Notch, New Hampshire to Nashua NH (a 185-mile march) to promote the idea of tackling [...] "The Systemic Corruption in Washington." [...] Lessig chose this language over the related term [...] "campaign finance reform," [...] commenting that [...] "Saying we need campaign finance reform is like referring to an alcoholic <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a liquid intake problem." [...] The walk was to continue the work of NH Native Doris [...] "Granny D" [...] Haddock, and in honor of deceased activist Aaron Swartz. In its second year the walk expanded to include other locations in New Hampshire.|$|E

2500|$|On March 9, 2011, Milliken {{made two}} {{historic}} rulings finding a prima fascia case of contempt of Parliament {{against the government}} of Stephen Harper, referring the matter to the Procedure Committee. The House subsequently voted to [...] "agree with the finding of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs {{that the government is}} in contempt of Parliament" [...] in supporting a non-confidence vote on March 25, 2011. Prior to the vote, the last House of Commons which Milliken would preside over, the Speaker was praised by MPs from all sides of the House. Conservative Government House Leader John Baird paid homage to Milliken’s career, recalling a meeting he’d had with the Speaker of the British House of Commons. “The Speaker of the Commons there said that he and Speakers from all around the Commonwealth look to you as their leader and their inspiration <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> conducted himself very professionally. For a Canadian to hear that from a British Speaker is a pretty remarkable conclusion and assessment of your role as Speaker." [...] Baird predicted that Milliken would “go down in history as, if not one of the best Speakers, the best Speaker the House of Commons has ever had." ...|$|E

25|$|Polly {{was seen}} by her social circle <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> perverted the trust placed in her as a chaperone, as an older woman <b>who</b> <b>had</b> taken {{advantage}} of a younger man. To the Crosbys, she was dishonored and corrupt. Polly and Harry's scandalous courtship was the gossip of blue-blood Boston.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, Rohmer uses ”cruel moral dilemmas, {{sophisticated}} {{settings and}} the use of language as the main constituent in the drama.” Renko plays Fiodor <b>as</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a triple life between various spy organizations.
