60|$|THE TWEEDED GENTLEMAN [sitting {{down on the}} stool, heavily {{preoccupied with}} his thought] I have {{made up my mind}} at last <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> make it three hundred years.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{smile when}} I think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> hit Martin's camp, pretty hungry and ragged, and got after {{him about his}} sending Davies on our track," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|Thanks {{for your}} condolences <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times.</b> <b>I</b> {{have had it}} both [...] ways, though more, perhaps, of the one than the other. Some of the [...] penny press, which has now {{acquired}} an enormous expansion, go [...] great lengths in my favour, and I read some eulogies quite as wide [...] of fact as the interpretations.|$|R
6000|$|<b>ABOUT</b> <b>the</b> same <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> {{encountered}} {{a man in}} the street, whom I had not seen for six or seven years; and something like this talk followed. I said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So long? How time flies! Well, {{things went}} bad with me <b>about</b> <b>the</b> last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> heard from you. I always {{intended}} to write some day, but I never did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know the}} date. I only know the thing went from here, and just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> speak of. It wasn't delivered, you see. We've got to recover it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{have not}} been very long here," [...] said Amy, [...] "and Bax had ceased to dwell {{regularly}} on the coast <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was saved, and {{came to live with}} Mrs Foster." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A little <b>time</b> after, <b>I</b> {{received}} {{an invitation from}} Mr. Coleridge to pay himself and Mr. Wordsworth another visit. At <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> received <b>the</b> following corroborative invitation from Mr. Wordsworth.|$|R

6000|$|... "But, Aunt Dahlia, {{listen to}} reason. I assure you, you've {{got hold of}} the wrong man. I'm hopeless at a game like that. Ask Jeeves <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> got lugged in to address a girls' school. I made the most colossal ass of myself." ...|$|E

[...] "It IS my wedding day, even though {{there may be something}} sad <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> mean," [...] she added, anxious to correct any wrong impression, [...] "not sad in itself, but in its having had great disappointment and trouble before it." ...|$|E
50|$|Carew {{asked to}} resign, and was {{replaced}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> James <b>I</b> came to the English throne.

40|$|I want to {{take this}} {{opportunity}} to express my appreciation for these two associations meeting together.

60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--There you stick, at Belmont, and now I'm {{going to}} Washington {{for a few}} days; and of course, between you and Providence that visit {{is going to get}} mixed, and you'll have been here and gone again just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> get back. Bother it all, I wanted to astonish you with a chapter or two from Orion's latest book--not the {{seventeen}} which he has begun in the last four months, but the one which he began last week.|$|E
60|$|On {{my arrival}} here I found your letter inquiring {{especially}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{expect to be}} in Copenhagen. My plan {{is to be in}} Sweden by the middle of June, and after visiting that country and Norway, to return by way of Copenhagen. It is not likely that I shall be there before the fifth to the tenth of July, {{and it may be that}} I shall like the northern country so well that my visit to Copenhagen will be postponed even a month longer.|$|E
60|$|Monna Giuliana and I would linger {{together}} in talk after the painter had gone; {{and this would}} be at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> had my first lessons of Curial life from my Lord Gambara. You will remember that he mentioned Boccaccio to me, and I chanced to ask her was there in the library a copy of that author's tales.|$|R

I was at Christchurch with him, and {{we entered}} <b>the</b> world <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> was rather before him. He did everything; and did it well.

50|$|The {{town was}} {{incorporated}} in 1901. The peak population was in about 1915, with 1000 citizens. The town's growth stopped <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> World War <b>I</b> began, and {{has continued to}} decline ever since.|$|R
60|$|I {{observed}} that <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{came to the}} boat-side the fire was pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in {{about half an hour}} after I got on board I heard a volley of our men's fire-arms, and saw a great smoke; this, as I understood afterwards, was our men falling upon the forty men, who, as I said, stood at the few houses on the way; of whom they killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all those houses on fire, but did not meddle with the women or children.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have watched}} the papers carefully. In two years I have {{followed}} several clues. A bricklayer disappeared, but his drowned body was finally found; a college professor was missing, but he was sixty years of age; {{a young man in}} New York embezzled a large sum and hid himself. I followed that trail, although regretfully, but the real embezzler was caught the day I presented myself in his place. Perhaps the most curious experience was {{in the case of a}} young husband who deserted his wife and infant child. She advertised for him; he had disappeared <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> had found myself; so I went to see her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All I know," [...] said Mrs. Makely, [...] "is that I {{like to have}} {{my husband}} belong to his club. It's a nice place for him in summer; and very often in winter, when I'm dull, or going out somewhere that he hates, he can go down to his club and smoke a cigar, and come home just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> get in, and it's much better than {{worrying}} through the evening with a book. He hates books, poor Dick!" [...] She looked fondly at him, {{as if this were}} one of the greatest merits in the world. [...] "But I confess I shouldn't like him to be a mere club man, like some of them." ...|$|E
50|$|At one <b>time,</b> Richard owned <b>the</b> Elworth Estate located {{partly in}} Bradwall, which he passed {{to his son}} Thomas de Helleworth, in <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of Edward <b>I</b> (1239-1307). The family coat of arms is not certain.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can mind her mother," [...] {{said the}} hollow-turner. [...] "Always a teuny, {{delicate}} piece; her touch upon your hand was as soft and cool as wind. She was inoculated for the small-pox {{and had it}} beautifully fine, just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> {{was out of my}} apprenticeship--ay, and a long apprenticeship 'twas. I served that master of mine six years and three hundred and fourteen days." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, it chanced that, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{of which}} <b>I</b> write, a noted bank failed, and a {{considerable}} {{sum of money}} which had been temporarily deposited in it by the committee of the Sailors' Home at Wreckumoft was lost.|$|R
6000|$|... "I 'd {{saved up}} a couple of dollars, and I kept {{traveling}} back, deeper and deeper into the country, looking for work, and buying bread and cheese and such things from the storekeepers. I tell you, it was cold, nights, sleeping out without blankets, and I was always glad when morning came. But worse than that was the way everybody looked on me. They were all suspicious, and not a bit afraid to show it, and sometimes they 'd set their dogs on me and tell me to get along. Seemed as though there was n't any place for me on the land. Then my money gave out, and just <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was good and hungry I got captured." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> joined, the Dacoits were unusually troublesome; {{the police}} {{had a hard time}} of it, and almost lived in the saddle, and the cavalry were {{constantly}} called up to help them, while detachments of infantry from the station were under canvas at several places {{along the top of the}} Ghauts to cut the bands off from their strongholds, and to aid, if necessary, in turning them out of their rock fortresses. The natives in the valleys at the foot of the Ghauts, who have always been a semi-independent race, ready to rob whenever they saw a chance, were great friends with the Dacoits and supplied them with provisions whenever the hunt on the Deccan was too hot to make raids in that direction.|$|E
60|$|<b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> {{received}} {{the news of}} this attack, word came from Hancock that Early had left his front. He had been forced over to the Catharpin Road, crossing the Po at Corbin's and again at Wooden Bridge. These are the bridges Sheridan had given orders to his cavalry to occupy on the 8th, while one division should occupy Spottsylvania. These movements of the enemy gave me the idea that Lee {{was about to make}} the attempt to get to, or towards, Fredericksburg to cut off my supplies. I made arrangements to attack his right and get between him and Richmond if he should try to execute this design. If he had any such intention it was abandoned as soon as Burnside was established south of the Ny.|$|E

You feel like ringing people up and saying, 'Are you watching this?!'" ...|$|R

6000|$|Now, here's {{something}} else I remember. It's <b>about</b> <b>the</b> first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever stole a watermelon. [...] "Stole" [...] {{is a strong}} word. Stole? Stole? No, I don't mean that. It was <b>the</b> first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever withdrew a watermelon. It was <b>the</b> first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever extracted a watermelon. That is exactly the word I want--"extracted." [...] It is definite. It is precise. It perfectly conveys my idea. Its use in dentistry connotes the delicate shade of meaning I am looking for. You know we never extract our own teeth.|$|R
