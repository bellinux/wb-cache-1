25|$|Despite {{spawning}} in estuaries, <b>Australian</b> <b>bass</b> rely on floods {{coming down}} river systems into the estuaries throughout the winter period, both to stimulate migration and spawning in adult <b>Australian</b> <b>bass</b> and for strong survival and recruitment of <b>Australian</b> <b>bass</b> larvae.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>Australian</b> <b>bass</b> are fierce {{predators and}} any small {{creature}} that swims across a bass pool such as (introduced) mice and native lizards or frogs {{are at risk}} of being taken by a large <b>Australian</b> <b>bass,</b> and are regularly taken.|$|E

25|$|<b>Australian</b> <b>bass</b> are {{not found}} in the Murray-Darling system because {{although}} the system is extensive, it has only one variable entrance to the Southern Ocean, a feature that appears to be incompatible with the estuarine breeding habits of <b>Australian</b> <b>bass</b> and other aspects of their life cycle.|$|E
25|$|Responsible {{fishermen}} now avoid {{fishing for}} wild <b>Australian</b> <b>bass</b> in estuaries in winter, {{so that this}} increasingly pressured native fish can spawn in peace.
