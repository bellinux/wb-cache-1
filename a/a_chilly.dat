5|$|Missouri {{had a large}} Union {{presence}} {{throughout the}} Civil War, but also many civilians whose sympathies lay with the Confederacy. From July 1861 {{until the end of}} the war, the state suffered up to 25,000 deaths from guerrilla warfare, more than any other state. Confederate General Sterling Price failed to gain control of Missouri in his 1861 offensive and retreated into Arkansas, leaving only the guerrillas to challenge Union dominance. Quantrill was at the time the most prominent guerrilla in the Kansas–Missouri area. In early 1863, William and Jim Anderson traveled to Jackson County, Missouri, to join him. William Anderson was initially given <b>a</b> <b>chilly</b> reception from other raiders, who perceived him to be brash and overconfident.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{had planned}} to provide China with an atomic bomb {{complete}} with full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead. When Khrushchev {{paid a visit to}} China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met <b>a</b> <b>chilly</b> reception, and Khrushchev left the country on the third day of a planned seven-day visit. Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. After Khrushchev attacked China in his speech to the congress, Chinese leader Peng Zhen mocked Khrushchev, stating that the premier's foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the West. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.|$|E

25|$|The Golden Gophers {{would start}} {{the game with}} the ball on <b>a</b> <b>chilly</b> {{afternoon}} in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The stout Badgers defense would get right to work forcing a three–and–out. Wisconsin's first offensive play was a 49-yard run by RB James White down to the Minnesota 12-yard line. The Gopher defense would hold up and force Wisconsin to kick a 31-yard field goal by K Jack Russell. Minnesota would then punt again after only three offensive plays. Wisconsin moved the ball to about midfield but were forced to punt. The Golden Gophers took over at their own 4-yard line {{and picked up a}} couple of first downs but once again had to punt. The Badgers then had their own three–and–out and punting the ball back to the Gophers who took over right aroung midfield as the first quarter came to a close. On the first play of the second quarter, Minnesota QB Philip Nelson threw a 9-yard pass to WR Maxx Williams but the ball the stripped by Badgers S Nate Hammon and recovered by LB Derek Landisch at the Badgers 32-yard line. Three plays later, Wisconsin QB Joel Stave threw and interception to Gophers CB Aaron Hill who returned it 39 yards for a touchdown. Wisconsin would move the ball into Minnesota territory but were forced to punt it back to Minnesota. The Golden Gophers were putting together a nice drive but on third down and 11 from the Wisconsin 36-yard line, LB Brendan Kelly hit the Gophers QB Nelson and forced a fumble that was recovered by Badgers LB Chris Borland. Five plays later, Wisconsin was in the end zone with a 1-yard touchdown run by James White. The Badgers defense moved the Gophers offense back and forced a three–and–out. The Badgers then used a 12 play drive and got down to the Minnesota 2-yard line but were forced to kick a 20-yard field goal by Jack Russell. The Gophers would take a knee to close out the half, Wisconsin led 13–7.|$|E

Mark Loizeaux of Controlled Demolition, Inc. pushed the button that set off the 19-second implosion, while Elizabeth and Joseph King pushed the [...] "ceremonial old fashioned dynamite plunger". The demolition cost $5.1million and used 4,800pounds of explosive. With the newly constructed Heinz Field only 80feet away, effects from the blast were a concern.

Several of the children and staff were also ill, and Zita (at the time eight months pregnant) helped nurse them all. Charles weakened and died on 1 April, his last words to his wife being [...] "I love you so much." [...] After his funeral, a witness said of Zita [...] "This woman really is to be admired. She did not, for one second, lose her composure... she greeted the people on all sides and then spoke to those who had helped out with the funeral. They were all under her charm."

500|$|Colbert {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>chilly</b> {{response from}} the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, apart from the enthusiastic laughter of a few in the audience. The major media outlets {{paid little attention to}} it initially. Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin and Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism professor Todd Gitlin claimed that this was because Colbert's routine was as critical of the media as it was of Bush. Richard Cohen, also writing for The Washington Post, responded that the routine was not funny. The video of Colbert's performance became an internet and media sensation, while, in the week following the speech, ratings for The Colbert Report rose by 37% to average just under 1.5million total viewers per episode. In Time magazine James Poniewozik called it [...] "the political-cultural touchstone issue of 2006". Writing six months later, New York Times columnist Frank Rich referred to Colbert's speech as a [...] "cultural primary" [...] and called it the [...] "defining moment" [...] of the 2006 midterm elections.|$|E
500|$|Lewis's {{version of}} [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] {{garnered}} mostly negative reviews from music critics. Nick Levine for Digital Spy complimented her version, writing {{that it is}} [...] "as satisfying as a sponge pudding on <b>a</b> <b>chilly</b> winter evening". Michael Cragg for musicOMH wrote that [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] is another song {{to be given the}} [...] "Leona treatment", and compared it to her cover of Snow Patrol's [...] "Run", which she recorded for her inclusion on her debut studio album, Spirit. He felt that her cover of Oasis's song appeared to serve as a [...] "replacement" [...] for covering Snow Patrol. He continued to criticise the production and vocal performance of Lewis's version, writing [...] "On this occasion the kitchen-sink style production – stirring strings, acoustic strums, and inevitable appearance of a choir – feels hollow, like being aurally attacked by a (admittedly very impressive) karaoke singer". As part of his review of Echo, Matthew Cole for Slant Magazine wrote that too much of the album is dominated by [...] "thoughtless" [...] ballads, which he highlighted in the form of [...] "Don't Let Me Down" [...] and [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out". While he noted that Lewis gives a [...] "technically unimpeachable" [...] vocal performance, he wrote that it does not compensate for the [...] "dull arrangement" [...] and lack of emotion in her delivery. Andy Gill for The Independent described her cover as [...] "sententious". Neil McCormick for The Telegraph was critical of her decision to cover the song, writing that she is too emotive for the [...] "direct and simple" [...] lyrics, and concluded by saying that her version does not compare to Gallagher's [...] "raw-thorated sincerity".|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 1886, {{a meeting}} {{was held at}} the home of P.N. Clausen at which the Danebod {{congregation}} was formally organized with fifteen members. The church council consisted of its president, P.N. Clausen, secretary M.Lauritsen, and treasurer Jørgen Jacobsen. At first there were no regular church services and no resident pastor. Instead, the people met in various homes to sing Danish hymns and listen to a reading of the sermon by a layman. The pastor of Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, S.C. Madsen, and other ministers occasionally conducted services in town. The congregation later hired the Danish settler, pastor Hans Jørgen Pedersen (1851–1905) of Gowen, Michigan. He arrived with his family on April12, 1888. Pedersen had a humble upbringing in Denmark, where he later studied at Ryslinge Folk High School before emigrating to America in 1875. He was an eloquent preacher, resourceful, and became involved in community activities throughout the area. He quickly assumed leadership and thus, in a sense, became the founder of Danebod. One of the pastor's six children, Sigurd Pedersen, described their first arrival in Danebod in his autobiography: [...] "It was <b>a</b> <b>chilly</b> morning, when the committee stood on the platform to bid welcome to the new pastor and his wife, trailed by six children, and the rear held up by the trusty hired man, Søren Olsen, who was to keep count of the straying flock and see that the last luggage was not forgotten. Friends invited us over for breakfast in the home of H.J. Nelsen, the merchant. Then the committee guided us to a small house on the corner just west of the present-day Chevrolet dealer, where businessman Carl Cold Sorensen brought the first automobiles to the area in the early 1900's. The committee had left no kindling in this small house, but Søren Olsen soon discovered that the kitchen range was in place and claimed to be able to manipulate the same if kindling could be provided. Across the street was a large general store, and father sent us there to beg Mr.Lauritsen for some kindling. We were given old boxes to break up, and we soon had our arms full and Søren had a blazing fire in a few minutes." [...] In September 1888, it was decided at a convention in Elk Horn, Iowa, to give the congregation at Danebod [...] of land, and the Danebod Lutheran Church was dedicated on Sunday, June16, 1895. Pedersen died in 1905, and the Reverend Thorvald Knudsen succeeded him at Danebod.|$|E

2500|$|Shafer was {{defeated}} for re-election as PEF president by James Sheedy in June 1994.

The margin of victory was 388 votes, the slimmest margin in the union's 15-year history. [...] Sheedy's entire slate also narrowly edged out the Shafer slate's candidates.|$|E
2500|$|The entire LP was recorded, {{mixed and}} {{mastered}} within a month, {{and the band}} were thrilled with the results.

To promote it, they used Australian film-maker Timothy Fisher to make a music video. The simple but effective clip was filmed on <b>a</b> <b>chilly</b> autumn morning on Hampstead Heath. Black-and-white prints were shown many times on Australian TV, where colour was not introduced until 1975, but it was shot in colour, as were several other clips for tracks from the LP, most were not screened.|$|E
2500|$|Confirmed {{as the new}} leader, Sadoul was {{seconded}} by Henri Guilbeaux, who nevertheless resented his [...] "Bonapartism" [...] {{and complained}} that it was splitting the Communist Group. Serge recalls that the Group's was [...] "completely demoralized" [...] by the Guilbeaux–Sadoul conflict. He contrasts the two as irreconcilable characters: Guilbeaux was a [...] "failure", while Sadoul embodied [...] "a great charmer, a splendid raconteur, a sybarite, and a cool careerist to boot." [...] Later that year, his Thomas diaries were published by Éditions de la Sirène of Paris, as Notes sur la révolution bolchévique ("Notes on the Bolshevik Revolution")—with prefaces by Thomas and Henri Barbusse. The publication was advised by Lenin himself, after copies of the letters had been seized from Sadoul during a random house-search. Nevertheless, as a record of Russian life under communism, the Notes received <b>a</b> <b>chilly</b> response in both France and Switzerland.|$|E
