50|$|Varying {{the amount}} of current through the {{stationary}} exciter field coils varies the 3-phase output from the exciter. This output is rectified by a rotating rectifier assembly, mounted on the rotor, and the resultant DC supplies the rotating field of the main alternator and hence <b>alternator</b> <b>output.</b> The result {{of all this is}} that a small DC exciter current indirectly controls the output of the main alternator.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new design of automotive alternator which allows the DC output voltage to rise to 32 V which is more suited to efficient supply of heater loads. This utilises more of the <b>alternators</b> <b>output</b> capability while retaining the traditional 12 V standard for the many other loads not suitable for higher voltage operation. Such an alternator was designed to generate and regulate two independent DC voltages within a single housing without compromising the existing 12 V system...|$|R
50|$|The {{trembler}} coil operates {{equally well}} from AC or DC electricity. In the Model T, a battery {{was used for}} starting, but once the engine started the supply was switched to the engine's own generator. The Model T was unusual in being fitted with an AC alternator (a permanent magnet magneto) rather than a DC dynamo. In these early days, this was not rectified and so the <b>alternator's</b> <b>output</b> remained as AC. This was entirely adequate to operate the ignition system, and after 1915 to power electric headlights, although {{it could not be}} used for battery charging.|$|R

If the outside temperature fell to , the temperature display is automatically selected to warn of possible [...] "black ice" [...] road conditions. A separate pictogram monitored door and hatch opening and exterior light bulb condition. 1988 als marked the introduction of pyrotechnic seat belt tensioners for the front seats.|$|E
50|$|Shipboard {{installations}} usually used a DC motor (usually {{run off the}} ship's DC lighting supply) {{to drive}} an alternator whose AC output was then stepped up to 10,000-14,000 volts by a transformer. This was a very convenient arrangement, since the signal could be easily modulated by simply connecting a relay between the relatively low voltage <b>alternator</b> <b>output</b> and the transformer's primary winding, and activating it with the morse key. (Lower-powered units sometimes used the morse key to directly switch the AC, but this required a heavier key {{making it more difficult}} to operate).|$|E
5000|$|The output {{frequency}} of the transmitter {{is proportional to the}} speed of the rotor. To keep the frequency constant, the speed of the electric motor turning it was controlled with a feedback loop. In one method, a sample of the output signal is applied to a high-Q tuned circuit, whose resonant frequency is slightly above the {{output frequency}}. The generator's frequency falls on the [...] "skirt" [...] of the LC circuit's impedance curve, where the impedance increases rapidly with frequency. The output of the LC circuit is rectified, and the resulting voltage is compared with a constant reference voltage to produce a feedback signal to control the motor speed. If the output frequency gets too high, the impedance presented by the LC circuit increases, and the amplitude of the RF signal getting through the LC circuit drops. The feedback signal to the motor drops, and the motor slows down. Thus the <b>alternator</b> <b>output</b> frequency is [...] "locked" [...] to the tuned circuit resonant frequency.|$|E

50|$|Older {{automobiles}} {{with minimal}} lighting {{may have had}} an alternator capable of producing only 30 A. Typical passenger car and light truck alternators are rated around 50-70 A, though higher ratings are becoming more common, especially as there is more load on the vehicle's electrical system with air conditioning, electric power steering and other electrical systems. Very large alternators used on buses, heavy equipment or emergency vehicles may produce 300 A. Semi-trucks usually have <b>alternators</b> which <b>output</b> 140 A. Very large alternators may be water-cooled or oil-cooled.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} our work, which is doing an energy audit on <b>{{alternator}}’s</b> current <b>output</b> and battery’s voltage based on alternator speed. Up until today, {{the demand for}} power in automobile is ever increasing. As technology advances, more and more electrical devices were produced and being installed in vehicles. To cope with the demand, alternator has been designed and modified {{so that it can}} produce enough power. This research is to study the effect of alternator speed to the charging system. The car used in this experiment is Proton Preve 1. 6 Manual. In both ISO 8854 and SAE J 56, alternator testing and labelling standards indicate that the rated <b>output</b> an <b>alternator</b> is the amount of current that it is capable of producing at 6, 000 RPM. Three different constant speed of engine which is 750 RPM as idle speed, 1500 RPM and 3000 RPM as cruise speed were taken as parameter. The speed of the alternator was measured using tachometer, digital multi-meter was used to measure battery’s voltage, and AC/DC Clamp was used to measure <b>alternator</b> current <b>output.</b> The result shows that the faster the alternator spin, the more power it can produce.

5000|$|Rarely, {{more extreme}} cases of voltage {{fluctuation}} can {{occur when the}} car battery is disconnected while the engine is running, or when the car receives a jump start. When the battery is disconnected while the engine is running, a load dump transient can produce very high voltages as the built in voltage regulator has been controlling the alternator field current to charge the vehicle battery and although it will attempt to reduce the field current to keep the output voltage constant, the field winding is highly inductive and setting the current to its new value takes several hundred milliseconds, during which the <b>alternator</b> <b>output</b> voltage will exceed its intended value. The load dump transient may also ruin the diodes in the alternator by exceeding their breakdown voltage. A car receiving a jump start from a truck {{may be subject to}} a 24 V electrical system used in some vehicles. Also, a [...] "double battery jump-start" [...] is performed by some tow truck drivers in cold climates.|$|E

40|$|The Brayton {{rotating}} unit (BRU), {{consisting of}} a turbine, an alternator, and a compressor, was tested {{as part of a}} Brayton cycle power conversion system over a side range of steady state operating conditions.

Turbine inlet temperature was varied from 1200 to 1600 F, compressor inlet temperature from 60 to 120 F, compressor discharge pressure from 20 to 45 psia, rotative speed from 32 400 to 39 600 rpm, and alternator liquid-coolant flow rate from 0. 01 to 0. 27 pound per second. Test results indicated that the BRU internal temperatures were highly sensitive to alternator coolant flow below the design value of 0. 12 pound per second but much less so at higher values. The armature winding temperature was not influenced significantly by turbine inlet temperature, but was sensitive, up to 20 F per kVA <b>alternator</b> <b>output,</b> to varying <b>alternator</b> <b>output.</b> When only the rotational speed was changed (+ or - 10 % of rated value), the BRU internal temperatures varied directly with the speed...|$|E

5000|$|In older vehicles, the {{tachometer}} {{is driven}} by the RMS voltage waves from the low tension (LT) side of the ignition coil, while on others (and nearly all diesel engines, which have no ignition system) engine speed is determined by the frequency from the <b>alternator</b> tachometer <b>output.</b> This is from a special connection called an [...] "AC tap" [...] which is a connection to one of the stator's coil output, before the rectifier. Tachometers driven by a rotating cable from a drive unit fitted to the engine (usually on the camshaft) exist - usually on simple diesel-engined machinery with basic or no electrical systems. On recent EMS found on modern vehicles, the signal for the tachometer is usually generated from an ECU which derives the information from either the crankshaft or camshaft speed sensor.|$|R

Therefore automotive alternator performance becomes increasingly important {{to meet the}} requirements. Many proposed methods have suggested adding magnets or regulation control to increase alternator efficiency and output. However, this creates a significant additional cost. During the stator lamination process, the magnetic property of the stator deteriorates mainly due to stamping and slinky process for an alternator. To maximize the alternator performance, heat treatment of the stator core was performed and magnetic properties were compared to find the optimal condition.

40|$|The free-piston engine (FPE) {{was being}} used on {{stationary}} power plants and automobile test back in 1950 ’s. The advantages of the FPE are obtained mainly from the freely moving piston, with which a variable compression ratio can be easily achieved. This gives the possibility of high compression ratio with high efficiency and the flexibility of burning different fuels. With many alternative fuels, such as biofuels under development to replace the traditional gasoline or diesel fuel, {{the potential of the}} FPE is again becoming valuable. The primary goal of the present research is to develop a numerical model of the FPE {{that can be used to}} understand the conceptual design and operation. Until now, a model for the FPE was not available, so a model is built in Matlab/Simulink with many user-defined functions and algorithms. The second goal was to integrate the FPE with a linear alternator. Historically, the FPE extracted power solely through a power turbine. Many research groups have used the linear alternator with the FPE and have claimed high efficiency. This study focused on using both power extraction devices together, namely turbine-compound free-piston linear alternator (TCFPLA) engine. It is believed that the linear alternator as the secondary power output has the potential to increase the efficiency when combined with the turbine. The most special characteristic of the TCFPLA engine is its energy-recovering configuration. With the air box fully surrounding the combustion chamber, it absorbs most of the heat from the combustion chamber. This heat recovery process was proven in the study to be a great advantage on efficiency. Two important control parameters were defined, namely the bounce chamber mass and the injection position. These two parameters have to change with load for the best performance output. A 2 D engine map is generated for various linear <b>alternator</b> <b>output</b> at each given fueling rate. The brake efficiency reached 50 % at the mid to high load conditions with high <b>alternator</b> <b>output.</b> This makes the TCFPLA engine very competitive with the diesel engine...|$|E

40|$|The power {{requirements}} of automotive alternators are increasing significantly {{due to the}} introduction of new vehicle electrical loads. Moreover, the possible transition to a 42 V electrical system is introducing new concerns regarding the load dump overvoltage transient of alternators. This thesis makes several contributions to the power density, efficiency, and transient performance of future alternators. A comparison and design optimization of four alternator types is conducted to identify the least cost alternator that meets the challenging requirements of future automobiles. Alternator designs with conventional diode rectifiers and switched-mode rectifiers are investigated. It is found that optimized Lundell alternators are capable of meeting the demands of future systems, and that wound field synchronous machines may also be competitive. It is also found that incorporation of a simple switched-mode rectifier enables substantial improvements in designs optimized for their use. The behavior of the Lundell alternator under load dump transient conditions is studied. It is found that rotor eddy currents limit {{the rate at which the}} machine can be de-excited to terminate the transient overvoltage. Models for the de-excitation process are developed based on experimental measurements, and new field control circuits are proposed that provide fast field de-excitation. (cont.) The use of foil field windings in Lundell alternators to improve alternator power density is also explored. Foil field windings are shown to provide higher conductor packing factors than conventional wire wound fields (e. g. 73 % as opposed to 64 % for a typical wire wound design) and offer improved thermal transfer properties. These advantages are demonstrated to enable significant increases in field ampere turns and achievable <b>alternator</b> <b>output</b> power. However, realizing these advantages requires new field excitation circuits that can deliver high field currents at low voltages, without exceeding the limited current ratings of alternator brushes. Two new field excitation circuits capable of meeting the needs of foil field windings are developed and experimentally demonstrated. The first field excitation circuit is based on the use of a coreless printed circuit board transformer with a rotating secondary for contactless transfer of power to the rotor. A stationary inverter delivers high frequency ac to the transformer primary, and the power received by the transformer secondary is rectified and delivered to the field. This approach eliminates the need for brushes, and their associated wear and current limitations. (cont.) This rotating transformer topology is designed, built and tested at standstill with a foil wound bobbin. Experimental results demonstrate that a 51 % increase in ampere turns on the rotor can be delivered with this approach, which is more than sufficient for practical applications. The second class of field excitation circuits developed in this thesis uses a DC/DC converter on the rotating side to provide a step down in voltage and a step up in current for the foil field. Control information is communicated to the rotating converter to regulate the field. An experimental alternator implementing a foil field winding and this excitation circuit is developed and experimentally validated. Tests at idle speed demonstrate an improvement of 15 % in <b>alternator</b> <b>output</b> power, and an approximate increase of 30 % in field ampere turns for similar temperature limits. It is anticipated that significantly larger power improvements could be achieved if the alternator stator were redesigned to take advantage of this improved field capability. by Leandro Manalac Lorilla.
