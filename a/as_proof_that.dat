5|$|According to U.S. authorities, {{a single}} soldier – Staff Sergeant Robert Bales – {{conducted}} the attack. The U.S. military showed Afghan authorities the footage from the surveillance video {{at the base}} <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> {{there was only one}} perpetrator of the shootings.|$|E
5|$|Besides Gešovski, {{there were}} no fatalities, but several JNA {{soldiers}} were wounded. Gešovski's death sparked demonstrations in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, in June. Protesters accused Tuđman of being responsible for the murder. The Croatian Government refused to express regret for Gešovski's killing, and the Serbian media pointed to the young Macedonian's death <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> Tuđman's government had revived the fascist Ustaše, which controlled Croatia during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E

50|$|Rape {{has been}} defined so <b>as</b> to require <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> the sexual act in {{question}} was done without the victim's consent, or so <b>as</b> to require <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> it was done either without their consent or, alternatively, against their will.|$|R

5|$|Only in {{exceptional}} circumstances would {{there have been no}} dowry, since the lack of one could have been interpreted <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> no legitimate marriage occurred. A dowry may have been occasionally overlooked if a bride's family connections were very favorable; Callias reportedly married Elpinice, a daughter of the noble Philaidae, to join that family and was sufficiently wealthy that her lack of a dowry did not concern him.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{more recent}} {{theories}} now hold that, if the Egyptian kingdom was divided, the division happened peacefully. Egyptologists such as Michael Rice, Francesco Tiradritti and Wolfgang Helck {{point to the}} once palatial and well preserved mastaba tombs at Sakkara and Abydos belonging to high officials such as Ruaben and Nefer-Setekh. These are all dated from the reign of Nynetjer to that of Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second dynasty. Egyptologists consider the archaeological record of the mastabas' condition and the original architecture <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> the statewide mortuary cults for kings and noblemen successfully {{took place during the}} entire dynasty. If true, their preservation is inconsistent with the theory of civil wars and economic problems during Peribsen's reign. Rice, Tiradritti and Helck think that Nynetjer decided to leave a divided realm because of private or political reasons and that the split was a formality sustained by Second Dynasty kings.|$|E
5|$|Norman pioneered {{a form of}} past-life therapy, {{teaching}} her disciples how to recall details of experiences from their past incarnations. These recollections contributed to the group's mythology, which developed over time with student input. Unarius' members occasionally recalled crimes that they had committed in past lives, including times they harmed incarnations of Ruth Norman. The students sometimes acted out and filmed scenes from their previous incarnations, an experience that participants found therapeutic; they cited this benefit <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> the events were real. Norman's therapy, according to R. George Kirkpatrick of San Diego State University and Tumminia, differed from most New Age past-life therapies {{in the way that}} it wove her followers into the group's narrative.|$|E
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to give in this series all {{the lives of the}} early hermits--even of those contained in Rosweyde. This volume will contain, therefore, only the most important and most famous lives of the Egyptian, Syrian, and Persian hermits, followed, perhaps, by a few later biographies from Western Europe, <b>as</b> <b>proofs</b> <b>that</b> the hermit-type, <b>as</b> it spread toward the Atlantic, remained still the same as in the Egyptian desert.|$|R

5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to ideological and political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A cover letter attached to Maggi's statement described it <b>as</b> <b>proof</b> <b>that</b> Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe study posets {{defined by}} Stanley as a multiset {{generalization}} of Greene's posets of shuffles. Ehrenborg defined a quasi-symmetric function encoding for the flag f-vector, denoted FP, and we determine FP for shuffle posets of multisets, expressing it as a Schur-positive symmetric function. This leads to several combinatorial formulas <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>proofs</b> <b>that</b> shuffle posets of multisets are supersolvable and have symmetric chain decompositions. We also generalize posets of shuffles to posets for shuffling k words, answering {{a question of}} Stanley. Finally, we extend our results about shuffle posets of multisets to k-shuffle posets...|$|R
