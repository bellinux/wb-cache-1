5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war in August 1914, Bruix was assigned to protect troop convoys from French North Africa to France before she was transferred to the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> support Allied operations against the German colony of Kamerun in September. She was briefly assigned to support Allied operations in the Dardanelles in early 1915 before she began patrolling the Aegean Sea and Greek territorial waters.|$|E
5|$|Falke {{departed}} Montevideo {{and crossed}} the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> Dakar, proceeding to Las Palmas and then Lisbon. There she was visited by Frederick Augustus III of Saxony. She arrived in Danzig on 15 April, after {{five and a half}} years abroad. The ship was decommissioned on 20 January, and an evaluation determined that she was not worth overhauling. She was accordingly stricken from the naval register on 25 October 1912 and broken up the following year at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig.|$|E
5|$|Fredericton served {{during the}} Battle of the Atlantic from 1941 to 1945. During 1942 she escorted oil tankers from the Caribbean to New York City. From 1943 to 1945 she escorted convoys in the Western Atlantic {{and then later}} on across the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> Northern Ireland. She was {{decommissioned}} on 14 July 1945. Some question as to her final disposition lies with a possible error in Lloyd's Register. Either she was sold for scrap in 1946 or ended up as a Panamanian-flagged Japanese whaler which was used until 1979.|$|E

5|$|From early 1942 Tirpitz posed a {{significant}} {{threat to the}} Allied convoys transporting supplies through the Norwegian Sea to the Soviet Union. Operating from fjords on the Norwegian coast, the battleship was capable of overwhelming the close-escort forces assigned to the Arctic convoys or breaking out into the North <b>Atlantic.</b> <b>To</b> counter this threat, the Allies were forced to keep a powerful force of warships with the British Home Fleet, and capital ships accompanied most convoys {{part of the way}} to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|HMS Monmouth was {{the lead}} ship of her class of 10 {{armoured}} cruisers built for the Royal Navy {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century. She was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet upon completion in 1903. She was transferred to the China Station in 1906, and remained there until she returned home in 1913 and was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet. When World War I began in August 1914, the ship was recommissioned and assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron in the Central <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> search for German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping. She was detached upon arrival to patrol the Brazilian coast for German ships, and was later ordered to the South <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> join Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock's squadron in their search for the German East Asia Squadron. He found the German squadron on 1 November off the coast of Chile. The German squadron outnumbered Cradock's force and were individually more powerful; they sank Cradock's two armoured cruisers in the Battle of Coronel. Monmouth was lost with all hands.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan's {{path through}} the {{southern}} Caribbean in late October was highly unusual. Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took the southernmost path of a tropical cyclone since a June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of Joan's. Joan-Miriam was also unusual in that it survived passage from the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> Pacific Ocean. Only seven other storms {{have been known to}} survive the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.|$|E

It is now a state in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Irene–Olivia {{is unusual}} in that it survived passage from the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> Pacific Ocean. Only nine other named storms {{are known to have}} done so. Irene was the first of three Atlantic-to-Pacific {{crossover}} tropical cyclones in the 1970s, all three of which took eastern Pacific names starting with the letter O.|$|E
5|$|Nevada then {{departed}} for Norfolk Navy Yard in June for further modernization. After this was completed, Nevada went on Atlantic convoy duty. Old battleships such as Nevada {{were attached to}} many convoys across the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> guard against the chance that a German capital ship might head out to sea on a raiding mission.|$|E
50|$|In late November 1979, a {{professional}} blackjack player contacted {{one of the}} card-counting students, J.P. Massar, after seeing a notice for the blackjack course.

Instead, casinos would have to ban players individually.|$|R

5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to {{divide and conquer}} his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} might be of use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party {{would be far more}} effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E
5|$|While he was {{the owner}} of Cable Atlantic Williams {{purchased}} the naming rights to a sports complex in St. John's for $600,000 from Molson. Before the centre opened, however, Williams had sold Cable <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> Rogers Communications to pursue his political career, but retained the naming rights. Ultimately he chose to name the centre Mile One Centre, based on the venue's location {{at the beginning of the}} Trans Canada Highway.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, Soviet troops {{occupied}} the easternmost part of Denmark, and the Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing Olga and a Danish Catholic bishop of conspiracy against the Soviet government.

5|$|Admiral Graf Spee {{spent the}} first three months of her career {{conducting}} extensive sea trials to ready the ship for service. The ship's first commander was Kapitän zur See (KzS) Conrad Patzig; he was replaced in 1937 by KzS Walter Warzecha. After joining the fleet, Admiral Graf Spee became the flagship of the German Navy. In the summer of 1936, following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she deployed to the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> participate in non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain. Between August 1936 and May 1937, the ship conducted three patrols off Spain. On the return voyage from Spain, Admiral Graf Spee stopped in Great Britain to represent Germany in the Coronation Review at Spithead for King George VI on 20 May.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities in the United States, Seeadler steamed back across the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> the Azores, before proceeding into the Mediterranean Sea and then into the Red Sea. There, she met Schwalbe at Aden on 20 June. Seeadler proceeded to Bombay, India, for routine maintenance that lasted from 3 July to 21 August. The cruiser finally arrived on station on 2 September when she dropped anchor in Zanzibar and met the survey ship , the other vessel on the East Africa Station. On 9 September both ships went to Kilwa; a group of slave traders had attacked the small police force detachment stationed there. The colonial army, the Schutztruppe (protection force), was unavailable to reinforce the police troops, and so Seeadler and Möwe bombarded the slavers and neutralized the threat.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the review, Rhode Island steamed to New York for an overhaul at the New York Navy Yard. During the overhaul, on 8 March, the ship was assigned to the 3rd Division, 1st Squadron. After emerging from the dry dock, she resumed her normal peacetime routine of maneuvers {{with the rest of the}} squadron, gunnery practice, and training cruises. In February 1910 she was sent on a cruise in the Caribbean. The ship was reassigned to the 4th Division, 1st Squadron on 20 October, and two weeks later she and the rest of the squadron held a naval review in Boston for President William Howard Taft on 2 November. The ships then crossed the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>to</b> visit European ports; Rhode Island went to Gravesend. During the cruise, the fleet conducted large scale battle and reconnaissance training. Rhode Island and the rest of the ships recrossed the Atlantic and stopped in Guantanamo Bay on 13 January 1911.|$|E
