Explaining his wardrobe process, he said: [...] "I never had to try stuff on. I'm not used to wardrobe fittings. I had to try on about 20 different outfits! That was really grueling. It was important to shake the leather coat and black t-shirt <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> hair different, because I know people {{are always going to}} see me as Jason." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{claiming}} [...] "we all {{helped put}} the album together", Q-Tip {{was the only}} Tribe Called Quest member present at every recording session. Group member Phife Dawg later admitted [...] "I was being ignorant on that first album, that’s why I was only {{on a couple of}} tracks. I was hardly around. I would have rather hung out with my boys on the street and got my hustle on rather than gone in the studio. I wasn’t even on the contract for the first album. I was thinking me and Jarobi were more like back-ups for Tip and Ali, but Tip and Ali really wanted me to come through <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> thing".|$|E

2500|$|Lawrence's {{second husband}} Richard Aldrich became a {{lieutenant}} in the United States Navy during World War II, during which time Lawrence had a standing invitation to perform for British troops {{from the head of}} the UK's Entertainments National Service Association. Her chief obstacle was getting from her home in Massachusetts to Britain. Aldrich was overseas at the time. In her 1945 memoir A Star Danced, she recalled, [...] "After weeks of more or less patient waiting, repeated timid, pleading, urgent and finally importunate requests to the authorities who rule such matters in Washington and London, and a rapid-fire barrage of telegrams, cables and telephone calls, it had happened. At last I had permission to do what I had been wanting desperately to do for four years—go to England <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> bit on a tour for E.N.S.A." ...|$|E

In regard to his primary campaign message, Symington stated [...] "I vowed to get state spending under control, reduce taxes <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best to promote economic development and restore strength to the economy. I think I am in a strong position because I accomplished my goals." [...] Barrett had spent more than $1 million of her own money {{in the attempt to}} defeat Symington, who she stated she did not dislike personally, but simply felt that she could do a better job as Governor. On September 13, 1994, Symington defeated Barrett in the primary by a margin of 68% to 32%. Political analysts stated that Barrett had failed to distinguish herself from the incumbent Governor, and ran a flawed campaign.|$|E

2500|$|The {{difference}} in musical style and composition in Love Is Dead compared to Kerli's second album's material is significant. Love Is Dead being alternative rock {{and the new}} material being {{along the lines of}} synthpop. Kerli describes herself as being very depressed during the production of Love Is Dead and that she felt [...] "scattered" [...] and describes the transition to the new sound as an attempt to [...] "make it really radio friendly without losing what people already love about [...]" [...] In response to criticism concerning her sound compared to her older sound, Kerli said she was [...] "not the same person anymore", stating [...] "Maybe I will be [...] my third album. Maybe I'll be totally depressed and write another really dark album. I have no idea where I'm going to go. All I know is that I'm just always going to try to grow <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best. And whatever comes out of me is just going to be a reflection of who I am at that moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|His Bar Mitzvah {{speech was}} {{on the subject of}} the plight of the European Jews and the impact that World War II events would have on Jewish people around the world. He said, upon {{becoming}} a man under Jewish law: [...] "As I ... find happiness in joining the ranks of Israel, the knowledge of the tragic suffering of my fellow Jews ... makes this ... an occasion to reflect upon the heritage of my people—which now becomes mine. ... I shall try to understand my people <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best to share the responsibilities which history has placed upon all of us." [...] He later wrote to a friend from childhood: [...] "I should have been born into the German-speaking Jewish community of Prague in 1922 and died in a gas chamber some 20 years later. How I came to be born in the Bronx Hospital, I'll never quite understand." [...] Milgram married his wife, Alexandra, in a ceremony at the Brotherhood Synagogue in Greenwich Village in Manhattan on December 10, 1961, and they had two children, Michele and Marc.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Michael Strahan's retirement, Tuck was {{promoted}} to starting defensive end. When asked about the pressure of replacing Strahan, Tuck replied [...] "Pressure? No, I'm smart enough to realize there's only one Strahan and there will always only be one Strahan. I'm not trying to replace Michael Strahan. I'm just trying to fill in <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best to help this football team win. I'm not pinning that pressure on my back, as far as {{going out there and}} getting 22 sacks in a season." [...] But Tuck started his 2008 campaign in Michael Strahan-like fashion by sacking Washington Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell in the first play of the season opener. The Giants went on to defeat their division rivals the Washington Redskins 16–7. Tuck followed his exceptional performance in week one with an outstanding performance against the St. Louis Rams. Tuck finished the game with 2.0 sacks and an interception return for a touchdown in a Giants victory in week two. The interception and touchdown marked the first of Tuck's professional career. The touchdown was his first since his junior season at Notre Dame.|$|E

In October, Gunn confirmed that all five original Guardians and other characters from the original film would return, and the release date was moved up to May 5, 2017. In the following months, Michael Rooker said he would return for the sequel as Yondu, and was looking forward to exploring new areas of the character; Chris Pratt, who played Peter Quill / Star-Lord in the first film, confirmed the sequel would be one of his next projects; and Bradley Cooper expressed interest and excitement when asked if he would return as Rocket for the sequel. Vin Diesel also confirmed he would return as Groot. In March 2015, Gunn revealed that filming would take place in Atlanta, Georgia with [...] "major crew changes" [...] from the first film, and that his brother, Sean Gunn, would return as Kraglin alongside Karen Gillan as Nebula. He also discussed his relationship with Marvel, explained that the company [...] "let me go <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> thing, and I truly listen to their notes and ideas.

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Extra at the Vevo Certified SuperFanFest on 8 October 2014, Azalea commented that she was [...] "really excited" [...] about her upcoming release saying that the new material was [...] "uptempo and fun," [...] adding that she [...] "did a lot more collaborations because I felt like I had doors open for me and I {{had the opportunity to}} collaborate with artists that I didn't have before when I made my first album, so this time I got to kind of call whoever I wanted up <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> dream collaborations – it's really exciting!" [...] During yet another interview with Radio.com backstage at the CBS Radio We Can Survive concert at the Hollywood Bowl on 24 October 2014, Azalea mentioned her longtime desire to work with Ellie Goulding and after meeting several times she was approached by Goulding about a song that would become [...] "Heavy Crown", recalling [...] "she played it for me and I was in love with it and just felt it was so kind of appropriate for this to be our collaboration," [...] because it [...] "brings out something different in both artists that you don't usually see." [...] Most notably, the track shows off an edgier side of Goulding, whose voice Azalea called [...] "unique and ethereal sounding." [...] "She loved it because she felt like she doesn't do things that are as aggressive as our song together," [...] Azalea explained.|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{process for}} making music is [...] "I'll have a sudden, {{spontaneous}} {{vision of a}} song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> best to record it as quick as I can. I'll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song will go for like 30 seconds. I'll have {{a whole bunch of}} them [...] and then I'll just choose which ones to make into full songs." [...] For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, [...] "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story." [...] Parker also said [...] "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me." ...|$|E
