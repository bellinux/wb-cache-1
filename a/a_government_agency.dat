5|$|The ACLU's {{support of}} the NLRB was a major {{development}} for the ACLU, because it {{marked the first time}} it accepted that <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>agency</b> could be responsible for upholding civil liberties.

5|$|Freedom of {{the press}} is limited, with {{numerous}} restrictions on publishing rights and information dissemination. The government has previously tried {{to crack down on}} opposition papers before elections. In 2007, <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>agency</b> issued a directive to all private television and radio stations to refrain from broadcasting speeches made by opposition leaders, a move condemned by politicians from the opposition Democratic Action Party. Sabah, where all tabloids but one are independent of government control, has the freest press in Malaysia. Laws such as the Printing Presses and Publications Act have also been cited as curtailing freedom of expression.|$|E
5|$|In 1983 {{the site}} was bought by {{property}} developers Regalian Properties. A competition to develop {{the site was}} won by architect Terry Farrell, with an urban village as Farrell's original proposal. A scheme of office blocks was subsequently developed for the site, with <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>agency</b> as their occupier. The building had been sold for £130million in 1989, with construction planned to take three years, built by John Laing. SIS ultimately became the occupiers of the building. Farrell's design for the SIS building was influenced by 1930s industrial modernist architecture such as Bankside and Battersea Power Stations and Mayan and Aztec religious temples.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} {{of nuclear power}} in the United States slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>agency</b> planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 both contributed {{to a decline in}} interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program shrunk to 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E

On arrival at Chance Vought he was told that he could not be inducted without his birth certificate, which he had not brought with him. Annoyed by the bureaucratic mindset of the company, he decided to accept the offer from NACA instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} considered using {{a similar}} procurement solution {{to that in}} Denmark, where the spectrum was licensed to private enterprise, and the agencies purchase services from private telecommunications companies, based on conventional GSM technology. However, in Denmark this had not led to the desired results, with only Metropolitan Copenhagen being covered. Instead, the Norwegian Government chose to establish <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>agency</b> to build and operate the network. Use of the GSM and NMT450 network was insufficient {{because of lack of}} capacity in the conventional network in case of larger amounts of communication, lack of ability of group conversations, lack of priority systems and long dial-up times.|$|E
5|$|Underwater diver {{training}} is normally {{given by a}} qualified instructor {{who is a member}} of one of many diver training agencies or is registered with <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>agency.</b> Basic diver training entails the learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables. Diving hand signals are used to communicate underwater. Professional divers will also learn other methods of communication.|$|E

5|$|The Green Book was {{published}} locally in New York, but its popularity {{was such that}} from 1937 it was distributed nationally with input from Charles McDowell, a collaborator on Negro Affairs for the United States Travel Bureau, <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>agency.</b> With new editions published annually from 1936 to 1940, the Green Book's publication was suspended during World War II and resumed in 1946. Its scope expanded greatly during its years of publication; from covering only the New York City metropolitan area in the first edition, it eventually covered facilities {{in most of the}} United States and parts of Canada (primarily Montreal), Mexico and Bermuda. Coverage was good in the eastern US and weak in Great Plains states such as North Dakota, where there were few black residents. It eventually sold around 15,000 copies per year, distributed by mail order, by black-owned businesses and Esso service stations, some of which– unusual for the oil industry at the time– were franchised to African Americans.|$|E
5|$|When the {{government}} seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, {{the government}} provide the person notice, {{an opportunity to}} be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>agency</b> seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest. For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.|$|E
5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Supreme Court, Justice Stephen Breyer stated that the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's precedent in this area holds it is unconstitutional for <b>a</b> <b>government</b> <b>agency</b> to discipline an employee (who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, as long as that activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justice Samuel Alito, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.|$|E
