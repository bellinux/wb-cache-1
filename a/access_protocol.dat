5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage <b>access</b> <b>protocol</b> of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was an evolution of MTP). The primary {{reason for this is that}} MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E

FlightXML's API can be accessed via Representational state transfer or Simple Object <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> and the API can be accessed from any programming language that supports XML. FlightXML is charged on a per query basis and the more queries that a user account makes per month, the less the per-query fee is.|$|E
30|$|In this article, {{we first}} {{addressed}} {{the challenges in}} the design and implementation of distributed dynamic spectrum <b>access</b> <b>protocols.</b> Then, we categorized the existing dynamic spectrum <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> based on different criteria, such as spectrum sharing modes, spectrum allocation behaviors, spectrum access modes, the usage common control channel, spectrum usage strategies, the number of radios, and spectrum sensing techniques. We also discussed {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each category under diverse classification criterion. Moreover, we made a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art distributed dynamic spectrum <b>access</b> <b>protocols.</b> In addition, we also reviewed the ongoing standardization efforts. Finally, we presented several open research issues for the dynamic spectrum <b>access</b> <b>protocols,</b> including spectrum handoff based protocols, spectrum prediction based protocols, adaptation of the spectrum-sharing modes, protocols with cooperative spectrum sensing, and collision avoidance mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{is a critical}} issue in wireless networks since the battery life of mobile terminals is limited to only a few hours. One {{of the goals of}} protocol development for wireless networks should be power efficiency in mobile terminals. This paper addresses the design of link level and medium <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> (MACs) for this environment, with the objective of power conservation, in addition to the traditional design goals of maximizing channel utilization and minimizing latency. We consider a local area wireless Asynchronous Transfer mode (ATM) network supporting virtual circuits and multimedia traffic. A taxonomy of <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> with respect to power conservation is presented. A comparison of <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> for wireless networks from a power management perspective is presented. <b>Access</b> <b>protocols</b> such as 802. 11, DSA++, and others are considered in the comparison...|$|R

25|$|One way {{of sharing}} a library {{is over the}} network, known as network sharing. A user's iTunes Library can be shared over a local network using the closed, {{proprietary}} Digital Audio <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> (DAAP), created by Apple for this purpose. DAAP relies on the Bonjour network service discovery framework, Apple's implementation of the Zeroconf open network standard. Apple has not made the DAAP specification available to the general public, only to third-party licensees such as Roku. However, the protocol has been reverse-engineered and is now used to stream audio from non-Apple software (mainly on the Linux platform).|$|E
25|$|Many {{people use}} the terms Internet and World Wide Web, or just the Web, interchangeably, but the two terms are not synonymous. The World Wide Web is the primary {{application}} program that billions of people use on the Internet, and it has changed their lives immeasurably. However, the Internet provides many other services. The Web is a global set of documents, images and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, servers, and other databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main <b>access</b> <b>protocol</b> of the World Wide Web. Web services also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{metropolitan}} area networks are commonly implemented {{in a ring}} architecture. In this research, we study various <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> for multicasting in an optical burst switched (OBS) WDM ring environment. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} detailed study of multicast protocols in an OBS ring architecture. A ring topology is appropriate for multicasting since routing is significantly simplified as compared to a mesh topology. This allows us to forgo complex routing algorithms and focus on performance of various <b>access</b> <b>protocols.</b> We have developed multicast <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> that use simple scheduling and coordination schemes, and therefore are easy to implement in hardware. We consider only distributed protocols to avoid having a single point of failure. We study reliable versus unreliable protocols, and collision versus collision-free protocols. Ring nodes are equipped with a single fixed transmitter and tunable receiver (FT-TR). Signaling is done via a dedicated control wavelength. The performance of the multicast <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> is analyzed by simulation. We measure the performance of the <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> in terms of throughput, delay, channel utilization, and fairness. We show that there is a relationship between throughput, delay, and channel utilization. Specifically, throughput and delay performance can be increased at the expense of higher channel utilization. One of the proposed protocols, named Unicast Token, has high channel utilization, but performs well in terms of throughput, delay, and fairness...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modeling technique for performance evaluation of media <b>access</b> <b>protocols</b> based on semi-markovmodels. Theproposed techniqueprovides accurate performance prediction while also preserving model flexibility. General traffic generation and resource holding time distributions are supported with this approach. The model {{is independent of}} the system size and is linearly scalable to an arbitrary transmitter queue capacity. The analytic technique is introduced through the study of two simple media <b>access</b> <b>protocols.</b> The technique is then applied to a multi-channel photonic environment to evaluate protocol performance.
