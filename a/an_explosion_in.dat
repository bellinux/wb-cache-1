Video footage of the raid showed <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> her vicinity; Norgrove was then found, injured, in a fetal position in a gully.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1911, {{the ship}} {{suffered}} <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> {{one of her}} 12-inch guns when it failed to fire during gunnery practice. After some time passed, the breech was opened and ignited the propellant; the resulting fire killed 16 crewmen and several officers.|$|E
5|$|The Cambrian {{radiation}} saw <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> {{the variety}} of animal body plans, from flatworms and molluscs to arthropods and vertebrates.

5|$|Flight 663 {{was unable}} to recover from its unusually steep bank and plunged into the icy water of the Atlantic Ocean, where it {{exploded}} with bright orange flames. The Pan American 707 {{was the first to}} relay news of the crash, as it was receiving permission to land. Air Canada Flight 627, which had departed a few minutes prior to Flight 663, also radioed news of <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the water.|$|E
5|$|Pitch darkness. Every now and then, <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the night. They had {{orders to}} fire on any {{who could not}} keep up.

5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 as a result of <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> his lab. McCluskey {{died at the age of}} 75 of unrelated pre-existing disease.|$|E

5|$|An early {{version of}} the modern {{self-help}} book, the 18th-century British conduct book drew on many literary traditions, such as advice manuals and religious narratives. There was <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the number of conduct books published {{during the second half}} of the 18th century, and Wollstonecraft took advantage of this burgeoning market when she published Thoughts. However, the book was only moderately successful: it was favourably reviewed, but only by one journal and it was reprinted only once. Although it was excerpted in popular contemporary magazines, it was not republished until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the gun breech. Sandia's technicians {{also found that the}} physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's theory that an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion.|$|E
5|$|During the ship's peacetime career, she {{frequently}} {{took part}} in fleet reviews. In 1934, she went on a tour with the royal yacht to eastern Africa, and she made another foreign cruise two years later to Germany during the 1936 Summer Olympics being held there. She {{was involved in the}} Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s; she evacuated Italian nationals in August 1936, and while returning to Italy, suffered <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> an aviation gas tank that necessitated major repairs. The ship supported the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Georgia {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career in the Atlantic Fleet. In 1907, she {{took part in the}} Jamestown Exposition and suffered <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> her aft 8-inch gun turret that killed or wounded 21men. At the end of the year, she joined the Great White Fleet on its circumnavigation of the globe, which ended in early 1909. Peacetime training followed for the next five years, and in 1914 she cruised in Mexican waters to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution. In early 1916, the ship was temporarily decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|In May 1909, at the {{launching}} ceremony for Danton, socialist activists prevented the ship from leaving the stocks. The ship was eventually launched on 4 July 1909. A week {{after she was}} completed, she {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom in honour of the Coronation of George V in 1911. Upon her return to France, Danton was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron, along with her sister ships and the two powerful dreadnoughts Courbet and Jean Bart. In 1913, while off Hyères in the Mediterranean, Danton suffered <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> one of her gun turrets, which killed three men and injured several others.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{served in}} the Spanish–American War (1898) {{as part of the}} Flying Squadron and took part in the {{blockades}} of Cienfuegos and Santiago de Cuba. She missed the decisive Battle of Santiago de Cuba after steaming to Guantánamo Bay the night before to resupply coal. After the war she served with the North Atlantic Squadron, performing training maneuvers and gunnery practice. During this period she suffered <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> an 8-inch gun turret, killing nine, and ran aground twice, requiring several months of repair both times. She was decommissioned in 1906 for modernization.|$|E

5|$|On December 30, 1905, Frank Steunenberg {{was killed}} by <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> front of his Caldwell, Idaho home. A former {{governor}} of Idaho, Steunenberg had clashed with the WFM in previous strikes. Harry Orchard, a former WFM member who had once acted as WFM President Charles Moyer's bodyguard was arrested for the crime, and evidence was found in his hotel room. Famed Pinkerton detective James McParland, who had infiltrated and helped to destroy the Molly Maguires, was placed {{in charge of the}} investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Big Bang {{is not an}} {{explosion}} of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, space itself expands with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> space, but rather an expansion of space. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.|$|E
5|$|The {{first test}} would {{probably}} be a ground burst, but consideration was also given to <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> a ship to measure the effect of a ship-borne atomic bomb on a major port. Such data would complement that obtained about an underwater explosion by the American Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946, and would therefore be of value to the Americans. Seven Canadian sites were assessed, the most promising being Churchill, Manitoba, but the waters were too shallow to allow ships to approach close to shore.|$|E

5|$|The {{main base}} was then {{subjected}} to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122mm rockets {{slammed into the}} base, leveling most of the above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells set off <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> the main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown {{into the air and}} detonated on impact within the base. Soon after another shell hit a cache of tear gas, which saturated the entire area. Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of C-4 and other explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.|$|E
5|$|Amy starts {{becoming}} more afflicted {{by the image}} of the Angel in her eye, and the Doctor instructs her to keep her eyes closed, preventing her from seeing it. Octavian has the clerics guard Amy while he, the Doctor, and River make for a secondary control room {{on the other side of}} the oxygen factory. During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River to enter and secure the control room. They analyze the crack the Doctor saw and confirm that the leaking energy came from <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> time, and are able to narrow the date of the explosion's epicenter.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{bricks and}} {{brickwork}} were also imported and utilized in other colonies throughout the Dutch Empire in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Fort Zeelandia {{was built on}} a small island off Tainan in Formosa (Taiwan) between 1624 and 1634 after the Dutch acquired Formosa from China as a trading colony. It was built using bricks from Batavia (Jakarta), where the Dutch East India Company had its headquarters. After a siege in 1662, the Dutch surrendered the fort to Koxinga, a Ming dynasty general. The fort was destroyed by <b>an</b> <b>explosion</b> <b>in</b> 1873 when a shell from a British warship blew up the ammunition storehouse. The masonry was later used for other purposes. All that remains {{is part of the}} southern wall.|$|E
