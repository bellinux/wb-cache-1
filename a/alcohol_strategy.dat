40|$|Introduction and Aims The aims of {{this study}} were to examine young people's belief in the {{effectiveness}} of various <b>alcohol</b> control <b>strategies</b> and to identify demographic, attitudinal and behavioural correlates of perceived effectiveness. Design and Methods An online questionnaire hosted on a secure server was completed by 1418 men and women aged 16 – 21 [*]years living in South-East England. It assessed the perceived effectiveness of various <b>alcohol</b> control <b>strategies.</b> Key correlates included sensation seeking, impulsivity, conscientiousness, alcohol outcome expectancies, drink refusal self-efficacy, perceived peer alcohol use and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test scores. Results The most effective strategies were perceived to be enforcing responsible service legislation, strictly monitoring late-night licensed premises and teaching alcohol refusal skills. Greater belief in the effectiveness of <b>alcohol</b> control <b>strategies</b> was expressed by older participants, those who consumed less alcohol and those who expected more negative outcomes from alcohol consumption. Discussion and Conclusions The data suggest that in order to increase the perceived effectiveness of <b>alcohol</b> control <b>strategies,</b> we may need to address young people's beliefs about the negative outcomes of <b>alcohol</b> use. <b>Strategies</b> that young people believe are effective may be easier to implement, but this does not imply that unpopular but effective strategies should not be trie...|$|R
40|$|Alcohol {{has become}} a major public health problem in the UK. In order to {{coordinate}} the work of both statutory and non-statutory agencies more efficiently and effectively, a government circular HN(89) 4 has emphasized the need for development of local multi-agency <b>alcohol</b> misuse prevention <b>strategies.</b> Despite expressed enthusiasm for <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategies,</b> information about their development, effectiveness and overall national progress is scarce and needs to be improved. This national survey reports the most recent and accurate information about the development of district and regional <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategies</b> in England and Wales. Although only 51 (27 %) districts stated they had a strategy, it was encouraging to find 90 (47 %) other districts that were in the process of, or planning to develop such a document. Of the 51 districts with a strategy, the following key findings were noted: (1) Forty-three (84 %) districts stated that they had started to implement their strategy, but none claimed to have fully implemented it. (2) Thirty-six (71 %) districts stated that their strategy had an action plan. (3) Thirty-four (67 %) districts stated that their strategy had been officially endorsed by the district health authority. (4) Thirty-eight (76 %) districts stated that they had identified an individual or group to monitor the strategies' implementation. The results of the survey could be of interest to the Department of Health, the Faculty of Public Health Medicine, the Health Education Authority and the regional alcohol coordinators.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} trends in alcohol {{consumption}} and related {{problems in the}} Republic of Ireland during the years 1990 – 2010, and on alcohol policy developments over this same period. Prior {{to the collapse of}} the Irish economy in late- 2008, Ireland had enjoyed almost fifteen years of unprecedented economic growth, with commensurate increases in levels of personal disposable income. As predicted by economists, economic growth was accompanied by substantial increases in levels of alcohol consumption, with corresponding increases in all the main indicators of alcohol-related problems. Although numerous policy reports from the health sector advocated <b>alcohol</b> control <b>strategies,</b> due to the generally neoliberal ethos of this era and active lobbying from the drinks industry, little or no implementation of such strategies occurred. Reflecting the current economic down-turn, levels of alcohol consumption have now stabilized. It is concluded, however, that implementation of comprehensive, top-down, <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategies</b> remains unlikely, and that bottom-up, community mobilization offers the best prospect for change in this sphere...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{reducing}} the consumption of alcohol became a topical issue among the Soviet authorities in 1982, {{but as a result}} of the following frequent substitutions in the organs of power the planned measures could not be applied. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev, being appointed secretary general, once again raised the issue, and began to carry out a considerably stricter alcohol policy. The new and unprecedentedly strict <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategy</b> was being carried out according to the guidelines sent from Moscow in all the Union Republics, including Estonia. The <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategy</b> implemented in 1985 - 1987 covered different fields and was not only about restrictions on the sale. Attention was also paid to preventive methods - propagating abstinence as well as offering new choices to spend free time. The availability of alcoholic drinks was aggravated by setting stricter limits on the sale, increasing the prices of alcoholic beverages and also by increasing the penalty for illegal sale and use of alcohol. Several changes were made to provide better availability of narcological aid. The new administration would not have withdrawn from the once started policy, but economical difficulties brought it to halt as early as in 1987. The significantly reduced production of alcohol lead to the slumping of profits from the sale and the treasury could no longer afford to continue the experiment. The purpose of this paper was to give a thorough survey of the methods of the 1985 - 87 <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategy</b> and to look into the consequences of developing a stricter official <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategy</b> in Estonia, especially the effects on consumption habits. The descriptions of the official <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategy</b> are based on the decrees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, also the official documents issued by local authorities, legislative and executive bodies. To evaluate alcohol consumption, the author has basically relied on the statistics of the sale of alcohol. The source of the data is the departmental reports of the Central Statistical Office of the ESSR to the USSR Federal Statistical office on the sales of alcohol in Soviet Estonia. The data of the reports must be reliable as these were confidential documents intended only for official use. It may be concluded from the estimations of the amount of the alcohol sold that {{as a result of the}} new <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategy,</b> alcohol consumption in Estonia decreased considerably: from 10. 8 litres of absolute alcohol per capita in 1984 to 7. 5 litres in 1986, and 6. 4 litres in 1987. There was also a change in the different types of alcoholic drinks consumed. The consumption of strong alcohol, especially different types of wine, decreased to some extent, while the relative proportion of beer consumption increased. In addition to the decreased figures of legal alcohol sale the decrease in alcohol consumption is confirmed by the drastic fall in the rate of alcohol poisoning fatalities and cases of alcoholic psychosis in 1985 and 1986; during the period of 1985 - 1986 the rate of alcohol poisoning fatalities was reduced by half. The similarity of changes in the frequency of alcohol poisoning fatalities and tendencies in legal alcohol sales allows us to conclude that under the circumstances of restricted sale of legal alcohol the consumption of illegal alcohol and surrogates did not considerably increase. The temperance campaign and contingent fall in alcohol consumption was effective in decreasing the number of fatalities in injuries and suicides...|$|E

40|$|AIM – The study explores arenas of {{adolescent}} binge drinking in small Swedish towns and the meanings these have for young persons. The focus is thus on space and place, {{and on the}} geography of underage drinking. DESIGN – An ethnographic approach was used, including direct observations, document studies and contacts with youth workers on local and national levels, and interviews with 28 underage binge-drinking adolescents chosen as informants. FINDINGS – Adolescent binge drinkers seem to have moved away from street and other outdoor drinking arenas to home environments, where {{they feel they have}} more control over their party location and participants. CONCLUSIONS – One consequence of outdoor drinking moving indoors is that professional youth workers and police cannot enter party arenas and the only adults who can do so are the parents. This has implications for preventive <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategies</b> and outreach social work. Measures should be directed to parents to make them fully {{aware of the importance of}} the party location in their homes...|$|R
40|$|Gay men's use of methamphetamine has aroused great anxiety.

Recent evidence from case-crossover studies suggests that use of not only methamphetamine but also of alcohol, cannabis, poppers, cocaine, amphetamines and Viagra is associated with increased risk behaviour during episodes of anal intercourse. However national drugs and <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategies</b> do not refer to gay men, drug treatment services {{tend to focus on}} opiates and do not target gay men, and HIV prevention for gay men rarely mentions use of substances other than methamphetamine.

40|$|Abstract — The 2012 UK Government’s <b>Alcohol</b> <b>Strategy</b> for England and Wales {{has been}} welcomed broadly and {{resulted}} only in muted criticism within the UK public health community. This is despite strong continuities with previous alcohol industry construc-tions {{of the nature}} of the problem and preferred policy responses. This is probably because the strategy shows progress on the public health lobby’s key issue of pricing of alcohol beverages. There are, however, many problems with the wider content of the strategy, showing little interest in much needed industry regulation other than on price, and an absence of commitment to investment in research. Some dilemmas posed for the research community are discussed. The UK Government <b>Alcohol</b> <b>Strategy</b> for England and Wales (Secretary of State for the Home Department, 2012) has broadly been welcomed as a step in the right direction that needs to go further. The Lancet (2012) suggested that the ‘government should be commended for taking strong, effective steps to reduce alcohol consumption that will save lives’. Alcohol Research U. K. (2012) ‘broadly supports the approach adopted’. Witnesses giving evidence to the first session of the parliamen-tary health select committee in April gave similar praise (BMJ...|$|E
40|$|Tackling alcohol-related harms crosses {{agency and}} {{professional}} boundaries, requiring collaboration between health, criminal justice, {{education and social}} welfare institutions. It is {{a key component of}} most multicomponent programmes in the United States, Australia and Europe. Partnership working, already embedded in service delivery structures, is a core mechanism for delivery of the new UK Government <b>Alcohol</b> <b>Strategy.</b> This article reports findings from a study of alcohol partnerships across England. The findings are based on a mix of open discussion interviews with key informants and on semi-structured telephone interviews with 90 professionals with roles in local alcohol partnerships. Interviewees reported the challenges of working within a complex network of interlinked partnerships, often within hierarchies under an umbrella partnership, some of them having a formal duty of partnership. The new <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategy</b> has emerged at a time of extensive reorganisation within health, social care and criminal justice structures. Further development of a partnership model for policy implementation would benefit from consideration of the incompatibility arising from required collaboration and from tensions between institutional and professional cultures.

40|$|Alcohol {{plays an}} {{important}} and positive role in many aspects of British life. Drinking alcohol {{for most of us}} is associated with celebration and enjoyable social interaction. However alcohol has also become synonymous with drunken violence and disorder, vandalism and the images of overcrowded accident and emergency departments dealing with the harms of excessive drinking. Partners in Birmingham recognise and share the public’s concern that current levels of crime and disorder and ill health caused by alcohol are unacceptable. The financial costs to the city of the misuse of alcohol are significant. The human costs of the misuse of alcohol, impacting the individual, the family and the community, are immeasurable. The challenge we all face is to encourage everyone who drinks alcohol to do so sensibly and safely, whilst ensuring that measures are in place to tackle the impacts of alcohol misuse. HM Government has recently published the next steps in the <b>alcohol</b> <b>strategy</b> for England (Safe Sensible Social: June 2007) which outlines measures to address the issues of alcohol misuse. We in Birmingham will actively implement the strategy recommendations and build on these within the development of the Birmingham <b>Alcohol</b> <b>Strategy</b> {{in order to meet the}} local needs of the community we serve...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to better {{understand}} differences, similarities and trends of national-level alcohol policies in different parts of Europe as viewed in their contexts and with a focus on the policy-making process and influencing factors. METHOD: This case study included a combination of document and interview data and considered four European countries with different traditions concerning drinking culture, geographical location and policy approach. The countries were selected through purposive sampling. National-level official policy documents were collected using an openly accessible database. Four interviews with a national expert from each of the study countries were conducted by telephone, recorded and transcribed. Data analysis centred on a variety of <b>alcohol</b> policy <b>strategies</b> and factors influencing the policy-making process. RESULTS: The data show that all four countries have implemented a variety of complementary <b>alcohol</b> policy <b>strategies</b> including both preventive and regulatory <b>strategies.</b> However, <b>alcohol</b> policies are complex and the findings show differences across the four countries in priorities, type and number of preventive versus regulatory strategies, their implementation and enforcement, and their strictness. The results furthermore illustrate the variety of actors and their level of influence in the policy process. CONCLUSION: Alcohol consumption and policies are embedded into complex social, cultural, historical and political circumstances and are greatly influenced by these contexts. Despite existing differences, a combination of a variety of <b>alcohol</b> policy <b>strategies,</b> which are in accordance with the five health promotion strategies, is applied in all four countries. European recommendations or regulations provide guidance for national level alcohol policies on the one hand, but might also hinder advances for alcohol policies from a public health perspective. It is necessary to consider all policy sectors at all levels in order to build healthy public policy. The policy-making process involves many actors with competing interests, which makes it necessary to advocate for alcohol policy from a public health perspective...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{examined}} the coping strategies employed by adolescents in high-risk drinking situations. Adolescent drinking practices {{are affected by}} influences from four main sources. They are as follows: Culture, Family, Peer and Self. The present paper {{examined the}} different responses of adolescents when faced with influences from these sources. Eighty male adolescents (aged 13 - 17 years) were drawn from two populations, Christian based youth groups and State League Football Clubs. They {{were asked to describe}} the two most recent high-risk drinking situations they had experienced, that is, a situation in which {{they did not want to}} drink alcohol but were most tempted to do so. The subjects were asked to recall their cognitions and behaviours throughout each situation. From the situation descriptions, the physical and social characteristics were examined. Utilisation of different coping strategies were then compared across different social and physical settings. Seventeen coping strategies were identified that were extensively used by male adolescents. An examination of the utilisation profiles for each strategy demonstrated that the employment of different strategies was affected by the social setting, the proportion of friends drinking, and offers of <b>alcohol.</b> <b>Strategies</b> employed in situations involving high levels of stress were aimed at removing the pressures acting upon them (problem-focused coping) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the associations between <b>alcohol</b> marketing <b>strategies,</b> <b>alcohol</b> education including knowledge about dangers {{of alcohol and}} refusal of alcohol, and drinking prevalence, problem drinking, and drunkenness. Analyses {{are based on the}} Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS) conducted in Zambia (2004) of students primarily 11 to 16 years of age (= 2257). Four statistical models were computed to test the associations between alcohol marketing and education and alcohol use, while controlling for possible confounding factors. Alcohol marketing, specifically through providing free alcohol through a company representative, was associated with drunkenness (AOR = 1. 49; 95 % CI: 1. 09 – 2. 02) and problem drinking (AOR = 1. 41; 95 % CI: 1. 06 – 1. 87) among youth after controlling for demographic characteristics, risky behaviors, and alcohol education. However, alcohol education was not associated with drunkenness or problem drinking. These findings underscore the importance of restricting alcohol marketing practices as an important policy <b>strategy</b> for reducing <b>alcohol</b> use and its dire consequences among vulnerable youth...|$|R
