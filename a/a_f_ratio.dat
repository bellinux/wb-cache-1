40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} under experimental conditions whether the self concepts of children could be improved through the use of videotape feedback as a stimulus for discussion in group counseling sessions. The ninety-nine subjects in this study were all of the fourth and fifth grade students at Burris Laboratory School, Muncie, Indiana. The study was conducted during the spring of 1977. Two classrooms were used as experimental groups and two were control groups. Each classroom contained both fourth and fifth grade students. The experimental groups participated in six group counseling sessions over a two week period. Videotapes were made of regular classroom activities and these tapes were used as a stimulus for group discussions one hour later. Discussions were guided by the principles of Grasser's Reality Therapy. The data collected for each subject was the total score obtained on the Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale which was administered as a pre-test, a post-test and a two-week delayed post-test. The effects of the treatment were analyzed through the use of a 2 X 4 X 2 univariate analysis of covariance with repeated measures on the third factor. The pre-test scores were used as a covariate. All factors were considered to be fixed. A non-significant sex-by-treatment interaction was found (F= 1. 054, P<. 373). Also, a non-significant test-bysex interaction was found (F= 1. 35, p(. 26). Because there were no interactions, the effects of the treatment were interpreted directly by a contrast between the experimental and control groups (E 1 + E 2 - C 1 + C 2). The null hypothesis stated that there would be no significant differences between the experimental and control groups in the self concepts of the subjects as measured by the Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale. <b>A</b> <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> of 15. 991 (p<. 0002) allowed the null hypothesis to be rejected. Because of the degree of non-homogeniety of the groups, the significance was in the direction of the control groups who obtained higher means than the experimental groups. Examination of group means showed that the experimental groups were significantly lower on the pre-test scores, made larger gains during the treatment than the control groups, but still scored lower on the two post-tests than the control groups. The mean of the normative sample for the Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale is 51. 84. In this study the mean on the delayed post-test was 59. 56 for the experimentalgroups and 67. 02 for the control groups. Under the constraints of the study, the following conclusions were made based on the statistical analyses of the data: 1. The treatment did not produce more significant change than that observed in the groups which receive treatment. 2. As a group, the self concept scores of the students at Burris Laboratory School are higher than those of the normative group. 3. There were no significant differences in self concept scores based on the sex of the subjects. 4. Becoming familiar with the components of personality which make up the self concept, as defined by PiersHarris, appeared to have a positive effect on the subjects. 5. All groups experienced gains in self concept scores during the five weeks of this study. Recommendations were made for further study to include a longer period of treatment, the use of a behavioral. checklist to determine the effects of the treatment, and the use of videotape feedback and the Piers-Harris Children's Self Concept Scale in classroom activities.

40|$|A test of {{standing}} broad jump ability {{was administered to}} ninety-three sixth grade boys to compare the kinesthetic and demonstration methods of instruction. The subjects were classified on the Neilson-Cozens Classification Index and divided into three groups. The first group received the kinesthetic method of instruction, the second group was instructed using the demonstration method, and the third group did not receive any formal instruction. The data were examined by computing the {{mean and standard deviation}} of each pre-test and post-test group. The mean and standard deviation of the pre-test scores were 60. 61 and 7. 589. The mean and standard deviation of the post-test scores were 61. 31 and 7. 397. When each pre-test score was subtracted from its corresponding post-test score it was revealed that the demonstration group showed an increase in performance of eighteen boys, the kinesthetic group increased by sixteen boys and the group receiving no formal instruction increased by seven boys. Analysis of variance of matched groups revealed <b>an</b> <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2. 68 which was not significant at the. 05 level. An alternate approach was attempted in which the effect of the pre-test scores were partialled out from the post-test scores.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} whether or not the process of meaning acquisition and vocabulary development begins with an initial exposure to an unfamiliar word within the oral context of a children 2 ̆ 7 s story. The effect of the order in which the posttest was given on the posttest score was also measured. ^ Two children 2 ̆ 7 books were selected and taped for use in the study: Solomon the Rusty Nail and The Legend of the Veery Bird. A list of ten unfamiliar words and three sentences containing those words from each of the two books comprised the oral posttest. ^ A pilot study and the remaining research were conducted in a small Northwestern town. Children were randomly assigned to membership in the experimental group for one book and the control group for the other, simultaneously. The order of the oral posttest was manipulated so that an approximately even number of males and females were given the posttest in each of four orders for both books. A proportionate random sample of 128 children in self-contained third grade classrooms listened to tapes of one of the books and were given individual posttests. ^ Analysis of variance indicated that significant differences existed between the experimental and control groups and between males and females for both books. For Solomon the Rusty Nail, a comparison of means by group yielded <b>an</b> <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> of 69. 46, p 3 ̆c. 0001.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} has shown that robust procedures for testing variances have become available. The two best procedures are one proposed by O'Brien (1981) and another by Brown and Forsy the (1974). An exami-nation of these procedures {{for a wide variety of}} populations confirms their robustness and indicates that optimal power can usually be obtained by applying a test for kurtosis to aid in the decision between these two proce-dures. Recently robust tests of variance (scale) have been reported (Brown & Forsythe, 1974; O'Brien, 1981) and have been found to give good power for a variety of population distributions (Algina, Olejnik, & Ocanto, 1989; Conover, Johnson, & Johnson, 1981; Olejnik & Algina, 1987; Ramsey & Brailsford, 1990).

40|$|Neural {{avalanches}} are {{a prominent}} form of brain activity characterized by network-wide bursts whose statistics follow a power-law distribution with a slope near 3 / 2. Recent work suggests that avalanches of different durations can be rescaled and thus collapsed together. This collapse mirrors work in statistical physics {{where it is}} proposed to form a signature of systems evolving in a critical state. However, no rigorous statistical test has been proposed to examine {{the degree to which}} neuronal avalanches collapse together. Here, we describe a statistical test based on functional data analysis, where raw avalanches are first smoothed with a Fourier basis, then rescaled using a time-warping function. Finally, <b>an</b> <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> test combined with a bootstrap permutation is employed to determine if avalanches collapse together in a statistically reliable fashion. To illustrate this approach, we recorded avalanches from cortical cultures on multielectrode arrays as in previous work. Analyses show that avalanches of various durations can be collapsed together in a statistically robust fashion. However, a principal components analysis revealed that the offset of avalanches resulted in marked variance in the time-warping function, thus arguing for limitations to the strict fractal nature of avalanche dynamics. We compared these results with those obtained from cultures treated with an AMPA/NMDA receptor antagonist (APV/DNQX), which yield a power-law of avalanche durations with a slope greater than 3 / 2. When collapsed together, these avalanches showed marked misalignments both at onset and offset time-points. In sum, the proposed statistical evaluation suggests the presence of scale-free avalanche waveforms and constitutes an avenue for examining critical dynamics in neuronal systems...|$|R
40|$|Dealing with a {{procedure}} for the automatic classification of laser point clouds based on surface curvature values, {{one of the}} most critical aspects is the correct interpretation of the estimated results. This care is required since the measurements are characterised by errors of different kind, and simplified analytical models are applied to estimate the differential terms used to locally compute the object surface curvature values. Following a non-parametric approach, the differential terms are the first- and second-order partial derivatives of a Taylor’s expansion used to determine the Gaussian K and the mean H local curvatures. Therefore, a statistical analysis is proposed in this paper. It is based at first on a chi-square test applied to verify the fulfilment of the second-order Taylor’s expan- sion. Successively, the variance–covariance propagation law is applied to the estimated differential terms, in order to calculate the covariance matrix of a two-row vector containing the Gaussian and the mean curvature estimates, and <b>an</b> <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> test is then applied to verify their significance. By analysing the test acceptance or rejection for K and H and their sign, a reliable classification of the whole point cloud into its geometrical basic types is carried out. A robust parametric modelling is then applied to estimate the analytical function of each classified surface. This parametric modelling allows also the indirect segmen- tation of the geometrical units. Nevertheless, to directly perform the unit segmentation by detecting the discontinu- ity lines, an extension of the Taylor’s expansion to the third- and fourth-order terms is also suggested. Some numerical experiments on noisy synthetic laser data confirm the validity of the method proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} of quasistatic lung inspiratory and expiratory pressure-volume (P-V) curves {{has been investigated}} in 8 young healthy volunteers studied on 4 occasions. The reproducibility of the total lung capacity (TLC) measured by body plethysmography was good, with a mean coefficient of variation of 1. 8 ± 0. 9 % (SD). The following variables were calculated from the P-V curves: the recoil pressures measured at TLC and 90, 80, 70, 60, and 50 % TLC, {{as well as the}} compliance at functional residual capacity. For all the variables considered the intraseries variance was similar to the intarsenies variance so that all the individual results were pooled together. For each variable a coefficient of variation was calculated for each subject, as well as <b>an</b> <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> to compare the interindividual differences to the intraindividual differences. For the variables obtained from the expiratory P-V curve, the lowest coefficient of variation was found for elastic lung recoil pressure, 90 % TLC (6. 6 ± 2. 6 %, mean ± SD). The reproducibility of the inspiratory P-V curve was found to be somewhat better than that of the expiratory one, with a coefficient of variation of 3. 4 ± 0. 8 % at 90 % TLC. In absolute terms at that same level, the mean standard error of measurements was 1. 2 cm H 2 O for the expiratory curves and 0. 8 cm H 2 O for the inspiratory ones. It is concluded that in terms of reproducibility the best index of lung elasticity is the recoil pressure measured at 90 % TLC and that the inspiratory curve is even better than the expiratory one.

The subtests for reading vocabulary and reading comprehension were both used. Following the pretest, the students in the experimental group attended the reading laboratory three days a week, forty-five minutes a day from October through May. The students in the control group received only normal classroom instruction. A distinct one-way analysis of variance was applied to test hypotheses one through six. The t test for uncorrelated data was applied to test hypotheses seven through nine. In each instance the level of significance necessary to reject the null hypothesis was set at the. 01 level. The results of this study indicate that the students attending the reading laboratory significantly outperformed the students receiving only normal classroom instruction on all subtests of the posttest of the California Achievement Test. Significant <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> were attained on all pretest- posttest comparisons of the learners in the experimental group. The mean scores were significantly higher on the posttest. <b>A</b> significant <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> was attained on the pretest- posttest comparison of the vocabulary reading achievement scores for the control group. The mean scores were significantly higher on the posttest. There were no significant <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> attained on the pretest-posttest comparison of the comprehension or total reading achievement scores for the control group. When the learners in the experimental group were compared with the learners in the control group on the vocabulary, comprehension, and total reading section of the California Achievement Test, significant t ratios were attained on all comparisons. The experimental group significantly outperformed the control group in all comparisons...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{extended and}} refined an in-service assessment model used in Project Genethics {{resulting in an}} evaluation of Project Genethics and {{a test of the}} model's utility. The model guided analyses of the correlational relationships between (a) teacher competency measured by a written 50 -item validated posttest (Teacher 50), (b) the number of teaching strategies reported by the participant teachers (Strategy 20), and (c) student competency measured by a written 25 -item validated posttest (Student 25) using a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient Lr). A multiple R statistic and stepwise linear regression with <b>an</b> <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> were used to determine the association of Teacher 50 and Strategy 20 with the criterion, Student 25. The model is hierarchical. Subsets of test items and teaching strategies related to core genetics concepts (Mendelian genetics, mitosis and meiosis, pedigrees and probability, polygenic inheritance, and chromosome aberrations) were analyzed in teacher posttests, student posttests, and reported teaching strategies. Stepwise linear regression was used to determine the relative impact of the predictors on the criterion, Student 25. The research population consisted of 78 secondary biology teachers and 4, 920 of their students. The teachers attend one of six Project Genethics workshops conducted in the summer of 1991,. funded by the National Science Foundation, and implemented by staff of the Human Genetics and Bioethics Education Laboratory (HGABEL). The researcher employed an ex g facto design. A summative data form was designed and used with project data for testing eight null hypotheses. A significant positive linear correlation was found between teacher competency and student competency and the number of strategies used in both full and subset analyses. No significant correlation was found between the number of strategies used and student performance in both full and subset analyses. The number of strategies used did not add significantly to the predictability of student competency after teacher competency was considered. The conceptual understanding of secondary students should be the ultimate criterion by which the effectiveness of in-service programs is measured provided the assessment items are congruent with the student conceptual level of understanding. Teacher knowledge was the most highly associated predictor of student concept attainment. Department of BiologyThesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There {{are limited}} {{data about the}} {{epidemiology}} and risk factors/indicators of gingivitis, aggressive periodontitis (AgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP) in Jordan. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the prevalence and risk indicators of gingivitis, AgP and CP. Methods A sample of 595 subjects was randomly selected from subjects escorting out-patients attending a Medical Center, a Dental Teaching Hospital, and 2 private dental clinics. The socio-demographic variables, oral hygiene habits, income, smoking and Body Mass Index (BMI) were recorded. Full mouth periodontal examination was performed, and radiographs were taken for sites with probing depth > 3 mm. Results About 76 % had gingivitis, 2. 2 % had AgP and 5. 5 % had CP. Periodontitis was more frequent among males than females with <b>a</b> M: <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1. 6 : 1 and the prevalence increased with age. Subjects who reported not using a tooth brush, smokers and subjects with BMI > 30 kg/m 2 had significantly higher prevalence of periodontitis. The risk for periodontitis was greater among subjects who reported positive family history and subjects with ≤ 12 years of education. Conclusions This is the first study to report on the prevalence of gingivitis, CP and AgP in North Jordanian. Age, low education, low frequency of tooth brushing and family history were significantly associated with increased risk of periodontitis. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Shine-Bower error term {{is used to}} form {{approximate}} <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> {{for testing}} various effects in the Shine-Bower single-subject ANOVA and the Shine Combined ANOVA. The distribution governing the general case of {{any one of these}} <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> is the double non-central F distribution which has both a numerator and a denominator non-centrality parameter. It is rigorously shown that the approximate nature of these <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> makes them no worse than conservative with respect to the probability of a Type I error. It is also shown that the approximate nature of these <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> reduces their power. EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT 1979, 39 THE Shine-Bower error term is used to form approximate <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> for testing various effects in the Shine-Bower single-subject ANOVA (Shine, 1977) and the Shine Combined ANOVA (Shine, 1978). With one exception, all these <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> have the Shine-Bower error term in the denominator. The exception is the <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> used as <b>an</b> alternate statistic to test the slow change assumption of the Shine-Bower error term. This <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> has the Shine-Bower error term in the numerator. It is normally used as a right-tailed test for testing the slow change assumption, {{but it can also be}} used as a two-tailed test for testing the main effect of trials in the Shine-Bower ANOVA. All the other <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> based on the Shine-Bower error term are used as right-tailed tests only. The purpose of the present paper is twofold. The first purpose is to establish rigorously that all the above F tests are no worse than conservative with respect to the probability of a Type I error. -The second purpose is to investigate the general characteristics of the power of these tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if differences exist in the perceptions of baccalaureate and certificate radiation therapists regarding their level of professionalism; degree of competence in technical, analytic, communication and leadership skills; and level of role conflict in the work environment. The role conflict here refers to the situation in which the existing roles of graduates in the work place contradict their expectations. Additionally, administrators of employing facilities for baccalaureate and certificate radiation therapists were surveyed to determine their perceptions of baccalaureate and certificate radiation therapists using the variables indicated above. An instrument was developed by the researcher, incorporating elements relevant to professional behavior, job competence, and roles expected of radiation therapists in the work place. A preliminary pilot study was conducted with 33 radiation therapists and 12 administrators using the 35 -item survey to test the adequacy of the instrument. Reliability of the instrument was strong, ranging from. 89 to. 95. These reliabilities were judged to be adequate in relation to the sample size and number of items in the questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to 500 radiation therapists in the Eastern United States. Two hundred and twenty-one questionnaires, representing a return rate of 44 % were received from the respondents. In reviewing the questionnaire, only 216 (88 baccalaureate) and (128 certificate) respondents met the criteria of the study. A similar, but modified version of the questionnaire was mailed to 80 administrators of cancer treatment centers who supervised each radiation therapist in the study. Forty-three of the questionnaires mailed to the administrators were returned, representing a return rate of 44 %. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to the data and <b>an</b> <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> was obtained. Significance was set at p =. 05 There were no significant differences between the perceptions of baccalaureate and certificate radiation therapists regarding their level of professionalism or in any of the skill areas identified in the study. The administrators on the other hand perceived differences between both groups in the areas of professionalism, role conflict, analytic, communication and leadership skills. The baccalaureate radiation therapists were perceived as excelling in these qualities, and experiencing a greater role conflict in the work place compared to the certificate radiation therapists. The baccalaureate radiation therapists also perceived themselves as experiencing a greater role conflict in the work place...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> for both stable {{chromosome}} aberrations, i,e. ratios of translocations to pericentric inversions, and unstable aberrations, i. e. dicentrics and centric rings, were measured using fluorescence in situ hybridization. <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> for stable aberrations measured after exposure to low (2. 89 Gy 60 Co γ rays) and high-LET (0. 25 Gy 56 Fe ions; 1. 25 Gy 56 Fe ions; 3. 0 Gy 12 C ions) radiation were 6. 5 ± 1. 5, 4. 7 ± 1. 6, 9. 3 ± 2. 5 and 10. 4 ± 3. 0, respectively. <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> for unstable aberrations measured after low (2. 89 Gy 60 Co γ rays) and high-LET (0. 25 Gy S 6 Fe ions; 3. 0 Gy 12 C ions) radiations were 6. 5 ± 1. 6, 6. 3 ± 2. 3 and 11. 1 ± 3. 7, respectively. No {{significant difference between}} the <b>F</b> <b>ratios</b> for low- and high-LET radiation was found. Further tests on the models for calculation of the <b>F</b> <b>ratio</b> proposed by Brenner and Sachs (Radiat.

40|$|N uptake data {{obtained}} from 15 N tracer techniques were surveyed in surface waters of the Subantarctic and Polar Frontal Zones southwest of Tasmania during summer 1998. The N flux rates and <b>f</b> <b>ratio</b> were computed using inverse modeling. The approach provides a general framework for the handling of random and systematic variations. Furthermore, factorial experiments based on controlled ammonium additions were used to study {{the sensitivity of the}} <b>f</b> <b>ratio</b> relative to perturbations of the regenerated nutrient supply. This was achieved in distinct regions: the Subtropical Convergence Zone, the Subantarctic Zone, the Subantarctic Front, and the Polar Frontal Zone. Overall, the stability of the <b>f</b> <b>ratio</b> appeared closely related to the availability of both dissolved iron and ammonium. The effect of one factor depended on the level of the other one, and the interaction influenced the <b>f</b> <b>ratio</b> patterns. The relationship between <b>f</b> <b>ratio</b> and ammonium supplementation ranged from linear to convex curves, with the steepest slopes in water masses rich in dissolved iron and with low ammonium content. The magnitude of this variation may have important ecological and geochemical consequences. Our results suggest that only versatile systems are able to exhibit events of high new production...|$|R
