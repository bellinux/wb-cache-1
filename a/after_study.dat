Rosolie knows this. Discovery knows this. Yet they chose to contrive and air this shameful stunt for ratings anyway." [...] In a statement following the broadcast, Discovery Channel re-affirmed that the safety of Rosolie and the anaconda were a top priority, and that he [...] "created this challenge to get maximum attention {{for one of the most}} beautiful and threatened parts of the world, the Amazon Rainforest and its wildlife. He went to great lengths to send this message and it was his absolute intention to be eaten alive." ...|$|E

Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic praised the song and called it an [...] "album-closing ode to joy", further stating the track [...] "uses its star's distinctive voice for moments of multi-tracked beauty or play; often there's a lovely sensation of floating upwards." [...] As the album's closing track, Nicholaus James Jodlowski of Reporter appreciated the [...] "vulnerable side of Stefani" [...] and noted how it slows the album's pace down. However, Chuck Campbell of Go Knoxville gave the song a negative review, describing Stefani's vocals as [...] "a pale facsimile of Ariana Grande".|$|E

[...] The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization [...] "relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence", was [...] "imposing its own narrow values and morality {{on the rest of the}} country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view", and did not reply to the ESRB's request for comments following its report card in 2004.

2500|$|Water {{bodies that}} do not meet {{applicable}} water quality standards with technology-based controls alone are placed on the section 303(d) list of water bodies not meeting standards.

A TMDL is a calculation of {{the maximum amount of}} a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet WQS. [...] The TMDL is determined <b>after</b> <b>study</b> of the specific properties of the water body and the pollutant sources that contribute to the non-compliant status. Generally, the TMDL determines load based on a Waste Load Allocation (WLA), Load Allocation (LA), and Margin of Safety (MOS) [...] Once the TMDL assessment is completed and the maximum pollutant loading capacity defined, an implementation plan is developed that outlines the measures needed to reduce pollutant loading to the non-compliant water body, and bring it into compliance. [...] Over 60,000 TMDLs are proposed or in development for U.S. waters in the next decade and a half.|$|E
