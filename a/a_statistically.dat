5|$|FSU quarterback Drew Weatherford {{recorded}} <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> impressive {{year and}} was the top freshman quarterback {{in the nation in}} terms of passing yardage and passing touchdowns. Wide receivers Willie Reid, Greg Carr and Chris Davis were the primary beneficiaries of Weatherford's passing offense during the 2005 season. Carr, a freshman, caught 27passes for 593yards and a conference-leading ninetouchdowns. Davis, a junior, caught more passes and recorded more receiving yards during the 2005season than he had in both his previous seasons combined. Reid, the lone senior starting in the Florida State corps of wide receivers, played in a variety of positions on offense and held the Seminoles' team record for most punt return yardage.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of violent criminals), the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E

5|$|The National Academy of Sciences {{questioned}} Neel's procedure {{which did}} not filter the Kure population for possible radiation exposure. Overall, while <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> insignificant increase in birth defects occurred directly after the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Neel and others noted that in approximately 50 humans who were of an early gestational age {{at the time of}} the bombing and who were all within about 1km from the hypocenter, an increase in microencephaly and anencephaly was observed upon birth, with the incidence of these two particular malformations being nearly 3 times what was to be expected when compared to the control group in Kure.|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} showed <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> {{significant difference}} in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E

In contrast, no significant mortality reduction was observed with ARB treatment (HR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94–1.04; P=0.683). Analysis of mortality reduction by different ACE inhibitors showed that perindopril-based regimens are associated with <b>a</b> <b>statistically</b> significant 13% all-cause mortality reduction.|$|E

These differences in treatment were associated with <b>an</b> almost <b>statistically</b> significant (p = 0.067), 20 % relative reduction in mortality in addition to <b>a</b> strong <b>statistically</b> significant reduction in morbidity (duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, p = 0.006).|$|R
