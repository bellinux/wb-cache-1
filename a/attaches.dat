5000|$|The drawbar {{system was}} {{virtually}} the exclusive method of <b>attaching</b> implements (other than direct {{attachment to the}} tractor) before Harry Ferguson developed the three-point hitch. Equipment <b>attached</b> to the three-point hitch can be raised or lowered hydraulically with a control lever. The equipment <b>attached</b> to the three-point hitch is usually completely supported by the tractor. Another way to <b>attach</b> an implement is via a quick hitch, which is <b>attached</b> to the three-point hitch. This enables a single person to <b>attach</b> an implement quicker and put the person in less danger when <b>attaching</b> the implement.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this {{research}} is to assess whether performance on remembering faces with <b>attached</b> positive information and faces with <b>attached</b> negative information was enhanced when compared to faces with <b>attached</b> neutral information, or the control of faces with <b>attached</b> names only. It was hypothesised that likeability score would significantly differ for faces with <b>attached</b> positive information and <b>attached</b> negating information, an effect that was found in this research. In total, five measure of memory were used to assess the effect of <b>attached</b> social information on memory for faces- time taken to complete match pair grids, time taken between clicks on match pair grids, distance error on match pair grids, correct assisted name recall, correct assisted <b>attached</b> information recall and correct assisted type of <b>attached</b> information recall. Three conditions were used (positive/neutral <b>attached</b> information, negative/neutral <b>attached</b> information and control condition) to measure the effect of mate relevant information on memory test scores. For the three match pair measures, no significant effect of <b>attached</b> mate relevant information was found. Non-significant results were found for correct assisted name recall and correct assisted type of <b>attached</b> information, however for correct recall for <b>attached</b> information, a significant effect was found, suggesting that source memory of information can enhance subsequent memory for faces. Implications of research and future directions are discussed...|$|R
5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and <b>attaches</b> the sublingua to the underside of the tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with keratin. The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, <b>attaches</b> the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia's {{foreign policy}} is officially based on the {{principle}} of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their political system. The government <b>attaches</b> a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations with other countries in the region. Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states. A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} forms of {{assimilation}} are still at work today. For example, when a central authority nationalizes one language, that <b>attaches</b> economic and social advantages to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a separate and distinct ethnic group.|$|E

It comes in five colors of both polyurethane and the more expensive leather.|$|E

40|$|The general {{assumption}} {{has been}} that male batterers from clinical samples were mostly insecurely <b>attached</b> as compared to non-batterers. Recently, a large group was found (39. 4 % of batterers in a clinical sample) whose main attachment style was secure. No previous studies have examined specifically the securely <b>attached</b> batterer. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test whether antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), but not borderline personality disorder (BPD), traits may be related to battering among securely <b>attached</b> individuals. Twenty-seven securely <b>attached</b> batterers, 45 insecurely <b>attached</b> batterers, 40 securely <b>attached</b> controls, and 22 insecurely <b>attached</b> controls who lived in the Netherlands, filled in self-report measures of personality disorder traits (i. e., antisocial, narcissism, borderline) and attachment (i. e., avoidant and anxious). Results showed that ASPD traits explained 19 % of the variance of battering in securely <b>attached</b> individuals. NPD and BPD traits are related to battering among securely <b>attached</b> individuals when NPD and BPD traits were entered alone in the equation...|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} {{surfaces of}} the arms are covered with circular, adhesive suckers. The suckers allow the octopus to anchor itself or to manipulate objects. Each sucker is usually circular and bowl-like and has two distinct parts: an outer shallow cavity called an infundibulum and a central hollow cavity called an acetabulum, {{both of which are}} thick muscles covered in a protective chitinous cuticle. When a sucker <b>attaches</b> to a surface, the orifice between the two structures is sealed. The infundibulum provides adhesion while the acetabulum remains free, and muscle contractions allow for attachment and detachment.|$|E
5|$|The {{proboscis}} is an infolding of {{the body}} wall, and sits in the rhynchocoel when inactive. When muscles in {{the wall of the}} rhynchocoel compress the fluid in the rhynchocoel, the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside-out to attack the animal's prey along a canal called the rhynchodeum and through an orifice, the proboscis pore. The proboscis has a muscle which <b>attaches</b> {{to the back of the}} rhynchocoel, and which can stretch up to 30 times its inactive length and then retract the proboscis.|$|E
5|$|The unusual genus, Entovalva, is endosymbiotic, {{being found}} only in the {{oesophagus}} of sea cucumbers. It has mantle folds that completely surround its small valves.
