25|$|The global {{conservation}} status of velvet worm species {{is difficult to}} estimate; many species are only known to exist at their type locality (the location at which they were first observed and described). The collection of reliable data is also hindered by low population densities, their typically nocturnal behaviour and possibly also as-yet undocumented seasonal influences and sexual dimorphism. To date, the only onychophorans evaluated by the IUCN are: Mesoperipatus tholloni (Data Deficient), Plicatoperipatus jamaicensis (Near Threatened), Peripatoides indigo (Vulnerable), Peripatoides suteri (Vulnerable), Peripatopsis alba (Vulnerable), Peripatopsis clavigera (Vulnerable), Macroperipatus insularis (Endangered), Tasmanipatus <b>anophthalmus</b> (Endangered), Opisthopatus roseus (Critically Endangered), Peripatopsis leonina (Critically Endangered), and Speleoperipatus spelaeus (Critically Endangered). The primary threat comes from destruction and fragmentation of velvet worm habitat due to industrialisation, draining of wetlands, and slash-and-burn agriculture. Many species also have naturally low population densities and closely restricted geographic ranges; as a result, relatively small localised disturbances of important ecosystems {{can lead to the}} extinction of entire populations or species. Collection of specimens for universities or research institutes also plays a role on a local scale. There is a very pronounced difference in the protection afforded to velvet worms between regions: in some countries, such as South Africa, there are restrictions on both collecting and exporting, while in others, such as Australia, only export restrictions exist. Many countries offer no specific safeguards at all. Tasmania has a protection programme that is unique worldwide: one region of forest has its own velvet worm conservation plan, which is tailored to a particular velvet worm species.|$|E

Populations were collected from several caves and wells belonging to different drainage systems in the Karst areas of NE Italy. Results suggest the existence of two sympatric, genetically distinct, biological species (provisionally indicated as species A and B in the T. <b>anophthalmus</b> complex) in the samples collected at the Duino Well, Sagrado and Comarie caves (Nei’s `D= 0. 209).

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a secondary terrestrial lifestyle in diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae) has never been analysed in a phylogenetic framework before. Here we study Terradessus caecus Watts, a terrestrial species of the subfamily Hydroporinae endemic to Australia. We infer its phylogenetic placement using Bayesian inference and maximum-likelihood methods based on a multilocus molecular dataset. We also investigate the divergence time estimates of this lineage using a Bayesian relaxed clock approach. Finally, we infer ancestral ecological preferences using a likelihood approach. We recover T. caecus nested in the genus Paroster Sharp with strong support. Therefore, we establish a synonymy for both species of Terradessus with Paroster: Paroster caecus (Watts) n. comb. and Paroster <b>anophthalmus</b> (Brancucci & Monteith) n. comb. Paroster is an endemic Australian genus that has a remarkable number of subterranean species in underground aquifers with highly derived morphologies. Our results highlight {{one of the most}} remarkable radiations of aquatic beetles with independent ecological pathways likely linked to palaeoclimatic disruptions in the Neogene. Paroster caecus (Watts) n. comb. originated from a mid-Miocene split following the onset of an aridification episode that has been ongoing to the present day. The deep changes in ecological communities in association with the drying-out of palaeodrainage systems might have pushed this lineage to colonize a new niche in terrestrial habitats...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Alpine region {{harbours}} one of {{the most}} diverse subterranean faunas in the world, with many species showing extreme morphological modifications. The ground beetles of tribe Trechini (Coleoptera, Carabidae) are among the best studied and widespread groups with abundance of troglobionts, but their origin and evolution is largely unknown. Results: We sequenced 3. 4 Kb of mitochondrial (cox 1, rrnL, trnL, nad 1) and nuclear (SSU, LSU) genes of 207 specimens of 173 mostly Alpine species, including examples of all subterranean genera but two plus a representation of epigean taxa. We applied Bayesian methods and maximum likelihood to reconstruct the topology and to estimate divergence times using a priori rates obtained for a related ground beetle genus. We found three main clades of late Eocene-early Oligocene origin: (1) the genus Doderotrechus and relatives; (2) the genus Trechus sensu lato, with most anisotopic subterranean genera, including the Pyrenean lineage and taxa from the Dinaric Alps; and (3) the genus Duvalius sensu lato, diversifying during the late Miocene and including all subterranean isotopic taxa. Most of the subterranean genera had an independent origin and were related to epigean taxa of the same geographical area, but there were three large monophyletic clades of exclusively subterranean species: the Pyrenean lineage, a lineage including subterranean taxa from the eastern Alps and the Dinarides, and the genus <b>Anophthalmus</b> from the northeastern Alps. Many lineages have developed similar phenotypes independently, showing extensive morphological convergence or parallelism. Conclusions: The Alpine Trechini do not form a homogeneous fauna, in contrast with the Pyrenees, and show a complex scenario of multiple colonisations of the subterranean environment at different geological periods and through different processes. Examples go from populations of an epigean widespread species going underground with little morphological modifications to ancient, geographically widespread lineages of exclusively subterranean species likely to have diversified once fully adapted to the subterranean environment.

40|$|A {{synthesis}} of the Carabid fauna of the Central and Eastern Alps and Pre-Alps, from a biogeographical point of view, is presented. Only the Italian side of the Alpine chain is considered, from the basin of the Toce river to the Trieste and Gorizia Karst. Main features of the landscape are: 1. an ancient orogenetic history and evolution, that made this area available to the colonization by carabids, of both gondwanaland and laurasian lineages, since the lower Tertiary; 2. a marked geological and geo-morphological complexity, with highest elevation at Pizzo Bernina m 4. 049; 3. {{the presence of a}} very developed, dolomitic-calcareous and markedly carsified prealpine belt, rich of deep and large hypogean systems (also at high altitude), which makes this area highly different, from the geo-morphological point of view, from the Western Alps; 4. the geographic position, as a mountain chain of some 750 kms between central Europe and the Padanian plain, connected with the Caravanche and the Dinaric chain and close to the Adriatic sea in me Eastern part; 5. finally, a puzzled climate situation, that includes xero-thermic areas (500 - 700 mm of rain per year, also in some intra-alpine sectors), close to highly rainy areas - more than 2. 500 mm per year - in the westernmost and easternmost parts of the chain. Thus, like in the Western Alps, sub-mediterranean vegetation types, dose to cool-moist forests, coexist with high-altitude environments above the timber line. These facts explain the heterogeneity, the richness, the variety, and the interest of the carabid fauna of the area: the highest number of species (658) ascertained so far, i. e. 112 of the whole Italian carabid fauna and about 115 of the carabid fauna cited so far for the Europe in politic sense, fi·om me Canary islands to the Urals; the high number of euri- or stenoendemites (204, i. e. abour 31 % of the species, 3 / 5 of which concentrated in the pre-alpine belt), and the complex origins and/or affinities of different taxa. A large number of species (174, i. e. 26 %) belongs to European chorotypes (European, South-European or typically Alpine), and even more (255, i. e. 38 %) to Holarctic (Holarctic, Palaearccic, West-Palaearctic, Asiatic-European, Siberian-European, Central-Asiatic-European, Central-Asiatic-European-Mediterrancan, Turanic-European, Turanic-EuropeanMediterranean, European-Mediterranean) chorotypes. This darum confirms the well known role, both of connection and separation, that the Alps as a whole played between Europe and the Mediterranean area. Furthermore, it is to be recalled the presence, in some localities of the Eastern Alps, of micro thermophilous, boreal species, like Miscodera arctica, now widespread in Northern regions of the Holarctic Region. Many orophilous, forest-dwelling, riparian and hygrophilolls species, are of northern, north-eastern, ruranic or dinaric-balkanian origin. A very small, bur interesting group of thermophilous elements (mostly Harpalini), originally from the Mediterranean area or temperate steppes, during the hypsothermic periods of the Pleistocene and Olocene, reached the Central and Eastern Alps and Pre-Alps, and persist in xerothermlc biotopes. Some of these could increase their range of distribution as a consequence human activities in agricultural use overgrazing and deforestation. Some others, like Carabus montivagus and Laemostenus algerinus, seem to be present owing to very recent anthropogenic introduction. From the biogeograpic point of view, however the most important group of species is represented by the impressive number of endemics (204, of which 116 species restricted to politic Italy), either eurendemics to Central and Eastern Alps and Pre-Alps, or stenoendemics to single sectors of the area or to very small biotopes (caves, isolated montane massifs) : among these, we may cite some large-sized species like Cychrus cylindricollis, endemic at high altitude, to the Central Pre-Alps, several montane, very localized Trechus species, many subterranean, highly specialized Trechini of the peculiar genera Boldoriella, Orotrechus, <b>Anophthalmus,</b> Allegrettia, Italaphaenops, Lessinodytes: many Pterostlchini, and others, Most of them must be considered as pre-Quaternarian elements, With affinltl,es either til Gondwana (such as the blind Reicheina of the genus Alpiodytes), or in the Angarian (as the Broscosoma species) areas, They are, the result of an ancient, subtropical or temperate forest dweller Carabid fauna, tied now to soil: forest littter, superficlal subterranean environment, caves, and upper montane refugia, Both from floristic and faunistic informatlon, It IS a well known fact that the pre-alpine belt as a whole represents a large, unique Pleistocene refugium, that shows a scenario of marked isolation and speciation in mountains, valleys and hypogean compartments. The analysis of the entire Carabid fauna in the Central and Eastern Alps and Pre-Alps shows that the present composition and complexity is the result both of ancient clado-vicariance events and of recellt, ecological factors, These facts surprisingly make this area (not only concerning carabids) very close to important towns and {{to one of the most}} populated, cultivated and industrialized area of Italy (the Padanian plain), and in spite of its relatively small surface, one of the most important hot spar of biodiversity in Europe, in which many biotopes are presently highly endangered, or in some cases completely destroyed, A checklist of the Carabid species of the Central and Eastern Alps and Pre-Alps, with their chororypes, is added...|$|E
