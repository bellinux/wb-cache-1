5|$|The left <b>atrium</b> {{receives}} oxygenated blood {{back from}} the lungs via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. The left <b>atrium</b> has an outpouching called the left atrial appendage. Like the right <b>atrium,</b> the left <b>atrium</b> is lined by pectinate muscles. The left <b>atrium</b> is connected to the left ventricle by the mitral valve.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right <b>atrium</b> to the left <b>atrium,</b> allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right <b>atrium</b> remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
5|$|The avian {{circulatory system}} {{is driven by}} a four-chambered, myogenic heart {{contained}} in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an <b>atrium</b> and ventricle. The <b>atrium</b> and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right <b>atrium.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{coronary}} sinus {{is a large}} vein that drains {{into the}} right <b>atrium,</b> and receives most of the venous drainage of the heart. It receives blood from the great cardiac vein (receiving the left <b>atrium</b> and both ventricles), the posterior cardiac vein (draining {{the back of the}} left ventricle), the middle cardiac vein (draining the bottom of the left and right ventricles), and small cardiac veins. The anterior cardiac veins drain the front of the right ventricle and drain directly into the right <b>atrium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The right <b>atrium</b> {{receives}} blood almost continuously {{from the}} body's two major veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. A {{small amount of}} blood from the coronary circulation also drains into the right <b>atrium</b> via the coronary sinus, which is immediately above and {{to the middle of}} the opening of the inferior vena cava. In the wall of the right <b>atrium</b> is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. Most of the internal surface of the right <b>atrium</b> is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of pectinate muscles, which are also present in the right atrial appendage.|$|E
5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects {{in the right}} and left <b>atrium</b> continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right <b>atrium.</b> The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the <b>atrium</b> below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right <b>atrium.</b> The blood collects in the right <b>atrium.</b> When the right <b>atrium</b> contracts, the blood is pumped through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right <b>atrium</b> near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right <b>atrium</b> in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left <b>atrium</b> via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right <b>atrium</b> in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right <b>atrium</b> and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{floor of}} the <b>atrium</b> of the Molecular and Chemical Sciences Building at the University of Western Australia is tiled with Penrose tiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right <b>atrium</b> called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left <b>atrium,</b> the left atrial appendage. The right <b>atrium</b> and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left <b>atrium</b> and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E
50|$|Leading up to 2017 a {{redevelopment}} {{was proposed}} where three new buildings would be connected through piazzas and <b>atriums,</b> replacing {{the parking lot}} with underground parking. The proposal is still in discussion.|$|R
50|$|Citygate Outlets {{has made}} {{extensive}} use of glass and natural light. The mall features two sky-lit <b>atriums,</b> located at {{the northern and southern}} ends of the complex. These two <b>atriums</b> are connected to one another by walkways. The mall comprises five storeys, two of which are basement levels. There is a large restaurant-in-restaurant called foodrepublic on the mall’s topmost level. Unusually for Hong Kong, Citygate Outlets includes a large open-air piazza called The Square. Asia’s largest outdoor kinetic fountain is located here, and the space is often used for artistic performances, open-air exhibitions and special events.|$|R

5|$|The {{rectangular}} narthex {{constitutes the}} middle {{part of the}} building, between the <b>atrium</b> and the cella, and serves as {{the lobby of the}} church. It lies directly east of the <b>atrium,</b> through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} {{to the creation of the}} <b>atriums</b> in the historical centre of Saint-Petersburg for improving the quality of courtyards. Since 19 century Saint-Petersburg was built mostly with brick buildings along the perimeter of allotments with founding one or several courtyards. “Well-like” courtyards of historical buildings of Saint-Petersburg have typically a lack of illumination and insolation, are badly ventilated and are often transformed into parking lots for inhabitants. Possibility of glassing of “well-like” courtyards is analyzed from the viewpoint of historical buildings protection regulation of Saint-Petersburg and norms of insolation and illumination of the dwelling buildings, basing on the actual experience in the creation of <b>atriums</b> in Saint-Petersburg...|$|R
5000|$|Container {{gardening}} {{is concerned}} with growing plants in any type of container either indoors or outdoors. Common containers are pots, hanging baskets, and planters. Container gardening is usually used in <b>atriums</b> and on balconies, patios, and roof tops.|$|R
5|$|The second {{piece of}} art is Jonathan Borofsky's Humanity in Motion. Located in the glass <b>atrium</b> of the winter garden, Humanity in Motion shows ten life-size human figures walking across ten {{horizontal}} poles positioned {{at different levels of}} the <b>atrium.</b> At ground level, looking up at the stainless steel figures, are two more figures shaped to look like a father and son.|$|E
5|$|The {{shopping}} {{levels in}} the Clal Building are exceptionally large, with space for stores and a cinema. Stores are situated {{around the perimeter of}} a large, central <b>atrium.</b> Originally the <b>atrium</b> was open-air, but weather damage forced planners to install a semi-transparent roof. Several banks of elevators access upper-floor offices.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the <b>atrium,</b> which is a large muscular chamber. The <b>atrium</b> serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E

50|$|Belden Village {{underwent}} a minor facelift in 1989. The food court was adorned in pastel colored flags {{hanging from the}} ceiling, along with updates to tenant signage. Major entrances were refreshed with glass <b>atriums.</b> The Kaufmann's store was renamed Macy's on September 9, 2006.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the floor}} plans include <b>atriums,</b> with other {{features}} like large floor to ceiling glass windows, post and beam construction (beams originally painted in Rhodda’s Oxford Brown), vaulted ceilings in some models, galley kitchens with Thermadore stainless ovens and cooktops, radiant heat floors, and Roman baths.|$|R
5|$|In humans, other mammals, and birds, {{the heart}} is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria; and lower left and right {{ventricle}}s. Commonly the right <b>atrium</b> and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an <b>atrium</b> and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains {{a small amount of}} fluid. The wall of {{the heart is}} made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church {{includes}} three sections: the wide <b>atrium</b> (or courtyard), the narthex and the cella (also naos or, {{due to its}} shape, rotunda), each serving as a premise to the other. The sections were not necessarily built at the same time, and it is generally accepted that a reconstruction of the church was carried out some time after its completion. Mavrodinov and archaeologist Karel Škorpil believe the narthex and cella comprised the first building period, while the <b>atrium</b> was added very shortly after that and by the same architect.|$|E
5|$|The SA node {{is found}} in all amniotes but not in more {{primitive}} vertebrates. In these animals, {{the muscles of the}} heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Indeed, since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right <b>atrium</b> in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the <b>atrium.</b> The rate of heartbeat varies enormously between different species, ranging from around 20 beats per minute in codfish to around 600 in hummingbirds and up to 1200 bpm in the ruby-throated hummingbird.|$|E
50|$|While {{not part}} of the BJCC, the Lipa Green Centre for Jewish Community Services shared the same {{property}} but was a separate building. The redevelopment plans call for all buildings to be connected by bridges and <b>atriums</b> with the Lipa Green Centre itself having just undergone a major renovation.|$|R
50|$|With the {{oil boom}} in 1973, Saudi Arabia {{provided}} {{a majority of}} commissions for El-Wakil. He undertook {{the design of a}} number of grand mansions developing a design approach of internalised spaces of <b>atriums,</b> patios and courtyards, which appeared unfamiliar to the prevailing trend of extrovert villa type houses.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} built {{at a large}} cost to the Weber County School District. Every {{effort was made to}} make Bonneville reflect the latest in {{technology}} and culture.
