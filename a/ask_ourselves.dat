500|$|Like all {{the other}} tracks, album opener [...] "Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)" [...] borrows from [...] "preaching, {{shouting}} and ranting". The expression [...] "And the Heat Goes On", used in the title and repeated in the chorus, {{is based on a}} New York Post headline Eno read in the summer of 1980 whilst Byrne rewrote the song title [...] "Don't Worry About the Government" [...] from TalkingHeads' debut album, , into the lyric [...] "Look {{at the hands of a}} government man". [...] The [...] "rhythmical rant" [...] in [...] "Crosseyed and Painless"—"Facts are simple and facts are straight. Facts are lazy and facts are late."—is influenced by old school rap, specifically Kurtis Blow's [...] "The Breaks" [...] given to Byrne by Frantz. [...] "Once in a Lifetime" [...] borrows heavily from preachers' diatribes. Some critics have suggested that the song is [...] "a kind of prescient jab at the excesses of the 1980s". Byrne disagreed with the categorisation and commented that its lyrics are meant to be taken literally; he stated, [...] "We're largely unconscious. You know, we operate half awake or on autopilot and end up, whatever, with a house and family and job and everything else, and we haven't really stopped to <b>ask</b> <b>ourselves,</b> 'How did I get here?'." ...|$|E

They encouraged local people {{to aid the}} police in locating the perpetrators of the attack, which they asserted was an affront to Jamaica's democracy. J-FLAG's director Dane Lewis later commented that despite an increase in homophobic violence, Jamaican society was becoming more tolerant toward LGBT people; he attributed this to the actions of individuals like Jones, who have helped improve the public visibility of LGBT people in Jamaican society. Another LGBT rights organisation, Quality of Citizenship Jamaica, issued a press release calling {{for the government and}} churches to engage with LGBT organisations to establish common ground which could be undergirded by the principle of [...] "true respect for all," [...] found in the nation's National Anthem. Human rights organisation Jamaicans for Justice called on Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and religious leaders to condemn the murder, also commenting on what they saw as a lack of media coverage and public outrage about the incident, adding that [...] "we must <b>ask</b> <b>ourselves</b> what this says about us as a people." ...|$|E

2500|$|National {{security}} reporter Spencer Ackerman {{said the}} film [...] "does not present torture as a silver bullet {{that led to}} bin Laden; it presents torture as the ignorant alternative to that silver bullet". Critic Glenn Kenny said that he [...] "saw a movie that subverted a lot of expectations concerning viewer identification and empathy" [...] and that [...] "rather than endorsing the barbarity, the picture makes the viewer in a sense complicit with it", which is [...] " [...] whole other can of worms". Writer Andrew Sullivan said, [...] "the movie is not an apology for torture, as so many have said, and as I have worried about. It is an exposure of torture. It removes any doubt that war criminals ran this country for seven years". Filmmaker Michael Moore similarly said, [...] "I left the movie thinking it made an incredible statement against torture", and noted that the film showed the abject brutality of torture. Critic Andrew O'Hehir said that the filmmaker's position on torture in the film is ambiguous, and creative choices were made and the film poses [...] "excellent questions for us to <b>ask</b> <b>ourselves,</b> arguably defining questions of the age, and I think the longer {{you look at them}} the thornier they get".|$|E

It would have left {{the military}} in the miserable position of having to control those demonstrations by force. The cry from the crowd was they wanted new elections … to help decide the country's future, which has been so troubled. The military was faced with, genuinely overheated situation … It isn’t a coup in any classic sense and, yet, the military played a role in upsetting the government. We have to <b>ask</b> <b>ourselves,</b> then, finally, what are the interests of the United States? And here the president wisely has waiver authority and has to make a judgment. Egypt is the largest and most influential country in the Middle East. Egypt is central to peace with Israel. Egypt's fate will influence the course of politics elsewhere in the region. So we want to be very, very careful before we go out and condemn an event that has, by the most recent polling of Egypt's best pollsters, 80 percent support in the population. What is clear is the wave of anger against the government that drove Morsi from power, enjoyed massive, massive public support in the many, many millions of Egyptians.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction.

[...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids.
