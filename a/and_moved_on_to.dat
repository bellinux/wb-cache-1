5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1346, Kantakouzenos stood {{on the verge of}} victory. He left Thrace under the control of his son Matthew <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Selymbria, close to Constantinople. He did not attack the capital, but waited for almost a year for the city to surrender. In his memoirs, he {{explains}} {{that he did not want}} to turn his Turks on the city, although contemporaries such as Gregoras accused him of indecision and of needlessly prolonging the war.|$|E

With a time of 20.25, he ranked fourth out of seven in his heat, {{defeating}} Devonish; Mauritius' Stephan Buckland; and Antigua and Barbuda's Brendan Christian.

5|$|The region around Brough {{continued}} to be disputed between the kings of England and Scotland; in 1173, William the Lion of Scotland invaded {{as part of the}} Great Revolt against the rule of Henry II. William's army struck south but failed to take Wark <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> attack Carlisle instead; when that failed too, they successfully took Appleby before turning their attention to Brough.|$|E
5|$|A {{long period}} of waiting and {{training}} followed. Throughout 1943–1944, the division was re-organised under the jungle divisional establishment. This saw {{a reduction in the}} division's artillery, vehicles, equipment and manning, with divisional strength falling from around 18,000 men to about 16,000. The division also lost many of its experienced personnel during this time as they were promoted <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> other formations; although it also received reinforcements from the disbanded 30th Brigade. The division's next deployment would not come until November 1944 when they were committed to the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Once again they would be unified as a full division, with several units that had previously been detached, including the 2/3rd Field Regiment and the 19th Brigade, rejoining the division.|$|E
5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E

The fleet left from Hampton Roads, passed by Trinidad and Rio de Janeiro, and then {{passed through the}} Straits of Magellan. From there she passed by {{the west coast of}} South America, visiting Punta Arenas and Valparaíso, Chile, Callao, Peru, and Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet reached San Diego on 14 April 1908 <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> San Francisco on 6 May. Two months later the {{warships}} sailed for Honolulu, Hawaii, and from there to Auckland, New Zealand, arriving 9 August.

5|$|Graysmith {{first met}} Fischer and Vanderbilt at {{the premiere of}} Paul Schrader's film, Auto Focus, {{which was based on}} Graysmith's 1991 book about {{the life and death of}} actor Bob Crane. A deal was made and they optioned the rights to Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked when they became {{available}} after languishing at another studio for nearly a decade. David Fincher was their first choice to direct based on his work on Seven. Originally, he was going to direct an adaptation of James Ellroy's novel, The Black Dahlia (later filmed by Brian De Palma), and envisioned a five-hour, $80 million mini-series with film stars. When that fell through, Fincher left that project <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Zodiac.|$|E
5|$|He {{signed for}} Notts County in July 2009, {{and was named}} on the PFA Team of the Year after scoring 30 league goals as the club won the League Two title in 2009–10.

He also won five caps for England at under-20 and under-21 levels. He left the club in 2001 and joined Cambridge United for a short period, after which he joined Hartlepool United. He joined Port Vale on loan in 2006. He left Hartlepool in July 2013, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Chesterfield. Whilst at Chesterfield in 2014 he {{appeared}} at Wembley Stadium in {{the final of the}} Football League Trophy and helped the club to the League Two title in 2013–14.

5|$|I. C. Filitti {{studied at}} Saint Sava National College, {{where he was}} colleagues with future {{politician}} (and adversary) Ion G. Duca. He was an eminent student, who earned top distinctions annually, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> study at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris. His first ever published work as a historian was a French-language tome, Le Rôle diplomatique des phanariotes de 1700 à 1821 ("The Diplomatic Role of Phanariotes from 1700 to 1821"). Signed Jean C. Filitti, it was probably his Licence ès Lettres, and, although receiving good reviews, was never listed by its author in his official résumés. He became a Doctor of Law in 1904, when he published {{the first draft of}} his study about Regulamentul Organic as the first ever Romanian constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 Havelock {{took his}} first {{academic}} job at Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Canada. He married Ellen Parkinson in 1927, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Victoria College at the University of Toronto in 1929. Havelock's scholarly work during this period focused on Latin poetry, particularly Catullus, far from the early Greek philosophy he had worked on at Cambridge. While in Canada Havelock became increasingly involved in politics. With his fellow academics Frank Underhill and Eugene Forsey, Havelock was a cofounder of the League for Social Reconstruction, an organisation of politically active socialist intellectuals. He and Underhill were also the most outspoken {{of a group of}} dissident faculty members at the University.|$|E

5|$|Marble Madness was commercially {{successful}} {{following its}} December 1984 release and was positively received by critics. Around 4,000cabinets were sold, and {{it soon became}} the highest-earning game in arcades. However, the game consistently fell from this ranking during its seventh week in arcades that Atari tracked the game's success. Cerny attributed the six-week arcade life to Marble Madnesss short gameplay length. He believed that players lost interest after mastering it <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> other games. The arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare. Stan Szczepanski holds the official world record of 187,880 points.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{sent the}} invading Iraqi forces into {{neighboring}} Kuwait, a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq {{as part of}} its territory. This invasion sparked the initiation of the Persian Gulf War and it brought worldwide condemnation. An estimated 140,000 Iraqi troops quickly took control of Kuwait City <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the Saudi Arabia/Kuwait border. The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the U.S. Central Command, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf, because of its important petroleum reserves.|$|E
5|$|Transferred to {{the command}} of the Marshal de Richelieu, he served {{for a while in}} the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. He fought at Lutzenburg in October 1758, where he took 400 prisoners, <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> take the {{strategic}} castle of Spangenberg. Although it was heavily fortified, he took the garrison by surprise on 9 November. Finding that the drawbridge was down, his troops took the garrison prisoner and seized their armoury, including 18 cannon, 307 guns and 44 barrels of powder. He returned to Flanders in May 1759 and was appointed to command French forces in Picardy in 1760.|$|E

50|$|The School of Infantry (SOI) is {{the second}} stage of initial {{military}} training for enlisted United States Marines after Recruit Training. Since the initial training pipeline is divided between coasts, Marines from areas east of the Mississippi River usually graduate from MCRD Parris Island <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> SOI at SOI East (located at Camp Geiger, a satellite facility of Camp Lejeune in North Carolina), while those from the western half of the nation attend MCRD San Diego <b>and</b> <b>move</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> SOI West at the Camp San Onofre area of Camp Pendleton in California. Female Marines are an exception, all of whom go through MCRD Parris Island and SOI East.|$|R
5|$|Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh soon proved {{incapable}} of restoring {{order to the}} increasingly turbulent province. By 935, the troops were rioting over lack of pay, and Bedouin raids had recommenced. At the same time, Takin's son Muhammad and the fiscal administrator Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Ali al-Madhara'i—the heir of a dynasty of bureaucrats that had handled the province's finances {{since the time of}} Ibn Tulun and amassed enormous wealth—undermined Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh and coveted his position. Infighting broke out among the troops between the Easterners (Mashariqa), chiefly Turkish soldiers, who supported Muhammad ibn Takin, and the Westerners (Maghariba), probably Berbers and Black Africans, who backed Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh. With the support this time of the former vizier and inspector-general of the western provinces al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat, whose son was married to one of Ibn Tughj's daughters, Ibn Tughj was once more named the governor of Egypt. Taking no chances, Ibn Tughj organized an invasion of the country by land and sea. Although Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh was able to delay the advance of the army, Ibn Tughj's fleet took Tinnis and the Nile Delta <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the capital Fustat. Outmanoeuvred and defeated in battle, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh fled to the Fatimids. The victorious Muhammad ibn Tughj entered Fustat on 26 August 935.|$|E
5|$|In 1400 {{a revolt}} {{broke out in}} North Wales against English rule, led by Owain Glyndŵr. By 1403 {{only a handful of}} castles, {{including}} Harlech, still stood against the rebels, but the castle was under-equipped and under-staffed to withstand a siege, the garrison having just three shields, eight helmets, six lances, ten pairs of gloves, and four guns. At the end of 1404, the castle fell to Glyndŵr. Harlech became his residence, family home and military headquarters for four years; he held his second parliament in Harlech in August 1405. In 1408 English forces under the command of the future Henry V placed Harlech and its commander, Edmund Mortimer, under siege, conducting a bombardment with cannon, probably destroying the south and east parts of the outer walls. When this failed to take the castle, Henry left John Talbot in charge of the siege <b>and</b> <b>moved</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> deal with Aberystwyth Castle. Supplies finally ran short, Mortimer and many of his men died of exhaustion, and Harlech fell in February 1409.|$|E
