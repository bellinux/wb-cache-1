5|$|Sir John Carling, Tory MP for London, gave three {{events to}} explain the {{development}} of London in a 1901 speech. They were: {{the location of the}} court and administration in London in 1826; the arrival of the military garrison in 1838; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the railway in 1853.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century saw further {{expansion}} of the city, {{the growth of the}} University of Bristol <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the aircraft industry. During World War II, the city centre was extensively bombed in the Bristol Blitz. The redevelopment of shopping centres, office buildings, and the harbourside continues to this day.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a geomagnetic reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E

5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> {{of hundreds of thousands}} of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer and {{in the autumn of}} 1296, between the death of Bishop William Fraser <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the new Bishop of St Andrews William de Lamberton, Nicholas was placed in charge of the diocese of St Andrews as Official. Nicholas {{thereafter}} can be found exercising a senior role in Scottish affairs, and by early 1301 he was Chancellor of Scotland. In his late 60s or (more probably) his 70s by this stage, Nicholas was an extremely old man, yet in 1307 he became Bishop of Dunblane. He held this position until his death in either 1319 or 1320.|$|E
5|$|Jack is livid {{when his}} mother, Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch), visits {{him when she}} is in town to attend his ex-wife Bianca's (Isabella Rossellini) wedding to Vincent Folley. Colleen takes an {{immediate}} dislike to Jack's fiancée, Phoebe, but takes a liking to Liz, whom she originally mistakes for Phoebe. The stress of his approaching wedding <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of his mother prompt Jack {{to have a heart}} attack. While at the hospital, Colleen uses a heart monitor as a lie detector, on Jack, which leads him to revealing that he does not love Phoebe. They break off their engagement.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City manager Brian Horton, {{his former}} captain at Luton, paid Portsmouth £750,000 for Walsh's {{services}} in March 1994. With star striker Niall Quinn out injured, City were fourth from bottom with eleven Premier League games left {{to play and}} Walsh's strike partner Uwe Rösler was also a new signing – and had yet to learn English. The pair soon built an understanding however, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of wingers Peter Beagrie and Nicky Summerbee gave City the attacking firepower {{to steer clear of}} the relegation zone as Walsh and Rösler scored nine goals between them in the final ten games.|$|E
5|$|The {{inevitable}} {{consequence of}} demands for ever greater speed, striking power, and endurance meant that displacement, and hence cost, of dreadnoughts tended to increase. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 imposed {{a limit of}} 35,000 tons on the displacement of capital ships. In subsequent years treaty battleships were commissioned to build up to this limit. Japan's decision to leave the Treaty in the 1930s, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the Second World War, eventually made this limit irrelevant.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{formally}} inspected by the Railway Inspectorate on 1 July 1889, {{and the first}} official service on the line left Chesham for London's Baker Street at 6.55am on 8 July 1889. Throughout the day large crowds flocked to Chesham station to watch the trains, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> and departure of each train at Chesham was greeted with peals of the bells of St. Mary's Church. Over {{the course of the}} day 1,500 passengers travelled on the line, and 4,300 used the line in its first week of operations.|$|E

5|$|Banished {{revolves}} around the player guiding citizens of a remote community of outcasts to grow and maintain a settlement through a command economy. The game focuses on the player's town as a whole, with {{the citizens of the}} town acting as a resource to be managed. The player must assign citizens to various jobs such as building or fishing. The citizens then perform the job without specific direction from the player. Citizens have needs that must be met in order to keep them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home. Additional citizens come from two sources, the birth of children <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of nomads, wandering groups that wish to join the player's town. The player's citizens will age and eventually die.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{has been}} the largest {{religion}} in the region since the Early Middle Ages; its existence in Britain {{dates back to the}} late Roman era <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of Celtic Christianity. The Holy Island of Lindisfarne played an essential role in the Christianisation of Northumbria, after Aidan from Connacht founded a monastery there as the first Bishop of Lindisfarne at the request of King Oswald. It is known for the creation of the Lindisfarne Gospels and remains a place of pilgrimage. Saint Cuthbert, a monk of Lindisfarne, was venerated from Nottinghamshire to Cumberland, and is today sometimes named the patron saint of Northern England. Paulinus, as part of the Gregorian mission, became the first Bishop of York. The Synod of Whitby saw Northumbria break from Celtic Christianity and return to the Roman Catholic church, as calculations of Easter and tonsure rules were brought into line with those of Rome.|$|E
5|$|During {{the year}} the North Vietnamese transported or stored 60,000 tons of {{supplies}} with a net loss rate of 2.07 percent. During the same period, 195,000 PAVN replacements moved through the system to the southern battlefields. As during the previous year, PAVN continued to expand the system. By the end of May the North Vietnamese had occupied Muong Phalane, Ban Houei Sai, and Paksong. They also retook Attopeu, Saravane, and Ban Thateng, cementing their hold on the strategic Bolovens Plateau of south central Laos. Commando Hunt VI, launched during the wet season, was hampered by heavy rain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of two typhoons which threw off both the PAVN logistical effort and U.S. attempts to interdict it.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{departure}} of No.1 FTS in 1947, no flying was conducted at Uranquinty until 1951, when the newly formed No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) inherited the base facilities. No.1 BFTS transferred to Point Cook in 1958, at which point Uranquinty was closed. The RAAF units that operated at the base formed a close connection with the local community. In 1999, a memorial to No.5 SFTS was erected at Wirraway Park, Uranquinty. An additional panel to the memorial was unveiled in September 2002 by the Governor-General of Australia, Peter Hollingworth; the proceedings included an aerial display by a Pilatus PC-9 of the Roulettes aerobatic team, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of a Wirraway from Temora Aviation Museum, {{the first time in}} 45 years that one of these trainers had landed at Uranquinty.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} North American {{release of the}} original Final Fantasy by Nintendo in 1990, Square Soft, Square's North American subsidiary, began work on an English language localization of Final Fantasy II, to be called Final Fantasy II: Dark Shadow Over Palakia. Assigned to the project was Kaoru Moriyama, whose later work included script translations for Final Fantasy IV and Secret of Mana (known as Seiken Densetsu 2 in Japan). Although a beta version was produced, and the game was advertised in several Square Soft trade publications, the long development time, {{the age of the}} original Japanese game <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the NES's successor console, led Square Soft to cancel work on the Final Fantasy II localization in favor of the recently released Final Fantasy IV (which, to avoid confusing North American players, was retitled Final Fantasy II to reflect the jump in releases).|$|E
5|$|Historically part of Cheshire, Altrincham was {{established}} as a market town in 1290, {{a time when the}} economy of most communities was based on agriculture rather than trade, and there is still a market in the town today. Further socioeconomic development came with the extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Altrincham in 1765 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the railway in 1849, stimulating industrial activity in the town. Outlying villages were absorbed by Altrincham's subsequent growth, along with the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall, formerly the home of the Earl of Stamford, and now a tourist attraction with three Grade I Listed Buildings and a deer park.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} winter of 1920, Hananu's rebels {{assaulted}} French forces in Idlib {{and according to}} the British consul in Aleppo, looted the town and killed some of its Christian inhabitants. Hananu's victory at Idlib <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of Turkish military assistance led to a French withdrawal from Idlib. Hananu's principal lieutenant commander in the Idlib operations was Tahir al-Kayyali, who also {{served as president of the}} Arab Club of Aleppo and Aleppo's Committee of National Defense. In early December, the French general of the 2nd Division in Aleppo, , assembled a column at Hammam. In mid-December, the French launched a counterattack on Idlib and burned down the city. Afterward, General de Lamothe assembled a second column at Idlib.|$|E
5|$|No one at Truckee Lake {{had died}} during the interim between the {{departure}} of the first relief party <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said that her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body. The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by the organs of their father. The rescuers discovered that three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May 1915, the Turkish {{launched}} an assault against the Anzac perimeter.

Along most of the line, the attack met with immediate disaster, with the Turkish attackers swept away by the rifle and machine gun fire of the Anzac defenders. At Courtney's Post, one of the most exposed parts of the perimeter, the Turks managed to enter the trenches but there they encountered Lance Corporal Albert Jacka and others, who drove them out again. For his action, Jacka became the first Australian to win the Victoria Cross in the war.|$|E
