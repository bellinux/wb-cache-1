Components were produced by the Naval Ordnance Plants in Pocatello, Idaho, and Louisville, Kentucky. Enough fissionable material was available by 1948 to build ten projectiles and targets, although there were only enough initiators for six. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.|$|E

25|$|On 14 April 2000, Lions Gate Films {{released}} American Psycho in cinemas. Bale {{was later}} approached {{to make a}} cameo appearance in another Bret Easton Ellis adaptation, The Rules of Attraction, a film loosely connected to American Psycho, but he declined out of loyalty to Harron's vision of Bateman, which he felt could not be properly expressed by anyone else. In 2000, he again played a wealthy murderer, this time in John Singleton's Shaft. Bale's first role after American Psycho was in the John Madden adaptation of the best-selling novel Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Bale played Mandras, a Greek fisherman who vied with Nicolas Cage's title character for the affections of Pelagia (Penélope Cruz). Captain Corelli's Mandolin was Bale's second time working with John Hurt, after <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> Animals.|$|E

25|$|That day was, I fear, {{the fatal}} term of local patriotism. On that day, I fear, {{there was an}} end of that narrow scheme of {{relations}} called our country, with all its pride, its prejudices, and its partial affects. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> quiet rivulets, that watered an humble, a contracted, but not an unfruitful field, are to {{be lost in the}} waste expanse, and boundless, barren ocean of the homicide philanthropy of France. It is no longer an object of terrour, the aggrandizement of a new power, which teaches as a professor that philanthropy in their chair; whilst it propagates by arms, and establishes by conquest, the comprehensive system of universal fraternity. In what light is all this viewed in a great assembly? The party which takes the lead there has no longer any apprehensions, except those that arise from not being admitted to the closest and most confidential connexions with the metropolis of that fraternity. That reigning party no longer touches on its favourite subject, the display of those horrours, that must attend the existence of a power, with such dispositions and principles, seated in the heart of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Jane was {{appointed}} as a {{lady of the}} Queen's bedchamber on 15 July 1851. Although hard-working, loyal and devoted, she lacked the knowledge and discretion required for the role. In 1855, Mary Bulteel, later {{the wife of the}} Queen's private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby, disapproved of Jane's conduct, and commented that “Lady E. is more utterly the reverse from what she ought to be on this occasion than anybody can possibly conceive. I mean, I see she is preparing to be foolishly cringing to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> miseries of etiquette...I quite long for somebody as the Queen's first lady with more natural dignity”. Despite her shortcomings, the Queen came to rely heavily on “Dearest Jane”, as she was referred to. The Queen required the utmost effort and devotion from her servants, and Jane followed this code of conduct with total deference to her royal mistress. However, her health suffered as a result, and it remained a constant burden throughout her waiting. In a letter from Henry Ponsonby to Sir Thomas Biddulph, another courtier, he reported that Jane “was principally taken up with her own health”. Jane was also concerned about her own health, and in 1876, she confided to Ponsonby that “she cannot go on as it is, that it is killing her”, and he advised her to write to the Queen threatening to resign if her position was not made easier. The Queen relented, but continued to impose restrictions on Jane's contact with the outside world. Jane's son, who became the 4th Marquess on {{the death of his father}} in 1857, was anxious to visit, but the Queen would not allow him to. Instead, he requested an interview with Ponsonby about his mother's arduous duties; Ponsonby accepted, but Jane said “oh no, perhaps the Queen would not like it”. Ponsonby referred to this fear of the Queen as absurd, knowing that the Queen would not be angry with him for paying a visit to Jane's son.|$|E

The symmetry of its facade was typical to contemporary Greek Revival practiced on the East Coast.

In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{consists}} of four stanzas, each with twelve lines. [...] Riley dedicated his poem [...] "to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> ones," [...] which served as an introduction to draw the attention of his audience when read aloud. The alliteration, parallels, phonetic intensifiers and onomatopoeia add effects to the rhymes that become more detectable when read aloud. The exclamatory refrain ending each stanza is spoken with more emphasis. The poem is written {{in the first person}} and in a regular iambic meter. It begins by introducing Annie, and then sets a mood of excitement by describing the children eagerly gathering to hear her stories. The next three stanzas are each a story which Annie tells the children. Each story tells of a bad child who is snatched away by goblins and has an underlying moral which is announced in the final stanza, encouraging children to obey their parents and teachers, help their loved ones, and care for the poor and disadvantaged.|$|E
500|$|Doctors {{were able}} to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of {{baseball}} and American football player Bo Jackson. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating {{that they were the}} only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, [...] "I take my hat off [...] I want him to know I am in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> things he needs to compete on a professional level." [...] Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.|$|E
500|$|After {{the court}} issued its decision, some {{commentators}} praised the Court's ruling for [...] "further individual liberty by striking down a government’s unjustified censorship of protected speech". David A. Cortman, counsel for Good News Community Church, said the Court's ruling was an [...] "important victory for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>little</b> {{guys who have}} ever found their speech silenced by the strong arm of government". Likewise, Nina Totenberg reported that one consequence of the Court's decision is that [...] "the government has much less power to regulate how other people speak." [...] However, other commentators criticized the majority opinion's methodology; Hadley Arkes, for example, wrote that the Court's decision [...] "revealed the unlovely spectacle of the conservatives talking themselves ever deeper into a genuine moral relativism in the regulation of speech". Some analysts also claimed the majority's opinion left open unanswered questions within the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence. Lyle Denniston, for example, suggested that after the Court issued its decisions in Reed and Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, [...] "the meaning of the First Amendment, in general, became somewhat more confusing". Eugene Volokh also suggested the Court's opinion {{is likely to be}} litigated again in lower courts.|$|E
