5|$|There was {{considerable}} debate about which person or house of Congress was <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> decide between the competing slates of electors, with the Republican Senate and the Democratic House each claiming priority. By January 1877, {{with the question}} still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be <b>authorized</b> <b>to</b> determine {{the fate of the}} disputed electoral votes. The Commission was to be made up of five representatives, five senators, and five Supreme Court justices. To ensure partisan balance, there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans, with Justice David Davis, an independent respected by both parties, as the fifteenth member. The balance was upset when Democrats in the Illinois legislature elected Davis to the Senate, hoping to sway his vote. Davis disappointed Democrats by refusing to serve on the Commission because of his election to the Senate. As all of the remaining Justices were Republicans, Justice Joseph P. Bradley, believed to be the most independent-minded of them, was selected to take Davis's place on the Commission. The Commission met in February and the eight Republicans voted to award all 20 electoral votes to Hayes. Democrats were outraged by the result and attempted a filibuster to prevent Congress from accepting the Commission's findings.|$|E
