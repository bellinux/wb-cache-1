2500|$|V(D)J {{recombination}} is the rearrangement of multiple, distinct gene {{segments in}} germ-line DNA {{to produce the}} unique protein domains of immune cells, B cells and T cells, that will specifically recognize foreign antigens such as viruses, bacteria, and pathogenic eukaryotes. [...] B cells produce antibodies that are secreted into the bloodstream and T cells produce receptors that once translated are transported to the outer lipid bilayer of the cell. [...] Antibodies are composed of two light and two heavy chains. [...] The antigen binding site consists of two variable regions, VL and VH. [...] The remainder of the <b>antibody</b> <b>structure</b> {{is made up of}} constant regions, CL, CH, CH2 and CH3. [...] The Kappa locus in the mouse encodes an antibody light chain and contains approximately 300 gene segments for the variable region, V, four J segments than encode a short protein region, and one constant, C, segment. [...] To produce a light chain with one unique type of VL, when B cells are differentiating, DNA is rearranged to incorporate a unique combination of the V and J segments. [...] RNA splicing joins the recombined region with the C segment. [...] The heavy chain gene also contain numerous diversity segments, D, and multiple constant segments, Cμ, Cδ, Cγ, Cε, Cα. [...] Recombination occurs in a specific region of the gene that is located between two conserved sequence motifs called recombination signal sequences. [...] Each motif is flanked by a 7 bp and 9 bp sequence that is separated by a 12 bp spacer, referred to as class 1, or a 23 bp spacer, referred to as class 2. [...] A recombinase made up of RAG1 and RAG2 subunits always cleave between these two sites. [...] The cleavage results in two hairpin structures for the V and J segments, respectively, and the non-coding region, are now separated from the V and J segments by a DSB. [...] The hairpin coding region goes through the process of NHEJ where the closed end is cleaved and repaired. [...] The non-coding region is circularized and degraded.

The RNA sequence of the parent PR 8 virus as well as the RNA sequences of the sequential variants were also determined, and it was demonstrated that the variant hemagglutinin molecules differed from the parent molecule by only a single amino acid interchange.

However, the homodimeric nature of Fc effectively imposes bivalent binding on all current full-length bispecific antibodies, an attribute that can result in nonspecific activation of cross-linked receptors. We engineered a novel bispecific format, referred to as mAb-Fv, that utilizes a heterodimeric Fc region to enable monovalent co-engagement of a second target antigen in a full-length context. mAb-Fv constructs co-targeting CD 16 and CD 3 were expressed and purified as heterodimeric species, bound selectively to their co-target antigens and mediated potent cytotoxic activity by NK cells and T cells, respectively.

A rotating disk shear device is proposed that produces defined shear conditions at a known solid–liquid interface to measure stability in this environment. Five variants of IgG 1 and IgG 4 antibodies were created using combinations of two discrete triple amino acid sequence mutations denoted TM and YTE. Antibodies were ranked for stability based on shear device output (protein decay coefficient, PDC), and compared with accelerated thermal stability data and the melting temperature of the CH 2 domain (Tm 1) from differential scanning calorimetry to investigate technique complimentarity. Results suggest that the techniques are orthogonal, with thermal methods based on intramolecular interaction and shear device stability based on localized unfolding revealing less stable regions that drive aggregation. Molecular modeling shows the modifications’ effects on the <b>antibody</b> <b>structures</b> and indicates a possible role for Fc conformation and Fab-Fc docking in determining suspended protein stability.
