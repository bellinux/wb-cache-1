40|$|The {{hereditary}} hearing-vision loss disease, Usher syndrome I (USH 1), {{is caused}} by defects in several proteins that can {{interact with each other}} in vitro. Defects in USH 1 proteins are thought to be responsible for the developmental and functional impairments of sensory cells in the retina and inner ear. Harmonin/USH 1 C and Sans/USH 1 G are two of the USH 1 proteins that interact with each other. Harmonin also binds to other USH 1 proteins such as cadherin 23 (CDH 23) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH 15). However, the molecular basis governing the harmonin <b>and</b> <b>Sans</b> interaction is largely unknown. Here, we report an unexpected assembly mode between harmonin <b>and</b> <b>Sans.</b> We demonstrate that the N-terminal domain and the first PDZ domain of harmonin are tethered by a small-domain C-terminal to PDZ 1 to form a structural and functional supramodule responsible for binding to Sans. We discover that the SAM domain of Sans, specifically, binds to the PDZ domain of harmonin, revealing previously unknown interaction modes for both PDZ and SAM domains. We further show that the synergistic PDZ 1 /SAM and PDZ 1 /carboxyl PDZ binding-motif interactions, between harmonin <b>and</b> <b>Sans,</b> lock the two scaffold proteins into a highly stable complex. Mutations in harmonin <b>and</b> <b>Sans</b> found in USH 1 patients are shown to destabilize the complex formation of the two proteins...|$|R
