Madhava also found the Madhava-Gregory series to determine the <b>arctangent,</b> the Madhava-Newton power series to determine sine and cosine and the Taylor approximation for sine and cosine functions. In the 16th century, Jyesthadeva consolidated many of the Kerala School's developments and theorems in the Yukti-bhāṣā. However, the Kerala School did not formulate a systematic theory of differentiation and integration, nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.|$|E

BKM provides a simpler method of computing some elementary functions, and unlike CORDIC, BKM needs no result scaling factor. The convergence rate of BKM is approximately one bit per iteration, like CORDIC, but BKM requires more precomputed table elements for the same precision because the table stores logarithms of complex operands.|$|R

As particular examples, new binary formulas are presented for $\pi\sqrt 3 $, $\pi\sqrt 3 \log 2 $, $\sqrt 3 \;{\rm Cl}_ 2 (\pi/ 3) $ {{and a couple of other}} polylogarithm constants.

40|$|Skew {{estimation}} for textual document {{images is}} a well-researched topic and numerals of {{methods have been}} reported in the literature. One of the major challenges is the presence of interfering non-textual objects of various types and quantities in the document images. Many existing methods require proper separation of the textual objects which are well aligned from the non-textual objects which are mostly nonaligned. Some comparative evaluation workon the existing methods chooses only the text zones of the test image database. Therefore, the object filtering or zoning stage is crucial to the skew detection stage. However, it is difficult if not impossible to design general-purpose filters that are able to discriminate noises from textual components. This paper presents a robust, general-purpose skew estimation method that does not need any filtering or zoning preprocessing. In fact, this method does apply filtering, but not on the input components at the beginning of the detection process, rather on the output spectrum at the end of the detection process. Therefore, the problem of finding a textual component filter has been transformed into finding a convolution filter on the output accumulator array. This method consists of three steps: (1) the calculation of the slopes of the virtual lines that pass through the centroids of all the unique pairs of the connected components in an image, and quantizes the <b>arctangents</b> of the slopes into a 1 -D accumulator array that covers the range from − 90 ◦ to + 90 ◦; (2) a special convolution on the resultant histogram, after which there remain only the prominent peaks that possibly correspond to the skew angles of the image; (3) the verification of the detection result. Its computational complexity and detection precision are uncoupled, unlike those projection-profile-based or Hough-transform-based methods whose speeds drop when higher precision is in demand. Speedup measures on the baseline implementation are also presented...|$|R

The angle can be restricted to be from 0° to 180°, but angles are formally ambiguous by multiples of 360°. When the angle is zero, the axis is undefined. When the angle is 180°, the matrix becomes symmetric, which has implications in extracting the axis. Near multiples of 180°, care is needed to avoid numerical problems: in extracting the angle, a two-argument <b>arctangent</b> with [...] equal to [...] avoids the insensitivity of arccos; and in computing the axis magnitude in order to force unit magnitude, a brute-force approach can lose accuracy through underflow [...]|$|E
