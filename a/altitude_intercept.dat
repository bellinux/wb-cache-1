5000|$|Twelve McDonnell F-4 Phantom IIs of VF-41 {{moved to}} augment air defense forces on Key West, and {{additional}} crews {{were added to}} the VF(AW)-3 detachment to permit it to maintain aircraft on continuous alert. [...] The 331st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron deployed 18 Delta Daggers to Homestead Air Force Base bringing the number of Deuces there to 32. [...] However, the F-102s of the 331st were soon replaced with F-102s from 325th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron in order to have planes armed with Mighty Mouse rockets to improve low <b>altitude</b> <b>intercept</b> capability [...] Patrick Air Force Base, Florida received a dozen Delta Darts from the 49th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron.|$|E
5000|$|On 22 October 1962, before President John F. Kennedy told Americans that {{missiles}} {{were in place}} in Cuba, the squadron dispersed a portion of its force to Des Moines Airport {{at the start of}} the Cuban Missile Crisis. [...] At the beginning of the crisis, the 331st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron had deployed F-102s to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. The 325th was the only F-102 squadron whose planes had not been modified to carry the GAR-11 Falcon nuclear missile and its planes were armed with Mighty Mouse rockets, [...] which provided a superior low <b>altitude</b> <b>intercept</b> capability. [...] The 325th replaced the 331st at Homestead to take advantage of this capability. Following the crisis, twenty of the squadron's F-102s were kept at Homestead until Air Defense Command (ADC) decided to replace the F-102s there with F-104s. [...] Although the F-104 had been removed from the ADC inventory in 1960 because of its lack of an all-weather capability, this was not a factor at Homestead because Cuba lacked a bomber force and the F-104 had a superior fighter against fighter capability. The alert responsibility at Homestead was assumed by F-104s of the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron on 15 April 1963 and the 325th's planes returned to Truax.|$|E
50|$|Piston-engined petrol {{military}} aircraft used water injection technology prior to World War II to increase takeoff power. This was used so that heavily laden fighters could {{take off from}} shorter runways, climb faster, and quickly reach high <b>altitudes</b> to <b>intercept</b> enemy bomber formations. Some fighter aircraft also used water injection for a boost in short bursts during dogfights.|$|R
50|$|This mode of {{operation}} meant that the missile had a minimum <b>intercept</b> <b>altitude</b> of 30 m which in theory left it unable to intercept sea skimming anti-ship missiles and low flying aircraft. However even blind the 100 kg warhead meant that some result would have been achieved.|$|R
5000|$|The S-125M (1970) {{system uses}} 5V27. The <b>intercept</b> <b>altitudes</b> are between 20 m and 14 km. The minimum range is 2.5 km, and the maximum is 22 km The S-125M1 (1978) system uses 5V27D.

5000|$|Final {{approach}} segment: For a PA or APV, {{this segment}} starts where the glideslope intercepts the glideslope <b>intercept</b> <b>altitude</b> plane. For an NPA, this segment {{starts at the}} FAF, final approach point (FAP), or where the aircraft is established on the final approach course. This segment ends at either the designated MAP or upon landing.|$|R
50|$|Meantime, Storpâ€™s group arrived, commencing {{their attack}} at 14.38. As planned, they had flown across the borders before heading northwards south of Roslin and over Threipmuir Reservoir in the Pentland Hills almost due {{south of the}} target area and the {{airfield}} at Turnhouse. Yellow Section of 603 Squadron (led by Flight Lieutenant George Denholm) had taken off at 14.35 and were climbing to <b>altitude</b> to <b>intercept.</b> Storp descended to 12,000 ft and decided to attack the ships beside the bridge. As the Ju 88 dived, he selected one of the cruisers as his target and at 2,400 ft released his bombs. He believed his target was Southampton.|$|R
5000|$|... "Rarely {{have the}} enemy attacks been so cleverly {{executed}} and made with such reckless determination. These attacks were generally by single or few aircraft making their approaches with radical changes in course and <b>altitude,</b> dispersing when <b>intercepted</b> and using cloud cover to every advantage. They tailed our friendlies home, used decoy planes, {{and came in}} at any altitude or on the water." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{average speed}} of V-1s was 550 km/h and their average {{altitude}} was 1000 m to 1200 m. Fighter aircraft required excellent low <b>altitude</b> performance to <b>intercept</b> them and enough firepower {{to ensure that}} they were destroyed in the air rather than crashing to earth and detonating. Most aircraft were too slow to catch a V-1 unless they had a height advantage, allowing them to gain speed by diving on their target.|$|R
50|$|The later {{version is}} named V-601 (or 5V27). It has {{a length of}} 6.09 m, a wing span of 2.2 m and a body {{diameter}} of 0.375 m. This missile weighs 953 kg at launch, and has a 70 kg warhead containing 33 kg of HE and 4,500 fragments. The minimum range is 3.5 km, and the maximum is 35 km (with the Pechora 2A). The <b>intercept</b> <b>altitudes</b> are between 100 m and 18 km.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} noise {{measurements}} were made during engineering evaluation {{tests of the}} two segment approach using a DC- 8 - 61. The two approaches evaluated were: (1) ILS, 2. 9 deg glide slope using 50 deg flaps; and (2) two segment 5. 5 deg/ 2. 9 deg glide slope, using 50 deg flaps and lower segment <b>intercept</b> <b>altitude</b> of 575 feet. Measurements were made at twelve sites underneath and {{to the side of}} the flight path...|$|R
5000|$|SA-2A; SA-75 Dvina ( [...] - Dvina River) with Fan Song-A {{guidance}} {{radar and}} V-750 or V-750V missiles. Initial deployment began in 1957. The combined missile and booster was 10.6 m long, with a booster having {{a diameter of}} 0.65 m, and the missile a diameter of 0.5 m. Launch weight is 2,287 kg. The missile has a maximum effective range of 30 km, a minimum range of 8 km, and an <b>intercept</b> <b>altitude</b> envelope of between 450 and 25000 m.|$|R
2500|$|Bomarc {{development}} dragged on, and by 1956 {{less than}} 25 test launches had taken place, {{many of them}} failures. By this point the Army had begun early production of its greatly improved Nike Hercules missile, which offered high supersonic speeds, <b>intercept</b> <b>altitudes</b> as high as , and ranges {{on the order of}} [...] Although Bomarc's range was much greater than Hercules, the mission of protecting cities was adequately served, and Hercules was dramatically simpler, cheaper and more reliable (Bomarc was estimated to be ready to fire 25% of the time or less).|$|R
50|$|The Whirlwind was the UK's first cannon-armed {{fighter and}} faster than many other British {{aircraft}} at the time but was troubled by the inability of Rolls-Royce to produce the engines.The Lysander army co-operation aircraft was displaced for reconnaissance as too vulnerable but found favour for specialist missions into occupied Europe carrying agents. Westland tendered designs for new aircraft during the war but only the Welkin was accepted. The Welkin was a twin-engine high <b>altitude</b> design to <b>intercept</b> attempts by high-flying German bombers to attack Britain. When the threat never appeared production was limited.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second phase}} of the HASTOL study, {{published}} in 2001, proposed increasing the intercept airspeed to Mach 15-17, and increasing the <b>intercept</b> <b>altitude</b> to 150 km, which would reduce the necessary tether mass by a factor of three. The higher speed would be achieved by using a reusable rocket stage instead of a purely air-breathing aircraft. The study concluded that although there are no [...] "fundamental technical show-stoppers", substantial improvement in technology would be needed. In particular, there was concern that a bare Spectra 2000 tether would be rapidly eroded by atomic oxygen; this component was given a technology readiness level of 2.|$|R
50|$|SA-2D; Fan Song-E {{radar and}} V-750SM missiles. The V-750SM {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} A/B/C versions in having new antennas and a longer barometric nose probe. Several other differences {{were associated with the}} sustainer motor casing. The missile is 10.8 m long and has the same body diameters and warhead as the SA-2C, but the weight is increased to 2,450 kg. The effective maximum range is 43 km, the minimum range is 6 km, and the <b>intercept</b> <b>altitude</b> envelope is between 250 and 25000 m. Improved aircraft counter measures {{led to the development of}} the Fan Song-E with its better antennas which could cut through heavy jamming.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{determined}} {{the feasibility of}} developing a 16 -inch, gun-launched anti-satellite weapon. The general performance capability of rocket-and scramjet-boosted, gun-launched vehicles is examined with regards to propelling a miniature homing vehicle to a satellite <b>intercept</b> <b>altitude.</b> Rocket and scramjet boost vehicle performance is modeled and optimum trajectories are determined. A low gun elevation at launch and a pop-up manuever are required to maximize the scramjet boost vehicle acceleration potential. The rocket boost vehicle is capable of <b>intercepting</b> a low <b>altitude</b> satellite without a pop-up manuever from a gun elevation of 45 degrees. Both boost methods provide apogees consistent with the intercept of known Soviet Electronic Intelligence Ocean Reconnaissance satellites, EORSAT, and Radar Ocean Reconnaissance satellites, RORSAT...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the effects of hypervelocity impact generated debris on S-band radio frequency (RF) transmission, a conical aeroshell was impacted by a Lexan projectile traveling at 6. 7 km/s. RF signals from four transmitting patch antennas mounted on the target were {{used to measure the}} debris effects. The aft impact produced a back-scattered debris cloud that slowed as it moved through the 2 torr atmosphere in the evacuated blast chamber, and the debris attenuated S-band signals by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude from their preimpact values. The average velocity of the RF-inhibiting debris ranged from 0. 7 to 1. 1 km/s depending on the distance traveled. At an <b>intercept</b> <b>altitude</b> of 230 km, the atmospheric pressure is 10 " 7 torr, there is no resistive force, and the debris should continue at its initial velocity. To gain {{better understand}}ing of the chamber atmosphere effects, a simple momentum transfer model for debris slowing in a nonviscous media was used to model debris propagation. The resistive force is proportional to V 2, and an initial (exoatmospheric) velocity of 1. 5 km/s was calculated. Therefore, debris velocities measured at 2 torr will overestimate telemetry link lifetimes by Vexo/Vavei which ranges from 1. 4 to 2. 1 in this experiment...|$|R
40|$|In recent {{military}} conflicts, {{ballistic missiles}} {{have been used}} to achieve military and psychological objectives. With the {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction (WMD), the growing threat of ballistic missiles being used as a delivery platform for WMD by rogue nations or militant groups becomes a concern for many countries. Defense against such threats becomes increasingly important. There are different guidance laws for the missile interception of aerial targets. These include pursuit, proportional navigation (PN) guidance as well as its variants. A new guidance algorithm was developed by John A. Lukacs IV and Prof Yakimenko in 2006 to intercept a ballistic missile during the boost phase by a missile interceptor. This TS guidance algorithm uses the direct method of calculus of variations that maximizes the kinetic energy transfer from a surface-launched missile to a ballistic missile target. A trade-off study was conducted by applying this guidance law in simulated ballistic missile interception. This study examines the interactions and trade-offs between the various critical parameters in the intercept solution, like the endgame intercept geometry, time-to-intercept and <b>intercept</b> <b>altitude.</b> It provides insights into the feasibility and limitations of the TS guidance algorithm. A literature review of the drag model used in the algorithm and comparison of the new guidance with the compensated PN guidance was also conducted. A new induced drag model was developed for future studies. The results verified that the trajectory-shaping guidance is feasible for the interception of ballistic missiles in the boost phase for a wide range of interceptor launch locations with respect to a ballistic missile detection point. A better understanding of the trade-offs between the key parameters allows users to optimize the performance of this guidance. Republic of Singapore Air Force author...|$|R
5000|$|A second hearing {{convened in}} October focused upon the {{proposed}} {{reduction in the}} Navy and the cancellation of the USS United States project and the soundness of the proposed expansion of the strategic bomber forces. The Army and Air Force command testified that naval aviation {{should be used to}} reinforce the Air Force, but could not be used for sustained actions against long range in-land targets. Regarding the USS United States, Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg commented: [...] "I accept the military capability of this ship as stated by the Chief of Naval Operations. My opposition to building it {{comes from the fact that}} I can see no necessity for a ship with those capabilities in any strategic plan against the one possible enemy." [...] The new Secretary of the Navy, Francis Matthews, announced that no Navy man would be censored or penalized for the testimony he offered at the hearing. The naval officers called to testify were expected to support Secretary Matthews, but instead officer after officer arose to testify that the Air Force reliance on the B-36 was inadequate for national defense, and that the entire strategy of atomic bombing was misguided. Among the officers testifying from 6-17 October, were the naval leaders of World War II: Ernest King, Chester Nimitz, William Halsey, Raymond Spruance, Thomas Kinkaid, Richard Conolly, Robert Carney and Captain Arleigh Burke. Captain Burke had run tests which showed the Navy was already in possession of a fighter aircraft, the McDonnell F2H Banshee, that could reach high enough <b>altitudes</b> to <b>intercept</b> bombers like the B36, and he knew it would be unreasonable to assume that an opposing major world power would not also have developed such an aircraft. In that case, the B-36 would need to be accompanied with long range fighter escorts with the requisite range and ceiling to complete its mission, and the Air Force had no such fighter available in their inventory. The Air Force rebutted all previous testimony, point by point, with only Secretary of the Air Force Symington and Air Force General Vandenberg on 18-19 October. The remainder of the testimony before the House Armed Services Committee further weakened the already faltering Navy position. Of particular note were the arguments of Army General Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He stated that there would be no need in the future for an island hopping campaign or large amphibious capabilities, and more importantly, strategic bombing was [...] "our first-priority retaliatory weapon." [...] Bradley made no attempt to hide his contempt for the Navy's methods during the case, and he directly accused senior naval officers of poor leadership, disloyalty, and being [...] "completely against unity of command and planning".|$|R
