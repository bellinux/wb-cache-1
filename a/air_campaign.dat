5|$|As the <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> continued, the Coalition's {{expectations}} of an Iraqi offensive decreased. As a result, the United States redeployed the XVIII Airborne Corps and the VII Corps 480kilometers (300mi) to the west. The Coalition's leadership believed that should an Iraqi force {{go on the}} offensive, it would be launched from the al-Wafra oil fields, in Southern Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Khafji was {{the first}} major ground {{engagement}} of the Gulf War. It took place in and around the Saudi Arabian city of Khafji, from 29 January to 1 February 1991 and marked the culmination of the Coalition's <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> over Kuwait and Iraq, which had begun on 17 January 1991.|$|E
5000|$|World War II brought great {{advances}} in meteorology as large-scale military land, sea, and <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> were {{highly dependent on}} weather, particularly forecasts provided by the Royal Navy, Met Office and USAAF for the Normandy landing and strategic bombing.|$|R

50|$|The analysts {{specifically}} {{alleged that}} the conclusions of both their reports about the readiness of indigenous forces to face ISIS, and {{about the effectiveness of}} the American <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> over Syria and Iraq, were completely reversed by the Administration before distribution.|$|R
5|$|The Central Intelligence Agency {{analysed}} {{the effects}} of Operation Deliberate Force and Operations Maestral 2 and Sana, and noted that the NATO <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> did not degrade VRS combat capability as much as was expected, because the airstrikes were never primarily directed at field-deployed units but at command and control infrastructure. This analysis noted that, while the NATO <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> did degrade VRS capabilities, the final offensives by the HV, HVO and the ARBiH did the most damage. The analysis further concluded that the ground offensives, rather than the NATO bombardment, were responsible for bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiation table and the war to its end. However, author Robert C. Owen argues that the HV would not have advanced as rapidly as it did had NATO not intervened and hampered the VRS defence by denying it long-range communications.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{attacks on}} the Mariana Islands during 1944 and 1945 did not seriously disrupt the USAAF's {{strategic}} <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> against Japan. They did, however, force the United States to allocate forces to defend the islands {{in order to prevent}} further losses of expensive B-29s. Moreover, due to the high cost of the heavy bombers, the ratio of losses was in favor of the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} {{morality}} of the <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E
50|$|The mission taskings {{included}} counter <b>air</b> <b>campaigns,</b> strafing and bombing Japanese {{forces and}} installations, escorting bombers, flying reconnaissance missions, and intercepting Japanese bombers. The fighter group excelled in these roles {{and received the}} Distinguished Unit Citation for its exceptional performance during the war.|$|R

50|$|De Havilland flew {{in various}} <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> in Europe and the Middle East in World War I {{and reached the}} rank of Major. On 10 March 1917 was awarded a Distinguished Service Order for {{distinguished}} service {{in the field in}} Mesopotamia. The youngest airman to receive the D.S.O.|$|R
5|$|Assuming {{command of}} United States Central Command in 1988, Schwarzkopf was {{called on to}} respond to the Invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by the forces of Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Initially tasked with {{defending}} Saudi Arabia from Iraqi aggression, Schwarzkopf's command eventually grew to an international force of over 750,000 troops. After diplomatic relations broke down, he planned and led Operation Desert Storm—an extended <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> followed by a highly successful 100-hour ground offensive—which defeated the Iraqi Army and liberated Kuwait in early 1991. Schwarzkopf was presented with military honors.|$|E
5|$|Despite these Iraqi threats, the Coalition {{launched}} a 38-day aerial campaign on 17 January 1991. Flying an estimated 2,000 sorties a day, Coalition aircraft rapidly crippled the Iraqi air defense systems and effectively destroyed the Iraqi Air Force, whose daily sortie rate plummeted from a prewar level {{of an estimated}} 200 per day to almost none by 17 January. On {{the third day of}} the campaign, many Iraqi pilots fled across the Iranian border in their aircraft rather than be destroyed. The <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> also targeted command-and-control sites, bridges, railroads, and petroleum storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Berlin, No.467 Squadron {{began to}} {{concentrate}} on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to {{the invasion of the}} continent. On the night of 10/11 April, Balmer led not only his own unit but a total of 148 aircraft of No.5 Group RAF in an assault on Toulouse, striking at an airfield, and aircraft and explosives factories. The bombing was highly accurate, and the Australians suffered no losses on the raid.|$|E
25|$|Following {{service as}} USAF Vice Chief of Staff (1957–1961), LeMay was made the fifth Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force on the {{retirement}} of Gen Thomas White. His belief in the efficacy of strategic <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> over tactical strikes and ground support operations became Air Force policy during his tenure as chief of staff.|$|R
50|$|Number 56 Squadron {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{successful}} squadrons of the Royal Air Force, with battle honours from many of the significant <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> of both World War I and World War II. As 56 (Reserve) Squadron it is now an Air Command and Control Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Operational Evaluation Unit (AIR C2ISR OEU).|$|R
50|$|The 44th Bombardment Group {{was one of}} {{the first}} two heavy {{bombardment}} groups flying the B-24 with the 8th Air Force in the fall/winter <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> in the European Theater of Operations. The 44th Bomb Group flew the first of its 344 combat missions against the Axis powers in World War II on 7 November 1942.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>air</b> <b>campaign,</b> {{a small number of}} Australians took part in special operations ahead of the invasion. In January 1944, RANVR officer Lieutenant Ken Hudspeth, who commanded the midget submarine , transported a party of specialist personnel to inspect and collect soil samples from French beaches being considered for the invasion. This operation was successful, and earned Hudspeth his second Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). Nancy Wake, an Australian serving with the British Special Operations Executive, was parachuted into France in April 1944 and subsequently helped to organise the French Resistance in the Auvergne region.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{argued that}} among the Vietnamese forces {{involved}} {{in the civil war}} there were nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention. He opposed many of the strategies associated with troop escalation, notably the <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> over North Vietnam, which he saw as an aggressive measure causing civilian casualties that could draw the People's Republic of China or the Soviet Union into the conflict. He also feared that other American interests, including the economy, were suffering through U.S. involvement in the war, and that the U.S. was losing prestige internationally.|$|E
5|$|The Air Battle of South Korea was an <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> {{early in}} the Korean War {{occurring}} roughly from June 25 to July 20, 1950, over South Korea between the air forces of North Korea and the United Nations, including the countries of South Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom. The month-long fight for air supremacy over the country saw several small engagements over airfields in Seoul and Taejon and ultimately ended in victory for the UN air force, which was able to destroy the small North Korean People's Air Force.|$|E
50|$|By {{the start}} of the 21st century, the Air Force had created several new ribbons as well as an <b>Air</b> Force {{specific}} <b>campaign</b> medal known as the <b>Air</b> and Space <b>Campaign</b> Medal.|$|R
500|$|Kenney wrote {{three books}} about the SWPA <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> he led during World War II. His major work was General Kenney Reports (1949), a {{personal}} history of the air war he led from 1942 to 1945. He also wrote The Saga of Pappy Gunn (1959) and Dick Bong: Ace of Aces (1960), which described the careers of Paul Gunn and Richard Bong, {{two of the most}} prominent airmen under his command.|$|R
50|$|Albert Kesselring was a German Luftwaffe general. He {{served as}} {{commander}} of Luftflotte 2 {{for the early}} part of the war, commanding <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> in west and east, before being assigned as commander-in-chief of German forces in the Mediterranean, a position he would occupy for most of the war, commanding German forces in the defense of Italy. In March 1945, he became the last German commander-in-chief in the west.|$|R
5|$|The Luftwaffe was to {{spearhead}} {{the aerial}} {{battle in the}} low countries. Its first task was {{the elimination of the}} Belgian air contingent. Despite an overwhelming numerical superiority of 1,375 aircraft, 957 of which were serviceable, the <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> in Belgium had limited success overall on the first day. At roughly 04:00, the first air raids were conducted against airfields and communication centres. It still had a tremendous impact on the AéMI, which had only 179 aircraft on 10 May.|$|E
5|$|While {{the attacks}} on the Mariana Islands did not seriously disrupt the USAAF <b>air</b> <b>campaign,</b> they had an effect on other American operations. After {{determining}} that the Japanese raiders were staging through Iwo Jima, American forces stepped up their attacks on that island. While the decision to invade Iwo Jima had been made before the raids commenced, stopping the attacks formed part of the justification for the landing. In addition, further air defense units were deployed to the Mariana Islands to protect the B-29 bases.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the Luftwaffe had {{subjected}} the UK {{to a major}} <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> {{and caused}} {{an enormous amount of}} destruction and displacement of civilians. However, it failed to bring the UK to peace talks, nor had any obvious effect on economic output. At the end of May the Germans called off The Blitz, and from then on the UK would be subject to dramatically lower rates of bombing. How much of this was due to the effects of the night fighter force has been a matter of considerable debate among historians. The Germans were turning their attention eastward, and most of the Luftwaffe was sent to support these efforts. Even in May, the losses represent only 2.4% of the attacking force, a tiny number that was easily replaceable by the Luftwaffe.|$|E

50|$|Allen's The Legacy of Lord Trenchard {{questioned}} {{the need for}} an independent RAF and the rectitude of Air Staff policies before and during the Second World War. The provocatively titled Who Won the Battle of Britain (first published in 1974) followed shortly afterwards with a critique of RAF structure, leadership and doctrine before and during the <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> of 1940. Controversially, Allen stated that RAF Fighter Command's 11 Group was a defeated force at the time the invasion was most likely to have been launched. Allen argued that the Luftwaffe did not lose the Battle of Britain <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> - reasoning that the Luftwaffe's damaging attacks on airfields containing vital sector stations gave them air superiority during the critical period of late August to early September preceding the change of focus to the bombing of London after which it dropped thousands of tons of bombs with negligible losses. But the Luftwaffe did not win it either as it lacked the training and equipment and therefore the potential to sink enough of the Royal Navy's warships, especially the large capital ships.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{first heard}} of the term centers of gravity {{in the context of}} Desert Storm or COL John Warden, but Warden's {{contribution}} was adapting the idea to <b>air</b> <b>campaigns,</b> of the Clausewitz idea of a [...] "center of gravity," [...] a feature that if successfully attacked, can stop the enemy's war effort. Assessment requires considering the potential interaction of the two sides. According to Clausewitz, [...] "One must keep the dominant characteristics of both belligerents in mind." ...|$|R
5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, Saudi commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> against Iraqi forces {{in and around the}} city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi infantry and two Kuwaiti tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days of August 1995, NATO {{launched}} Operation Deliberate Force—an <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> targeting the VRS. This campaign was launched in response to the second Markale massacre of 28 August, which came {{on the heels of the}} Srebrenica massacre. Airstrikes began on 30 August, initially targeting VRS air defences, and striking targets near Sarajevo. The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city. The bombing resumed on 5 September, and its scope extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its list of targets near Sarajevo. On 13 September, the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO's demand for the establishment of an exclusion zone around Sarajevo and the campaign ceased.|$|E
5|$|The Split Agreement was {{a turning}} point in the Bosnian War as well as an {{important}} factor in the Croatian War of Independence. It led to a large-scale deployment of the HV in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the capture of strategic positions in Operation Summer '95. This in turn allowed the quick capture of Knin, the capital of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and the lifting of the siege of Bihać soon thereafter, during Operation Storm. Subsequent HV offensives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, supported by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), as well as NATO <b>air</b> <b>campaign</b> in Bosnia and Herzegovina, shifted the military balance in the Bosnian War, contributing to the start of peace talks, leading to the Dayton Agreement.|$|E
50|$|The whistle blowers {{alleged that}} the Obama Administration {{attempted}} to portray a rosy image of {{the fight against the}} Islamic State (ISIL) by altering some reports to seem more positive, while burying other reports to keep them from the press and Congress. The analysts specifically {{alleged that the}} conclusions of both their reports about the readiness of indigenous forces to face ISIL, and about the effectiveness of the American <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> over Syria and Iraq, were completely reversed by the Administration before distribution.|$|R
5000|$|The game is {{loosely based}} on the novel [...] "Flight of the Intruder" [...] by Stephen Coonts. The player flies several {{missions}} off one of the aircraft carriers on Yankee Station. The game does not have a real story line but instead is set in the historic conflict of the Vietnam war. In campaign mode the player progresses through the different <b>air</b> <b>campaigns</b> of the Vietnam war, with the first mission being the notorious Tonkin Gulf incident, the casus belli escalating the conflict.|$|R
