40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problems of}} dynamically modeling and automatically controlling the motion of a small maneuverable flight vehicle that is being towed by a much larger one. Mathematical models {{of the components of}} the system, including the <b>towing</b> <b>aircraft,</b> <b>tow</b> cable reel mechanism, <b>tow</b> cable, and <b>vehicle</b> aerodynamics, are described. The development of an autopilot for stability augmentation and maneuvering of the <b>towed</b> <b>vehicle</b> is discussed. An overview of the implementation of the models in a digital computer simulation program is provided, and some typical results obtained using the program are presented. A comparison of theoretical and experimental results is also made...|$|R

5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle</b> that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle's</b> rear axle to the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle's</b> front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch. <b>Tow</b> <b>vehicles</b> often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} factor in towing safety is tongue weight, the weight with which the trailer presses down on the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle's</b> hitch. Insufficient tongue weight can cause the trailer to sway back and forth when towed. Too much tongue weight can cause problems with the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{analysis}} of the structure and the power transmission system of <b>aircraft</b> <b>towing</b> tractor, a new project applying hydraulic drive hybrid power is put forward considering the requirements of <b>towing</b> <b>aircraft</b> and working process without towbar. As the testing and controlling signals of the system are multi channel and distributed, the testing program is designed via LXI bus. The experimental data indicate both the pressure change of accumulators and the capacity change of the hydraulic pump/motor are ideal. All the data are in good agreement with expectation. The research may highlight the design for a new generation <b>aircraft</b> <b>towing</b> tractor.

50|$|The {{problem can}} be {{eliminated}} by minimising slack spring travel, and by {{reducing the amount of}} trailer braking force applied for a given drawbar force. However this results in the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> bearing some of the trailer braking load, something the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> is often not designed to do. The result is compromised braking.|$|R

5000|$|The {{clearance}} {{between the}} lunette and pintle allows for more relative motion between the trailer and <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle</b> than a ball coupling does. A disadvantage {{of that is}} the [...] "slam" [...] transmitted into the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> with each push/pull load reversal. This becomes a tradeoff between a more secure coupling and a more comfortable towing experience.|$|R
5000|$|... {{since the}} <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> is still slowing down, the whole cycle repeats itself. The result {{is not only}} severe vibration, {{but the lack of}} {{effectiveness}} of the trailer brakes leaves the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> to do nearly all the braking. The front vehicle thus also fails to brake effectively, and lateral stability is also compromised, risking a jackknife situation.|$|R
