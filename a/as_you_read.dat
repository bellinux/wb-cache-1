[...] In addition to being necessary for virtually all blues musicians, the song is known to performers in several other genres, who would not otherwise play any blues. [...] Its popularity is such that one encyclopedia entry concludes, [...] "What bluesman does not have his own version?" [...] Billy Vera wrote [...] "rest assured, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> these notes, someone somewhere is performing 'Call It Stormy Monday'".|$|E
500|$|Each journal {{covers a}} {{different}} period of Mountstuart's life, {{and they are}} usually geographically named: The School Journal, London I, etc. Boyd varied the narrator's tone in each to demonstrate changes in Mountstuart's character. In the first London Journal he is, according to Boyd, a [...] "modernist aesthete", becoming a [...] "world-weary cynic" [...] in New York and finding [...] "serene and elegiac serenity" [...] in the final French journal. To support the book's historical themes and documentary premise, there is a feigned editorial apparatus: an index listing real people and their relation to Mountstuart alongside fictional characters, an editor's introduction (by Boyd), an authorial preface (by Mountstuart) {{and a list of}} works attributed to Mountstuart. An additional stylistic feature is the anonymous editor (Boyd), who introduces the book and offers explanatory footnotes, cross-references and attempts at dating. Since a journal is written from the perspective of each day, Mountstuart's moods change as events affect him. The form lends itself to [...] "plotlessness", since the author/narrator inevitably cannot see the overall structure of the story. Plot lines which [...] "fizzle and fade" [...] emphasise the theme of multiple selves throughout life. Boyd adds other aspects to the work, such as parenthetical musings that are never answered, to re-enforce the style. His tone of voice gradually changes as he ages: Boyd wanted the style to reflect the major theme that we change and grow throughout life: [...] "I wanted the literary tone of each journal to reflect this and so the voice subtly changes <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> on: from pretentious school boy to modern young decadent, to bitter realist to drink soaked cynic, to sage and serene octogenarian, and so forth." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{released}} a second book in 2003, titled Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown. The book, which was previously known as Good and Evil, chronicled nine case studies during {{her life as}} a Wiccan healer and gives explanations as to why those events happened. To promote the book, Chakraverti held a healing session at Oxford Bookstore in Kolkata, where she read excerpts from the book, and gave demonstration of her healing skills, holding the hand of a volunteer, tapping her with her athame (wand) and reciting Egyptian chants. After its release, the book received positive reaction from critics. Rajdeep Bains from The Tribune commented [...] "Sacred Evil is a very coherent account of the author’s dealings with witchcraft and sorcery. Unfortunately, it could add to superstition, which is already prevalent at an unhealthy level in our country. As a work of fiction it would have been laudable; given the cover of truth it becomes a dangerous piece of writing. [...] But what makes Sacred Evil so interesting is the juxtaposition of modern thought with the ageless. After every chapter there are notes on the practices described in it along with modern explanations." [...] Krithika Ranjan from The Hindu commented, [...] "Throughout [...] Chakraverti refers to herself as a skeptic. Yet the stories she tells are bound to raise the ire of [...] rationalists. You can almost hear one spluttering about superstition <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> the story Those who return. [...] In the final analysis, the book is a good read— whether you believe in the dark arts or whether you just want to curl up with a spine chiller." [...] Chakraverti started working on her third book, tentatively titled Every Strong Woman is a Witch.|$|E
