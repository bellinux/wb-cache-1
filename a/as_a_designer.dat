5|$|After the war, Emeco {{started selling}} 1006 chairs to prisons, {{hospitals}} and government offices. The chair {{was sold to}} restaurants in the 1980s and 1990s, under Jay Buchbinder's leadership, then <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> chair in the 2000s after Emeco was acquired by his son, Gregg. French designer Philippe Starck designed a total of 14 chairs and 4 tables for Emeco.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Morris' death, his poetry was known internationally and his company's {{products}} were found all over the world. In his lifetime, he was {{best known as a}} poet, although by the late twentieth-century he was primarily known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> of wallpapers and fabrics.|$|E
50|$|From 2000 to 2002, Bennett would explore various {{disciplines}} {{within the}} creative industry {{in an effort}} to expand his capabilities. In that time, he worked with Kinetic Studios <b>as</b> <b>a</b> graphic <b>designer,</b> CO2 Media <b>as</b> <b>an</b> interactive <b>designer</b> and Novak-Birch <b>as</b> <b>an</b> environmental <b>designer.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1880, Carrier-Belleuse– now art {{director}} of the Sèvres national porcelain factory– offered Rodin a part-time position <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>designer.</b> The offer was in part a gesture of reconciliation, and Rodin accepted. That part of Rodin which appreciated 18th-century tastes was aroused, and he immersed himself in designs for vases and table ornaments that brought the factory renown across Europe.|$|E
5|$|Although Fox {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} CinemaScope for a time, some actors disliked the system. For Fox's 1965 production Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar lenses be used. Such pressures led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars that year; Von Ryan's Express was the studio's first picture with Panavision lenses. To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection lenses, Gottschalk had Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses retrofitted into Panavision housings {{with a new}} astigmatic attachment, improving them greatly. This was revealed many years after Gottschalk's death; a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had {{been involved with the}} original CinemaScope project, came to work <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> for Panavision and—after opening some of the older lenses—figured out the secret.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{had hoped}} that being the author of an ongoing comic strip would improve his job prospects, for {{at the time he}} was {{beginning}} to develop a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> of postcards, stationary, and advertisements. Rather than representing an example of a comic as the medium would come to be understood in the following decade, The Adventures of Totor consisted of square boxes containing illustrations with the captions written separately underneath, as was the style found in French comic creator Christophe's works La Famille Fenouillard (The Fenouillard Family) and Sapeur Camembert (Sapper Camembert). Initially using four boxes per page, as the series progressed this was increased to six and then eight, with each page ending on a cliffhanger.|$|E
50|$|Pasion {{started his}} career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>designer's</b> {{apprentice}} for director Marilou Diaz-Abaya in the film Muro Ami in 1999, until he became a scriptwriter for movies Crying Ladies, Volta, and script consultant for Feng Shui, Milan.|$|R

50|$|In 1933, after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor, Gidoni left Berlin {{and settled}} in Tel Aviv. In 1938, she moved to New York, where she worked <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{interior}} <b>designer</b> for Heimer & Wagner before eventually finding work <b>as</b> <b>a</b> project <b>designer</b> at the architectural firm of Kahn & Jacobs.|$|R
5|$|Ida Marcia Camelhor {{was born}} on 31 October 1882 in Kovno, Russia to Mary (née Dember) and Louis Camelhor (also noted as Lieb Kamelhorn). She was the only {{surviving}} child {{of a family of}} eight. Before her first birthday, her parents immigrated to New York and then when she was around ten years old, they moved to Providence, Rhode Island. She attended public grammar school and high school and, at sixteen years old, went to work as a bookkeeper for Archibald Silverman. Archibald, also an immigrant, had begun his career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> of costume jewelry. Together with his brother, Charles, he established the Silverman Brothers jewelry company in Providence in 1897. After two years of working in the jewelry business, Camelhor agreed to marry her boss; they wed in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Development of Invisible War {{began at}} series creator Ion Storm {{following}} {{the success of}} the original Deus Ex. Most of the original game's development team returned to develop Invisible War, eager to both tell a new story and refine the original gameplay. There were also relative newcomers who had worked on the original game's PlayStation 2 (PS2) port. Harvey Smith, who worked as lead designer for the original game, was chosen by the original director and series creator Warren Spector to direct the game; Spector instead took on a supervisory role for both Invisible War and other projects within the company. While Smith was tempted to act as both director and designer, he saw that it would be too much work, so brought on Ricardo Bare as lead designer. Bare had been involved in the later development of Deus Ex, and despite his lack of experience <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> was given the role when more qualified staff members were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the actual}} {{software}} development work on the game was done at Artoon, with Takuya Matsumoto serving as director and Manabu Kusonoki responsible for the game's world view. Matsumoto previously worked <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> on , while Kusonoki {{is known for his}} work at Sega, including the world of Panzer Dragoon. Near the end of November 2005, roughly a year before the title was released in Japan, Artoon's Naoto Ohshima indicated that the game was around 40% complete. He also pointed out that Artoon had previously been known primarily for action titles, so that responsibility for Blue Dragon was originally somewhat frightening. Following this, a relative lack of media information for most of 2006 resulted in speculation that the title would be delayed until 2007, but Microsoft's Takashi Sensui confirmed in August 2006 that the game would indeed see a year-end 2006 release. Blue Dragon was eventually released on three full DVD discs, making it the first Xbox 360 game to span multiple discs.|$|E

5|$|While visiting Nintendo {{for other}} business, Itoi {{approached}} Shigeru Miyamoto about making Mother. When approved for a sequel, Itoi increased his involvement <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>designer</b> in the five-year development of EarthBound. When the project began to flounder, producer and later Nintendo president Satoru Iwata rescued the game. EarthBound English localizers were given great liberties when translating the Japanese game's cultural allusions. The American version sold poorly despite a multimillion-dollar marketing budget. Mother 3 was originally slated for release on the Nintendo 64 and its 64DD disk drive accessory, but was cancelled in 2000. Three years later, {{the project was}} reannounced for the Game Boy Advance alongside a rerelease of Mother and Mother 2 in a combined cartridge: Mother 1 + 2, released in 2003. The new Mother 3 abandoned the 3D graphics progress for a 2D style, and became a bestseller upon its release. EarthBound was rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013, and Mother received its English-language debut in 2015 for the same platform, retitled EarthBound Beginnings.|$|E
