5000|$|In {{addition}} to charging effects, AES {{data can be}} obscured {{by the presence of}} characteristic energy losses in a sample and higher order atomic ionization events. Electrons ejected from a solid will generally undergo multiple scattering events and lose energy in the form of collective electron density oscillations called plasmons. If plasmon losses have energies near that of an Auger peak, the less intense <b>Auger</b> <b>process</b> may become dwarfed by the plasmon peak. As Auger spectra are normally weak and spread over many eV of energy, they are difficult to extract from the background and in the presence of plasmon losses; deconvolution of the two peaks becomes extremely difficult. For such spectra, additional analysis through chemical sensitive surface techniques like x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is often required to disentangle the peaks. Sometimes an Auger spectrum can also exhibit [...] "satellite" [...] peaks at well-defined off-set energies from the parent peak. Origin of the satellites is usually attributed to multiple ionization events in an atom or ionization cascades in which a series of electrons is emitted as relaxation occurs for core holes of multiple levels. The presence of satellites can distort the true Auger peak and/or small peak shift information due to chemical bonding at the surface. Several studies have been undertaken to further quantify satellite peaks.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{electron}} microscopes that have been specifically designed for use in Auger spectroscopy; these are termed scanning Auger microscopes (SAM) and can produce high resolution, spatially resolved chemical images. SAM images are obtained by stepping a focused electron beam across a sample surface and measuring the intensity of the Auger peak above the background of scattered electrons. The intensity map is correlated to a gray scale on a monitor with whiter areas corresponding to higher element concentration. In addition, sputtering is sometimes used with Auger spectroscopy to perform depth profiling experiments. Sputtering removes thin outer layers of a surface so that AES can be used to determine the underlying composition. Depth profiles are shown as either Auger peak height vs. sputter time or atomic concentration vs. depth. Precise depth milling through sputtering has made profiling an invaluable technique for chemical analysis of nanostructured materials and thin films. AES is also used extensively as an evaluation tool on and off fab lines in the microelectronics industry, while the versatility and sensitivity of the <b>Auger</b> <b>process</b> makes it a standard analytical tool in research labs. Theoretically, Auger spectra can also be utilized to distinguish between protonation states. When a molecule is protonated or deprotonated, the geometry and electronic structure is changed, and AES spectra reflect this. In general, as a molecule becomes more protonated, the ionization potentials increase and the kinetic energy of the emitted outer shell electrons decreases.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} phenomenon underlying XANES is {{the absorption}} of an x-ray photon by condensed matter {{with the formation of}} many body excited states characterized by a core hole in a selected atomic core level. (see the first Figure). In the single particle theory approximation, the system is separated into one electron in the core levels of the selected atomic species of the system and N-1 passive electrons. In this approximation the final state is described by a core hole in the atomic core level and an excited photoelectron. The final state has a very short life time because of the short life-time of the core hole and the short mean free path of the excited photoelectron with kinetic energy in the range around 20-50 eV. The core hole is filled either via an <b>Auger</b> <b>process</b> or by capture of an electron from another shell followed by emission of a fluorescent photon. The difference between NEXAFS and traditional photoemission experiments is that in photoemission, the initial photoelectron itself is measured, while in NEXAFS the fluorescent photon or Auger electron or an inelastically scattered photoelectron may also be measured. The distinction sounds trivial but is actually significant: in photoemission the final state of the emitted electron captured in the detector must be an extended, free-electron state. By contrast in NEXAFS the final state of the photoelectron may be a bound state such as an exciton since the photoelectron itself need not be detected. The effect of measuring fluorescent photons, Auger electrons, and directly emitted electrons is to sum over all possible final states of the photoelectrons, meaning that what NEXAFS measures is the total joint density of states of the initial core level with all final states, consistent with conservation rules. The distinction is critical because in spectroscopy final states are more susceptible to many-body effects than initial states, meaning that NEXAFS spectra are more easily calculable than photoemission spectra. Due to the summation over final states, various sum rules are helpful in the interpretation of NEXAFS spectra. When the x-ray photon energy resonantly connects a core level with a narrow final state in a solid, such as an exciton, readily identifiable characteristic peaks will appear in the spectrum. These narrow characteristic spectral peaks give the NEXAFS technique a lot of its analytical power as illustrated by the B 1s π* exciton shown in the second Figure.|$|E
40|$|Auger {{recombination}} is {{an important}} nonradiative carrier recombination mechanism in many classes of optoelectronic devices. The microscopic <b>Auger</b> <b>processes</b> can be either direct or indirect, mediated by an additional scattering mechanism such as the electron-phonon interaction and alloy disorder scattering. Indirect Auger recombination is particularly strong in nitride materials and affects the efficiency of nitride optoelectronic devices at high powers.

Our measurement reveals two distinct time scales over which the photoexcited electrons and holes recombine; a fast time scale that lasts ∼ 2 ps and a slow time scale that lasts longer than ∼ 100 ps. The temperature and the pump fluence dependence of the observed carrier dynamics are consistent with defect-assisted recombination as being the dominant mechanism for electron-hole recombination in which the electrons and holes are captured by defects via <b>Auger</b> <b>processes.</b> Strong Coulomb interactions in two dimensional atomic materials, together with strong electron and hole correlations in two dimensional metal dichalcogenides, make <b>Auger</b> <b>processes</b> particularly effective for carrier capture by defects.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{mechanisms of}} Auger recombination of nonequilibrium carriers in semiconductor heterostructures with quantum wells are investigated. It is shown {{for the first}} time that there exist three fundamentally different Auger recombination mechanisms of (i) thresholdless, (ii) quasi-threshold, and (iii) threshold types. The rate of the thresholdless <b>Auger</b> <b>process</b> depends on temperature only slightly. The rate of the quasi-threshold <b>Auger</b> <b>process</b> depends on temperature exponentially. However, its threshold energy essentially varies with quantum well width and is close to zero for narrow quantum wells. It is shown that the thresholdless and the quasi-threshold Auger processes dominate in narrow quantum wells, while the threshold and the quasi-threshold processes prevail in wide quantum wells. The limiting case of a three-dimensional (3 D) <b>Auger</b> <b>process</b> is reached for infinitely wide quantum wells. The critical quantum well width is found at which the quasi-threshold and threshold Auger processes merge into a single 3 D <b>Auger</b> <b>process.</b> Also studied is phonon-assisted Auger recombination in quantum wells.

30|$|Weak {{radiative}} recombination {{is not uncommon}} in narrow gap III–V semiconductors, especially when nanostructured. Possibly, the increased surface-to-volume ratio gives rise to enhanced effect of surface recombination. Since surface states are typically below the bandgap energy, and since our InGaAs detector was limited to 0.6 eV, our experiment was practically blind to any emission below 0.6 eV. Surface deep levels usually mean surface depletion. However, narrow gap III–V semiconductors, especially In-based, such as InAs and InSb, {{are known to have}} their surface Fermi level pinned above the conduction band, giving rise to surface accumulation layer [10].
