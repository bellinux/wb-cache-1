The subsequent arrival of Price’s forces causes both Lash <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> to flee. Afterwards, President Matthew Ellis officially announces Price's organisation—the Advanced Threat Containment Unit—as a replacement for the now underground S.H.I.E.L.D., and they begin hunting their next target after Gutierrez: Campbell. A computer simulation informs Coulson that the Terrigen may cover the entire world within the next 18 months.|$|E

5|$|If {{there is}} a halo effect {{spreading}} to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners.

After a midweek European football match, Arsenal beat Notts County by two goals, a result which moved them fourth in the table.|$|E
5|$|Crimewave is a 1986 American comedy film {{directed}} by Sam Raimi, written {{by him and}} the Coen brothers, and starring Louise Lasser, Paul L. Smith, Brion James, Sheree J. Wilson, Edward R. Pressman, Bruce Campbell, and Reed Birney, with Campbell also serving as a producer. Following the commercial success of The Evil Dead (1981), Raimi <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> decided to collaborate on another project. Joel Coen of the Coen brothers served {{as one of the}} editors on The Evil Dead, and worked with Raimi on the screenplay. Production was difficult for several members of the crew, and the production studio, Embassy Pictures, refused to allow Raimi to edit the film. Several arguments broke out during the shoot for the film, because of continued interference by the studio.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W. Campbell {{found that}} the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the atmosphere of Mars {{is similar to that}} of the Earth. Previous detections of water in the atmosphere of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, guitarists Mark Morton and Matt Conner, bassist John Campbell {{and drummer}} Chris Adler started a band named Burn the Priest. The band members {{knew each other}} from the college they were all attending, Virginia Commonwealth University, in Richmond, Virginia. Morton and Conner left the band soon after its {{inception}} to pursue master's degrees. Adler <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> replaced Morton with Abe Spear. For the next five years, the band practiced in Richmond and around Virginia. In 1995, the band released its self-titled first demo. After the demo, Burn the Priest recorded two split EPs with Agents of Satan and ZED respectively. After the band's first three demos, Burn the Priest added vocalist Randall Blythe to its line up.|$|E
5|$|In post-production, Embassy's self-imposed role {{in making}} Crimewave was even greater. Although Raimi, Tapert, <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> {{insisted that they}} had made the film as partners, the studio refused — because of the already {{ballooning}} costs — to pay for Campbell to stay in Los Angeles during post-production (although the executives later compromised). The studio replaced Raimi's music composer, Joseph LoDuca, with {{one of its own}} choosing. It did the same with the editor, removing Raimi's influence over the film's final cut.|$|E

5|$|Raimi <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> grew up together, {{and have}} been friends from a young age. The duo {{directed}} several low-budget Super 8 mm film projects together. Several were comedies, including Clockwork and It's Murder!. Shooting a suspense scene in It's Murder! inspired Raimi to approach {{a career in the}} horror genre, and after researching horror cinema at drive-in theaters, Raimi was set on directing a horror film. The idea was to shoot a short film first, which would attract the interest of producers, and then use the money gained from that to shoot a full-length project. The short film that Raimi created was called Within the Woods. It was produced for $1,600, but for The Evil Dead, Raimi needed over $100,000.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army's regular {{units are}} {{concentrated}} in a few bases, {{most of which are}} located in Australia's northern states. The Army's operational headquarters, Forces Command, is located at Victoria Barracks in Sydney. Most elements of the Army's three regular brigades are based at Robertson Barracks near Darwin, Lavarack Barracks in Townsville, Queensland, and Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane. The 1st Division's Headquarters is also located at Gallipoli Barracks. Other important Army bases include the Army Aviation Centre near Oakey, Queensland, Holsworthy Barracks near Sydney, Woodside Barracks near Adelaide, South Australia <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> Barracks in Perth. Dozens of Army Reserve depots are located across Australia.|$|E
5|$|The large centre canvas has {{not been}} {{positively}} identified. However both Koch <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> believe that a damaged Crucifixion, now in the Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, was probably the centrepiece. Its size (181×153.5cm) is exactly double that of the four wing panels. Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export, most likely to Venice. The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works {{had fallen out of}} fashion by the 17th century, and would have had more value as single panels.|$|E

The Evil Dead {{would go on to}} be the first installment of a film franchise spawning two sequels, Evil Dead II (1987), and Army of Darkness (1992), both of which were directed by Raimi and featured Campbell as Ash Williams. A remake, known as Evil Dead, was released in 2013 with Raimi <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> as producers and creative consultants. In 2015, the Starz television network began airing the ongoing comedy horror series Ash vs Evil Dead, which features Bruce Campbell returning as an older Ash Williams.|$|E
5|$|After the Inhuman leader Jiaying {{refuses to}} risk {{anyone else to}} rescue Campbell, Raina {{receives}} a vision of Skye saving him, and convinces Gordon to take Skye to the Playground, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s base. Coulson reforms his original S.H.I.E.L.D. team of May, Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, and Jemma Simmons, and they fly to the Arctic in their old mobile command base, a plane called the Bus. Their approach is detected by Hydra, who shoot down the Bus with missiles, but the team escape in a quinjet and infiltrate the base with Bakshi's help. Coulson, May, and Fitz break into the base's control rooms to steal information about Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker's primary headquarters in the small Eastern European nation of Sokovia, while Skye, Ward, Bakshi, and Simmons rescue Peterson <b>and</b> <b>Campbell.</b> During the rescue, Simmons attempts to kill Ward as she once promised she would, but Bakshi {{gets in the way}} and Simmons murders him instead, and Ward flees after sparing Simmons' life.|$|E
5|$|Raimi {{was able}} to secure $1600 to produce the film. Raimi <b>and</b> <b>Campbell</b> {{collected}} a group of their friends and family {{who were interested in}} participating in the production of the film. The film was primarily shot at a farm house belonging to one of Raimi's friends located in Marshall, Michigan. One of the regular actors involved with Raimi's early short films, Ellen Sandweiss, was cast as the film's protagonist. This decision stemmed from the notion that most horror films at the time involved female leads, who were more enjoyable to watch terrorized. The current boyfriend of Sandweiss was cast as the film's antagonist, a demon who threatens the cast. Campbell was cast as one of the protagonists, though he initially was not familiar with horror cinema and instead identified as a fan of comedies. One of the films that inspired Campbell's interest in the genre was John Carpenter's film Halloween. Another Raimi regular, Scott Spiegel, was also cast as a protagonist based on his prior collaborations with the group.|$|E

The Freeths <b>and</b> <b>Campbells,</b> as well as their workers, were driven from the property. As of 2011, the Mount Carmel estate has become derelict <b>and</b> overgrown. Mike <b>Campbell</b> died in April 2011, though Freeth has stated his intention to continue fighting to take back ownership of the property. He also was a symbol of hope in the country.|$|R
