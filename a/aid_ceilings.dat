40|$|Tliis report {{describes}} measurements OIL indoor {{reception of}} a 7 MHz OFDM signal at it center frequency of 762 MHz. The cliannel impulse response ancl the facliiig cliaracteristics {{in the frequency}} domain and the spatial domain are measured. Fiutlierniore, a 11 iiidication is given {{of the effect of}} building attenuation. From Iiieasureiiieiits in tlie urban area of Eiiidlioveii, it appears that no significant cliffereiice can be observed in the echo profiles witli indoor or outdoor reception witlioiit line-of-sight. hi both cases, strong echoes (up to 30 dB weaker than tlie main sipal) are observed with delays up to 5 - 10 p. Tliis corresponds very well with the oiitcoiiie of COST- 207. Building penetration loss is due to atteiiuatioii or shielding of the radio signals by walls, floors <b>aid</b> <b>ceilings.</b> Using over 300 ineasureiiieiit ruis iii different rooins at differerit floors in 40 residential houses, apartment biiildiiigs and office buildings iii Eiiicilioveii, the l~iulcling penetration loss at 762 MHz can be determined. One iiieasiueineiit rim gives the received iiarrow-bancl signal power at more than 1000 positions witliin it room on a circle with...|$|E
40|$|In 2009, the Competition Council's {{activity}} {{regarding the}} state aid field has considered Romania's obligations {{as a member}} state, and the fulfillment of some specific tasks by the competition authority acquired after January 1, 2007. In this regard, the Competition Council has encouraged the collaboration between institutions to develop projects of state aid schemes. In 2010 there were six major investment projects approved, four of them being in the photovoltaic sector in which three are in Germany, one is in Spain and the rest concern the mechanical industry in Germany and Italy. Also, there were approved five ad hoc aid measures in favor of individual enterprises, for investments {{in areas that are}} on the regional aid maps for the period 2007 - 2013, and ten aid schemes, of which five related to the outermost regions. In accordance with the guidelines on national regional aids for 2007 - 2013, the Commission developed a statistical evaluation of the situation of state aid and regional <b>aid</b> <b>ceiling</b> which received a transitional assisted area status under Article 107 paragraph 3 letters (a) by the end of 2010. The Commission accepted the changes introduced by the three member states (France, Ireland and Italy) in state aid maps for certain regions eligible for regional aid under Article 107 paragraph 3 letter (c) ...|$|R
