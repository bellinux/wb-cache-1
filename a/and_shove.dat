25|$|Around 9:10p.m., power {{failed in}} the building, {{extinguishing}} the lights. Panic ensued, and even {{those who had been}} calmly moving toward exits in the Cabaret Room began to push <b>and</b> <b>shove</b> each other. The situation was made worse by the fact that of the three exits in the room, two were quickly blocked off by the fire, leaving the crowd to funnel through a single exit. Employees outside the exits attempted to pull guests to safety, but the crush of bodies as those behind pushed upon those in front became so solid that no amount of strength could free most of them. Many of those who escaped the crush blocking the northeast fire exit became lost trying to find other exits. Twists and turns in building design which led to a set of doors opening into a bar area funneled some into a dead end.|$|E

The band collaborated with many producers and other artists to record Rock Steady in under a year, mixing the band's new wave and pop sounds with ragga music. The album was a comeback for the band, selling well and yielding career-highest singles chart positions. After Rock Steady, the band released several compilations and went on hiatus.
