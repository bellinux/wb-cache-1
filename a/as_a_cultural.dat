5|$|The {{line has}} been {{suggested}} preserved <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, since it represents one of very few railways with the original narrow gauge profile intact.

The organization Friends of the Flekkefjord Line offer rental of draisines for tourists since {{the closure of the}} line, and a round trip from Flekkefjord to Bakkekleivi just outside Sira takes about three hours. However, the Norwegian National Rail Administration have since banned the operation of draisines until the line is fully fenced in.|$|E
