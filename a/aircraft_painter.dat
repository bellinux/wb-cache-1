40|$|AbstractA {{dramatically}} increasing {{trend in}} the population of <b>aircraft</b> <b>painters</b> with permanent physical limitations was identified among participants in the return-to-work program at a large aircraft maintenance facility. The increase came primarily from painters who had used a full-depth mechanical sanding depainting process. A detailed ergonomic assessment of the process was begun to elicit details of the range and types of risks faced by painters in that shop, and determine what types of mitigation might be utilized to minimize the prevalence of injury. Shoulder injuries represent the biggest area of ergonomic risk for painters. Cervical problems, hand/wrist problems, and lumbar problems make {{up the majority of}} the remainder of injuries. The extent, duration, and complexity of the risks involved in the depaint process required more data than the typical observational and psychophysical assessment tools could provide. Inertial motion capture and tool force instrumentation was implemented in combination with the typical ergonomic methods to provide more details as to the biomechanical sources of risk and how this varies throughout the depainting process. The results indicate surprisingly high normal forces on the palm sander, with rapid muscle fatigue and frequent postural substitution evident during overhead sanding. The long duration of this overhead activity, in combination with the evidence of fatigue, implicates the development of risky scapulo-humeral kinematics and end-of-range glenohumeral motion in the etiology of shoulder and cervical injuries. A mix of management and engineering strategies for mitigation resulted from the analysis...|$|R

Materials and methods From the Reykjavik study database, 18, 840 men and women born in the period 1907 - 1935 were linked with a population-based registry containing all RCCs diagnosed in Iceland from 1971 to 2005 (n[*]=[*] 910). From this cross-reference, altogether 225 cases were identified. A prospective analysis of the risk factors for RCC was performed using Cox regression analysis, from the time of entry into the Reykjavik study to the diagnosis of RCC, death or end of follow-up, with a median follow-up time of 25 years. The hazard ratio (HR) was then calculated for multiple risk factors including occupational history. Results Male gender [HR 1. 65, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 14 - 2. 38], body mass index (BMI) over 25  kg/m² (HR 1. 41, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 1. 88) and age (HR 1. 04, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 07) increased the risk of RCC, as did severe hypertension (> 160 / 100  mmHg) (HR 1. 46, 95 % CI 1. 05 - 2. 03) and history of kidney disease (HR 1. 55, 95 % CI 1. 11 - 2. 16); however, smoking and type 2 diabetes were not significantly associated with the disease. The risk of RCC was significantly increased in painters (HR 2. 97, 95 % CI 1. 31 - 6. 74), aircraft mechanics (HR 4. 51, 95 % CI 1. 11 - 18. 28) and shipbuilders (HR 2. 03, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 3. 84). Conclusions Together with male gender, advanced age, hypertension, BMI over 25  kg/m² and history of kidney disease, the risk of RCC was significantly increased in <b>painters,</b> <b>aircraft</b> mechanics and shipbuilders, suggesting a link to occupational exposure...|$|R
