50|$|Not all of Scanlan’s work in Steubenville was successful. One {{failure was}} his {{invention}} of the civic group, Citizens for Clean Air (CCA). Steubenville was a highly industrialized area, and pollution was a serious problem for the town. The CCA attempted {{to inform the public}} about new <b>anti-pollution</b> <b>technologies</b> and other practices to cut down on industrial pollution. Unfortunately, the many steel mills and other factories in Steubenville ignored the group. The CCA was unable to make any changes {{to improve the quality of}} air in Steubenville.|$|E
50|$|The Clean Air Act {{was enacted}} by the United States Congress and signed by President Richard Nixon in 1970. The main {{provisions}} of the Clean Air Act were to control air pollution {{on a national level}} and an initiative program called New Source Review (NSR). The NSR initiative would require power plants to upgrade to <b>anti-pollution</b> <b>technologies</b> before they can expand existing facilities and add new technologies. The Clear Skies initiative proposed by the Bush administration main intention was to remove the New Source Review provision and deregulate some of the standards that the Clean Air Act required energy facilities to meet. The proposed removal of the NSR prompted nine northeastern states to file suit in federal court to prevent the new ruling. Advocates against Clear Skies viewed the removal of NSR as a weakening of existing laws and an “assault on the Clean Air Act”. Environmental advocates and their political allies would eventually prevail in defeating the Clear Skies initiative.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper uses {{innovation}} strengths indicators {{based on}} pollution prevention and abatement (or anti-pollution) patents lodged at the US Patent and Trademark Office {{for the period}} 1975 - 2002 to: (i) analyse trends in the patenting of <b>anti-pollution</b> <b>technologies</b> in the USA; and (ii) provide international rankings {{for the development of}} <b>anti-pollution</b> <b>technologies.</b> Annual data used for the innovation strengths indicators are patent shares to represent international presence, the technological specialisation index to represent national priorities, and the rate of assigned patents to represent potential economic benefits. The empirical results demonstrate the clear advantage held by Japan and France among the leading twelve foreign countries with patents in the USA...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses {{innovation}} strengths indicators {{based on}} patents lodged at the US Patent and Trademark Office from 1975 to 2002 : (i) to analyse {{trends in the}} patenting of pollution prevention and abatement (or <b>anti-pollution)</b> <b>technologies</b> in the USA; and (ii) to provide international rankings {{for the development of}} <b>anti-pollution</b> <b>technologies.</b> As the indicators are not directly measurable, accurate approximations are used, namely patent shares for international presence, the technological specialisation index for national priorities, and the rate of assigned patents for potential economic benefits. The findings of the paper demonstrate the clear advantage Japan and France have out of the group of the top 12 foreign countries patenting in the USA...|$|E

Ecological and pollution prevention technology patents have increased steadily over time, with the 1990 's having been a period of intensive patenting of technologies related to the environment. The time-varying nature of the volatility of anti-pollution technology patents registered in the USA is examined using monthly data from the US Patent and Trademark Office for the period January 1975 to Decembe...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the asymmetric {{volatility of}} patents related to pollution prevention and abatement (hereafter, <b>anti-pollution)</b> <b>technologies</b> {{registered in the}} USA. Ecological and pollution prevention technology patents have increased steadily over time, with the 1990 's having been a period of intensive patenting of technologies related to the environment. The time-varying nature of the volatility of anti-pollution technology patents registered in the USA is examined using monthly data from the US Patent and Trademark Office for the period January 1975 to December 1999. Alternative symmetric and asymmetric volatility models, such as GARCH, GJR and EGARCH, are estimated and tested against each other using full sample and rolling windows estimation...|$|E
40|$|Traffic is {{considered}} one of the major polluting sectors and as a consequence a significant cause for the measured exceedances of ambient air quality limit values mainly in urban areas. The Greater Athens Area (located in Attica), the most populated area in Greece, faces severe air pollution problems due to the combination of high road traffic emissions, complex topography and local meteorological conditions. Even though several efforts were made to construct traffic emission inventories for Greece and Attica, still there is not a spatially and temporally resolved one, based on data from relevant authorities and organisations. The present work aims to estimate road emissions in Greece and Attica based on the top down approach. The programme COPERT 4 was used to calculate the annual total emissions from the road transport sector for the period 2006 – 2010 and an emission inventory for Greece and Attica was developed with high spatial (6 × 6 km 2 for Greece and 2 × 2 km 2 for Attica) and temporal (1 -hour) resolutions. The results revealed that about 40 % of national CO 2, CO, VOC and NMVOC values and 30 % of NOx and particles are emitted in Attica. The fuel consumption and the subsequent reduction of annual mileage driven in combination with the import of new engine <b>anti-pollution</b> <b>technologies</b> affected CO 2, CO, VOC and NMVOC emissions. The major part of CO (56. 53 %) and CO 2 (66. 15 %) emissions was due to passenger cars (2010), while heavy duty vehicles (HDVs) were connected with NOx, PM 2. 5 and PM 10 emissions with 51. 27 %, 43. 97 % and 38. 13 % respectively (2010). The fleet composition, the penetration of diesel fuelled cars, the increase of urban average speed and the fleet renewal are among the most effective parameters towards the emission reduction strategies...|$|E
40|$|The case {{examines}} {{efforts by}} the Chinese government and local authorities to restore the Huiahe River, a 1, 000 kilometer waterway which runs through four provinces in eastern China. The river basin, covering an area of some 270, 000 square kilometers, is home to almost 150 million people and {{represents one of the}} most important areas of agricultural output in China. As a result of rapid economic development, the river has, over the past twenty years, become seriously polluted. This has had dire consequences for industries that depend on the river, notably agriculture and fishing. As well, the limited groundwater supplies in eastern China have meant that surface water has always been an important source of supply for residential and industrial uses. The pollution of the Huaihe has therefore had serious public health consequences. In mid- 1995, the Chinese government formally adopted an ambitious plan to restore the water quality in the river. The case is based on material gathered from secondary sources, supplemented by interviews conducted with government officials and company managers in Beijing and Anhui province in China. The case begins with an overview of the impact of economic growth on the Chinese environment, and the steps which China has taken to address its growing environmental challenges. The case then focuses on the plan as proposed by the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences (CRAES). The case goes on to describe some of the early implementation measures taken as part of the plan, in particular the forced closure of hundreds of small factories that have sprung up along the banks of the river. The case outlines the various stakeholders affected by the plan and its ultimate success or failure. These include local residents and businesses, various Chinese government ministries, multilateral lending agencies and international suppliers of <b>anti-pollution</b> <b>technologies.</b> The ultimate success of the plan is, at the time of this writing, not known. Future issues and questions that will affect the plan's success are then described. These include resistance by some elements of the Chinese government concerned about foreign debts incurred to finance the cleanup plan; local officials who may not wish to sacrifice short-term economic growth for environmental protection; and businesses concerned about the financial burden of having to install new clean technologies. ...|$|E
