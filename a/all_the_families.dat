5|$|<b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> were {{formerly}} {{treated as}} part of a single order, Mecoptera. The relationships between the families are however a matter of debate. The cladogram, from Cracraft and Donoghue 2004, places the Nannochoristidae as a separate order, with the Boreidae, sister to the Siphonaptera, also as its own order. The Eomeropidae is suggested to be sister {{to the rest of the}} Mecoptera, with the position of the Bittacidae unclear. Of those other families, the Meropeidae is the most basal, and the relationships of the rest not completely clear.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{flowering}} plant order Caryophyllales, most members produce betalains and lack anthocyanins. Of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> in the Caryophyllales, only the Caryophyllaceae (carnation family) and Molluginaceae produce anthocyanins instead of betalains. The limited distribution of betalains among plants is a synapomorphy for the Caryophyllales, though their production {{has been lost}} in two families.|$|E

25|$|Conifers are {{the largest}} and {{economically}} most important component group of the gymnosperms, but nevertheless they comprise {{only one of the}} four groups. The division Pinophyta consists of just one class, Pinopsida, which includes both living and fossil taxa. Subdivision of the living conifers into two or more orders has been proposed from time to time. The most commonly seen in the past was a split into two orders, Taxales (Taxaceae only) and Pinales (the rest), but recent research into DNA sequences suggests that this interpretation leaves the Pinales without Taxales as paraphyletic, and the latter order is no longer considered distinct. A more accurate subdivision would be to split the class into three orders, Pinales containing only Pinaceae, Araucariales containing Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae, and Cupressales containing the remaining families (including Taxaceae), but there has not been any significant support for such a split, with the majority of opinion preferring retention of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> within a single order Pinales, despite their antiquity and diverse morphology.|$|E

500|$|Banksy's op-ed {{article about}} One World Trade Center, posted on his website on 27 October, came as {{an insult to}} many across the city.

[...] Sally Regenhard, a leading voice for families of 11 September victims, expressed concerns about Banksy's 15 October depiction of the Twin Towers in TriBeCa, saying the piece was [...] "horrific" [...] and that the placed flower looked more like an explosion. A Century 21 department store near Ground Zero had planned to show Banksy's work on 29 October, but cancelled due to the controversy.|$|E

[...] The Eddys and Kesebergs joined the Breens, attempting to make it over the pass, but they found [...] drifts of snow, and were unable to find the trail. They turned back for Truckee Lake and, within a day, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> were camped there except for the Donners, who were [...] below them—half a day's journey.

He makes Bart interested in the subject by talking about Roosevelt's heroic and rebellious nature. [...] Classmates Milhouse, Nelson, Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph soon join Bart in his education.|$|E
500|$|None of {{the party}} had any {{remaining}} faith in the Hastings Cutoff as they recovered at the springs {{on the other side}} of the desert. They spent several days trying to recover cattle, retrieve the wagons left in the desert, and transfer their food and supplies to other wagons. Reed's family incurred the heaviest losses, and Reed became more assertive, asking <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> to submit an inventory of their goods and food to him. He suggested that two men should go to Sutter's Fort in California; he had heard that John Sutter was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers, and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip. The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by mongrel teams of cows, oxen, and mules. It was the middle of September, and two young men who went in search of missing oxen reported that another [...] long stretch of desert lay ahead.|$|E
500|$|On September 8, 1872, two Danish pioneer pastors, Adam Dan and Rasmus Andersen, {{established}} a small organization in Neenah, Wisconsin, which {{later became the}} Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. At one of the churches' conventions in Clinton, Iowa, in 1884, the Danish farmer Rasmus Hansen of Elk Horn, Iowa, suggested that [...] "the Danish Church should help <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> living around in cities, who would prefer living in the countryside, where they could find a fitting spot for a Danish colony." [...] A committee was appointed {{for the purpose of}} finding a piece of land for the scattered Danish immigrants to settle. The committee consisted of the Grundtvigian Evangelical-Lutheran pastors F.L. Grundtvig (the son of N. F. S. Grundtvig), Kristian Anker, Rasmus Hansen, Jens C. Kjær, and C.Bruhn. This committee soon made arrangements with Winona and the St.Peter Railroad Company to purchase [...] of land in the southeastern part of Lincoln County, Minnesota. An agreement with the land agent, A.Bojsen, stipulated that for three years this land was to be sold only to Danish people. The land was rolling prairie by the hills of Buffalo Ridge, just south of the community of Tyler, Minnesota. By June27, 1885, seventy settlers from various states, towns, and communities had made the area their home.|$|E
