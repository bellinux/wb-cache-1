5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen {{is in the foreground}} at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E
500|$|Noreen's {{family has}} {{received}} threats and {{has gone into}} hiding. Ashiq, her husband, stated that he was <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> their children go outside. He also expressed concern about how Noreen would be kept safe should she be released, saying, [...] "No one will let her live. The mullahs are saying they will kill her when she comes out." [...] Her family declined {{to leave the country}} while she remained in prison, but Italy, France, and Spain all offered to grant her and her family asylum in the event of her release.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} considered screening {{the first}} part of the season premiere at Comic-Con in San Diego, but ultimately decided against it because they thought the scene [...] "ends in such an exciting way that we were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it out". As a promotion, Fox did send out a DVD [...] "screener" [...] package of the premiere to certain journalists, which included a copy of the New York Times article shown in the first season finale as well as a piece of paper with a list of typed phrases. The paper was a copy of the instructions one of the shapeshifters received on the typewriter, which included phrases like [...] "Mission Accomplished" [...] and [...] "Target Terminated".|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{was introduced in}} Batman #1 (1940), in which he announces that he will kill three of Gotham's prominent citizens (including Mayor Henry Claridge). Although the police protect Claridge, the Joker had poisoned him before making his announcement and Claridge dies with a ghastly grin on his face; Batman eventually defeats him, sending him to prison. The Joker commits whimsical, brutal crimes for reasons that, in Batman's words, [...] "make sense to him alone". Detective Comics #168 (1951) introduced the Joker's first origin story as Red Hood: a criminal who, during his final heist, vanishes after leaping into a vat of chemicals to escape Batman. His resulting disfigurement led him to adopt the name [...] "Joker", from the playing card figure he came to resemble. The Joker's Silver-Age transformation into a figure of fun was established in 1952's [...] "The Joker's Millions". In this story the Joker is obsessed with maintaining his illusion of wealth and celebrity as a criminal folk hero, <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Gotham's citizens {{know that he is}} penniless and was tricked out of his fortune. The 1970s redefined the character as a homicidal psychopath. [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge" [...] has the Joker taking violent revenge on the former gang members who betrayed him; in [...] "The Laughing Fish" [...] the character chemically adds his face to Gotham's fish (hoping to profit from a copyright), killing bureaucrats who stand in his way.|$|E
2500|$|The {{season began}} with sophomore Carnie Norris {{starting}} ahead of Walker at tailback as the Bulldogs faced the University of Tennessee on September 6 in Knoxville.

2500|$|Nadal's playing {{style and}} {{personality}} can be summarised by Jimmy Connors," [...] He's {{built out of}} a mold that I think I came from also, that you walk out there, you give everything you have {{from the very first}} point to the end no matter what the score. And you're willing to lay it all out on the line and you're not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the people see that." ...|$|E
60|$|Christmas-day was {{not allowed}} to pass without being a festival for her, in her quiet room, where she lay, full of musings on his lonely Christmas night last year, his verses folded among her {{precious}} books, and the real joy of the season more within her grasp than in the turmoil of last year. She was not <b>afraid</b> now <b>to</b> <b>let</b> herself fancy his voice in the Angel's Song, and the rainbow was shining on her cloud.|$|R

[...] She was now {{trying to think of}} {{something}} she might say that would be sufficiently disagreeable to make him cease to insist on accompanying her; for, strange to record--if anything, in a person of that intense sensibility, be stranger than any other--her second thought with regard to having asked him had deepened with the elapsing moments into an unreasoned terror of the effect of his presence.

2500|$|According to Gaskarth, [...] "Do You Want Me (Dead?)" [...] is a up-tempo {{track that}} begins the album with [...] "a great guitar hook {{and lots of}} energy." [...] He said the song talks about [...] "feeling like you're being {{stretched}} to your limits by somebody. Gaskarth visited Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo at his house and ended up co-writing [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'". He called Cuomo [...] "such a cool guy to work with." [...] Gaskarth said the track was [...] "an ode to {{having a good time}} and not taking yourself too seriously." [...] Barakat called the track [...] "a great song ... It has a cool Weezer/All Time Low/party hybrid-vibe to it." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Forget About It" [...] details [...] "that place in a relationship where people have been together for a really long time and they're <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go." [...] Despite this, he said it was [...] "a totally fun song." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Guts" [...] was [...] "about finding within yourself the ability to say and do what you want no matter what the repercussions might be." [...] Maja Ivarsson from The Sounds provides guest vocals on the track. Gaskarth said Ivarsson was [...] "someone I’ve always respected vocally". He added that the pair [...] "both sound really similar ... she definitely sounds like a girl and I sorta sound like a girl so there’s a weird mix that happens but trust me it works for the song." [...] He called the track [...] "a departure for us as it's more universal and timeless than we've ever been." ...|$|E

2500|$|Livni led the Israeli {{negotiation}} team in {{the peace}} talks, brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Middle East envoy Martin Indyk from July 2013 until April 2014. Upon announcing the resumption of talks between Israel and the Palestinians {{at a press conference}} delivered at the U.S. State Department, Livni criticized the [...] "cynicism and pessimism" [...] surrounding Israeli–Palestinian peace process, and expressed hope that the negotiators would do everything in their power to transform a [...] "spark of hope into something real and lasting." [...] In concluding remarks praised for their poignancy, she said, [...] "I believe that history is not made by cynics. It is made by realists who are not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> dream. And <b>let</b> us be these people." [...] The process collapsed in April 2014 when internal political difficulties prevented Israel from releasing a promised fourth tranche of pre-Oslo prisoners and the Palestinians reacted by acceding to several international treaties. Indyk cited Israel's settlement policy during the talks as a critical factor leading to the collapse.|$|R

5000|$|In The Trial of Rouen, Dello Joio {{completely}} {{removed the}} character of the Dauphin of France/Charles VII of France, choosing instead to focus on Joan's trial and execution. The production starred soprano Elaine Malbin in the title role, baritone Hugh Thompson as Cauchon, bass Chester Watson as Father Julien, and baritone Paul Ukena as the Jailer. There were also six inquisitors and three heavenly voices in the cast. Peter Herman Adler conducted the Symphony of the Air for the production. The opera was broadcast nationally on NBC television on April 8, 1956, to an audience in the millions. Music critic Howard Taubman was overall positive about the work, stating that [...] "The NBC Television opera gave The Trial at Rouen a brilliant production, {{one of the best in}} a growing line of video presentations." [...] However, his comments on the effectiveness of the work were mixed. He said the following in his review in The New York Times: The Trial at Rouen is a high-minded attempt to come to grips with the subject of the martyrdom of Saint Joan. Its mood is reverent without turning ponderous. It is always lyrical and occasionally tense with drama. It combines words and music with an ease that makes the enfolding of the song seem natural and with a poetry that heightens its emotion... Does his opera give us Joan in all her innocence and radiance? One would have to say it comes close but is defeated in the end. One of Mr. Dello Joio's troubles is that his libretto lacks contrast and his characters are almost of one shade. In the case of Joan, this fault is rectified by variety and subtlety in the music. However, the music, though it is not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> sing, <b>lets</b> us down in the climaxes by failing to sing with sufficient intensity.|$|R
