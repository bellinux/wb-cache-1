5|$|In 2009, Superior Court Judge Jack Panella won a $770 bid on {{the auction}} website eBay to {{flip the switch}} {{and turn on the}} Peace Candle during the candle-lighting {{ceremony}} on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might need to be replaced sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace Candle cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight-year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace Candle, opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale {{to raise money for the}} candle. They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting.|$|E
5|$|The {{cutting of}} the first sod for the Isle of Axholme Light Railway was <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> grander occasion. It took place on 20 July 1899, and was {{reported}} at great length in the Epworth Bells newspaper. The ceremony was performed by Miss Bletcher, the daughter {{of one of the}} Directors, after which a luncheon for {{a large number of people}} was held in a marquee. Following speeches, about 400 children were given a free tea in the Temperance Hall, while adults were catered for in the schoolrooms of four local chapels. Sports were then held, watched by a crowd of 1,500, and finally there was a fireworks display. Most of the children later received a commemorative medal.|$|E
5|$|There {{are fewer}} records of {{elephants}} {{being used as}} straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by Josephus and the deuterocanonical book of 3 Maccabees {{in connection with the}} Egyptian Jews, though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by Ptolemy IV Philopator (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of Dionysus. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants. The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1018 Ivan Vladislav besieged Dyrrhachium, but in February {{he was killed}} under {{the walls of the}} city. The {{accounts}} of his death are contradictory. According to some he became victim of a plot and was killed by his servants; according to others, he perished in battle. The Bulgarian additions to the Skylitzes Chronicle are more detailed, saying that Ivan Vladislav dueled with the strategos of Dyrrhachium, the patrikios Niketas Pegonites, on horseback, and while fighting, two Byzantine infantrymen from the audience rushed to the emperor and wounded him mortally in the belly. A later Byzantine historian claimed that the duel was fair and Pegonites stabbed Ivan Vladislav in the chest with his spear, killing him instantly. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja reports <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> different story: while having a meal in his camp, the emperor was attacked by an unknown soldier, in whom Ivan Vladislav seemed to have recognized the murdered Jovan Vladimir. Terrified, he cried for help but no one rushed to his rescue and the unknown soldier mortally wounded the Bulgarian ruler.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 16th century, the Catholic Church {{had been}} the sole {{official}} Christian faith in the Holy Roman Empire. Martin Luther's initial agenda called for the reform of the Church's doctrines and practices, but after his excommunication from the Church his ideas became embodied in <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> separate religious movement, Lutheranism. Initially dismissed by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V as an inconsequential argument between monks, {{the idea of a}} reformation of the Church's doctrines, considered infallible and sacrosanct by Catholic teaching, accentuated controversy and competition in many of the territories of the Holy Roman Empire and quickly devolved into armed factions that exacerbated existing social, political and territorial grievances. These tensions were embodied in such alliances as the Protestant Schmalkaldic League, through which many of the Lutheran princes agreed to protect each other from encroachment on their territories and local authority; in retaliation, the princes that remained loyal to the Catholic Church formed the defensive Holy League. By the mid-1530s, the German-speaking states of the Holy Roman Empire had devolved into armed factions determined by family ties, geographic needs, religious loyalties, and dynastic aspirations. The religious issue both accentuated and masked these secular conflicts.|$|E

25|$|As a {{distinct}} movement, Pietism had its greatest strength {{by the middle}} of the 18th century; its very individualism in fact helped to prepare the way for the Enlightenment (Aufklärung), which took the church in <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> different direction.

While it is true that many sensitive documents were destroyed, the bureaucracy nonetheless was so immense and so dispersed, that most pertinent materials could be reconstructed either from copies or from a vast array of more peripheral ones.|$|E

25|$|Phages may be {{released}} via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, {{in a few}} cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called endolysin, which attacks and breaks down the cell wall peptidoglycan. <b>An</b> <b>altogether</b> different phage type, the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain Mycoplasma phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a lysogenic cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as prophage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} level, with the {{development}} of consciousness, love, although continuous with its lower forms, attains a higher form because of its relation to reason. In the beginning these two factors are in a natural harmony, but the one doesn't have conscious access to the other. Each one operates almost separately from the other. Then comes a stage where reason and love come in rapport and conflict with each other, yet the important factor is that they start coming simultaneously in the conscious sphere. Then comes a third stage where a synthesis of love and reason is achieved to bring <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> new type of consciousness, best described as superconsciousness.|$|E
25|$|The Lanes {{were part}} of a {{prominent}} Oregon political family. Nathaniel Lane's father Joseph Lane had been the first territorial Governor of Oregon and was immortalized as the namesake of Lane County, Oregon. In the election of 1860 Joseph Lane had achieved national prominence as the Vice Presidential running mate of John C. Breckinridge on the pro-slavery Southern Democratic Party ticket — with the pair carrying 11 states in a losing effort to Abraham Lincoln. Nathaniel's brother, Lafayette Lane, was elected a member of the Oregon Legislature and United States Congress. Harry would eventually continue the family tradition, albeit as a Democrat of <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> different stripe than had been his uncle and grandfather.|$|E

25|$|Various rival {{approaches}} to the challenge that Greek rationalism posed to revelation permeated early Islamic society; the Ashʿari considered Kalam contradictory to Islam and philosophy (falsafa) as inherently antagonistic to faith, asserting the absolute supremacy of revelation, and the abandonment of reason in the spiritual space, and secular space (both of which are interconnected within orthodox Islam). The Mu'tazili took a less absolutist approach asserting the supremacy traditionalism, yet allowing for a limited role of reason (Kalam). Isma'ili adopted <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> more philosophical approach in which only through reasoned discourse one could attain understanding of revelation, social structure, individualism and {{as well as the}} functioning of the natural world. For this reason Isma'ili produced a relatively scant collection of theological discourse in comparison to other Shia, and the Sunni. Yet they commanded a leading place in the development of philosophical discourse within the Islamic world.|$|E
25|$|One issue {{treated as}} {{secondary}} at the inquiry was the {{presence in the}} flight deck observer's seat of Captain Collins. The Lane report recommended greater caution in allowing off-duty flight crew members to occupy flight deck seats, and aired speculation that Collins might have been distracting his colleagues. The report noted that Collins' body {{was found to be}} holding a can of aerosol air freshener in its right hand. Sources close to the events of the time suggest that Collins played <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> more positive role by attempting to lower the leading-edge devices in the final seconds of the flight; Eric Pritchard, a Trident captain who happened to be the first airman at the accident site, recalled that a fireman had stated that Collins was lying across the centre pedestal and noted himself that his earphones had fallen into the right-hand-side footwell of the flight deck, diagonally across from the observer's seat, as might be expected if he had attempted to intervene as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|This {{political}} nature {{often leads}} to more private infrastructure such as roadways. To their credit, Miami-Dade Transit {{has not been an}} accountable organization, coming on the brink of shut-down in 2011, when they were audited by the federal government. On the other hand, the many tolled highways in Florida, for example, generate a significant amount of money for the state, whereas like many mass transit systems in the US, systems such as Metrorail and Metromover have always been a significant loss, financially speaking. Even some of the highway toll collection operations in Florida are privatized. Miami-Dade Transit's federal investigation, which included criminal investigation in addition to audits, revealed likely fraud among other wasteful spending; service cuts and a shut down of the AirportLink project nearly resulted. Tri-Rail is considered an exceptional loss; for fiscal year 2010, train revenue was approximately US$10.3 million, while total operating expenses for fiscal year 2010, including depreciation expense, were approximately US$86.9 million. Expenses increased by approximately US$14.9 million or 20.7% when compared to fiscal year 2009. During this time service was cut and <b>an</b> <b>altogether</b> shut down was threatened.|$|E
