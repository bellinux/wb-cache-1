500|$|Biance Gracie from Idolator gave a {{positive}} review to the performance, saying that [...] "Instead of doing her usual bit of either singing 'Living for Love' or the current single 'Ghosttown', the entertainer decided to switch {{things up a}} bit—and we're so glad [...] did! Madge did a wild and super-fun version of 'Bitch I'm Madonna'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter listed the performance {{as one of the}} top five shocking moments by Madonna in 2015. Stereogums Caitlin White was amazed by Madonna's performance, saying that [...] "the fact that she can dance like... this at 56 is practically a superhuman feat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> by how much I enjoyed the performance." [...] Bradley Stern also wrote a similar review for MuuMuse, describing the performance as [...] "one of the most all-out insane television performances of the entire Rebel Heart era... This was no basic stage performance: Instead, Madonna brought her noisy, bratty and utterly #Unapologetic banger to life." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt like it was a true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E
60|$|I glanced {{towards the}} Duke, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to see that}} his hands were shaking. For a man who rarely {{displayed}} feeling the Duke seemed to be wonderfully affected.|$|E
60|$|Both Tallant <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to {{hear these}} sentiments {{out of the}} mouth of Mr. Jason.|$|R
5000|$|Ама вие сте били тук. (Bulgarian, present tense: You are/have <b>been</b> here, but <b>I</b> did {{not know}} it, I have just found out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> at the fact) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is news to me, Peter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear it. I {{did think}} that even the great Tecumthe was {{scarcely}} as big a chief as you are yourself." ...|$|R
60|$|We came to {{a stream}} that ran north <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> to see a goodly volume of water. It evidently flowed down from the {{mountain}} far to the west.|$|E
60|$|Lady Jane gazed {{after him}} until {{he was out of}} sight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> to see that her face wore a smile and not a frown. Then she turned to me and held out her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{nervous system}} is quite shaken," [...] said the duchess. [...] "I {{wish we could}} all go to Brentham. I {{mentioned}} it to Corisande this morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> to find that she wished to remain in town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I," [...] cried Mrs. Pendennis; [...] "people <b>are</b> very impertinent, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure. Mr. Smirke {{came here}} as Arthur's tutor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> that anybody should dare to speak so----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Miss Effingham, {{we change}} the dishes at table, and no family of my acquaintance, more than this of your honourable father's; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> to find you opposed to the system." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t {{think your}} {{information}} <b>is</b> very correct,” <b>I</b> said, affecting to yawn slightly. “This is mere gossip of the gutter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> at you, who really {{know nothing about}} it—” ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the fourteenth}} day I {{went into the}} kitchen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to find that the}} fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured obscurity.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of you very often, also, Malinche; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised,</b> indeed, when I heard that you--for I felt {{sure that it was}} you--were with the Spaniards, and were not only an interpreter, but in high honor with them." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Rochester {{drew back}} the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let {{in all the}} {{daylight}} he could; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> and cheered {{to see how far}} dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the east. Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling.|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. Gentlemen, I {{instructed}} {{this lady}} to rest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to find you}} in attendance. Miss Livvy, you must be weary of their fatuities, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have taken the liberty to order your chaise.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{these are}} my grandnieces, Elizabeth and Kate, though why Kate I don't know. It is a fanciful name, and new to the family, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> that you didn't call her Susanna, after your grandmother." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the last}} {{occasion}} when I made a lengthened stay in London, my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>and</b> amused one morning by {{the receipt of}} the following note, addressed {{to me in a}} small, crabbed, foreign-looking handwriting.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{forget where}} I was," [...] said the bishop. [...] "Oh. Mr. Thumble came back, and I {{received}} your letter;--of course I received it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to learn from}} that, {{that in spite of}} what had occurred at Silverbridge, you were still anxious to continue the usual Sunday ministrations in your church." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must say}} {{it seemed to}} me the rottenest story I had ever heard, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> that Jeeves should have {{considered}} it worth while shoving into a speech. However, when I taxed him with this later, he said that Gussie had altered the plot a good deal, and I dare say that accounts for it.|$|E
60|$|As I {{came back}} to myself I glanced at Sola, who had {{witnessed}} this encounter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> to note a strange expression upon her usually expressionless countenance. What her thoughts were I did not know, for as yet I had learned but little of the Martian tongue; enough only to suffice for my daily needs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay, and {{therefore}} more easily played upon,' said the Squire. 'Rome {{is at the bottom}} of it, brother Masham, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> that a good Protestant like yourself, one of the King's Justices of the Peace, and a Doctor of Divinity to boot, should doubt the fact for an instant.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{you will have}} to solve the rest of it for yourself, Mr. Crocker," [...] said she; [...] "that is all of my contribution. My uncle tells me you are the best lawyer in the country, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> that you <b>are</b> so slow in getting at motives." ...|$|R
60|$|In 1879, I had a {{translation}} of Dr. Ernst Krause's 'Life of Erasmus Darwin' published, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> added a sketch of his character and habits from material in my possession. Many persons have been much interested by this little life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> that only 800 or 900 copies were sold.|$|R
60|$|Because we {{were forced}} to move slowly on account of the wounded, another day had fully come before we entered the encampment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> at finding that all our people there seemed to know as much {{concerning}} what had been done near Hog island as did we who had taken part in the action.|$|E
60|$|He {{had never}} spoken to me in confidence, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> by his doing so. I said I should respect his confidence, of course, and said no more on the {{delicate}} subject. We had but a little way to walk, and I was soon in his mother's company. He presented me, shook hands with me, and left us two (as he said) to business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] Captain Manley said surprised; [...] "I thought, of course, {{they were}} family pistols. Why, how on earth, {{if it is}} not an impertinent question, did you boys get hold of two brace of such pistols as these? I have no right to ask the question, boys. I see there has been a plate on the handles. But you said you had no relations, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> into asking." ...|$|E
60|$|The rain {{presently}} ceased, and {{the wind}} hauled, {{as is often the}} case, to the northwest, which began to clear, while Bear Island rose from the northern horizon. Both Farrar <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>surprised</b> to see Miss Trevor come out; she hooked back the cabin doors and surveyed the prostrate forms with amusement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she answered, [...] "I don't exactly {{understand}} it. I had {{visions of}} forests and wilds and tumbling mountain streams {{and a general}} air of primevalism, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> to see this fine hotel with piazzas, and croquet-grounds, and tennis-courts, and gravelled walks, and babies in their carriages, and elderly ladies carrying sun-shades." ...|$|R
6000|$|Aloof {{as the two}} {{officers}} are from the men, Captain West is still more aloof from his officers. I have not seen him address a further word to Mr. Mellaire than [...] "Good morning" [...] on the poop. As for Mr. Pike, who eats {{three times a day}} with him, scarcely any more conversation obtains between them. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> by what seems the very conspicuous awe with which Mr. Pike seems to regard his commander.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks pretty}} bad," [...] Sergeant Corney said, {{when he had}} made the most {{careless}} examination of the wound, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear him speak in such a tone, for it was not his custom to make much ado over any injury, however severe. [...] "I reckon you'd better hobble back to the fort without delay, an', once there, look well to it that you wash an' bandage the leg well." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{the enemy}} accepted, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to see that}} never one of Thayendanega's beauties came forward to carry off the slain of his tribe. I had always heard it said that the redskins would brave any danger rather than allow a dead Indian {{to fall into the}} hands of an enemy; but certain it is that on this day the rascally Tories dragged away the bodies, with not even a squaw to help them.|$|E
60|$|A perfect {{knowledge}} of these principles, and the intimacy that he had so kindly encouraged, emboldened me to speak frankly. After a few minutes' conversation, I laughingly inquired {{what he had done}} with the bonnet rouge. The question was perfectly understood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> to learn that, in the present instance, there was more foundation for the report than is usually the case with vulgar rumour. He gave the following account of what occurred at la Place de la Bastille.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 32: These illustrative {{spectacles}} are {{not among}} the best inventions of Dante. Their introduction is forced, and the instances not always pointed. A murderess, too, of her son, changed into such a bird as the nightingale, was not a happy association of ideas in Homer, where Dante found it; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> he made use of it, intimate as {{he must have been}} with the less inconsistent story of her namesake, Philomela, in the Metamorphoses.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That you do, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only <b>surprised</b> {{you don't}} smoke. Now, Mr. Dodge, your room-mate, there, {{tells me you}} have six-and-thirty pair of breeches!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I do," [...] said Aline. [...] "Half-cooked food on plates {{that have}} not been washed for weeks and weeks, and a house like a pig-stye. Have I not seen my brother reveling in them? Mr. Harry Lorraine, from what Ralph has told me, there <b>is</b> no one <b>I</b> should more gladly welcome to Fairmead than its part-owner, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>surprised</b> that he should prefer the pig-stye. Still, in {{reference}} to the latter, is there not a warning about blindly casting?" ...|$|R
