They returned to England in January 1559, two months after Elizabeth I's succession. Francis Knollys was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household; Lady Knollys became a senior Lady of the Bedchamber, and her daughter Lettice a Maid of the Privy Chamber.|$|E

Paul, whom Caro interviewed shortly before the former's death, claimed Robert had exerted undue influence on their mother to change her will in Robert's favor shortly before her death. Caro notes that Paul was on bad terms with their mother over a long period <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>may</b> have changed the will of her own accord, and implies that Robert's subsequent treatment of Paul may have been legally justifiable but was morally questionable.|$|E

Reggie Fluty, the first police officer to arrive at the scene, found Shepard alive but covered in blood. The medical gloves issued by the Albany County Sheriff's Department were faulty, and Fluty's supply ran out. She decided to use her bare hands to clear an airway in Shepard's bloody mouth. A day later, she was informed that Shepard was HIV positive, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>may</b> have been exposed due to cuts on her hands. After taking an AZT regimen for several months, she tested negative for HIV. Judy Shepard later wrote she learned of her son's HIV status during his stay at the hospital following the attack.|$|E
25|$|Fred became re-acquainted with Catherine ("Rena") Bernadette Costello in September 1962, {{when he was}} 21 years old. He {{had first}} met Costello—who hailed from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire—at a Much Marcle dance hall in 1960, and dated her for several months before she {{returned}} to Scotland. By now, Costello was pregnant by a Pakistani bus driver, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>may</b> have relocated from Glasgow to England due to the stigma of her baby's mixed ancestry. She married Fred in Ledbury on 17 November, the sole guest being Fred's younger brother John. The couple initially lived in Fred's aunt's home, but relocated to Coatbridge, where Fred worked as an ice cream van driver. Rena's daughter, Charmaine, was born in March 1963; to explain the child's mixed ancestry, Rena and Fred claimed that she had suffered a miscarriage and that Charmaine was adopted. Shortly thereafter, the couple relocated to Savoy Street, in the Bridgeton district of Glasgow.|$|E

It was exhibited along with a poem by D'Annunzio calling for courage and resolution in wartime, and later reproduced in a booklet sold to raise funds for the Red Cross.

500|$|Amenemhat IV {{was the son}} of a {{woman named}} Hetepi. Hetepi's only known {{attestation}} is an inscription on the wall of the temple of Renenutet at Medinet Madi where she is given the title of [...] "King's Mother" [...] but not those of [...] "King's Wife", [...] "King's Daughter" [...] or [...] "King's Sister". Consequently, her relation to Amenemhat III is unknown <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>may</b> have been non-royal. The relation of Amenemhat IV to Amenemhat III is similarly [...] uncertain; the former could have been the son or grandson of the latter. Similarly, while Manetho states that he married his half-sister Sobekneferu, this claim is not yet supported by archaeological evidence. In particular, Sobekneferu is not known to have borne the title of [...] "King's Wife". Instead, the egyptologist Kim Ryholt proposes that Amenemhat IV was adopted by Amenemhat III and thus became Sobekneferu's step-brother, thereby explaining the Manethonian tradition.|$|E

500|$|Press {{accounts}} framed Nixon as an {{embodiment of}} Cold War domesticity, {{in stark contrast}} to the second-wave feminism of the time. Journalists often portrayed her as dutiful and selfless and seeing herself as a wife first and individual second. Time magazine described her as [...] "the perfect wife and motherpressing [...] pants, making dresses for daughters Tricia and Julie, doing her own housework even as the Vice President's wife." [...] In the early years of her tenure as First Lady she was tagged 'Plastic Pat,' the derogatory nickname applied because, according to critics, she was always smiling while her face rarely expressed emotion and her body language made her seem reserved, and at times, artificial. Some observers described Pat Nixon as [...] "a paper doll, a Barbie dollplastic, antiseptic, unalive" [...] and that she [...] "has put every bit of the energy and drive of her youth into playing a role, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>may</b> no longer recognize it as such".|$|E

500|$|Gandhi {{tried to}} test and prove to himself his brahmacharya, {{less than a}} year before his {{assassination}} in January 1948. In February 1947, he asked his confidants such as Birla and Ramakrishna if it would be wrong for him to experiment his brahmacharya oath. He began his experiments by publicly asking in February for volunteer women. He progressed from first letting different volunteers to sleep in the same room but different beds, then later in the same bed but clothed, and finally sleeping naked. Gandhi kept the bedroom doors open all night during these experiments. According to the 1960s memoir of his grandniece Manu, Gandhi feared in early 1947 that he <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>may</b> be killed by Muslims in the run up to India's independence in August 1947, and asked her when she was 18-year-old if she wanted to help him with his experiments to test their [...] "purity", for which she readily accepted. None of the women who participated in the brahmachari experiments of Gandhi indicated that they had sex or that Gandhi behaved in any sexual way.

The women end up finding a letter addressed to Mary Alice, a blackmail note reading, [...] "I know what you did, it makes me sick, I’m going to tell." [...] Thereafter, the women make a series of discoveries concerning Mary Alice’s past and her possible motives for ending her life; she was being treated by Dr. Albert Goldfine (Sam Lloyd) where she revealed that she once went by the name Angela, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>may</b> {{have had something to do}} with a baby that went missing. [...] Paul soon discovers who sent Mary Alice the note, their next-door neighbor struggling with financial difficulty, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook), whom he ends up strangling to death out of pure rage and burying her body in the nearby forest. Meanwhile, her son Zach begins having flashbacks and is under the impression he killed a baby named Dana, who he believed to be his younger sister and reveals this to Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), Susan’s daughter. Paul worries over what Susan is spreading about their family, so he tells Susan in private that Zach accidentally killed his younger sister, Dana, and that he and Mary Alice covered it up to protect him. However, it becomes evident that this is not the case when Paul tells Zach that Dana is still very much alive.|$|E
500|$|... "Cocoon" [...] was {{received}} with positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic's Heather Phares called the song [...] "seductively alien". Seth Stevenson from Slate magazine gave a positive review to it, commenting {{that because of}} the song, Björk is [...] "actually at her best either barely murmuring or full-out yelling, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>may</b> be the most stylized vocalist in music today". Michael Cragg from The Guardian commented that [...] "Vespertine is littered with defining moments. While the first single Hidden Place, the choir-assisted Undo and the Matmos collaboration Aurora are among the highlights, it's Cocoon that best represents the album's sense of heavy-lidded, post-coital hibernation". David Fricke from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "the flurry of rhythm" [...] {{at the start of the}} song felt like [...] "the gravity of a spider scurrying across linoleum". Ian Gittins, author of Björk: Human Behaviour - the Stories Behind Every Song, referred to [...] "Cocoon" [...] as the eyes of many of the most significant moments of Vespertine, as well as the most complete display and literal philosophy that the singer had taken for the album. British magazine NMEs Joe Logic was also positive saying, [...] "Soft organs and Rice Krispies (Eh? - Cereal Ed) feature heavily on a very minimalist 'Cocoon', a beautiful love song featuring Bjork whispering sexual lyrics over a track that To Rococo Rot would be proud of". Stephen Dalton from the same publication was less positive, and stated: [...] "Then there is the uncomfortably intimate, tremble-whisper Björk voice of 'Cocoon' where she relates the joy of shutting herself away with her lover with a broken music box and some mouldy old string".|$|E

[...] Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times called the song [...] "impeccably arranged." [...] After watching the video, a writer for BET Sound Off said after it seemed Hilson and her label were losing faith, that [...] "out of nowhere, Keri got her ish together", and said, [...] "I’m sure she’ll regain the steam she lost during her first two singles."
