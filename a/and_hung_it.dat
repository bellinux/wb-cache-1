But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house <b>and</b> <b>hung</b> <b>it</b> on the simulator.|$|E
5|$|Rabi {{suggested}} to Edoardo Amaldi that Brookhaven {{might be a}} model that Europeans could emulate. Rabi saw science {{as a way of}} inspiring and uniting a Europe that was still recovering from the war. An opportunity came in 1950 when he was named the United States Delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). At a UNESCO meeting at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence in June 1950, he called for the establishment of regional laboratories. These efforts bore fruit; in 1952, representatives of eleven countries came together to create the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire (CERN). Rabi received a letter from Bohr, Heisenberg, Amaldi and others congratulating him on the success of his efforts. He had the letter framed <b>and</b> <b>hung</b> <b>it</b> on the wall of his home office.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the reign}} of Edward IV (r. 1461–1470, 1471–1483), monarchs {{presented}} the diseased with a gold medal known as touch piece <b>and</b> <b>hung</b> <b>it</b> around the subject's neck. The reverse of the medal depicted a ship, while the obverse showed the archangel Michael slaying a dragon, {{which led to the}} medal being popularly referred to as an Angel. The diseased were instructed to wear the medal constantly to ensure the success of the treatment. Not all people embraced the notion of the royal touch and miraculous medals; many were simply eager to obtain the medal, which was then sold on the market.|$|E

Peppiatt {{believes that}} Bacon would have disapproved {{of such a}} showing with a work he {{considered one of the}} finest ever painted, but writes that two, including HeadVI, [...] "stood up to it, and even enhanced its authority {{as one of the most}} penetrating studies of human nature and human power".|$|E

2500|$|As {{their record}} {{improved}} throughout {{the second half}} of the season, the Aggies earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1987. [...] During the tournament, Kavaliauskas averaged 10.5 points and 4.0 rebounds. [...] After winning their first round match-up against Syracuse, the Aggies appeared poised to reach the Sweet 16 when, with 18 seconds left in their second-round game against LSU, teammate Acie Law hit a jumper, giving the Aggies a 57–55 lead. The dream was dashed fifteen seconds later, however, when Darrell Mitchell completed a three-point shot for LSU over the head of Kavaliauskas. Convinced that he was the reason the team lost, Kavaliauskas found a photo of Mitchell's game-winning shot <b>and</b> <b>hung</b> <b>it</b> in his locker as a daily reminder of what he needs to work on.|$|E
2500|$|Dan Brown {{repeatedly}} {{said in his}} defense that history cannot be plagiarized and therefore the accusations of the two authors were false. Leigh stated, [...] "It's not that Dan Brown has lifted certain ideas because {{a number of people}} have done that before. It's rather that he's lifted the whole architecture – the whole jigsaw puzzle – <b>and</b> <b>hung</b> <b>it</b> on to the peg of a fictional thriller". Dan Brown has admitted some of the ideas taken from Baigent and Leigh's work were indispensable to the book but stated that there were many other sources also behind it. However, he claimed that neither he nor his wife had read Baigent and Leigh's book when he produced his original [...] "synopsis" [...] of the novel. Among Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh's arguments were that the given name of the character Sir Leigh Teabing's is the same of Richard Leigh's surname, and that [...] "Teabing" [...] is an anagram of [...] "Baigent".|$|E
2500|$|As an umpire, Quirk {{often is}} {{responsible}} for breaking up scuffles among players.

[...] Quirk grabbed Robinson by the waist and tackled him to the ground. [...] Robinson was ejected by Quirk for throwing a punch at Hallock. [...] As the game was concluding, Robinson asked Quirk if he could have a photo taken together. [...] Robinson later had the photo enlarged <b>and</b> <b>hung</b> <b>it</b> on the wall of his den. [...] After the game, Todd Lyght commented on Quirk's tackle saying, [...] "He did that with authority, and that was an older guy, too. That wasn't one of the young umps. He put it on him. I think that might open up (ESPN's) Prime Time." [...] Dick Vermeil, then-coach of the Rams, later joked with Robinson, asking him, [...] "(Quirk is a) Hell of a tackler, isn't he?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1990 season {{started for}} Earnhardt with {{victories}} in the Busch Clash and his heat of the Gatorade Twin 125's. Near {{the end of the}} Daytona 500, he had a dominant forty-second lead when the final caution flag came out with a handful of laps to go. When the green flag waved, Earnhardt was leading Derrike Cope. On the final lap, Earnhardt ran over a piece of metal, [...] which was later revealed as a bell housing, in turn 4, cutting down a tire. Cope, in an upset, won the race while Earnhardt finished fifth after leading 155 of the 200 laps. The No. 3 Goodwrench-sponsored Chevy team took the flat tire that cost them the win <b>and</b> <b>hung</b> <b>it</b> on the shop wall as a reminder of how close they had come to winning the Daytona 500. Earnhardt won nine races that season and won his fourth Winston Cup title, beating Mark Martin by 26 points. He also became the first multiple winner of the annual all-star race, The Winston.|$|E
