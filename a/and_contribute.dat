5|$|A {{decision}} {{holding that}} this action could be maintained {{either by the}} tribe, or an individual member thereof on behalf of himself and all others who should come in <b>and</b> <b>contribute,</b> would be contrary to the policy and practice which have been long established in our treatment of the Indian tribes.

5|$|DNA damage, due to {{environmental}} factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs {{at a rate}} of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
5|$|IUPAC and UNESCO {{were the}} lead {{organizations}} coordinating events for the International Year of Chemistry, {{which took place}} in 2011. The International Year of Chemistry was originally proposed by IUPAC at the general assembly in Turin, Italy. This motion was adopted by UNESCO at a meeting in 2008. The main objectives of the International Year of Chemistry were to increase public appreciation of chemistry and gain more interest in the world of chemistry. This event is also being held to encourage young people to get involved <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> to chemistry. A further reason for this event being held is to honour how chemistry has made improvements to everyone's way of life.|$|E

5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns in living organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{the band}} {{released}} its Island Records debut, The Artist in the Ambulance. The album's title is {{in reference to}} Burn Collector by Al Burian and is meant to reflect the band's desire {{to do more than}} make music <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> to society through their charitable donations. A portion of the album's proceeds were this time donated to the Syrentha Savio Endowment, a financial aid organization for breast cancer patients. First pressings of the album were packaged in a digipak-style case with postcards containing lyrics and notes from the band.|$|E

In July 1940 the squadron was re-designated a specialised night fighter unit and was amongst the first to receive airborne interception radar (AI). Cunningham was promoted to squadron leader in September 1940.|$|E

5|$|In December 1966, the AS-205 {{mission was}} canceled, since the {{validation}} of the CSM would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight, and AS-205 would have been devoted to space experiments <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft. Its Saturn IB was allocated to the dual mission, now redesignated AS-205/208 or AS-258, planned for August 1967. McDivitt, Scott and Schweickart were promoted to the prime AS-258 crew, and Schirra, Eisele and Cunningham were reassigned as the Apollo 1 backup crew.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, the Shetland Islands Council {{signed a}} {{partnership}} agreement with Scottish and Southern Energy for the Viking Wind Farm, a 200-turbine wind farm and subsea cable. This renewable energy project would produce about 600 megawatts <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> about £20 {{million to the}} Shetland economy per year. The plan met with significant opposition within the islands, primarily resulting from the anticipated visual impact of the development. The PURE project on Unst is a research centre which uses a combination of wind power and fuel cells to create a wind hydrogen system. The project {{is run by the}} Unst Partnership, the local community's development trust.|$|E
5|$|Many {{immigrants}} have established themselves in Brabrand, Hasle and Viby, where {{the percentage of}} inhabitants with foreign origins has risen by 66% since the year 2000. This has resulted in several 'especially vulnerable residential areas' (a.k.a. ghettos), with Gellerup as the most notable neighbourhood. In Brabrand and Gellerup, two-thirds of the population now have a non-Danish ethnic background. The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> many cultural flavours hitherto uncommon for the Nordic countries, including Bazar Vest, a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.|$|E

5|$|Parasitoids {{have been}} found to parasitize B. rufimanus eggs: Chremylus rubiginosus and Triaspis thoracicus (family: Braconidae), and Dinarmus acutus (family: Pteromalidae). Their larvae develop into B. rufimanus larvae and adults emerge from the seed, leaving a small {{emergence}} hole in the seed (smaller than for B. rufimanus). Generalist predators on faba bean leaves such as spiders might feed on B. rufimanus eggs <b>and</b> <b>contribute</b> to their biological control although no data was found on their potential impact on the population size or growth.|$|E
