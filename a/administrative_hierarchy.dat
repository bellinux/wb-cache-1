5|$|The {{population}} is young and predominantly rural, with a density {{among the highest}} in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the Banyarwanda, although within this group there are three subgroups: the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. The Twa are a forest-dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is Kinyarwanda, spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as official languages. Rwanda has a presidential system of government. The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by an ordered <b>administrative</b> <b>hierarchy</b> since pre-colonial times; there are five provinces delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.|$|E

25|$|The Malay Annals is a {{historical}} literature written {{in the form of}} narrative-prose with its main theme was to laud the greatness and superiority of Melaka. The narration, while seemingly relating the story of the reign of the sultans of Melaka until the demise of the sultanate to the Portuguese in 1511 and beyond, deals with a core issue of Malay statehood and historiography, the relationship between rulers and ruled. The Annals are prefaced by a celebration of the greatness of Allah, the Prophet and his companions. They begin with a genealogical account of the first sultan of Melaka who is said to be descended from Raja Iskandar Zulkarnain. The Annals cover the founding of Melaka and its rise to power; its relationship with neighbouring kingdoms and distant countries; the advent of Islam and its spread in Melaka and the region as a whole; the history of the royalty in the region including battles won or lost, marriage ties and diplomatic relationships; the <b>administrative</b> <b>hierarchy</b> that ruled Melaka; the greatness of its rulers and administrators, including the Bendahara Tun Perak and Laksamana, Hang Tuah. The Annals conclude with the account of Melaka's defeat by the Portuguese forces in 1511, resulting not only in the downfall of Melaka, but also in the eventual re-emergence of the Melakan-modeled sultanates {{in other parts of the}} region, including Johor, Perak and Pahang.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePerformance-based {{promotion}} schemes in <b>administrative</b> <b>hierarchies</b> have limitations. Chinese provincial leaders, despite facing strong career concerns, make different {{policy decisions}} {{depending on their}} career backgrounds. Provincial party secretaries who have risen from low to high positions within the province they govern (“locals”) spend a higher share of budgetary resources on {{education and health care}} and invest less in construction infrastructure than party secretaries who have made their most significant career advancements in other provinces (“outsiders”). Identification comes from variation in central leadership and term limits. As the promotion mechanism rewards infrastructure investments, locals {{are less likely to be}} promoted at the end of the term. We explore various mechanisms and provide evidence that the difference between locals and outsiders is not driven by knowledge or experience. Several pieces of evidence suggest that locals cater to low-level provincial elites, who helped them rise to power. Thus, local career trajectories limit the power of career concerns by fostering competing allegiances...|$|R

500|$|The {{legislation}} of Justinian I (r. 527–565) often {{mentions the}} orphanages {{and the office}} of orphanotrophos, {{but it was not until}} the reign of his successor Justin II (r. 565–578) that the institution in the capital acquired its definite characteristics: Justin and his wife Sophia, with the aid of a protovestiarios also named Zotikos, built an orphanage near the Church of St. Paul (or SS. Peter and Paul according to Theophanes the Confessor)—probably the church of the same name near the Gate of Eugenios on the sea-wall of the Golden Horn mentioned by Nikephoros Gregoras—and restored the foundation of the first Zotikos, which was possibly converted into a leprosarium. Justin bequeathed an annual stipend of 443 nomismata to the orphanage and made its possessions inalienable. It was probably then that the capital's orphanotrophos began to be appointed by the emperors. As a result, while in the provinces, the post of orphanotrophos continued to be occupied by clergymen, in the capital, it soon became a formal office and was held by members of the secular <b>administrative</b> <b>hierarchy.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Mehmed II {{established}} the basic {{layout of the}} palace. His private quarters would be located at the highest point of the promontory. Various buildings and pavilions surrounded the innermost core and winded down the promontory towards {{the shores of the}} Bosphorus. The entire complex was surrounded by high walls, some of which date back to the Byzantine acropolis. This basic layout governed the pattern of future renovations and extensions. The layout and appearance of Topkapı Palace was unique amongst not only European travellers, but also Islamic or oriental palaces. European travellers described it as [...] "irregular, asymmetric, non-axial, and [...] un-monumental proportions". Ottomans called it [...] "The Palace of Felicity". A strict, ceremonial, codified daily life ensured imperial seclusion from the rest of world. One of the central tenets was the observation of silence in the inner courtyards. The principle of imperial seclusion is a tradition that was codified by Mehmed II in 1477 and 1481 in the Kanunname Code, which regulated the rank order of court officials, the <b>administrative</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> and protocol matters. This principle of increased seclusion over time was reflected in the construction style and arrangements of various halls and buildings. The architects had to ensure that even within the palace, the sultan and his family could enjoy a maximum of privacy and discretion, making use of grilled windows and building secret passageways.|$|E

40|$|The {{rescaling}} of <b>administrative</b> {{structures and}} <b>hierarchies</b> is a Europe-wide phenomenon, {{often associated with}} democratisation and increased accountability. This is particularly true within the European Union, where the principle of regionalisation, {{often referred to as}} subsidiarity, is embraced in the Copenhagen criteria. Those states which joined the Union after the collapse of communism had to reorganise their spatial <b>administrative</b> <b>hierarchies</b> and decentralise their national administration, often creating two or more new levels of government. This was the case in Hungary, where before 1990, the main regional actors were counties, which were responsible for directing the allocation of resources and managing development. After 1990, local government reforms strengthened local governments {{at the expense of the}} counties and left a vacuum at the regional level. However, in the mid- 1990 s the Hungarian government attempted to create new NUTS 2 meso-level regions, partly in response to demands from the European Union and partly to instil a new regional orientation among policymakers. This paper, based on research undertaken in 2002 - 2008, examines some of the problems in creating new regions. The research found that top-down regionalisation, demanded by the European Union and imposed from above, failed to create a regional identity. Respondents, taken from among regional policymakers and business leaders, are identified with their locality and county but not the new region. Even national policymakers appeared ambivalent, supporters of the regionalisation legislation fearing that it would complicate administration by adding a new layewr of government and opponents arguing that it would weaken the central government. Regionalisation remained a relatively hollow administrative exercise from which civic, business and non-governmental organisations felt excluded despite their nominal participation. The research also found that bottom-up regionalism was potentially more successful, but it was unlikely to succeed unless there was broad-based political support at all levels of the government...|$|R
