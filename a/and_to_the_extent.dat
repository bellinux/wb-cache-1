The federal government played little role in air-pollution control, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> that it did, its actions supported the efforts of states and local governments. For example, federal law provided resources like research, training, grants to improve state and local programs, and a conference procedure to convene agencies and polluters {{under the guidance of}} the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Direct regulations—such as, for example, setting emissions standards—were left to states.|$|E

25|$|Several campuses {{distinguish}} societies called ‘honoraries’ from secret societies. An honorary {{is considered}} to operate in name only: membership is an honor given in recognition of some achievement, and such a society is distinct from a secret society.

Phi Beta Kappa is the most well-known such example, where it originally operated on a secret chapter basis, and it became the progenitor of all college fraternities, {{and at the same}} time, some time after its secrets were made public in the 1830s, Phi Beta Kappa continued on as an honorary. Virtually all the oldest honoraries were once clearly secret societies, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> that they are distinct now is at least ambiguous.|$|E

On the other hand, if the policy of the exhaustion doctrine is seen merely as a rule to make sure that downstream purchasers get fair notice that their use of goods whose purchase they are considering will be restricted, courts may be more likely to uphold such restrictions unless they collide with other policies, such as those of competition or antitrust law.|$|E
