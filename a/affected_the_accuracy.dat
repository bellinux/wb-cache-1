50|$|In 1984, Jennifer Thompson-Cannino {{selected}} Ronald Cotton {{from both}} a photographic line-up {{and later a}} physical line-up as her rapist, leading to his conviction of rape and burglary and a sentence of life in prison plus fifty-four years. Ronald Cotton spent eleven years in prison due to faulty eyewitness memory before DNA evidence exonerated him in 1995. Despite Jennifer's strong intent to study her rapist's features during the traumatic event {{for the purpose of}} identifying him afterward, she fell victim to encoding limitations {{at the time of the}} assault. Jennifer undoubtedly experienced a great degree of stress on the night of her assault with a knife pressed to her neck and a feeling of absolute powerlessness. “There in my memory, at the knife-edge of fear, time distorted”. She also fell prey to factors after the incident that <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of her recall. Even if memories are correctly encoded at the time of the event, interference and decay can alter these memories in negative ways. The simple passage of time entails memory loss, and any new information presented between the time of the crime and testimony can interfere with a witness’s recall. When Jennifer was asked to identify her perpetrator from a series of photographs, she was told by officers that she should not feel compelled to make an identification. However, Jennifer’s faith in the legal system led her to believe that the police must have had a suspect to warrant her participation in photographic identification. And when Jennifer selected the photo of Ronald, the police told her she did great. It should be noted the photograph of Jennifer's true rapist, Bobby Poole, was not included in the lineup. The positive feedback Jennifer received allowed her to begin incorporating details from the photograph into her memory of the attack. The fact that Jennifer took five minutes to study the pictures before she selected Ronald Cotton's photo also allowed Jennifer ample opportunity to encode Ronald's face as her assailant and thereby interfere with her original memory. The photographs were presented simultaneously, allowing Jennifer to compare the photographs to each other as opposed to her memory of the event. As a result, when she was later asked to choose her assailant from a physical line-up, Jennifer saw Ronald in her memory and thus chose him. The police further solidified her choice by telling her “We thought that might be the guy…it’s the same person you picked from the photos.”. As a result, the authorities viewed Jennifer as the ideal eyewitness, one who was motivated to remember the face of her assailant during the event and subsequently confident in her identification of the target. Unfortunately, the level of confidence in an eyewitness' recall is not associated with accuracy of identification. The eyewitness' confidence in his or her recall is, however, strongly associated with the jury's belief in the accuracy of the eyewitness' testimony, thus increasing the risk of assigning guilty verdicts to innocent individuals. In conclusion, unconscious transference essentially contaminated Jennifer’s memory. Even after Jennifer learned of Ronald’s innocence, she still saw his face in her memory of the attack years later. It wasn’t until she met with Ronald face-to-face and he gave her his forgiveness did she begin to see Ronald for himself rather than as her assailant, thus beginning a remarkable and unexpected friendship.|$|E

40|$|Numbers {{present an}} {{important}} part of our everyday life, therefore the development of arithmetic abilities has been studied for a long time. Modern imaging techniques enabled the research of relations between mathematical processes and the underlying brain processes. This has led {{to a better understanding of}} mathematical cognition, as well as problems and diseases encountered in learning, understanding and applying mathematics. Rather new research method is the eye movement analysis. We performed an experiment with an eye tracker device on two groups of adolescents: healthy and diagnosed with neonatal encephalopathy (NE). We analyzed the answer accuracy, the reaction time and the eye movements during the subtraction of two-digit numbers and simple equations solving. There were no significant differences between the studied groups in the accuracy of answers. The borrow problem in subtraction <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> only with healthy adolescents, while the position of the unknown x in the equation affected both groups. Adolescents with NE took longer to calculate, furthermore, the borrow problem affected the reaction time of both groups, but adolescents with NE less, and still, the position of x had an influence only on healthy adolescents. Neither the difference in subtraction nor the position of x <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> and reaction time of both groups. However, groups showed significant differences in eye movements. Adolescents with NE made more fixations but with shorter durations. They also made more blinks, their amplitudes of saccades were smaller and still, adolescents with NE had significantly smaller pupil sizes...|$|E
30|$|Regarding implant angulation, {{the results}} of this study found that {{increasing}} implant angulation to 15 ° or 30 ° <b>affected</b> <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of indirect impression technique. While in the direct unsplinted technique, no difference in accuracy was found between parallel condition and 15 ° angulated condition. The increased displacement of impression material and the difficult removal of the impression tray in case of angulated implant were believed to be the source of error in the indirect impression technique. In the direct technique, the impression coping remains in the impression, which reduces the effect of implant angulation and the impression material deformation upon removal from mouth.|$|E
