5|$|In {{an effort}} to add more options for {{travelers}} in Roanoke, the airport added non-stop service to Orlando in May 2006 and Tampa in December 2006 with Allegiant Air. This is largely seen {{as the product of}} <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> local leaders to bring new and improved service to the airport through both existing and new carriers. Earlier attempts to lobby AirTran Airways and the now defunct Independence Air to serve the airport were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{passed by}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} in 1933 {{made it easier for}} police officers who had been off the force {{for more than a year}} to apply for reinstatement. It was expected that this would lead to <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> the former strikers to be rehired, but several subsequent appeals for reinstatement were denied. In 1937, Massachusetts Governor Charles F. Hurley, after meeting with some of the 1919 strikers, backed the decision of Police Commissioner Joseph Timilty not to reinstate them.|$|E

5|$|After a long hiatus, Batwoman was reintroduced to DC {{continuity}} in 2006 {{in the seventh}} week of the publisher's year-long 52 weekly comic book. Reintroduced as Kate Kane, the modern Batwoman began operating in Gotham City in Batman's absence following {{the events of the}} company-wide crossover Infinite Crisis (2005). The modern Batwoman is written as being of Jewish descent and as a lesbian in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> DC editorial staff to diversify its publications and better connect to modern-day readership. Described as the highest-profile gay superhero to appear in stories published by DC, Batwoman's sexual orientation drew wide media attention following her reintroduction, as well as both praise and criticism from the general public.|$|E
5|$|In 367BC, plebeians {{were allowed}} to stand for the consulship, and this implicitly opened both the {{censorship}} {{as well as the}} dictatorship to plebeians. Around this time, the practice of electing military tribunes with consular authority was dropped. In 366BC, in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> the patricians to reassert their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. These two offices, the praetorship and the curule aedileship (so-called because its holder, like consuls and praetors, had the right to sit in a curule seat), were at first open only to patricians, but within a generation they were open to plebeians as well.|$|E

The opening of the Consulship to the Plebeian class implicitly opened both the Censorship as well as the Dictatorship to Plebeians. In 366 BC, in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> the Patricians to reassert their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created.

5|$|Kaleidoscope Dream {{was first}} {{released}} in vinyl LP format on September 25, in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> RCA {{to make the}} deadline for the Grammy Awards' eligibility period without charting prematurely on lower sales. The following week, it debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, selling 71,000 copies in the US. It was Miguel's first album {{to be released in}} the United Kingdom, where it spent 15 weeks on the country's R chart, peaking at number 13. By February 20, 2013, the record had charted for 20 weeks on the Billboard 200 and sold 321,400 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in June 2015, with 535,000 copies sold in the US at that point.|$|E

5|$|The {{move was}} seen as <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains {{as to whether or}} not these airspace violations were a necessity, as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do so. Still, many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs.|$|E
5|$|Together {{these two}} units {{remained}} linked until 4 September 1939 when, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel William Jeater, the 2nd Battalion was once again raised as a separate unit as part of <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> the Australian government to hastily expand the Militia following the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, although mobilised and assigned to the 1st Brigade, the battalion did not see active service overseas and was instead used as a garrison force in Australia until 2 December 1943 when it was merged once again with the 41st Battalion, forming the 41st/2nd Battalion. They remained linked until 17 December 1945, when they were disbanded as part of the demobilisation process.|$|E
5|$|Victims of the {{disaster}} continued to file claims against Imperial Sugar and its cleaning contractor.

The state appeals court rejected <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> defendants' attorneys for a pre-trial appeal in two related cases in an effort to limit damages. In 2011 Lawrence Manker, Jr., an Imperial Sugar worker who underwent 70 surgeries for burns covering 85% of his body after the plant explosion, settled his lawsuit with the company for an undisclosed amount.

5|$|While {{serving in}} the militia in 1779, Garrard was elected to {{represent}} Stafford County the Virginia House of Delegates, and he assumed his seat for the 1779 legislative session. His major contribution to the session was advocating for a bill that granted religious liberty to all residents of Virginia; passage of the bill ended persecution by citizens who associated with the Church of England upon followers of other faiths and countered <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> some to establish the Church of England as Virginia's official church. After the session, {{he returned to his}} military duties. In 1781, he was promoted to the rank of colonel.|$|E
5|$|A {{minute later}} Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard was shown a yellow card for a foul on García. The {{resulting}} free-kick found Steven Gerrard, but {{he fell to}} the ground after a challenge from Claude Makélélé. The referee Steve Bennett ignored Liverpool claims for a penalty and Chelsea went straight on the attack, but <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> Drogba went wide of the Liverpool goal. Chelsea continued to attack in an effort to score an equalising goal, but attempts by Duff and Joe Cole failed to find the target. Liverpool defender Djimi Traoré was the third player to be shown a yellow card for a foul on Ferreira in the 35th minute. However, minutes later he made an important tackle as Duff beat the Liverpool offside trap, but a poor touch outside of the Liverpool penalty area allowed Traoré to dispossess him. As half-time approached Liverpool were content to remain in their own half and allow Chelsea to attack them, but any attack was dealt with by the Liverpool defence.|$|E
5|$|Burchard, {{along with}} Marshal {{and other members}} of the chapter, were often opposed to the actions of their {{archbishop}}. They objected to the archbishop having given a large part of York's treasury towards Richard's ransom, and to some of the archiepiscopal appointments in the church of York. Burchard and the others charged Geoffrey with simony, extortion, and neglect of his duties and the archbishop in return excommunicated the ringleaders more than once, and locked the canons out of church. The disputes flared up in 1192, with Burchard facing <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> Geoffrey to replace him in the treasurership with Hamo, but the dispute was resolved by the gift of a church to Hamo by Burchard and Hamo's relinquishing of any claim to the treasurership. At another dispute, Geoffrey had confiscated the revenues of Burchard's offices, along with the revenues of Marshal, Peter de Ros the Archdeacon of Carlisle, and the canons Hugh Murdac and Adam of Thornover. Geoffrey refused to restore the incomes unless the offenders came barefoot into York Minster and begged for the archbishop's forgiveness. This all but Marshal did and they had their official revenues restored.|$|E

5|$|Caltrans {{engineer}} Jacob Dekema {{announced in}} April1969 that construction on SR76 {{and the nearby}} SR 78 between I-5 and US395 would be delayed until work was underway on I-5 and US395 was underway, or at least until 1976. Nevertheless, a widening project was commissioned in 1970 between Pauma Reservation Road and Cole Grade Road, well east of US395. The next year, construction began on a new interchange between the future routing of SR76 and I-5, near Oceanside Harbor and Camp Del Mar in Camp Pendleton. The expansion of SR76 appeared on the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO) regional government plan in late 1974. At that time, there was <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> the City of Oceanside to have SR76 included as a scenic highway, but SR76 has not {{been included in the}} system. The Chamber of Commerce decided to continue efforts to have SR76 expanded at the end of 1974.|$|E
5|$|Operation PBHISTORY was <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> the CIA {{to analyze}} {{documents}} from the Árbenz government to justify the 1954 coup after the fact, in particular by finding evidence that Guatemalan communists had been {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union. Due to the quick overthrow of the Árbenz government, the CIA believed that the administration would not have been able to destroy any incriminating documents, and that these could be analyzed to demonstrate Árbenz's supposed Soviet ties. The CIA also believed this would help it better understand the workings of Latin American communist parties, on which subject the CIA had very little real information. A final motivation was that international responses to the coup had been very negative, even among allies of the U.S., and the CIA wished to counteract this anti-U.S. sentiment. The operation began on 4 July 1954 with the arrival of four CIA agents in Guatemala City, led by a specialist in the structure of communist parties. Their targets included Árbenz's personal belongings, police documents, and the headquarters of the Guatemalan Party of Labour.|$|E
5|$|Peckham {{was very}} strict in his interpretations of canon law, and once wrote to Queen Eleanor that {{her use of}} loans from Jewish moneylenders to acquire lands was usury and a mortal sin. He also felt that Welsh laws were illogical and {{conflicted}} with Biblical teachings. He also mandated that the clerical tonsure worn by the clergy should not just include {{the top of the}} head, but also have the nape and over the ears shaved, which allowed the clergy to be easily distinguished from the laity. To help with this, the archbishop also forbade the clergy from wearing secular clothing, especially military garb. He also forbade <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>by</b> the Benedictine order in England to reform their monastic rule, to allow more time for study and for more education for the monks. Peckham's reason was that they were against custom, but he may also have had concerns that these reforms would have drawn recruits away from the Franciscans.|$|E
