5|$|In case <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{should be}} resisted, Parliament passed the Treasons Act 1534, {{which made it}} high treason {{punishable}} by death to deny Royal Supremacy. The following year, Thomas More and John Fisher were executed under this legislation. Finally, in 1536, Parliament passed the Act against the Pope's Authority, which removed {{the last part of}} papal authority still legal. This was Rome's power in England to decide disputes concerning Scripture.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, John {{passes the}} time with both idle and cryptic chat, {{eventually}} telling Eric that his survival of a suicide attempt after his diagnosis is the true reason for his games. With the little time left to him, he wants to inspire in others the new appreciation for life he had found. Eric, not interested in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> runs out of patience {{and returns to the}} monitors. He destroys several of John's documents and sketches at Kerry's suggestion, but fails to provoke John. As the tech team arrives, John reveals the connection between the victims: Eric has framed all of them for various crimes, and Daniel will be in danger if his identity is discovered.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass and Briscoe {{determine}} {{from the}} evidence at hand that something living in outer space has entered the ship, dissolved Reichenheim and Green in their sealed spacesuits, and evidently entered Carroon's body, which {{is now in the}} process of being changed by this unknown entity. Not knowing <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Carroon's wife, Judith, hires a private investigator, Christie, to break her husband out of the secured hospital. The escape is successful, but not before Carroon smashes a potted cactus in his hospital room, fuses it into his flesh, then kills the private investigator and absorbs all the forces of life in his body, leaving just a shrivelled husk. It does not take long for Judith to discover what is happening to her husband; Carroon flees and disappears into the London night, leaving her screaming outside the hospital, alive, unharmed, but entirely mad from fright.|$|E

25|$|There {{were several}} aspects of Nixon's life that were not brought to the {{attention}} of the jury. He had twice saved people from death — once a drowning boy in a flooded irrigation ditch and the other a woman from a burning plane crash at Houston International Airport (now William P. Hobby Airport) in 1966. He had volunteered to serve in the United States Navy during World War II and received an honorable discharge. He later enlisted in the United States Army, getting a hardship discharge after his father abandoned his mother. Nixon did not tell his lawyers <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> and they had to discover it through their own private investigations.|$|E
25|$|Although {{research}} {{continued at}} the SCL in the passive detection of infrared emitted from heated aircraft engines, Blair {{became convinced that}} practical detection systems would involve reflected radio signals. He was certainly influenced in this by his earlier doctoral research in this field, and {{he was aware of}} the work on radio detection at the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C. In December 1930, representatives of the SCL had been briefed at the NRL on the beat-interference phenomena that they were investigating, and in 1932, an NRL report on radio interference for target-detection was passed on to the Army. It does not appear, however, that <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> information was used by Blair.|$|E

25|$|A report {{published}} in January 2011 by the Diário de Notícias, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated {{that in the}} period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic Portuguese Republic governments have encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This has funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation and mismanaged European structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister Sócrates's cabinet {{was not able to}} forecast or prevent <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country {{was on the verge of}} bankruptcy in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Michael warns Dominic {{not to make}} {{an enemy}} of Don Samuele Mangano (Ralph Peduto), so Dominic offers him a partnership, which he accepts. Meanwhile, Dominic bombs the Granados {{compound}} and kills Rico. Subsequently, Fredo and Dominic are almost killed in a drive-by shooting. Fredo blames Samuele for the hit, urging Dominic to strike back. He does so, taking over Mangano's warehouse in Florida. A furious Samuele denies he ordered the hit, and declares war against Dominic's family. Dominic asks Roth for advice, who tells him he can reason with Mangano, if Dominic is willing to help him out. Roth still believes the Cuban deal is possible, and his associate, CIA agent Henry Mitchell (Peter Hulne), tells Dominic the CIA want Fidel Castro dead so they can bring back Batista. Mitchell proposes that Dominic travel to Cuba and kill Castro. Dominic is worried that Michael is unaware of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> but Roth assures him that Michael has enough to worry about with the senate hearings.|$|E
