5|$|On {{the surface}} of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become {{compressed}} and heated. At some point the accumulated gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months. An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} star-formation {{scenario}} for Betelgeuse {{is that it}} is <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> star from the Orion OB1 Association. Originally a member of a high-mass multiple system within Ori OB1a, Betelgeuse was probably formed about 10–12 million years ago, but has evolved rapidly due to its high mass.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{may have}} been formed near the Scorpius-Centaurus Association. The {{collapse}} of the gas cloud {{which resulted in the}} formation of Beta Pictoris {{may have been}} triggered by the shock wave from a supernova explosion: the star which went supernova may have been a former companion of HIP 46950, which is now <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> star. Tracing the path of HIP 46950 backwards suggests {{that it would have been}} in the vicinity of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association about 13 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Blast Corps is a 1997 action {{video game}} for the Nintendo 64 in which the player uses {{vehicles}} to destroy buildings {{in the path of}} <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> nuclear missile carrier. In the game's 57 levels, the player solves puzzles by transferring between vehicles to move objects and bridge gaps. It was developed by Rare, published by Nintendo, and released in March 1997 in Japan and North America. A wider release followed {{at the end of that}} year.|$|E
5|$|However if {{the white}} dwarf merges with another white dwarf (a very rare event), it will {{momentarily}} exceed the limit and begin to collapse, again raising its temperature past the nuclear fusion ignition point. Within {{a few seconds of}} initiation of nuclear fusion, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> reaction, releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} were {{to exceed the}} Chandrasekhar limit, and nuclear {{reactions}} did not take place, the pressure exerted by electrons {{would no longer be}} able to balance the force of gravity, and it would collapse into a denser object called a neutron star. Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> nuclear fusion reaction, which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before it reaches the limiting mass.|$|E

5|$|Strangelets {{are small}} {{fragments}} of strange matter—a hypothetical form of quark matter—that contain roughly {{equal numbers of}} up, down, and strange quarks and that are more stable than ordinary nuclei (strangelets would {{range in size from}} a few femtometers to a few meters across). If strangelets can actually exist, and if they were produced at the LHC, they could conceivably initiate <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> fusion process in which all the nuclei in the planet would be converted to strange matter, similar to a strange star.|$|E
5|$|Asad was {{a member}} of the Qasr clan, a {{subtribe}} of the Banu Bajila. His great-grandfather, Asad ibn Kurz al-Qasri, is said by some traditions to have been the chief of the Bajila in the times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and is counted as one of Muhammad's companions. Other traditions, hostile to the family, report that Asad was a Jew and <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> slave. Asad's grandfather Yazid was an early and prominent supporter of the Umayyads in the First Fitna, while Asad's father Abdallah sided with Ibn al-Zubayr in the Second Fitna, but was eventually pardoned by the Caliph Abd al-Malik (reigned 685–705).|$|E

5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} path of <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary in the way they clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck drifts, the lightweight buggy crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot mechs tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in difficulty as the player progresses through its 57 levels.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the city}} {{installed}} a large boulder on the southeast {{portion of the}} grounds. The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company had found the 15,000-year-old boulder in 1897 and moved it to Portland. The ten ton Wallula Stone was discovered in the Columbia River Gorge, and was covered with petroglyphs. It was returned to the Umatilla tribe of Native Americans in Eastern Oregon in 1996. The old elevators inside were replaced again in 1946, and in 1948 <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> truck destroyed part of the stone railing on the Fifth Avenue side, which was then fixed.|$|E
5|$|Locke's Some Thoughts Concerning Education was <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> best-seller. During {{the eighteenth}} century alone, Some Thoughts was {{published}} in at least 53 editions: 25 English, 16 French, six Italian, three German, two Dutch, and one Swedish. It was also excerpted in novels such as Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740–1), and it formed the theoretical basis of much children's literature, particularly that of the first successful children's publisher, John Newbery. According to James Secord, an eighteenth-century scholar, Newbery included Locke's educational advice to legitimise the new genre of children's literature. Locke's imprimatur would ensure the genre's success.|$|E

Though a pop culture phenomenon in the first half of the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 brought it back into the public light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the white}} dwarf's mass {{approach}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 it {{will no longer}} be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result. If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, increasing pressure and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to attainment of the Chandrasekhar limit. The dramatic result is <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> nuclear fusion reaction that consumes a substantial fraction of the star within a short time. This will be sufficient to unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{accretion}} process, {{by which}} 1km planetesimals grow into 1,000km sized bodies, is well understood now. This process develops inside any disk where the number density of planetesimals is sufficiently high, and proceeds in <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> manner. Growth later slows and continues as oligarchic accretion. The {{end result is}} formation of planetary embryos of varying sizes, which depend on {{the distance from the}} star. Various simulations have demonstrated that the merger of embryos in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk leads to the formation of a few Earth-sized bodies. Thus the origin of terrestrial planets is now considered to be an almost solved problem.|$|E

5|$|Tubman and her brothers, Ben and Henry, {{escaped from}} slavery on September 17, 1849. Tubman {{had been hired}} out to Dr. Anthony Thompson, who owned a large {{plantation}} in an area called Poplar Neck in neighboring Caroline County; it is likely her brothers labored for Thompson as well. Because the slaves were hired out to another household, Eliza Brodess probably did not recognize their absence as an escape attempt for some time. Two weeks later, she posted <b>a</b> <b>runaway</b> notice in the Cambridge Democrat, offering a reward of up to 100 dollars for each slave returned. Once they had left, Tubman's brothers had second thoughts. Ben may have just become a father. The two men went back, forcing Tubman to return with them.|$|E
