5|$|Martin's death largely {{took the}} <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal perjury case against Webber. In July 2003, {{on the day}} before jury {{selection}} in the case was due to begin, Webber pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal contempt in order to avoid a possible jail sentence. He admitted to having received and repaid $38,200. The deal was subject to a discretionary fine and possible classification of the infraction as a felony by the United States District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds who would rule in September 2003. In exchange for the plea all other charges were dropped against him as were all charges against his father. The charges against Webber's aunt had been dropped after Martin's death.|$|E

25|$|Architects promote {{double glazing}} in {{residential}} houses, which avoids the inefficient {{convection of heat}} across the relatively narrow gap between the panes, but the tower exploits this effect. The shafts pull warm <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building {{during the summer and}} warm the building in the winter using passive solar heating. The shafts also allow sunlight to pass through the building, making the work environment more pleasing, and keeping the lighting costs down.|$|E

5000|$|Due {{to various}} {{production}} delays, <b>the</b> episodes <b>aired</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correct scripted order. This caused some confusion with audiences regarding <b>the</b> chronology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series. For example, [...] "The Party" [...] originally aired after its sequel [...] "When Sparks Fly".

25|$|The didgeridoo {{is played}} with {{continuously}} vibrating lips {{to produce the}} drone while using a special breathing technique called circular breathing. This requires breathing in through the nose whilst simultaneously expelling stored <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth using the tongue and cheeks. By use of this technique, a skilled player can replenish the air in their lungs, and with practice can sustain a note {{for as long as}} desired. Recordings exist of modern didgeridoo players playing continuously for more than 40 minutes; Mark Atkins on Didgeridoo Concerto (1994) plays for over 50 minutes continuously.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} is that most turtle shells are rigid and do not allow {{for the type of}} expansion and contraction that other amniotes use to ventilate their lungs. Some turtles, such as the Indian flapshell (Lissemys punctata), have a sheet of muscle that envelops the lungs. When it contracts, the turtle can exhale. When at rest, the turtle can retract the limbs into the body cavity and force <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs. When the turtle protracts its limbs, the pressure inside the lungs is reduced, and the turtle can suck air in. Turtle lungs are attached {{to the inside of the}} top of the shell (carapace), with the bottom of the lungs attached (via connective tissue) to the rest of the viscera. By using a series of special muscles (roughly equivalent to a diaphragm), turtles are capable of pushing their viscera up and down, resulting in effective respiration, since many of these muscles have attachment points in conjunction with their forelimbs (indeed, many of the muscles expand into the limb pockets during contraction).|$|E
25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.|$|E
5000|$|The George Wendt Show is an American sitcom that {{aired on}} CBS from March 8 to April 12, 1995.

25|$|Indirect {{evidence}} for endothermy {{is provided by}} the body shape of derived ichthyosaurs, which with its short tail and vertical tail fin seems optimised for a high cruising speed that can only be sustained by a high metabolism: all extant animals swimming this way are either fully warm-blooded or, like sharks and tuna, maintain a high temperature in their body core. This argument does not cover basal forms with a more eel-like body and undulating swimming movement. In 1996, Richard Cowen, while accepting endothermy for the group, presumed that ichthyosaurs would have been subject to Carrier's constraint, a limitation to reptilian respiration pointed out in 1987 by David Carrier: their undulated locomotion forces the <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs and thus prevents them from taking breath while moving. Cowen hypothesised that ichthyosaurs would have overcome this problem by porpoising: constantly jumping out of the water would have allowed them to take a gulp of fresh air during each jump. Other researchers have tended to assume that for at least derived ichthyosaurs Carrier's constraint did not apply, because of their stiff bodies, which seems to be confirmed by their good diving capacity, implying an effective respiration and oxygen storage system. For these species porpoising was not a necessity. Nevertheless, ichthyosaurs would have often surfaced to breathe, probably tilting their heads slightly to take in air, because of the lower position of the nostrils compared to that of dolphins.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{intended}} {{the book to}} have a more serious tone than his debut novel, and he initially considered making the story a meditation on the nature of evil. The novel's original title, The Undertaker's Wind, reflects this; the undertaker's wind, which was to act {{as a metaphor for the}} story, describes one of Jamaica's winds that [...] "blows all the bad <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island".|$|E
500|$|For a fight scene {{taking place}} {{on top of a}} {{speeding}} bullet train, the actors and stunt performers filmed on wires above a set piece surrounded by a greenscreen. The moving background, filmed on an elevated freeway in Tokyo, was added later. Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Martin Hill said the team adopted a [...] "Google Street View method", explaining [...] "But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, we built a rig that had eight 45 degree angle Red Epic [...] that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway. We let a bit of <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour. So if we shot at 48 fps we just needed to speed up the footage by 10 times to give us the 300 kilometers an hour required." ...|$|E

[...] The speed of pressurization and de-pressurization can be adjusted to each patient's needs.|$|E
2500|$|The airflow {{created by}} the fans that is {{entering}} the tunnel is itself highly turbulent due to the fan blade motion (when the fan is blowing air into the test section – when it is sucking <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> test section downstream, the fan-blade turbulence is not a factor), and so is not directly useful for accurate measurements. The air moving through the tunnel needs to be relatively turbulence-free and [...] To correct this problem, closely spaced vertical and horizontal air vanes are used to smooth out the turbulent airflow before reaching {{the subject of the}} testing.|$|E
2500|$|The Dalkey Archive {{features}} {{a character who}} encounters a penitent, elderly and apparently unbalanced James Joyce (who dismissively refers to his work by saying 'I have published little' and, furthermore, does not seem aware of having written and published Finnegans Wake) working as an assistant barman or 'curate'—another small joke relating to Joyce's alleged priestly ambitions—in the resort of Skerries. The scientist De Selby seeks to suck all of the <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, and Policeman Pluck learns of the mollycule theory from Sergeant Fottrell.

2500|$|As an {{aircraft}} changes speed or altitude, {{the pressure of}} the air at the inlet to the compressor will vary. In order to [...] "tune" [...] the compressor for these changing conditions, designs starting in the 1950s would [...] "bleed" [...] <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> middle of the compressor in order to avoid trying to compress too much air in the final stages. This was also used to help start the engine, allowing it to be spun up without compressing much air by bleeding off as much as possible. Bleed systems were already commonly used anyway, to provide airflow into the turbine stage where it was used to cool the turbine blades, as well as provide pressurized air for the air conditioning systems inside the aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|A {{pulmonary}} laceration {{can cause}} air to leak {{out of the}} lacerated lung [...] and into the pleural space, if the laceration goes through to it. Pulmonary laceration invariably results in pneumothorax (due to torn airways), hemothorax (due to torn blood vessels), or a hemopneumothorax (with both blood and air in the chest cavity). Unlike hemothoraces that occur due to pulmonary contusion, those due to lung laceration may be large and long lasting. However, the lungs do not usually bleed very much because the blood vessels involved are small and the pressure within them is low. [...] Therefore, pneumothorax is usually {{more of a problem}} than hemothorax. A pneumothorax may form or be turned into a tension pneumothorax by mechanical ventilation, which may force <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tear in the lung.|$|E
2500|$|A 1908 {{paper by}} Geiger, On the Scattering of α-Particles by Matter, {{describes}} the following experiment. He constructed a long glass tube, nearly two meters in length. [...] At {{one end of}} the tube was a quantity of [...] "radium emanation" [...] (R) that served as a source of alpha particles. [...] The opposite end of the tube was covered with a phosphorescent screen (Z). [...] In the middle of the tube was a 0.9mm-wide slit. [...] The alpha particles from R passed through the slit and created a glowing patch of light on the screen. [...] A microscope (M) was used to count the scintillations on the screen and measure their spread. [...] Geiger pumped all the <b>air</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube so that the alpha particles would be unobstructed, and they left a neat and tight image on the screen that corresponded to the shape of the slit. [...] Geiger then allowed some air in the tube, and the glowing patch became more diffuse. [...] Geiger then pumped out the air and placed some gold foil over the slit at AA. [...] This too caused the patch of light on the screen to become more spread out. [...] This experiment demonstrated that both air and solid matter could markedly scatter alpha particles. [...] The apparatus, however, could only observe small angles of deflection. [...] Rutherford wanted to know if the alpha particles were being scattered by even larger angles—perhaps larger than 90°.|$|E
