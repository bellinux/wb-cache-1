5|$|In May 2007, the TSB {{released}} {{copies of}} the audio recordings of the <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> transmissions associated with the flight. The transcripts of these recordings had been released in 1998 (within days of the crash), but the TSB had refused to release the audio on privacy grounds. The TSB argued that under Canada's Access to Information Act and Privacy Act, the audio recordings constituted personal information and were thus not disclosable. Canada's Federal Court of Appeal rejected this argument in 2006 in a legal proceeding concerned with <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> recordings in four other air accidents. The Supreme Court of Canada did not grant leave to appeal that decision and consequently the TSB released {{a copy of the}} Swissair 111 <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> audio recordings to the Canadian Press, which had requested the recordings under the Access to Information Act.

5|$|On October 13, 2006, {{two days}} after the crash, the FAA banned all fixed-winged {{aircraft}} from the East River corridor unless in contact with local <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control.</b> The new rule, which took effect immediately, required all small aircraft (with the exception of helicopters and certain seaplanes) to seek the approval of and stay in contact with <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> while in the corridor.
