This measure {{is controlled by}} {{a short list of}} easily identifiable plants (indicators). Flora, agronomical and ecological value of a set of 671 grassland of four French natural regional parks were studied. The indicators used for the control are mainly linked to the total species richness of the grasslands. other aspects of the grassland value are less related to these indicators, inclusing ecosystem services like preservation of patrimonial species or contribution to pollinator activity. Agronomical value of grasslands seems poorly linked to the short lists of plants. Finally, the methods used to construct plant lists were analysed.

40|$|Our study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the impacts of}} an <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measure</b> implemented in Swiss arable landscapes, the wild flower strips, on the diversity of arthropods (butterflies, spiders and carabid beetles). We tested whether (i) wild flower strips harbour a higher arthropod diversity than conventional fields and (ii) arthropod diversity is enhanced by wild flower strips at the landscape scale. Wild flower strips had more arthropod species and typical set of species as compared to conventional fields, but they had similar or lower activity-density of epigeic arthropods. The percentage cover of wild flower strips in the landscape context had a positive influence only on carabid assemblages, reflecting an effect of extensification measures at the landscape scale for carabid beetles. For each arthropod group, the efficiency of wild flower strips might also {{vary according to the}} presence of conventional grasslands or crop fields in the surrounding landscape...|$|E

In addition to increasing the awareness of the problem among farmers and policy makers, evaluation of {{the economic}} damage caused by erosion can promote the implementation of more sustainable soil management practices. In the present study, we describe {{a new approach to}} evaluate incentives for the adoption of <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measure</b> (AEM) in degraded and eroded vineyards. To estimate this incentive, the replacement cost (RC) and the loss of income are calculated when the vineyard is managed with conventional tillage versus a cover crop (AEM). Our findings show that the incentive could range from the loss of income due to AEM adoption to the ecosystem service benefit (RCC-RCAEM). In our case study, the incentive ranged from 315 Euroha(- 1) (loss of income) to 1, 088 Euroha(- 1) (ecosystem service benefit). Within this range, the incentive amount is determined according to efficiency criteria based on vineyard slope. We also present a conceptual model of public spending efficiency that should help policy makers decide how to allocate the incentives so as to maximize the economic return associated with ecosystem services...|$|E

Based on the theory of farm household, the model used for this analysis takes into account this absence of rivalry characterising the environmental goods. Using this model with data from a survey of 245 farmers, the econometric analysis confirms the validity of this type of behaviour and shows in particular to what extent the household's environmental sensitivity influences the probability of adopting these two <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measures.</b> The econometric results for the adoption of the late mowing measure compared to those for the willingness to accept a payment to adopt this measure are coherent with each other and confirm the validity of using contingent evaluation to estimate the costs of providing a public good by private agents.

40|$|Agri-environment schemes {{such as the}} Environmental Stewardship in England {{provide a}} range of options, {{including}} some targeted at single species, which may benefit {{a wide range of}} other species or taxa. To ascertain whether trials of an <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measure</b> designed for a single species had wider biodiversity benefits, we describe monitoring of pollinators (bumblebees and butterflies) on plots of a novel seed mix aimed at providing a source of seed food throughout the breeding season for the rapidly declining European Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur. We compare pollinator abundance on these turtle dove plots to that on six control habitat types: fallow, grass margins, meadow, nectar flower mixture, wild bird cover and floristically enhanced margins. The abundance of foraging bumblebees and butterflies was higher on turtle dove plots than in fallow and wild bird cover habitats. Surprisingly, foraging bumblebee abundance was higher, and foraging butterfly abundance marginally higher on turtle dove plots than on nectar flower mixture. Whilst the specific mix described here is to be altered to increase access to foraging turtle doves, we suggest that the modified mix, to be rolled out through Higher Level Stewardship, is also likely to provide valuable resources for pollinators, adding to the growing body of literature demonstrating multi-taxa benefits of agri-environment options designed to benefit one species...|$|E
40|$|The loss of seed-rich {{wintering}} habitats {{has been}} a major contributory cause of farmland bird population declines in western Europe. Agricultural grasslands are particularly poor winter foraging habitats for granivorous birds, which have declined most in the pastoral farming regions of western Britain. We describe an experiment to test the utility of fertile ryegrass (Lolium) swards as a potentially rich source of winter seed for declining farmland birds. Four patches of final-cut grass silage were allowed to set seed and were left in situ overwinter. Half of each patch was lightly aftermath grazed in an attempt to increase the accessibility of the seed to foraging birds and reduce the perceived predation risk. Large numbers of yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella) and reed buntings (E. schoeniclus) foraged on the seeded plots throughout the winter. They preferred to forage on ungrazed seeded plots, where the accumulation of senescent foliage resulted in a 14 % average loss in silage yield in the following season. However, seed produced on the plots also led to sward regeneration, increasing subsequent yields on some plots. The technique offers clear benefits as a potential future <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measure</b> for declining granivorous birds, with wide applicability, but requires further development to minimise sward damage and costs to the farmer. Autumn grazing should reduce sward damage, but at the cost of reduced usage by buntings. Using the technique just prior to reseeding would be one way of avoiding any costs of sward damage...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{intensive}} farming caused pronounced {{changes to}} the European arable flora. Many species adapted to less intensive traditional farming declined severely, as did the potential of unsown arable vegetation to support higher trophic levels. To reverse these trends, various agri-environment measures were introduced. One such measure is to manage cereal headlands as conservation headlands, involving strict restrictions on pesticide and fertiliser use. An additional modification to management which could reduce crop competition and thus deliver benefits to arable plants is cereal sowing at reduced rates. However, {{little is known about}} its benefits to rare and declining arable plants, or to species of value to higher trophic levels, and whether it can be implemented without concomitant increase in undesirable weeds. We set up identical two-factorial experiments in winter wheat and spring barley, combining a nitrogen fertiliser versus no fertiliser treatment with cereal sowing at economic rates versus sowing at rates reduced by 75 %, with added sowing of a mixture of rare arable species. Both experiments also included an uncropped but cultivated control equivalent to another <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measure.</b> Our results show that reduced cereal sowing in conservation headlands can benefit rare and declining species, as well as arable plant diversity, without necessarily resulting in a concomitant increase in undesirable weeds. While such benefits tended to be larger in uncropped cultivated controls, conservation headlands have the advantage of not requiring land being taken out of production. Moreover, as shown in this study, their benefits to arable plants can be maximised by reduced sowing...|$|E

To alleviate the effect of agricultural intensification, farmers are compensated via agri-environment schemes for carrying out farming in ways to preserve and restore biodiversity.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to apply the Driving forces-Pressures-State-Impact-Responses (DPSIR) {{framework}} to identify the issues of pollinator loss. The linkages between the significant pressures on insect pollinators, their underlying socio-economic driving forces and responses, with the focus on Europe, are addressed in the study. A review of literature revealed the shortage of empirical studies that prove direct links between policy responses and specific pressures on the pollinators. Based on written evidence and expert judgement, land use practices and the use of agrochemicals were regarded as the most significant pressures on different functional groups of pollinators. As demonstrated in the study, agricultural and rural development policy has been the key driving force of these pressures. The application of the DPSIR framework proved to be useful in identifying the pathway of human pressures on pollinators. The study also concludes that there is further need for specific empirical research on the effects and effectiveness of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) <b>measures</b> (<b>agri-environment</b> <b>measures</b> in particular) to support farming practices that facilitate the protection of the environment and the prevention of pollinator loss.

40|$|Environmental {{objectives}} {{have become}} increasingly integrated into the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) since the mid- 1980 s.

Increasing small mammal populations on farmland is important for improving the biodiversity of agricultural ecosystems. This study assessed the small mammal communities associated with 42 riparian margins in the south-east of Ireland. Riparian margins were separated into those dominated by grassy, scrubby or woody vegetation. Results suggested that riparian margins dominated by woody vegetation had the greatest abundance of small mammals. Significantly more small mammals were captured in woody habitats as opposed to grassy or scrubby habitats. Although they had the greatest abundance of small mammals, woody habitats showed the least diversity, with the small mammal community consisting almost entirely of woodmice. Results from this study suggest that current Irish agri-environmental measures, which can lead to succession of vegetation and result in scrub and wood dominated margins, do not promote small mammal diversity in riparian margins.

40|$|Support {{for rural}} {{development}} and <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measures</b> is often defended {{on the basis}} of the contribution of farming to the attractiveness of rural areas and the growing rural tourism sector. Farmers may benefit from the presence of tourism by offering accommodation or selling farm products to tourists. We analyse rural tourism data for Flanders to determine whether agricultural amenities contribute to the price rural tourists are willing to pay for lodging at a farm. We find that farming practices do indeed influence the attractiveness of an area for tourism and have an impact on the prices that can be charged for accommodation. Amenities from agriculture such as permanent grassland have a positive influence on rental prices. However, the presence of intensive agricultural and livestock farming and associated polluting activities decrease the attractiveness of rural regions for tourism. Farm tourism is found to make an important contribution to the farm income and economy of a rural region. Farm tourism constituted more than 30 per cent of the farm income of certain farms. Overall, our findings support the idea of major synergies between farming and rural tourism. Strengthening this relationship may therefore be a good strategy for countryside management and rural development.

We use data from 315 transects, completed {{as part of a}} national acoustic survey of bat distribution, to examine the incidence of four bat species adjacent to linear features in rural areas. The use of linear features was assessed in relation to hedgerow width, tree density, the presence of water and woodland proximity. To examine the effect of tree density, linear features were classified as either hedgerows without trees, hedgerows with sparse trees (comprising 50 % tree canopy). The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pipstrellus was not affected by tree density; linear features of all types were associated with a similar increase in P. pipistrellus incidence. The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pygmaeus was dependent on both tree density and the proximity of woodland; only linear features containing trees provided an increase in P. pygmaeus incidence regardless of woodland proximity. P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus incidence was not affected by hedgerow width or the presence of water. Incidence of Nyctalus noctula and Eptesicus serotinus was unaffected by the density of linear features of any type.

Many species, {{such as the}} Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus, have undergone severe declines across Europe, despite being targeted by <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measures.</b> This study assessed whether there were additive effects of soil variables (depth, pH and organic matter content) in explaining Lapwing distribution, after controlling for known habitat relationships, at 89 farmland sites across Scotland. The addition of these soil variables and their association with elevation improved model fit by 55 %, in comparison with models containing only previously established habitat relationships. Lapwing density was greatest at sites at higher elevation, but only those with less peaty and less acidic soil. Lapwing distribution is being constrained between intensively managed lowland farmland with favourable soil conditions and upland sites where lower management intensity favours Lapwings but edaphic conditions limit their distribution. Trials of soil amendments such as liming are needed on higher elevation grassland sites to test whether they could contribute to conservation management for breeding Lapwings and other species of conservation concern that depend upon soil-dwelling invertebrates in grassland soils, such as Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata, Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris and Ring Ouzel Turdus torquatus.

This paper conceives AEM as an evolving instrument, a product that takes shape, gets diffused and taken up in, by and through networks of relations. Success then depends on the mobilisation or active participation {{of all those who}} may support and develop it. Using the examples of the Flanders' and Walloon regions of Belgium, the paper sets out to examine the mechanisms by which mobilisation for agri-environmental management develops, and by doing so, {{to gain a better understanding}} of mobilisation capacity as a concept to be used for evaluating policy implementation in this area. The study follows AEM along the various trajectories of implementation (design, distribution, application). The findings reveal how mobilisation capacity is gradually built-up by the interplay between AEM and the networks it connects to. The case illustrates well how such interactions occur all the way from administration offices to farmers' fields, and that their nature can be very different (e. g., formal and informal, durable and short-lived, expected and unexpected). It is concluded that in evaluating actor-networks, one should look at them in an open and fluid manner, that is, not to privilege any particular configuration or form of attachment over the other, not take intentions and objectives as a starting point but instead address the opportunities for synergies, and be aware that any network built around the instrument may change its content and the way it functions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Six of {{the soil}} {{degradation}} processes recognised at EU level are closely linked to agriculture. Soil degradation implies a need for protection, maintenance and improvement of soil quality. However, due to the public good characteristics of soil quality, the market does not sufficiently assure its provision. Thus, policy intervention is required to reach desired levels of soil quality through appropriate practices. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of EU polices that have scope for addressing soil degradation in agriculture. To this aim, EU legislation and legislative proposals along with related evaluations and research projects were analysed with the intervention logic approach. To date, soil protection is not a specific objective of EU legislation but features in some policies as a secondary objective. Pursuing other environmental objectives contributes to some extent to soil quality, although not always effectively. Currently, the most important EU environmental directives for soil quality are the Nitrates Directive and the Water Framework Directive. Under the Common Agricultural Policy, the compulsory requirement to keep land in good agricultural and environmental condition {{plays an important role}} in soil protection and conservation. Rural development policy, in particular <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measures,</b> offers member states or regions options for encouraging farmers to achieve environmental quality beyond a predefined reference level. Overall, the study indicates that the existing EU policies have the potential to address all recognised soil degradation processes across the EU. Nevertheless, they should be well targeted and ask for appropriate farm management in order to reach desired levels of soil quality. JRC. DDG. J. 5 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R

To halt the decline, grassland conservation {{measures have been}} included in most European agri-environment schemes. This is the first study to compare the botanical composition of grassland habitats managed under the Irish Agri Environment Options Scheme (AEOS). Sixty fields on dry stock pastoral farms in receipt of agri-environment payments for grassland conservation were surveyed, with twenty fields being enrolled in each of the following AEOS options: Traditional Hay Meadow (THM), Species Rich Grassland (SRG) and Natura 2000 species rich grassland (Natura). The vegetation quality of sites enrolled in the Natura measure was higher than those enrolled in the THM and SRG measures. Natura sites had the greatest species richness with a mean > 40 species per site, which included approximately 17 species indicative of high botanical quality. Traditional Hay Meadow sites had the lowest species richness (mean 29 species per site) and were dominated by species associated with improved grassland. Some THM sites had good levels of botanical richness and were similar in composition to Natura sites, with some Natura sites having a lower vegetation quality, more similar to that of THM sites. Species Rich Grassland had a botanical richness that was intermediate between THM and Natura sites. A thorough assessment of the effectiveness of these measures was confounded by a lack of quantitative objectives for the target community composition to be attained. We discuss limitations and potential opportunities regarding the design, targeting, implementation and cost-effectiveness of these <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measures.</b> accepted for publicationTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|R

Agricultural abandonment {{may be a}} significant and low cost strategy for carbon sequestration and mitigation of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions due to the vegetation recovery and increase in soil organic matter. The {{aim of this study}} was to: (i) estimate the influence of different Soil Regions (areas characterized by a typical climate and parent material association) and Bioclimates (zones with homogeneous climatic regions and thermotype indices) on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics after agricultural land abandonment; and (ii) to analyse the efficiency of the <b>agri-environment</b> policy (<b>agri-environment</b> <b>measures)</b> suggested by the European Commission in relation to potential SOC stock ability in the Sicilian Region (Italy). In order to quantify the effects {{of agricultural}} abandonment on SOC, a dataset with original data that was sampled in Sicily and existing data from the literature were analysed according to the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) methodology. Results showed that abandonment of cropland soils increased SOC stock by 9. 03  Mg C ha−  1 on average, ranging from 5. 4  Mg C ha−  1 to 26. 7  Mg C ha−  1 in relation to the Soil Region and Bioclimate. The estimation of SOC change after agricultural use permitted calculation of the payments for ecosystem service (PES) of C sequestration after agricultural land abandonment in relation to environmental benefits, increasing in this way the efficiency of PES. Considering the 14, 337  ha of abandoned lands in Sicily, the CO 2 emission as a whole was reduced by 887, 745  Mg CO 2. Therefore, it could be concluded that abandoned agricultural fields represents a valid opportunity to mitigate agriculture sector emissions in Sicily...|$|R
40|$|Disponibile online AgEcon Search: [URL] Starting {{from the}} McSharry reform in 1992, {{environmental}} conservation and minimization of negative agricultural impacts through adoption of agri-environmental farming practices have gained momentum within the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Agenda 2000 {{and the recent}} issuing of Regulation 1698 / 2005 – with its strong accent on CAP’s second pillar – have further emphasized the need to reduce environmental risks {{within the context of}} sustainable and integrated rural development. Nowadays, agri- environmental measures are the only compulsory measure for Member States in the Rural Development Programs. The result of this shift in CAP objectives is the increased agri-environmental spending in the total EU agricultural budget and the parallel growth in farmland enrolled in <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measures</b> throughout Europe in the last decade. Since the start of the new policy trend, the EU has invested considerable effort in monitoring and evaluating its impacts on the various environmental items and progress has been made. However, less is known so far on the factors inducing farmers’ participation in the agri-environmental programs. This paper aims to explore this field taking the Veneto Region of Italy as a case study. The framework for the analysis is represented by the four main agri-environmental actions in place in the Veneto Region in the period 2000 - 2006, with their main objectives, eligibility criteria, ranking priorities and budget assigned. Farmers’ behavior has been explained via farm characteristics, farmland structure, as well farmers’ socio-economic profile, attitudes and perceptions towards agri-environmental measures. These variables have been collected in a survey of participating and non-participating farmers. This is crucial information that can affect policy success and therefore needed for further policy design...|$|R

In Europe, changes in farmland management practices driven in part by the European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have caused dramatic declines in associated biodiversity. This thesis studied avian land-use associations to understand the relative importance of different habitat and landscape elements to the farmland bird community, with particular emphasis on priority species for conservation, in Cyprus, a recently acceded EU Member State, as a case study for the eastern Mediterranean. Results provide the first evidence base to inform CAP <b>agri-environment</b> <b>measures</b> in the region. A wide range of habitats and land-uses were important for bird species and assemblages and local habitat diversity was of key value. Farmland habitats, particularly viticulture and groves, and remnant scrub were the most important, demonstrating the high value of heterogeneous farmland mosaics to breeding and wintering avian biodiversity in Cyprus. The area of land under agriculture in Cyprus has substantially decreased, with much of this attributable to declines in marginal low-intensity crops on which much avian biodiversity depends. Building development appears to be one important driver behind these trends. Changes observed in the distributions of Sardinian Warbler Sylvia melanocephala, a recently established breeder in Cyprus, and the endemic Cyprus Warbler Sylvia melanothorax are more likely mediated by changing land-use patterns relating to grazing intensity of scrub, as {{there was no evidence of}} competitive displacement. The complex Mediterranean farmland mosaic was created by traditional farming practices that are usually economically marginal. Agri-environment mechanisms to support this heterogeneity are necessary for effective conservation of priority species and bird biodiversity in the eastern Mediterranean...|$|R
