40|$|<b>Halftone</b> <b>gravure</b> {{has become}} the {{accepted}} front end imaging procedure for the publication <b>gravure</b> industry. <b>Halftone</b> <b>gravure</b> refers to using screened or halftone film when imaging a gravure cylinder. This procedure has allowed the publication gravure industry {{to benefit from the}} prepress advantages of offset printing. Therefore, the possibilities of an allowable color tolerance between a <b>halftone</b> <b>gravure</b> print and a SWOP standard offset press proof in hue, saturation, and brightness needed to be studied. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether an allowable color tolerance could be achieved between the gravure production print and the SWOP standard offset press proof. The experimental design involved the research of the effects of clear extender varnish modifications of gravure inks used to produce an allowable color tolerance between a gravure print and a SWOP standard offset press proof. It was important to compare the gravure print to the SWOP standard offset press proof because the publication gravure industry recognized the SWOP standard offset press proof as the standard or control parameter. The methodology was based upon the modification of gravure inks by the addition of 10...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to quantitatively analyze off-press color {{proofing}} methods for advertising material appearing in <b>halftone</b> publication <b>gravure</b> printing. This type of proofing has been an area of debate for the publications industry, especially in reference to the print quality of advertising material. The correlation between dot gain characteristics and the resulting color differences of off-press color proofing methods has been the center of greatest controversy. This paper has tested to determine if a correlation exists between dot gain characteristics and the resulting colorimetric-matching ability for color proofing methods used in <b>halftone</b> publication <b>gravure.</b> The variable dot-gain feature of an electrophotographic proofing system was tested to determine if this feature improved the color matching ability of the off-press proof to the SWOP offset press proof. This system was analyzed by its 2 ̆ 7 ability to objectively match the SWOP offset press proof for dot gain aimpoints. These aimpoints are used as the quality control tool for advertising material appearing in both <b>halftone</b> <b>gravure</b> and web offset publications printing. The experiment concluded that the dot gain characteristic curve of the electrophotographic off-press proof could be altered to quantitatively match closer to the dot gain of an offset press proof printed to SWOP/GAA Specifications. However, the data did not completely support the authors 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis. A direct correlation between dot gain and the resulting delta E values could not be established. None of the data collected from the electrophotographic test sets completely proved that a change in dot gain produced a closer colorimetric match to the SWOP/GAA Offset Press Proof...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Control {{engineering}} courses {{conducted in}} the classroom need to be integrated with design and implementation of controllers. This paper describes the implementation of an online Internet laboratory for control experiments for this purpose. It could be an effective alternative to setting up a fully equipped laboratory. The pilot plant used is the rotary inverted pendulum. The setup allows the user to select an appropriate test signal and collect real data for estimating the plant parameters. Using the model identified {{as a basis for}} controller design, the students then verify their design by specifying the controller parameters and perform a swing up and balancing experiment on the <b>actual</b> <b>inverted</b> pendulum over the Internet...|$|R

In a space booster on takeoff, a control {{system must be}} employed to prevent the rocket from falling over as it is forced upward by the engines. One accurate dynamic model of the space booster on takeoff is the inverted pendulum. This paper investigated the inverted pendulum system from development of equations of motion, through implementation of an <b>actual</b> <b>inverted</b> pendulum system using state variable feedback control. The concept of state variable feedback was analyzed in determining {{a solution to the}} problem of control of the inverted pendulum. Most importantly, design and construction of a working, solid state controlled, inverted pendulum demonstration model was accomplished. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a control law that linearizes {{inverted}} dynamics is developed. The equation for inverted circular dynamics {{is derived from}} differential method and an integral method. By making alternate approximative assumptions of the inverted circular manifold with hyperbolic functions, an inverting control function is derived. Computer simulation {{results show that the}} alternate manifold linearizes the inverted dynamics. Analog simulation results show that the developed control law in this paper linearizes inverted dynamics. The method can be applied other nonlinear systems that have a gain term for the position of the angle in the sinusoid nonlinearity such as the space station. Because of torque requirements of the <b>actual</b> <b>inverted</b> systems such as the space station and inverted pendulum, a nonlinear adaptive gain is added. The adaptive gain is derived from a hyperbolic function which also results in a linearizing inverting function. (1991) A. M. S. (MOS) Subject Classification Codes. 34, [...] ...|$|R
30|$|A source {{inversion}} method using {{very fast}} simulated annealing is proposed {{to estimate the}} earthquake rupture process, and associated radiation of broadband strong ground motions. We invert the displacement and velocity motions separately to estimate the spatio-temporal distributions of effective stress and moment. The developed method {{is applied to the}} near-source strong motions in the frequency range up to 5 Hz from the 1997 Izu-Hanto Toho-Oki earthquake (Mjma 5.9). Results of the displacement inversion indicate that for this earthquake the seismic moment is mainly released from the shallower region and the northern area from the hypocenter. Similar results are obtained from the velocity inversion, and the variation of the effective stress also exhibits a similar behavior to the moment distribution. Based on the inversion results, we propose a characterized source model that consists of the finite number of asperities and a background area with uniform effective stresses. The broadband ground motion simulation demonstrates that the characterized source model successfully reproduces the observed ground motions in spite of the simplification of <b>actual</b> (<b>inverted)</b> source process. This suggests our proposed inversion method and source characterization process are suitable for the strong-motion prediction that reflects the high-frequency radiation from an actual earthquake.|$|R

40|$|Abstract only availableSurface wave {{velocity}} measurements are a non-destructive and non-intrusive means {{to determine the}} shear {{wave velocity}} (VS) profile at soil sites. The VS profile is a primary input for site amplification calculations and is also used in the International Building Code to determine site classification. In many cases, surface wave measurements are performed at sites where complicating conditions exist, such as velocity inversions or embedded stiff layers. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the effectiveness of surface wave inversion procedures at complex geotechnical sites. This was accomplished by using simulated surface wave measurements at both simple and complex soil sites. The stimulated surface wave data was analyzed using the Spectral-Analysis-of-Surface-Waves (SASW) method and a linearized least-squared inversion approach was performed to estimate the VS profile. Comparisons are presented between the <b>actual</b> and <b>inverted</b> VS profiles for several common complex geotechnical profile conditions.

40|$|International audienceThe {{inversion}} problem {{concerns the}} identification of parameters of a volcanic source causing observable changes in ground deformation data recorded in volcanic areas. In particular, this paper deals with the inversion of ground deformation measured by using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) interferometry and an inversion approach formulated {{in terms of an}} optimization problem is proposed. Based on this inversion scheme, it is shown that the problem of inverting ground deformation data in terms of a single source, of Mogi or Okada type, is numerically well conditioned. In the paper, two case studies of <b>inverting</b> <b>actual</b> SAR data recorded on Mt.

40|$|Mode-converted PS-waves {{can provide}} {{critically}} important information for velocity analysis in transversely isotropic (TI) media. Here we demonstrate, with physical-modeling data, {{that the combination}} of longspread reflection traveltimes of PP- and PS-waves can be inverted for the parameters of a horizontal TI layer with a tilted symmetry axis. The 2 D multicomponent reflection data are acquired over a phenolic sample manufactured to simulate the effective medium formed by a system of steeply dipping, penny-shaped cracks. The reflection moveout of PS-waves in this model is asymmetric, and the moveout-asymmetry attributes {{play a crucial role in}} constraining the TI parameters. Applying the modified PP+PS=SS method to the PP and PS traveltimes recorded in the symmetry-axis plane, we compute the time and offset asymmetry attributes of the PSwaves along with the traveltimes of the pure SS reflections. Then the moveout attributes of the PP-, SS-, and PS-waves are inverted for the medium parameters. Our estimates of the tilt of the symmetry axis and layer thickness almost coincide with the <b>actual</b> values. The <b>inverted</b> model is also validated by reproducing the results of transmission experiments with both P- and S-wave sources. In particular, the transmitted SV wavefield exhibits a prominent cusp (triplication) accurately predicted by the parameter-estimation results...|$|R
