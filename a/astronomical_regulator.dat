2500|$|The Rembrandt Room Now {{called the}} Chandos Delta Dormitory. Immediately {{to the east}} of the Breakfast Parlour, {{originally}} dated 1748, the room was extended and redecorated in 1775. In a relatively plain room, the painting that {{used to be in the}} centre of the ceiling, Venus at her toilet by Vincenzo Valdrè was sold in 1922 along with the marble chimneypiece with its central relief of Hebe and Jupiter's Eagle. The room once contained eleven paintings attributed to Rembrandt although only three are considered so now, the rest being School of Rembrandt. All the paintings were sold in 1848. They included: Samson Threatening his Father-in-law, in 1989 this was sold by the estate of the late P Chrysler Jr; Bellona now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Self-Portrait as a Young man now in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum; Eleazor Swalmius now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp; A Young Negro Archer and (genuine Rembrandt) The Centurion Cornelius sold for £2,300 (the highest price any of the paintings sold in 1848 fetched) both now in the Wallace Collection. Also originally in this room and now in the Wallace Collection are the almost [...] high <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulator</b> clock by Michael Stollewerck formerly at the Palace of Versailles and a Boulle armoire. Also from this room was a German marquetry cabinet, later bought by Mayer Amschel de Rothschild for Mentmore Towers. It was in this room that Queen Victoria and her husband slept during their visit, redecorated for the occasion, including the purchase of the largest Persian carpet in the country, 25.5 by , this cost £200, but only fetched £55 in the 1848 sale. The 2nd Duke spent £5,300 on redecorating the house and on entertaining the royal couple for a visit that lasted a few days.|$|E

50|$|By 1900, {{the highest}} {{precision}} <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulators</b> used pendulums of {{low thermal expansion}} materials like invar and fused quartz.|$|R
5000|$|During the Industrial Revolution, {{daily life}} was {{organized}} around the home pendulum clock. More accurate pendulum clocks, called regulators, were installed in places of business and railroad stations and used to schedule work and set other clocks. The need for extremely accurate timekeeping in celestial navigation to determine longitude drove {{the development of the}} most accurate pendulum clocks, called <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulators.</b> These precision instruments, installed in naval observatories and kept accurate within a second by observation of star transits overhead, were used to set marine chronometers on naval and commercial vessels. Beginning in the 19th century, <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulators</b> in naval observatories served as primary standards for national time distribution services that distributed time signals over telegraph wires. [...] From 1909, US National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the US time standard on Riefler pendulum clocks, accurate to about 10 milliseconds per day. In 1929 it switched to the Shortt-Synchronome free pendulum clock before phasing in quartz standards in the 1930s. [...] With an error of around one second per year, the Shortt was the most accurate commercially produced pendulum clock.|$|R
5000|$|Clemens Riefler {{precision}} regulator clocks achieved accuracies of 10 milliseconds per day, {{and were}} {{guaranteed to be}} within 30 milliseconds. [...] With over 600 made, they {{were one of the}} most widely used <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulators,</b> and became the highest standard for timekeeping in the early 20th century. They were used worldwide in astronomical observatories, naval observatories, and as primary standards for electrical time dissemination services, which delivered time signals by telegraph wire. Riefler clocks had internal switch contacts for this purpose, which delivered a 1 Hz time signal to external equipment. The first time standard for the United States, provided by the Bureau of Standards (now NIST), was from 1904 to 1929 generated by Riefler clocks.|$|R
5000|$|... 2013 A {{new world}} record {{was set on}} Saturday, November 23 at Fontaine’s Auction Gallery in Pittsfield Ma. when an E. Howard No. 68 <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Regulator</b> clock was sold for $277,300.00 making it the highest price ever paid at auction for a clock by E. Howard & Co.|$|E
5000|$|The Riefler {{escapement}} is {{a mechanical}} escapement for precision pendulum clocks invented and patented by German instrument maker Sigmund Riefler in 1889. [...] It {{was used in}} the <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulator</b> clocks made by his German firm Clemens Riefler from 1890 to 1965, which were perhaps the most accurate all-mechanical pendulum clocks made.|$|E
50|$|Succeeding Willard generations {{continued}} successfully as horologists. Beginning in 1828, Simon Willard Jr. (1795-1874) apprenticed in horology at his father's shop; he subsequently {{established his}} own workshop in Boston. Also, he specialized in both watches and chronometers, while his foremost jobs were Harvard's astronomical clock and the <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulator</b> which standardized {{the time for}} all New England's railroads.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century {{specialized}} escapements {{were used}} in the most accurate clocks, called <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulators,</b> which were employed in naval observatories and for scientific research. The Riefler escapement, used in Clemens-Riefler regulator clocks was accurate to 10 milliseconds per day. Electromagnetic escapements, which used a switch or phototube to turn on a solenoid electromagnet to give the pendulum an impulse without requiring a mechanical linkage, were developed. The most accurate pendulum clock was the Shortt-Synchronome clock, a complicated electromechanical clock with two pendulums developed in 1923 by W.H. Shortt and Frank Hope-Jones, which was accurate to better than one second per year. A slave pendulum in a separate clock was linked by an electric circuit and electromagnets to a master pendulum in a vacuum tank. The slave pendulum performed the timekeeping functions, leaving the master pendulum to swing virtually undisturbed by outside influences. In the 1920s the Shortt-Synchronome briefly became the highest standard for timekeeping in observatories before quartz clocks superseded pendulum clocks as precision time standards.|$|R
5000|$|The torsion {{pendulum}} {{was invented by}} Robert Leslie in 1793. [...] The {{torsion pendulum}} clock was first invented and patented by American Aaron Crane in 1841. [...] He made clocks that would run up to one year on a winding. He also attempted to make precision <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulator</b> clocks based on the torsion pendulum, but only four sold.|$|E
50|$|The term is loosely used {{to refer}} to any clock that shows, in {{addition}} to the time of day, astronomical information. This could include the location of the sun and moon in the sky, the age and Lunar phases, the position of the sun on the ecliptic and the current zodiac sign, the sidereal time, and other astronomical data such as the moon's nodes (for indicating eclipses) or a rotating star map. The term {{should not be confused with}} <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulator,</b> a high precision but otherwise ordinary pendulum clock used in observatories.|$|E
50|$|As a scientist, Van der Willigen did {{significant}} work in {{the research}} on physical units - where he tried to use the wavelength of light to set a new and trustworthy standard for a unit of distance. In those days there was insufficient data on the reliability of measurement units because errors {{had been made in}} the standards based on the circumference of the earth. The Dutch Minister of the Interior had requested the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen in 1851 {{to come up with a}} new standard for both length and weight. Inspired by this discussion and a publication by the Swedish scientist Anders Ångström in 1855, Van der Willigen decided to dedicate himself first to the determination of the refractive index and the wavelength of light, in order to be able to more accurately define the unit of length. In the inner garden of the Museum, he had a small observatory built in 1866/1867, where he set up several precision instruments to determine the latitude (zenith telescope) and time (clock). There he also kept an <b>astronomical</b> <b>regulator,</b> heliostat, spectroscope, diffraction gratings, microscope with micrometer, balance, thermometers and barometers. He also ordered the standards of length (glass) and weight (copper). Combining these instruments he tried to determine a standard of length by use of a seconds pendulum (initially a Foucault pendulum, later he ordered a Repsold reversible pendulum which arrived shortly after his death). Besides his work on measurements, he also purchased acoustics instruments, on which he gave a series of lectures in the museum.|$|E
