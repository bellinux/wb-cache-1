50|$|The Guadalupe {{fur seal}} (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi)</b> {{is one of}} six members of the fur seal genus Arctocephalus. Sealers reduced the {{population}} {{to just a few}} dozen by the late 19th century, but the species had recovered to 10,000 in number by the late 1990s. Many individuals can be found on Mexico's Guadalupe Island.|$|R
50|$|Many island or {{marine species}} that reside {{on or near}} Guadalupe also {{frequent}} the Channel Islands, and vice versa. In {{stark contrast to the}} rampant extinction of terrestrial life that happened at the same time, Guadalupe was the last refuge for the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) and the Guadalupe fur seal (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi)</b> in the 1890s. The island has been a pinniped sanctuary since 1975.|$|R
40|$|In April and June 1968, the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program (POBSP) of the Smithsonian Institution {{conducted}} surveys on breeding marine {{birds and}} pinnipeds on various Mexican islands. Between 18 to 26 April and 21 to 29 June, pinniped populations were surveyed at Islas de Guadalupe, San Benito, Cedros, and Natividad off Baja California. Species observed were the California sea lion, Zalophus californianus, Guadalupe fur seal, <b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi,</b> harbor seal, Phoca vitulina, and northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostri...|$|R
50|$|Guadalupe Island is {{a volcano}} with {{a height of}} 5800 m. Its surface area is {{approximately}} 250 km². It is a center of endemism with 34 species of plants, including two classes (Redman and Moran, 1997); eight land birds; one sea bird; eleven land snails; and at least 18 species of insects (Gonzales, 1981). The island is an important breeding site for marine mammals such as the Guadalupe fur seal (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi),</b> elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), and numerous species of birds, including the Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis note {{constitutes}} {{the first report}} of the Guadalupe fur seal (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi)</b> for Oaxaca. This subadult male was found stranded {{on a beach in}} Cerro Hermoso, in the Lagunas de Chacahua National Park (PNLC). This record is highly relevant because the normal range for this fur seal is farther north, in Guadalupe Island and a recolonization site in the San Benito Archipelago, more than 1, 300 km from the stranding location. This is the southernmost report for A. townsendi and the first case for Oaxaca, increasing the number of known marine mammal species for this area in the Mexican South Pacific. Because of the current population growth of this otariid, we highlight the necessity of tracking these atypical sightings over time...|$|R
5000|$|Guadalupe Island {{was a major}} {{destination}} for Russian and American fur hunters seeking the Guadalupe fur seal (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi)</b> in the 18th and 19th centuries, until they were nearly extinct by 1844. Captain Auguste Duhaut-Cilly reported in 1827 that a Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands) brig [...] "had spent several months there and collected three thousand sealskins". The northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) was also ruthlessly hunted for the oil in its blubber. They {{were thought to be}} extinct in 1884 until a remnant population of eight individuals was discovered on Guadalupe Island in 1892 by a Smithsonian expedition, who promptly killed seven of them for their collections. The elephant seals managed to survive, and were finally protected by the Mexican government in 1922. All surviving northern elephant seals share the same male ancestor.|$|R
40|$|The feeding {{ecology of}} {{juvenile}} and subadult Guadalupe fur seals (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi)</b> at San Benito Archipelago, Baja California, Mexico, was investigated {{to determine if}} dietary differences exist between these two age classes. During the summer of 2007, 108 scats of fur seals were collected from areas used mainly by juveniles (n = 54 scats) or subadults (n = 54 scats). Cephalopod beaks and/or otoliths were found in all samples collected. Only 702 squid beaks of 1, 144 were identified to species level (61. 3 %). Only four of eight otoliths found were identified to species level (50 %). Six squid species and two fish species were identified. Both juveniles and subadults showed similar dietary composition; however, differences between prey selection were found. The California market squid (Loligo opalescens) {{was the most common}} squid species for both age classes in the summer of 2007. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The Guadalupe {{fur seal}} (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi)</b> is a {{specialist}} predator feeding on prey present in one trophic level. Data {{related to the}} diet of the Guadalupe fur seal are few. It is still unknown {{where most of the}} individuals forage or the composition of their diet. On Isla Guadalupe, the San Benito Archipelago and the Farallon Islands, fur seals primarily feed on pelagic and coastal squids. However, differences between colonies were found probably caused by differences in diversity and abundance of prey species over the continental shelf and the pelagic environment, and maybe due to the plasticity of the species in their foraging behavior. Diet composition of the Guadalupe fur seal might reflect adaptations to local and temporal environmental conditions. The aim of this work was to consider historical information, add new information, identify main prey species, and determine where in the marine regions the Guadalupe fur seals feed. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analize the re–colonization process of the San Benito Archipelago by the Guadalupe fur seal (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi).</b> The {{archipelago}} is of great importance for the species, since it can be consolidated in the future as a breeding colony, which would imply a great achievement for the fur seal's natural recovery. Population growth, population structure, feeding behavior, foraging trips duration (which shows an important feeding area near), behavior and pup attendance, are characteristics that help analyze and study this process; where San Benito grows as a colony and, therefore, is established as a new breeding colony. Furthermore, this expansion of the breeding territory might reflect the gregarious nature of the species, and fidelity to breeding areas as well. The importance of this work is that it is an initial description of the recolonization of a species that almost disappears. It can be expected to continue increasing the number of individuals at the archipelago, since it is unlikely that in a short period of time, the breeding territory and the food availability limit the birth of offspring and the population growth. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The Guadalupe {{fur seal}} (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi)</b> {{formerly}} ranged from Islas Revillagigedo (19 Â°N lat) northward to the Farallon Islands, California (Repenning, Peterson, and Hubbs 1971). The species was intensively hunted throughout its range and nearly exterminated by commercial sealers in the 19 th century. A few surviving animals discovered in 1928 on Isla de Guadalupe, Mexico were quickly slaughtered; the species {{was not observed}} again until its 2 ̆ 2 rediscovery 2 ̆ 2 in 1949, when a single male was observed on San Nicolas Island, California (Bartholomew 1950). Subsequently, {{a small group of}} fur seals was found on Isla de Guadalupe in 1954 (Hubbs 1956). The fur seal population on Isla de Guadalupe increased slowly from a few hundred animals in 1956 to 1000 - 2000 animals in 1978 (Pierson 1978). Although the Guadalupe fur seal has not been reported from San Nicolas Island since 1949 (Bartholomew 1950), occasional sightings of adult males and juveniles have been made on San Miguel Island, approximately 110 km to the northwest, and at sea in the Southern California Bight (G. Antonelis and R. L. DeLong, pers. comm.) ...|$|R
40|$|Although the California {{sea lion}} (Zalophus californianus) {{is the only}} {{pinniped}} resident in the Gulf of California, there are occasional records of 3 additional species; here we report 4 recent records of the Guadalupe fur seal (Artocephalus townsendi), 6 of the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) and 2 of the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Harbor seals have been observed mostly during the winter-spring months of El Niño years, before water temperature warms in the summer. It is possible that juveniles and subadult and adult males of A. townsendi and M. angustirostris are using the Gulf as an alternative feeding area during the season of intensive feeding as individuals disperse more and more widely as their populations grow. Aunque en el golfo de California, el único pinnípedo residente es el lobo marino de California (Zalophus californianus), existen registros ocasionales de otras 3 especies; en la presente nota se proporcionan 4 registros recientes de lobo fino de Guadalupe (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi),</b> 6 de elefante marino del norte (Mirounga angustirostris) y 2 de foca común (Phoca vitulina). La foca común se ha observado principalmente durante los meses de invierno-primavera en años de El Niño, antes del calentamiento anual del agua en verano. Es posible que los juveniles y los machos sub-adultos y adultos tanto de A. townsendi como de M. angustirostris hagan uso del golfo como un sitio alternativo durante la temporada de alimentación intensiva como de su expansión geográfica debido a su incremento poblacional...|$|R
40|$|Guadalupe {{fur seals}} (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi)</b> were {{decimated}} by 19 th century commercial sealers {{in the northeastern}} Pacific and thought to be extinct until 1928 when commercial fishermen caught two adult males at Isla de Guadalupe {{from a group of}} up to 60 adults and pups (Wedgeforth 1928, Huey 1930). These two animals were brought to the San Diego Zoo, prompting several zoological expeditions to Isla de Guadalupe in the 1930 s and 1940 s, but none successfully located Guadalupe fur seals. In 1949, a single male was seen on San Nicolas Island, California (Bartholomew 1950), and in 1954, a small breeding group of animals was found in a cave at Isla de Guadalupe (Hubbs 1956). The population had grown to at least 500 animals in 1967, to about 7, 400 animals in 1993, and to 12, 176 in 2003, with breeding populations currently confined to Mexico’s Islas de Guadalupe and San Benito (Peterson et al. 1968, Gallo-Reynoso 1994, Gallo-Reynoso et al. 2005, Carretta et al. 2007). Although small numbers of Guadalupe fur seals haul out on the California Channel Islands today, including a female and single pup born on San Miguel Island in 1997, they are vastly outnumbered by California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus), and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina), all of which currently breed on San Miguel Island (Stewart et al. 1993, Melin and DeLong 1999, DeLong and Melin 2002). Archaeological and genetic data suggest, however, that the modern distribution and abundance of Guadalupe fur seals are very different from prehistoric distributions (Walker and Craig 1979, Colten 2002, Etnier 2002 a, Walker et al. 2002, Weber et al. 2004) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTissue-cyst forming coccidia in {{the family}} Sarcocystidae are {{etiologic}} agents of protozoal encephalitis in marine mammals including the federally listed Southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris). California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), whose coastal habitat overlaps with sea otters, are definitive hosts for coccidian protozoa provisionally named Coccidia A, B and C. While Coccidia A and B have unknown clinical effects on aquatic wildlife hosts, Coccidia C is associated with severe protozoal disease in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). In this study, we conducted surveillance for protozoal infection and fecal shedding in hospitalized and free-ranging California sea lions on the Pacific Coast and examined oocyst morphology and phenotypic characteristics of isolates via mouse bioassay and cell culture. Coccidia A and B were shed in similar frequency, particularly by yearlings. Oocysts shed by one free-ranging sea lion sampled at Año Nuevo State Park in California were previously unidentified in sea lions and were most similar to coccidia infecting Guadalupe fur seals (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi)</b> diagnosed with protozoal disease in Oregon (USA). Sporulated Coccidia A and B oocysts did not replicate in three strains of mice or in African green monkey kidney cells. However, cultivation experiments revealed that the inoculum of fecally-derived Coccidia A and B oocysts additionally contained organisms with genetic and antigenic similarity to Sarcocystis neurona; {{despite the absence of}} detectable free sporocysts in fecal samples by microscopic examination. In addition to the further characterization of Coccidia A and B in free-ranging and hospitalized sea lions, these results provide evidence of a new role for sea lions as putative mechanical vectors of S.  neurona, or S.  neurona-like species. Future work is needed to clarify the distribution, taxonomical status, and pathogenesis of these parasites in sea lions and other marine mammals that share their the near-shore marine environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} of California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) (CSLs) and Guadalupe fur seals (<b>Arctocephalus</b> philippii <b>townsendi)</b> (GFSs) from the San Benito Archipelago (SBA) was determined through nine monthly surveys in 2014 - 2015. Assessment of their foraging habits was examined {{based on the}} isotopic analysis of pups (maternal indicators) (SIAR/SIBER-R). Environmental variability between 2014 and 2015 was also analyzed, in terms of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentration. Both otariids reached their highest abundance in July of both years; however, relative to 2014, the 2015 survey showed a 59. 7 % decline in the total GFS abundance and a 42. 9 % decrease of GFS pups, while total CSL abundance decreased 52. 0 % and CSL pup presence decreased in 61. 7 %. All monthly surveys for both otariids showed a similar trend (> 50 % decrease in 2015). Compared to 2014, the 2015 GFSs isotopic niche was three times larger (2. 0 in 2015, 0. 6 in 2014) and the δ 13 C was significantly lower. CSLs also showed significantly lower δ 13 C and higher δ 15 N in 2015. Interannual segregation was greater for CSLs, and their pup body mass was also significantly lower during the 2015 breeding season (mean = 8. 7 kg) than in the same season of 2014 (mean = 9. 9 kg). The decrease in δ 13 C for both otariids reflected a more oceanic foraging; most likely associated with the decline in primary productivity in surrounding areas to the SBA, related to a higher SST caused by the 2015 ENSO, with a subsequent increase in foraging effort. These would explain the fewer observed individuals on land, especially pups, which showed diminished body condition (CSLs). This study {{highlights the importance of}} marine mammals as sentinel species that respond dynamically to changes in environment, providing valuable information on the effect of ENSO on pinnipeds in Mexican waters...|$|R
40|$|The {{offshore}} {{waters and}} the coastline of Oregon provide year-round habitat {{for a number}} of birds, marine mammals, sea turtles, and possibly bats, at least fifteen of which are federally listed as threatened or endangered. Previous workshops on offshore renewable energy have provided baseline information on the distribution and abundance of these species on the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). There are varying amounts of baseline information for offshore species; however, seasonal variability and relative abundance are generally known at a broad scale. Sea turtles are subtropical and tropical breeders and all species found on the Pacific OCS are uncommon north of Mexico. Sea turtles that occur in the waters off of Oregon are primarily leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea); however, loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas), and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) sea turtles could also occur. All of these species are listed as either threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA); there is designated Critical Habitat for the leatherback sea turtle off the Oregon coast. Sea turtles are drawn to offshore waters during the summer upwelling period where they feed on a variety of pelagic and benthic organisms. A diversity of marine mammals occur offshore of Oregon including 24 species of cetaceans and 6 species of pinnipeds. Sea otters are rare, but stragglers from Washington are occasionally seen along the Oregon coast. Among the cetaceans seen in Oregon waters, the north Pacific right (Eubalaena japonica), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), sei (Balaenoptera borealis), humpback (Megaptera novaengliae), killer (Orcinus orca), and sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) whales are listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA. Federally listed pinnipeds include the Guadalupe fur seal (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>townsendi)</b> and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), the latter of which also has designated Critical Habitat off the Oregon coast. Little is known about the offshore movement of bats on the Pacific OCS, but observations from the Farallon Islands off San Francisco have regularly recorded the presence of the migratory hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) during migration periods. Modeling has shown that hoary bat arrivals and departures correlate with low wind speeds, low moon illumination, and relatively high degrees of cloud cover. In addition, low barometric pressure predicted arrivals. The status of bats offshore has received little to no attention and study is needed to determine their presence on the Pacific OCS. Marine birds occur widely on the Pacific OCS off Oregon. Nearshore areas are inhabited by a variety of species of sea ducks, loons, grebes, cormorants, pelicans, gulls, terns, and several alcids. Deepwater areas 8 - 35 miles offshore and beyond are inhabited by albatrosses, shearwaters, petrels, storm-petrels, skuas, jaegers, alcids, and pelagic shorebirds, gulls and terns. Federally listed species under the ESA that have been extensively monitored and studied along the Oregon coast include the Western Snowy Plover (Charadrius nivosus nivosus) and Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus). As studies reveal more information about the population status and movements of the endangered Short-tailed Albatross (Phoebastria albatrus) and Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis), we are finding that these species are rare, but regular off the Oregon coast at specific times of the year. Previous workshops on offshore renewable energy have also described the potential effects that the construction and operation of energy devices could have on these taxonomic groups. Activities that can have effects on these species include construction and operational activities, vessel traffic, seismic surveys, foundation and cable installation, turbine operation, foundation protection, and the ongoing presence of cables. Resulting effects include collision and entanglement, barotrauma (particularly for bats), prey base and habitat alteration, trash ingestion (particularly for sea turtles), displacement, movement barriers, electromagnetic field effects, light attraction, pollution, and noise impacts. Renewable energy conferences and workshops have identified knowledge and data gaps {{that need to be addressed}} to inform the planning and regulating of commercial-scale projects on the Pacific OCS. Gaps identified for sea turtles include understanding their seasonal use of the OCS particularly for post-hatchling stages; noise and EMF effects; and comprehensive population estimates; the latter will be difficult to assess due to the turtles’ solitary nature and wide distribution. Gaps identified for marine mammals include information on site-specific baseline data on occurrence, distribution, and behavior; site-specific acoustic effects on species with low frequency sensitivity; baseline information on migration routes and home ranges; impacts on gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus); monitoring to understand interactions between marine mammals and renewable energy devices; and acoustic-related effects. Gaps identified for marine birds include site-specific spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of birds at sea; nocturnal activity; important areas of bird activity that should be avoided; important migration patterns; potential effects on seabird prey; energetic consequences; and effects of EMF, noise, lights and structures, and collision risk. Sensitivity analysis and decision support tools have also been identified as necessary to assess the risk to marine birds. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Environmental Studies Program has funded a variety of seabird and marine mammal studies to collect baseline information and assess the effects of conventional and renewable energy projects on the Pacific OCS. Recently completed studies focused on renewable energy include a summary of knowledge of select areas of the Pacific coast, an analysis of the effects of EMFs from undersea power cables on marine species, and protocols for baseline studies and monitoring for ocean renewable energy. A number of additional studies focused on renewable energy are underway or proposed, several of which should eliminate some of the identified knowledge and data gaps. These include aerial surveys of seabirds and marine mammals off the Pacific Northwest, assessing vulnerability of marine birds to offshore renewable energy devices, data synthesis and high-resolution predictive modeling of marine bird distributions in the Pacific, and several others. In addition, there are pilot studies in the Atlantic that are assessing and testing technologies that could be used for surveying and monitoring birds, bats, marine mammals, and sea turtles in the Pacific...|$|R
