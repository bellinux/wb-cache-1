5|$|Martin {{provides}} {{a variety of}} female characters to explore the place of women in a patriarchal society. Writing all characters <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> with the same basic needs, dreams, and influences, his female characters are to cover the same wide spectrum of human traits as the males.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} also immortalized in the Hungarian epic poem Szigeti Veszedelem ("Peril of Sziget"), written in fifteen parts by Zrinski's {{great-grandson}} Nicholas VII of Zrin (also a Ban of Croatia) in 1647 {{and published in}} 1651. This {{was one of the}} first such epics in the Hungarian language and was also inspired by Marulić's Judita. Kenneth Clark's renowned history Civilisation lists the Szigeti Veszedelem as one of the major literary achievements of the 17th century. In spite of the author and other members of Zrinski family being fierce enemies of the Turks, the poem never demonizes them. The Turks are portrayed <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and a love story between Deliman the Tatar and the Sultan's daughter Cumilla is interwoven into the main plot.|$|E

25|$|Also, the {{representation}} and {{approach of the}} client (<b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>being)</b> and social issue (<b>as</b> <b>human</b> issue) in social work is made from the humanistic psychology position. According to Petru Stefaroi, the way humanistic representation and approach of the client and his personality is realized is, in fact, the theoretical-axiological and methodological foundation of humanistic social work.|$|R
25|$|In a sense Hartness was {{responding}} to the era's enthusiastic fervor for scientific management, which Hartness and many others felt did not adequately address the psychology of how to manage employees <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and maintain their respect.|$|E
25|$|Gurdjieff's {{teaching}} {{addressed the}} question of humanity's {{place in the universe}} and the importance of developing latent potentialities—regarded as our natural endowment <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> but rarely brought to fruition. He taught that higher levels of consciousness, higher bodies, inner growth and development are real possibilities that nonetheless require conscious work to achieve.|$|E
25|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for human meaning in the sky; it seeks to understand general and specific human behavior through the influence of planets and other celestial objects.

25|$|The {{invisible}} world {{represents the}} vital energies which originates from the transcendent powers of Roog, which spreads worldwide.

They form the demi-goods, saints and ancestral spirits (Pangool), etc.|$|E
25|$|Several {{specific}} {{dimensions of}} Sahagún's work (and {{that of other}} Franciscans in New Spain) reflect this philosophical anthropology. The native peoples were believed to have dignity and meritd respect <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> The friars were, for the most part, deeply disturbed by theconquistadores' abuse of the native peoples. In Sahagún's collaborative approach, in which he consistently gave credit to his collaborators, especially Antonio Valeriano, the Franciscan value of community is expressed.|$|E
25|$|Mediæval European miners {{believed}} in underground spirits. The kobold filled this role in German folklore and {{is similar to}} other creatures of the type, such as the English bluecap, Cornish knocker and the Welsh coblynau. Stories of subterranean kobolds were common in Germany by the 16th century. Superstitious miners believed the creatures to be expert miners and metalworkers who could be heard constantly drilling, hammering, and shoveling. Some stories claim that the kobolds live in the rock, just <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> live in the air.|$|E

25|$|In {{the teachings}} of the Theosophical Society, Devas are {{regarded}} as living either in the atmospheres of the planets of the solar system (Planetary Angels) or inside the Sun (Solar Angels) and they help to guide the operation of the processes of nature such as the process of evolution and the growth of plants; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames {{about the size of a}} human. It is believed by Theosophists that devas can be observed when the third eye is activated. Some (but not most) devas originally incarnated <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Animal persons (usually {{mammals and}} birds, but {{including}} insects) appear {{to enjoy a}} relative autonomy which is lacking {{in the case of}} the animal 'co-essences'. Perhaps representing the transformed human beings of a former creation, they play varying social roles. In the Popol Vuh, for example, grandfather 'Great White Peccary' and grandmother 'Great White Coati' act as healers, whereas the owl messengers of the lords of the underworld wear military titles. Turning to the 'ceramic codex', one finds that animal persons are often clothed and acting like persons at court. The howler monkey, for example, is commonly depicted in the social role of a writer and sculptor, and functions as a divine patron of these arts. Other mammals function as musicians. In the Dresden Codex, certain animals (dog, jaguar, vulture, owl, parrot, frog), most of them clothed <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> are seated in between deities, and seem thus to be treated on a par with the latter, while other animals, again acting <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> fulfill important ritual roles. In the New Year rites, for example, an opossum traveller introduces the patron of the incoming year. Similarly, in the Paris Codex, a turkey person alternates with deities in offering the head of the lightning deity (god K) to the new king. Animal persons are repeatedly shown interacting with Goddess I.|$|E

25|$|The huge {{losses on}} the battlefields were {{not limited to}} men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and {{ammunition}} (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were {{being sent to the}} front bearing no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. The soldiers did not feel that they were being treated <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> or even as valuable soldiers, but rather as raw materials to be squandered {{for the purposes of the}} rich and powerful.|$|E
25|$|Earth's {{surface is}} {{situated}} fairly {{deep in a}} gravity well. The escape velocity required {{to get out of}} it is 11.2 kilometers/second. <b>As</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> evolved in a gravitational field of 1g (9.8m/s²), an ideal propulsion system would be one that provides a continuous acceleration of 1g (though human bodies can tolerate much larger accelerations over short periods). The occupants of a rocket or spaceship having such a propulsion system would be free from all the ill effects of free fall, such as nausea, muscular weakness, reduced sense of taste, or leaching of calcium from their bones.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000 presidential elections, PAN {{candidate}} (and eventual winner) Vicente Fox used homosexual stereotypes to demean and humiliate {{his principal}} opponent (Francisco Labastida). Fox accused Labastida {{of being a}} sissy and a mama's boy and nicknamed him Lavestida ("the cross-dressed"). When Mexico City and Coahuila legalized same-sex civil unions the chief opposition came from the PAN, former President Vicente Fox and former President Felipe Calderón. Since then the party has opposed similar bills, with the rationale of protecting traditional family values. Nonetheless, PAN officials have insisted that homosexuals have rights <b>as</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and should in no case be subjected to hatred or physical violence.|$|E
