25|$|In micro{{economic}}s, {{supply and}} demand is an economic model of price determination in a market. It postulates that in <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>market,</b> the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles {{at a point where}} the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the quantity supplied (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity transacted.|$|E
50|$|Supply {{and demand}} is an {{economic}} model of price determination in <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> <b>market.</b> It concludes that in <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> with no externalities, per unit taxes, or price controls, the unit price for a particular good is the price at which the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers. This price results in a stable economic equilibrium.|$|R

Krueckeberg and Paulsen note conflicting politics, government corruption and street violence in slum regularization process {{is part of the}} reality. Slum upgrading and tenure regularization also upgrade and regularize the slum bosses and political agendas, while threatening the influence and power of municipal officials and ministries. Slum upgrading does not address poverty, low paying jobs from informal economy, and other characteristics of slums. It is unclear whether slum upgrading can lead to long term sustainable improvement to slums.|$|E
25|$|However, {{competitive}} {{markets are}} not without limitations. Basic economic theory dictates that for competition to exist, {{a large number of}} market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive markets can lead to market power concentration and market manipulation. In these jurisdictions, the market has been threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share. The case of Enron in California is a prime example. For <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.|$|E
25|$|A {{government}} may subsidize {{production of a}} public good in the private sector. Unlike government provision, subsidies may result {{in some form of}} <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>market.</b> The potential for cronyism (for example, an alliance between political insiders and the businesses receiving subsidies) can be limited with secret bidding for the subsidies or application of the subsidies following clear general principles. Depending on the nature of a public good and a related subsidy, principal–agent problems can arise between the citizens and the government or {{between the government and the}} subsidized producers; this effect and counter-measures taken to address it can diminish the benefits of the subsidy.|$|E

40|$|In this article, we {{show that}} common {{insurance}} policy provisions—namely, deductibles, coinsurance, and maximum limits—can arise {{as a result of}} adverse selection in <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> insurance <b>market.</b> Research on adverse selection typically builds on the assumption that different risk types suffer the same size loss and differ only in their probability of loss. In this study, we allow the severity of the insurance loss to be random and, thus, generalize the results of Rothschild and Stiglitz [1976] and Wilson [1977]. We characterize the separating equilibrium contracts in <b>a</b> Rothschild-Stiglitz <b>competitive</b> <b>market.</b> By further assuming <b>a</b> Wilson <b>competitive</b> <b>market,</b> {{we show that}} an anticipatory equilibrium might be achieved by pooling, and we characterize the optimal pooling contract.

25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{negative}} externalities, the introduction of taxes into a market reduces economic efficiency by causing deadweight loss. In <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>market</b> {{the price of a}} particular economic good adjusts to ensure that all trades which benefit both the buyer and the seller of a good occur. The introduction of a tax causes the price received by the seller to be less than the cost to the buyer by the amount of the tax. This causes fewer transactions to occur, which reduces economic welfare; the individuals or businesses involved are less well off than before the tax. The tax burden and the amount of deadweight cost is dependent on the elasticity of supply and demand for the good taxed.|$|E
