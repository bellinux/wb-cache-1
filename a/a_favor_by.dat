25|$|Carl Barks {{retired in}} 1966, but was persuaded by editor Chase Craig to {{continue}} to script stories for Western. The last new comic book story drawn by Carl Barks was a Daisy Duck tale ("The Dainty Daredevil") published in Walt Disney Comics Digest issue 5 (Nov. 1968). When bibliographer Michael Barrier asked Barks why he drew it, Barks' vague recollection was no one was available and {{he was asked to}} do it as <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> Craig.|$|E
25|$|The last contact Tobares {{had with}} someone was at 12:32p.m. on June 5, 2013, {{the day he}} disappeared. He was {{speaking}} to Verónica Román, a friend from Argentina. While on the phone, Tobares {{explained that he was}} doing Gerardo <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> driving a vehicle from Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara and exchanging it for another of his boss' preference. He told Verónica that they were guiding him along the way, but {{said he did not know}} where he was, that he was scared, and that the whole situation seemed strange to him. That was the last thing Tobares said to Verónica.|$|E

[...] Thomas had had the idea for this mystery of the week {{since the beginning of the}} season; in an interview, he stated that he would like to include several [...] "college-age crimes" [...] such as [...] "this idea of a college girl getting pregnant, and someone getting the idea they're doing her <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> slipping her RU-486." [...] The promos for the episode made it seem as though Veronica was pregnant.|$|E
2500|$|After it {{had been}} {{reported}} in 2006 that Rezko was under federal investigation for influence-peddling, Obama purchased a 10-foot-wide strip of Ms. Rezko's property for $104,500, $60,000 above the assessed value. According to Chicago Sun-Times columnist, Mark Brown, [...] "Rezko definitely did Obama <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> selling him the 10-foot strip of land, making his own parcel less attractive for development." [...] Obama acknowledges that the exchange may have created the appearance of impropriety and stated [...] "I consider this a mistake on my part and I regret it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, German {{chancellor}} Gerhard Schröder cancelled {{an official}} visit to Prague after Zeman called the ethnic Germans in pre-war Czechoslovakia [...] "Hitler's Fifth column". Zeman stated that [...] "the Czechs and Slovaks {{were doing the}} Sudeten Germans <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> expelling them, because they granted them their wish to go Heim ins Reich". Later, Zeman called Karel Schwarzenberg, his rival {{in the presidential campaign}} of 2013, a [...] "sudeťák" [...] (Sudeten German), leading the Austrian Die Presse to ascribe Zeman's victory to an [...] "unprecedented anti-German dirty campaign." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2011 Cockburn {{wrote in}} favour of a {{substantial}} increase in the minimum wage, continued his opposition to anti-immigrant hysteria, envisioning a high-wage economic model as the alternative. While at the same time Cockburn writes sympathetically of proposals by Ron Unz to institute a tax-free cash payment of $5,000 to $10,000 to immigrants looking to return to their country of birth. He writes [...] "Unz does us all <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> raising important [...] questions [...] {{about the role of the}} reserve army of the unemployed or of migrants in sustaining the current low-wage capitalist economy. He poses an escape from the low-wage vortex, which is also all to the good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simmons {{was deeply}} {{disappointed}} to lose {{on the first}} round of voting. Despite his promise to the contrary, Simmons then decided to force a primary with McMahon. Four days later, on May 25, Simmons reversed himself again, and suspended his campaign, saying he could not compete financially with McMahon's deep pockets. Although Simmons was no longer campaigning, he often disparaged McMahon to the press. He told The National Review that he did not think McMahon [...] "can win at all". He also said that if she were to ask for his help, he would say he was [...] "preoccupied". Simmons said he did McMahon <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> stopping his campaign, but he did not endorse her. He said he would not call off the August primary because [...] "voters deserve another choice." [...] Many of Simmons' hardcore backers also refused to back McMahon.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas was a {{relentless}} self-promoter, and he persuaded railroads {{to give him}} free passage in exchange for articles extolling rail travel. When he visited Alaska, he hit upon the novel idea of the travelogue, movies about faraway places. When the United States entered World War I, {{he was part of}} an official party sent by President Wilson, former president of Princeton, to [...] "compile a history of the conflict." [...] In reality, the mission was not academic. The war was not popular in the United States, and Thomas was sent to find material that would encourage the American people to support it. Thomas did not want to merely write about the war, he wanted to film it. He estimated that $75,000 would be needed for filming, which the U.S. government thought too expensive, and so he turned to a group of 18 Chicago meat packers. (He had done them <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> exposing someone who was blackmailing them, without the damaging material becoming public.) ...|$|E

Accordingly, without more words, the sky was shifted from the shoulders of Atlas, and placed upon those of Hercules.|$|E
60|$|When I {{was quite}} a young man I adopted {{literature}} as a profession, and having passed through the necessary preparatory grades, I found myself, after a good many years of hard and often unremunerative work, in possession {{of what might be}} called a fair literary practice. My articles, grave, gay, practical, or fanciful, had come to be considered with <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> the editors of the various periodicals for which I wrote, on which I found in time I could rely with a very comfortable certainty. My productions created no enthusiasm in the reading public; they gave me no great reputation or very valuable pecuniary return; but they were always accepted, and my receipts from them, at the time to which I have referred, were as regular and reliable as a salary, and quite sufficient to give me more than a comfortable support.|$|E
60|$|The whole {{arrangements}} of the household, to me {{fresh from the}} simplicity and order of New England, had a singular and wild sort of novelty which was attractive rather than otherwise. I was well recommended in the family by an influential and wealthy gentleman of Boston, who represented my family, as indeed it was, as among {{the oldest and most}} respectable of Boston, and spoke in such terms of me, personally, as I should not have ventured to use in relation to myself. When I arrived, I found that two or three tutors, who had endeavored to bear rule in this tempestuous family, had thrown up the command after a short trial, and that the parents felt some little apprehension {{of not being able to}} secure the services of another,--a circumstance which I did not fail to improve in making my preliminary arrangements. I assumed an air of grave hauteur, was very exacting in all my requisitions and stipulations, and would give no promise of doing more than to give the situation a temporary trial. I put on an air of supreme indifference as to my continuance, and acted in fact rather on the assumption that I should confer <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> remaining.|$|E

60|$|The king, however, did {{insist upon}} it, and Gyges was {{compelled}} to yield. Whatever is offered as <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> a half-intoxicated despot to an humble inferior, it would be death to refuse. Gyges {{allowed himself to be}} placed behind a half-opened door of the king's apartment, when the king retired to it for the night. There he was to remain while the queen began to unrobe herself for retiring, with a strict injunction to withdraw at a certain time which the king designated, and with the utmost caution, so as to prevent being observed by the queen. Gyges did as he was ordered. The beautiful queen laid aside her garments and made her toilet for the night with all the quiet composure and confidence which a woman might be expected to feel while in so sacred and inviolable a sanctuary, and in the presence and under the guardianship of her husband. Just as she was about to retire to rest, some movement alarmed her. It was Gyges going away. She saw him. She instantly understood the case. She was overwhelmed with indignation and shame. She, however, suppressed and concealed her emotions; she spoke to Candaules in her usual tone of voice, and he, on his part, secretly rejoiced in the adroit and successful manner in which his little contrivance had been carried into execution.|$|E
60|$|One truly English {{object was}} a {{barometer}} {{hanging on the}} wall, generally indicating one or another degree of disagreeable weather, and so seldom pointing to Fair, that I began to consider that portion of its circle as made superfluously. The deep chimney, with its grate of bituminous coal, was English too, as was also the chill temperature that sometimes called for a fire at midsummer, and the foggy or smoky atmosphere which often, between November and March, compelled me to set the gas aflame at noonday. I am not aware of omitting anything important in the above descriptive inventory, unless it be some book-shelves filled with octavo volumes of the American Statutes, and a good many pigeon-holes stuffed with dusty communications from former Secretaries of State, and other official documents of similar value, constituting part of {{the archives of the}} Consulate, which I might have done my successor <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> flinging into the coal-grate. Yes; there was one other article demanding prominent notice: the consular copy of the New Testament, bound in black morocco, and greasy, I fear, with a daily succession of perjured kisses; at least, I can hardly hope that all the ten thousand oaths, administered by me between two breaths, to all sorts of people and on all manner of worldly business, were reckoned by the swearer as if taken at his soul's peril.|$|E
60|$|The joyous {{visit of}} a week, {{which has been}} here so poorly {{recovered}} from the past, came to an end, and the host went with his guest to the station in as much vehicular magnificence as had marked his going to meet him there. Harte {{was no longer the}} alarming portent of the earlier time, but an experience of unalloyed delight. You must love a person whose worst trouble-giving was made somehow <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>by</b> his own unconsciousness of the trouble, and it was a most flattering triumph to have got him in time, or only a little late, to so many luncheons and dinners. If only now he could be got to the train in time the victory would be complete, the happiness of the visit without a flaw. Success seemed to crown the fondest hope in this respect. The train had not yet left the station; there stood the parlor-car which Harte had seats in; and he was followed aboard for those last words in which people try to linger out pleasures they have known together. In this case the sweetest of the pleasures had been sitting up late after those dinners, and talking them over, and then degenerating from that talk into the mere giggle and making giggle which Charles Lamb found the best thing in life. It had come to this as the host and guest sat together for those parting moments, when Harte suddenly started up in the discovery of having forgotten to get some cigars. They rushed out of the train together, and after a wild descent upon the cigar-counter of the restaurant, Harte rushed back to his car. But by this time the train was already moving with that deceitful slowness of the departing train, and Harte had to clamber up the steps of the rearmost platform. His host clambered after, {{to make sure that he}} was aboard, which done, he dropped to the ground, while Harte drew out of the station, blandly smiling, and waving his hand with a cigar in it, in picturesque farewell from the platform.|$|E
