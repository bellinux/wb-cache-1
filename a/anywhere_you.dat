500|$|By 09:00, {{hundreds}} of people had arrived to observe the tree's toppling. At 10:00, the final cutting commenced. Criss decided to topple the tree downhill onto a ledge, which narrowed between the two ravines that emptied into Trace Fork. While it was assessed that the shelf was not {{long enough for the}} tree to land on, it was agreed upon by all the participants that given the rotten nature of the tree's top section, it would fracture notwithstanding the orientation of its fall. Prior to Criss cutting further into the tree, he assured the crews: [...] "I can put her <b>anywhere</b> <b>you</b> want her gentlemen.

500|$|Leading Marine officers, however, {{were not}} all of the same opinion. Cushman, the new III MAF commander, {{supported}} Westmoreland (perhaps wanting to mend Army/Marine relations after the departure of Walt). Other concerns raised included the assertion that the real danger to I Corps was from a direct threat to Quang Tri City and other urban areas; that a defense would be pointless as a threat to infiltration, since NVA troops could easily bypass Khe Sanh; that the base was too isolated and that the Marines [...] "had neither the helicopter resources, the troops, nor the logistical bases for such operations". Additionally, Shore argues that the [...] "weather was another critical factor because the poor visibility and low overcasts attendant to the monsoon season made such operations hazardous." [...] Brigadier General Lowell English (assistant commander 3rd Marine Division) complained that the defense of the isolated outpost was ludicrous. [...] "When you're at Khe Sanh, you're not really <b>anywhere.</b> <b>You</b> could lose it and you really haven't lost a damn thing." ...|$|E
