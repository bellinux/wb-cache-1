40|$|The {{incidence}} of whooping cough in the US {{has been rising}} slowly since the 1970 s, but the pace of this has accelerated sharply since <b>acellular</b> pertussis <b>vaccines</b> replaced the earlier whole cell vaccines in the late 1990 s. A similar trend occurred in many other countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and Spain, following the switch to <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The key question is why. Two leading theories (short duration of protective immunologic persistence and evolutionary shifts in the pathogen to evade the vaccine) explain some {{but not all of}} these shifts, suggesting that other factors may also be important. In this synthesis, we argue that sterilizing mucosal immunity that blocks or abbreviates the duration of nasopharyngeal carriage of Bordetella pertussis and impedes person-to-person transmission (including between asymptomatically infected individuals) is a critical factor in this dynamic. Moreover, we argue that the ability to induce such mucosal immunity is fundamentally what distinguishes whole cell and <b>acellular</b> pertussis <b>vaccines</b> and may be pivotal to understanding much of the resurgence of this disease in many countries that adopted <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Additionally, we offer the hypothesis that observed herd effects generated by <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines</b> may reflect a modification of disease presentation leading to reduced potential for transmission by those already infected, as opposed to inducing resistance to infection among those who have been exposed...|$|R
50|$|The <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{are more}} {{commonly}} used {{in the developed world}} due to less side effects. Between 10 and 50% of people given the whole-cell vaccines develop redness at the injection site or fever. Febrile seizures and long periods of crying occur in less than 1% of people. With the <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines</b> a brief period of non serious swelling of the arm may occur. Side effects with both types of vaccines, but especially the whole-cell vaccine, are less the younger the child. The whole-cell vaccines should not be used after seven years of age. Serious long term neurological problems are not associated with either type.|$|R

50|$|Pertussis {{vaccine is}} a vaccine that protects against {{whooping}} cough. There {{are two main}} types: whole-cell vaccines and acellular vaccines. The whole-cell vaccine is about 78% effective while the <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine</b> is 71-85% effective. The effectiveness of the vaccines appears to decrease by between 2 and 10% per year with a more rapid decrease with the acellular vaccines. Vaccinating during pregnancy may protect the baby.

5000|$|The {{pertussis}} booster {{for adults}} {{is combined with}} a tetanus vaccine and diphtheria vaccine booster; this combination is abbreviated [...] "Tdap" [...] (Tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis). It {{is similar to the}} childhood vaccine called [...] "DTaP" [...] (Diphtheria, Tetanus, acellular Pertussis), with the main difference that the adult version contains smaller amounts of the diphtheria and pertussis componentsâ€”this is indicated in the name by the use of lower-case [...] "d" [...] and [...] "p" [...] for the adult vaccine. The lower-case [...] "a" [...] in each vaccine indicates that the pertussis component is acellular, or cell-free, which improves safety by dramatically reducing the incidence of side effects. Adults should request the Tdap instead of just a tetanus vaccination in order to receive the multi-vaccine. The pertussis component of the original DPT vaccine accounted for most of the minor local and systemic side effects in many vaccinated infants (such as mild fever or soreness at the injection site). The newer <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine,</b> known as DTaP, has greatly reduced the incidence of adverse effects compared to the earlier [...] "whole-cell" [...] pertussis vaccine, however the efficacy of the <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine</b> declines faster than the whole-cell vaccine.|$|E
50|$|DTaP (also DTPa and TDaP) is a {{combined}} vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, {{in which the}} component with lower case 'a' is acellular. This {{is in contrast to}} whole-cell, inactivated DTP (aka DTwP). The <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine</b> uses selected antigens of the pertussis pathogen to induce immunity. Because it uses fewer antigens than the whole cell vaccines, it is considered safer, but it is also more expensive. Recent research suggests that the DTP vaccine is more effective than DTaP in conferring immunity; this is because DTaP's narrower antigen base is less effective against current pathogen strains.|$|E
40|$|Serious {{neurological}} disorders reported following whole-cell pertussis {{in comparison to}} <b>acellular</b> pertussis <b>vaccines</b> were evaluated. The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) was analyzed for Emergency Department (ED) visits, life-threatening reactions, hospitalizations, disabilities, deaths, seizures, infantile spasms, encephalitis/encephalopathy, autism, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and speech disorders reported with an initial onset of symptoms within 3 days following whole-cell pertussis and <b>acellular</b> pertussis <b>vaccines</b> among those residing in the US from 1997 to 1999. Controls were employed to evaluate potential biases in VAERS. Evaluations as to whether whole-cell and <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines</b> were administered to populations of similar age and sex were undertaken because these factors might influence the studyâ€™s results. Statistical increases were observed for all events examined following whole-cell pertussis vaccination in comparison to acellular pertussis vaccination, excepting cerebellar ataxia. Reporting biases were minimal in VAERS, and whole-cell and <b>acellular</b> pertussis <b>vaccines</b> were administered to populations of similar age and sex. Biologic mechanisms for the increased reactogenicity of whole-cell pertussis vaccines may stem {{from the fact that}} whole-cell pertussis vaccines contain 3000 different proteins, whereas DTaP contains two to five proteins.

5000|$|The AVN's public {{campaign}} against the pertussis vaccine began with {{an article in the}} May 2009 issue of Living Wisdom written by Meryl Dorey, which questioned the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and the dangers of whooping cough itself.

While the article correctly stated that Sweden had previously withdrawn pertussis vaccination in 1979 due to research showing it was ineffective, she failed to reveal that the vaccine then used in Sweden was different to the effective vaccine used in other countries such as Australia, nor did she reveal that Sweden reintroduced pertussis vaccination in 1996 and this had resulted in huge incidence reduction, with cases falling by 80-90% within 3 years. In the article, Dorey claims that [...] "Whooping Cough is not a vaccine-preventable disease".

40|$|Using a murine {{respiratory}} infection model, we have demonstrated previously that infection with Bordetella pertussis or immunization with a whole-cell pertussis vaccine induced antigen-specific Th 1 cells, which conferred {{a high level}} of protection against aerosol challenge. In contrast, immunization with an <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine,</b> consisting of the B. pertussis components detoxified pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and pertactin adsorbed to alum, generated Th 2 cells and was associated with delayed bacterial clearance following challenge. In this study, we demonstrated that addition of interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) either in vitro or in vivo enhanced type 1 T-cell cytokine responses induced with an <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Furthermore, the rate of bacterial clearance in mice coinjected with IL- 12 and the <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine</b> was similar to that observed following immunization with a potent whole-cell vaccine. Analysis of IL- 12 secretion by murine macrophages suggested that this cytokine is produced in vivo following B. pertussis infection or immunization with the whole-cell vaccine. IL- 12 was detected in the supernatants of lung, splenic, and peritoneal macrophages infected with live B. pertussis or stimulated with heat-killed whole B. pertussis or B. pertussis lipopolysaccharide. In contrast, IL- 12 could not be detected following stimulation of macrophages with the bacterial antigens filamentous hemagglutinin, detoxified pertussis toxin, and pertactin, the components of acellular vaccines. Our findings suggest that induction of endogenous IL- 12 may contribute to the high efficacy of pertussis whole-cell vaccines and also demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} attain these high levels of protection with a less reactogenic <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine</b> incorporating IL- 12 as an adjuvant...|$|E
40|$|The population-level safety {{benefits}} of the acellular pertussis vaccine may have been underestimated because only specific adverse events were considered, not overall impact on health services utilization. Using the Vaccine and Immunization Surveillance in Ontario (VISION) system, the authors analyzed data on 567, 378 children born between April 1994 and March 1996 (before introduction of acellular pertussis vaccine) and between April 1998 and March 2000 (after introduction of acellular pertussis vaccine) in Ontario, Canada. Using the self-controlled case series study design, they examined emergency room visits and hospital admissions occurring after routine pediatric vaccinations. The authors determined the relative incidence of events taking place before introduction of the <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine</b> versus after introduction by calculating relative incidence ratios (RIRs). The observed RIRs demonstrated a highly statistically significant reduction in relative incidence after introduction of the <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine.</b> RIRs for vaccine administered at ages 2, 4, 6, and 18 months were 1. 82 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 64, 2. 01), 1. 91 (95 % CI: 1. 71, 2. 13), 1. 54 (95 % CI: 1. 38, 1. 72), and 1. 51 (95 % CI: 1. 34, 1. 69), respectively, comparing event rates before the introduction of <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccine</b> with those after introduction.

40|$|Abstract Background In Australia two <b>acellular</b> Bordetella {{pertussis}} <b>vaccines</b> {{have replaced}} {{the use of a}} whole cell vaccine. Both of the licensed <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines</b> contain the following three components; pertussis toxoid, pertussis filamentous haemagglutinin and the 69 kDa pertactin adhesin. One vaccine also contains pertussis fimbriae 2 and 3. Various researchers have postulated that herd immunity due to high levels of pertussis vaccination might be influencing the makeup of endemic B. pertussis populations by selective pressure for strains possessing variants of these genes, in particular the pertactin gene type. Some publications have suggested that B. pertussis variants may be contributing to a reduced efficacy of the existing vaccines and a concomitant re-emergence of pertussis within vaccinated populations. This study was conducted to survey the pertactin and pertussis toxin subunit 1 types from B. pertussis isolates in Queensland, Australia following the introduction of <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Methods Forty-six B. pertussis isolates recovered from Queensland patients between 1999 and 2003 were examined by both DNA sequencing and LightCyclerâ„¢ real time PCR to determine their pertactin and pertussis toxin subunit 1 genotypes. Results Pertactin typing showed that 38 isolates possessed the prn 1 allele, 3 possessed the prn 2 allele and 5 possessed the prn 3 allele. All forty-six isolates possessed the pertussis toxin ptxS 1 A genotype. Amongst the circulating B. pertussis population in Queensland, 82. 5 % of the recovered clinical isolates therefore possessed the prn 1 / ptxS 1 A genotype. Conclusion The results of this study compared to historical research on Queensland isolates suggest that B. pertussis pertactin and pertussis toxin variants are not becoming more prevalent in Queensland since the introduction of the <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Current prevalences of pertactin variants are significantly different to that described {{in a number of other}} countries with high vaccine coverage. Relative paucity of recovered isolates compared to notified infections, due primarily to non culture based pertussis diagnostics is however a confounding factor in the assessment of variant prevalence. </p...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{pertussis}} {{resulting from}} infection with B. pertussis {{is a significant}} medical and public health problem, despite the huge success of vaccination that has greatly reduced its incidence. The whole cell vaccine had an undeniable success over the last 50 years, but its acceptance was strongly inhibited by fear, only partially justified, of severe side effects, but also, in the Western world, by the difficulty to enter {{in combination with other}} vaccines: today multi-vaccine formulations are essential to maintain a high vaccination coverage. The advent of <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines</b> was greeted with enthusiasm by the public health world: in the Nineties, several controlled vaccine trials were carried out: they demonstrated a high safety and good efficacy of new vaccines. In fact, in the Western world, the <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines</b> completely replaced the whole cells ones. In the last years, ample evidence on the variety of protection of these vaccines linked to the presence of different antigens of Bordetella pertussis was collected. It also became clear that the protection provided, on average around 80 %, leaves every year a significant cohort of vaccinated susceptible even in countries with a vaccination coverage of 95 %, such as Italy. Finally, it was shown that, as for the pertussis disease, protection decreases over time, to leave a proportion of adolescents and adults unprotected. Waiting for improved pertussis vaccines, the disease control today requires a different strategy that includes a booster at 5 years for infants, but also boosters for teenagers and young adults, re-vaccination of health care personnel, and possibly of pregnant women and of those who are in contact with infants (cocooning). Finally, the quest for better vaccines inevitably tends towards pertussis <b>acellular</b> <b>vaccines</b> with at least three components, which have demonstrated superior effectiveness and have been largely in use in Italy for fifteen years...|$|R
