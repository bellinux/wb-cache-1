30|$|Concerning the algorithm, it {{is based}} on the {{estimation}} of a simple Beveridge curve, that is, a relationship between unemployment and vacancies. The algorithm picks the adjusting date that minimizes the gap between the predicted and the actual unemployment rate at the end of the sample (2012). In other words, the algorithm generates different <b>adjusted</b> vacancies’ <b>series</b> (with Barnichon’s adjustment factors), one for each possible starting year for the adjustment. For each <b>adjusted</b> vacancy <b>series,</b> it predicts unemployment for 2012 using the respective Beveridge curve estimation. Then it chooses the starting date that minimizes the described gap. 2003 is the best year according to this metric 7.|$|R

5000|$|Use of {{seasonally}} adjusted time series {{data can be}} misleading. This is because the seasonally <b>adjusted</b> <b>series</b> contains both the trend-cycle component and the error component. As such, the {{seasonally adjusted}} data will not be [...] "smooth" [...] and {{what appears to be}} [...] "downturns" [...] or [...] "upturns" [...] may actually be randomness in the data. For this reason, if the purpose is finding turning points in a series, it is better to use the trend-cycle component rather than the seasonally adjusted data.|$|E

40|$|A typical {{problem of}} the {{seasonal}} adjustment procedures arises when the observed series is subject to structural breaks. In fact, using the full time interval, the seasonal <b>adjusted</b> <b>series</b> can differ from the "true" seasonal <b>adjusted</b> <b>series,</b> with unclear evidence showed by the usual diagnostic tests. Often the researcher has to decide where cut-off the observed series to obtain a homogeneous span; this is generally performed by a simple visual inspection studies of the graph of the series.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{seasonal}} adjustment filters on the identification of mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive (MAR) models. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, we find that standard seasonal filters might induce spurious autoregressive dynamics, a phenomenon already documented in the literature. Symmetrically, we show that those filters also generate a spurious noncausal component in the seasonally <b>adjusted</b> <b>series.</b> The presence of this spurious noncausal feature {{has important implications for}} modelling economic time series driven by expectation relationships. An empirical application on European inflation data illustrates these results. In particular, whereas several inflation rates are forecastable on seasonally <b>adjusted</b> <b>series,</b> they appear to be white noise using raw data...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} types of tests for the cointegrating rank of VAR processes with a deterministic shift in the level have been proposed in the literature.

Moreover, the small sample size and power properties of the tests are explored.

40|$|After {{demonstrating that}} any nontrivial {{technique}} for seasonally <b>adjusting</b> time <b>series</b> inevitably leads to certain distortions of the data, an effort {{is made to}} provide explicit motivation for the process of seasonal adjustment for purposes of appraising current economic conditions. Inherent advantages in terms of certain consistency requirements of a least square procedure for seasonal adjustment are pointed out. Problems encountered by the econometrician when seasonally <b>adjusted</b> time <b>series</b> are to be employed in regression analysis are also explored. The dummy variable technique for dealing with seasonal fluctuations is generalized to encompass a flexible pattern of seasonal movement. It is argued that when seasonally adjusted data rather than the dummy variable procedure are employed, there is an inherent tendency to overstate the significance of regression coefficients; a correction procedure is suggested. Consideration is given to certain special problems created by autocorrelated residuals when seasonally adjusted data are utilized in regression analysis. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{benchmarking}} monthly and quarterly {{series to}} annual series {{and to the}} Economic Census every five years, the U. S.

However, the Census Bureau’s X− 12 −ARIMA seasonal adjustment program uses a modified Denton procedure to benchmark the seasonally <b>adjusted</b> <b>series</b> to the annual totals of the unadjusted series. Some users have requested a different benchmark method in X− 12 −ARIMA. Statistics Canada has proposed several different benchmark methods, including a regression procedure, to replace the method for benchmarking in X− 12 −ARIMA. Using a sample of U.

There were very consistent results with smooth benchmark factors and small discrepancies in the month-to-month changes with both the Causey-Trager method and some settings of the Regression method.
