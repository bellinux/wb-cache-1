40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} general {{framework}} for studying equational specifications with pre-defined structures. The <b>axioms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>specifications</b> are to define new structures {{in addition to}} the given ones. In particular, they may define a new operator only partially over some given domain. Our approach allows one to assign easily semantics to such specifications in a denotational and operational fashion. In order to enable functional-style computations, we introduce a semantically enriched notion of term rewriting. This rewrite relation also allows us to infer the consistency <b>of</b> the <b>specification.</b> For the latter purpose one has to show confluence modulo the given structures. We outline how to obtain criteria easily for confluence and termination of the rewrite relation of discourse by generalizing results of the classical syntactic rewrite theory...|$|R

5000|$|In 1908, Ernst Zermelo {{proposed}} the first axiomatic set theory, Zermelo set theory. However, as first {{pointed out by}} Abraham Fraenkel in a 1921 letter to Zermelo, this theory was incapable of proving the existence of certain sets and cardinal numbers whose existence was taken for granted by most set theorists of the time, notably the cardinal number &alefsym;&omega; and the set {Z0, &weierp;(Z0), &weierp;(&weierp;(Z0)),...}, where Z0 is any infinite set and &weierp; is the power set operation. Moreover, one <b>of</b> Zermelo's <b>axioms</b> invoked a concept, that of a [...] "definite" [...] property, whose operational meaning was not clear. In 1922, Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem independently proposed operationalizing a [...] "definite" [...] property as one that could be formulated as a first order theory whose atomic formulas were limited to set membership and identity. They also independently proposed replacing the <b>axiom</b> schema <b>of</b> <b>specification</b> with the <b>axiom</b> schema <b>of</b> replacement. Appending this schema, {{as well as the}} <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> regularity (first proposed by Dimitry Mirimanoff in 1917), to Zermelo set theory yields the theory denoted by ZF. Adding to ZF either the <b>axiom</b> <b>of</b> choice (AC) or a statement that is equivalent to it yields ZFC.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the literature, one can {{distinguish}} two main {{approaches to the}} definition of observational semantics <b>of</b> algebraic <b>specifications.</b> On one hand, observational semantics is defined using a notion of observational satisfaction for the <b>axioms</b> <b>of</b> the <b>specifications</b> and, on the other hand, one can define observational semantics by abstraction with respect to an observational equivalence relation between algebras. In this paper, we present an analysis and a comparative study of the different approaches in a more general framework which subsumes the observational case. The distinction between the different observational concepts is reflected by our notions <b>of</b> behavioural <b>specification</b> and abstractor specification. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the semantical equivalence of both kinds <b>of</b> <b>specifications</b> and we show that behavioural specifications can be characterized by an abstractor construction and, vice versa, abstractor specifications can be characterized in terms <b>of</b> behavioural <b>specifications.</b> Hence, there exists a duality between both concepts which allows to express each one by the other. We also study the relationships to fully abstract algebras which can be used for a further characterization of behavioural semantics. Finally, we provide proof-theoretic results which show that behavioural theories <b>of</b> <b>specifications</b> can be reduced to standard theories of some classes of algebras...|$|R
