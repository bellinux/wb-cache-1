The structure of polyaspartic <b>acid</b> <b>derivative</b> {{was characterized by}} means of FTIR. The property of scale inhibition of PASP-SEA-ASP by static experment and weight loss method for corrosion inhibition efficiency were studied. Calcium carbonate crystals in scale samples and corrosive test pieces were analysed by means of SEM. The results showed that under Ca 2 + 400 mg/L, HCO 3 - 800 mg/L and polyaspartic <b>acid</b> <b>derivative</b> 4 mg/L, the scale inhibition rate of polyaspartic <b>acid</b> <b>derivative</b> can reach 67. 42 %. And it also possessed better corrosion inhibition performance and the corrosion inhibition rate can reach 67. 53 %.
