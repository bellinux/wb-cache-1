5|$|Government {{troops were}} {{stationed}} at Aberdour Castle during the Jacobite Rising of 1715. During their stay, a second fire again caused extensive damage. In 1725, the Mortons bought an <b>adjacent</b> <b>property,</b> Cuttlehill House, which they renamed Aberdour House, and the castle {{ceased to be}} a residence. The east range was again repaired, and was used for various purposes, including a school room, a barracks, and a masonic hall. In 1924 the castle and gardens were placed in state care, and continue to be managed by Historic Scotland as a visitor attraction. The south-east wing was initially restored as a home for the custodian, and now houses a cafe. The castle is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the castle, dovecot and walled garden are Category A listed buildings, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland. The grounds, and surrounding former parks, are listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national register of significant gardens.|$|E

Its {{distinctive}} red brick facade has aged fairly well and the porch is nearly exactly {{as it was in}} the late 19th century. Boynton was a dry goods dealer. On the <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> is the Frederick B. Townsend House. Townsend helped found the DeKalb County Farm Bureau and was a native of DeKalb County.|$|E
25|$|Cattle rancher Saundra Gray and her husband, Charles Gray, an Orlando attorney, {{purchased}} 160 {{acres of}} the Gemini Springs Farm in 1969 for $280,000, and later purchased <b>adjacent</b> <b>property.</b> After moving their cattle ranch operation from Osceola County to Gemini Springs Farm, they raised and bred Santa Gertudis cattle. They maintained most of the property in its natural state, only using a portion for cattle. They added an earthen dam near the springs, creating a reservoir {{at one end of}} the bayou.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1990s the Board of Supervisors updated the Buchanan Field Airport Master Plan. Commercial {{development}} of <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> such as Sam's Club, Taco Bell, Sports Authority, and Jiffy Lube was allowed in 1992. The future direction of this airport {{is always in}} question because of its location on prime property {{in the middle of}} the city of Concord with no room to grow, and noise concerns. The County has developed a new airport in Byron in the eastern part of the county.|$|E

Both institutions are located on the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River. DeLaSalle High School located on Nicollet Island in Minneapolis was opened in October 1900 through a gift of $25,000 from Ireland. Fourteen years later Ireland purchased an <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> for the expanding Christian Brothers school.|$|E
25|$|Pombo is {{especially}} {{known for his}} defense of private property rights. This was spurred by the Southern Pacific Railroad's abandonment of the Altamont Pass route through Tracy. Pombo owned land adjacent to the abandoned railroad line. Pombo argued that the abandoned easement should legally revert to the <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> owners (such as himself) {{rather than to the}} local park district. He argued that as the easement was granted based on a promise that the land would be used for railroad purposes only, that the easements ended entirely when they were abandoned. Pombo's case resulted in Congress passing the Rails to Trails Act.|$|E

It holds 150 buses at capacity, but is assigned around 200 buses, {{many of which are}} parked on the surrounding streets. Due to its age and capacity issues and to accommodate articulated buses, the MTA plans to demolish the existing structure and build a new and expanded depot on the same site, as well as on 50,000 square feet of <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> purchased in April 2014. Construction is anticipated to begin in 2018 and be complete by 2022, with all of its buses, and local routes temporarily sent to other depots.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, {{the owners}} {{announced}} that they would replace more than 1,000 windows above the first level. In late April the city announced a land swap deal with the Bridge Company to transfer a 3-acre strip of Riverside Park near the Ambassador Bridge for 4.8 acres of <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> owned by the Bridge Company. As part of that agreement, the city would receive up to $5 million for park improvements, and the Bridge Company agreed to replace {{the windows in the}} train station. In July the Detroit City Council approved the land transfer. As of December 2015, all of the new windows have been installed. Despite this work, the future of the building is undetermined.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1898, the Ministry of Public Works {{ratified}} the concession attributed to Santos, Sobral & Co., providing {{the company with}} all the rights to explore the spring in perpetuity. On 24 September, the prices were set at the spa, and the following year (14 September 1899), the company began to explore new springs, owing to the movement of visitors to the site, and consumption of the mineral waters. This influx caused a conflict between {{the company and the}} Viscountess of Peso, the <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> owner, and with whom the Santos, Sobral & Co. wished to expand their explorations. The Viscountess refused to be a partner nor to allow exploration on her property.|$|E

25|$|The rectangular-shaped site, as {{encompassed}} by {{the heritage}} boundary and corresponding almost exactly with the 1896 {{extent of the}} lighthouse reserve, covers an area of 868 square metres and is orientated north–south. It {{is divided into two}} lots – the present day (2009) Lighthouse Reserve at the southern end (1/RP135230) and Lions Park at the northern end (2/RP135230). The western boundary is defined by Canberra Terrace, which leads down into the main commercial spine of Caloundra, Bulcock Street. The northern boundary is made by Arthur Street, a long straight road descending steeply from the intersection with Canberra Terrace at the north-western corner of the park. Single residences occupy the allotments to the east of the site, while a number of medium-rise residential unit blocks have been built from the <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> to the south down Canberra Terrace.|$|E
25|$|Every {{municipality}} {{is required}} to maintain a publicly accessible zoning map indicating what parcels of property within the municipality {{may be used for}} what purpose. This map must be updated at least every five years. Every municipality is required by state law to have a zoning administrator who oversees the local government's regulatory scheme, and is generally the party responsible for bringing legal actions against zoning violators. Each municipality is also required to have a board of zoning appeals empowered to grant variances and settle boundary disputes. The standard for granting of variances is that the party requesting the variance faces an unnecessary hardship unique to that party, but that <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> will not suffer a substantial detriment, and the character of the district will not be changed. The board may also grant special use permits allowing a property owner to use a property for a purpose that is neither specifically permitted nor specifically prohibited within a particular zoning area, and such permits may be conditioned on the property owner making concessions such as improving roads leading into the property, providing street lighting in the area, or setting aside a certain amount of land for public use. The board of zoning appeals may be appealed to the local Circuit Court if such an appeal is filed within 30 days of the zoning board decision, and from there decisions may be appealed directly to the Virginia Supreme Court.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, a {{proposal}} {{was brought to}} the South Kingstown Planning Board to convert the Miller property, along with other <b>adjacent</b> <b>properties,</b> to a 48-unit multi-household development. The redevelopment proposal was denied in October 2014.|$|R

50|$|Additional {{questions}} were raised when {{comparisons of the}} property tax evaluation of the Breyer estate with similar <b>adjacent</b> <b>properties</b> showed that Breyer enjoys a valuation {{less than half that}} of his neighbors (according to Plainfield Town Clerk's office).|$|R
500|$|PA 152 was {{originally}} built as Limekiln Road in 1693. This road {{was used to}} transport lime from kilns in Upper Dublin Township. The road was maintained by <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> owners. In 1850, the Limekiln Turnpike Company was created to improve the roadway through the collection of tolls, boasting tollhouses {{at each end of}} the village of Dreshertown (now Dresher). The toll collection and tollhouses along the Limekiln Pike were abolished and removed in 1917. When Pennsylvania designated legislative routes in 1911, what is now PA 152 did not get a route number.|$|E
500|$|The {{attention}} of the FDA triggered belligerent responses from Reich, who called them [...] "HiGS" [...] (hoodlums in government) and the tools of red fascists. He developed a delusion that he had powerful friends in government, including President Eisenhower, who he believed would protect him, and that the U.S. Air Force was flying over Orgonon {{to make sure that}} he was all right. On 29 July 1952 three inspectors arrived at Orgonon unannounced. Sharaf writes that Reich detested unannounced visitors; he had once chased some people away with a gun just for looking at an <b>adjacent</b> <b>property.</b> He told the inspectors they had to read his work before he would interact with them, and ordered them to leave.|$|E
500|$|This {{does not}} {{confirm that the}} tree owns itself, but suggests, rather, that it is {{considered}} to be within the right-of-way along Finley Street. Athens-Clarke County confirms that the tree is in the right-of-way, and is thus “accepted for care” by municipal authorities; according to city-county officials, local government and the owners of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>property</b> jointly serve as “stewards” for the care of the tree, while Athens' Junior Ladies' Garden Club serves as its “primary advocate.” Regarding Jackson’s deed, one writer noted {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, “However defective this title may be in law, the public recognized it.” In that spirit, it is the stated position of the Athens-Clarke County unified government that the tree, in spite of the law, does indeed own itself.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{the early}} 2000s, {{there has been}} a {{continued}} buildup of traffic along Doña Soledad Avenue.This {{can be attributed to the}} increasing number of homeowners and tenants within Better Living Subdivision and <b>adjacent</b> <b>properties</b> that use the avenue.|$|R
