5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E
500|$|At the SAIC, students' {{characterizations}} {{of the painting}} ranged from political caricature, to [...] "whimsy", to a commercial success. One student noted that Nelson was [...] "known nationally now, which is every artist's dream". Another student noted that [...] "(a)rtists have {{to be responsible for}} what they make, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> is not being responsible". In a meeting with 100students after the incident, Anthony Jones, then-president of the SAIC, assured the students that he stood behind their First Amendment rights. Regarding the painting, Jones said that the painting was in poor taste and should not have been displayed.|$|E
500|$|At the 1972 U.S. Olympic {{trials in}} Eugene, Oregon, Jenner was in fifth {{place in the}} men's decathlon, behind Steve Gough and Andrew Pettes. Needing {{to make up a}} 19-second gap on Gough in the men's 1500 metres, Jenner {{qualified}} for the Olympic team by running a fast final lap, finishing 22 seconds ahead of the other runners. ( [...] @25:58) This prompted the Eugene Register-Guard to ask: [...] "Who's Jenner?" [...] Following the Olympic Trials, Jenner finished in tenth place in the decathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. [...] By watching Soviet Mykola Avilov win the event, [...] Jenner was inspired to start an intense training regimen. [...] "For the first time, I knew what I wanted out of life and that was it, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> has it. I literally started training that night at midnight, running through the streets of Munich, Germany, training for the Games. I trained that day on through the 1976 Games, 68 hours a day, every day, 365 days a year." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV about the video, Ritter said [...] "The video basically pits one neighbour against another terrible neighbour, who lives on a completely opposite schedule. He's not on the grid - he's not on, like the song says, 'a 9-to-5 pace.' <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy's</b> living the cookie-cutter life, with his white picket fence, and his wife who brings him lemonade when he's washing the car, So it's {{kind of like the}} clash of those worlds; only at the end, there's kind of a twist, where the two worlds kind of flip-flop." ...|$|R

500|$|Variety Brian Lowry {{deemed the}} adult cast of early Glee [...] "over-the-top buffoons", however opined that Emma offered [...] "modest redemption". The Los Angeles Times Denise Martin called Mays as Emma [...] "just as funny" [...] as Lynch's Sue, and noted: [...] "Emma doesn't get the zingers Coach Sue gets, but she {{makes me laugh}} just as hard." [...] Harris commented that, [...] "Despite the sad {{seriousness}} of , the tightly wound Emma also {{is one of the}} funniest characters in Glee. Go figure. It's funny, because everything is kind of heavy that's going on in her life, with these phobias <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> she loves who’s married, yet she still is a bit of the comic relief." [...] Mandi Bierly for Entertainment Weekly noted of the episode [...] "Vitamin D" [...] that she had hoped Emma would decline Ken's proposal: [...] "I want Emma to be strong and know it’s better to be without someone for the right reason than to be with someone for the wrong one." [...] Mike Hale for the New York Times praised Mays' performance in the episode. He noted: [...] "Jayma Mays registered Emma’s devastation with just the slightest widening of those enormous eyes. In fact all the best non-singing moments in the episode were hers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aguilera's fifth studio album, Back to Basics, which {{consists}} of two discs, was released in August 2006. The second disc, described by Aguilera herself as [...] "a '20s, '30s vibe," [...] was solely produced by her longtime collaborater–producer Linda Perry. During the recording session, Aguilera wanted to record a song about the pain of losing a loved one and asked Perry for help. Perry developed the idea while thinking about her father, who had died {{less than a year}} ago. She revealed, [...] "And she [...] came to me, and had these two chords that her <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> wrote, and she was like 'I really like these chords, can you turn this into a song? I want the song to be about losing someone'. And inside of me, I'm going 'You little fucking bitch, you totally know I lost my dad, and now you're gonna milk my emotions.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After the {{shooting}} of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, Today ran a selectively edited version of the 9-1-1 call that George Zimmerman made prior to shooting and killing Martin (which he defended as being committed in self defense while standing trial for {{the shooting}}, {{for which he was}} acquitted on charges of murder in July 2013), which had the effect of making Zimmerman appear racist. In a March 2012 edition of the program, Today played a recording of Zimmerman saying, [...] "This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black." [...] However, several seconds of the call were cut from the 911 tape, removing Zimmerman's description of Martin, and a question asked to him about the teenager by the 911 operator. In the original, unedited tape, Zimmerman said, [...] "This guy looks like he's up to no good. Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking around, looking about." [...] The operator then asked, [...] "OK, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> – is he black, white or Hispanic?," [...] to which Zimmerman answered, [...] "He looks black." ...|$|E

50|$|Tom asks Louisa {{whether she}} wants to get married - seems like the logical choice - to ask someone he already knew. She quickly shows signs of {{interest}} but keeps calm - is gradually being more comforted by the idea of marriage. She could finally interact with Grace in ways she could have not, such as hugging her etc., more affectionate forms of love. Another death - the chief manager (something like that of the Niagara plant) - Louisa has her suspicions that the two deaths - Karl's <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>guys</b> (Fitzhugh) were no accident, but instead a series of murders. She wants to find out the syndicates.|$|R
5000|$|There's {{a moment}} on the Brooklyn Bridge, and there was a guy filming {{something}} {{on the side of the}} bridge, and Hud sees him filming and he turns over and he sees the ship that's been capsized and sees the headless Statue of Liberty, and then he turns back <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy's</b> briefly filming him. In my mind that was two movies intersecting for a brief moment, and I thought there was something interesting in the idea that <b>this</b> incident happened <b>and</b> there are so many different points of view, and there are several different movies at least happening that evening and we just saw one piece of another.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2012, Today aired a story {{package that}} {{included}} an edited {{version of a}} 9-1-1 call made by George Zimmerman minutes prior to his confrontation with Trayvon Martin {{that resulted in the}} unarmed Florida teenager being shot and killed, which (as described in a Washington Post article criticizing the editing of the tape) had the effect of [...] "readily paint Zimmerman as a racial profiler". In the edited recording, Zimmerman (who claimed he shot Martin in self defense; a grand jury later acquitted him on murder charges while on trial in August 2013) is heard saying, [...] "This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black." [...] A portion of the tape in which Zimmerman was describing Martin to the 911 operator was removed in its broadcast version; in the unedited version, Zimmerman said, [...] "This guy looks like he's up to no good. Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking around, looking about."

2500|$|In {{the first}} {{minute of the}} second round Castillo went down on a shot by Mayweather, which was ruled a slip by the referee. Later in the fight Harold Lederman alluded to it, saying [...] "By the way, that {{knockdown}} {{in the second round}} [...] extremely questionable, I thought Floyd did throw a left hook <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> [...] went {{down at the end of}} the hook but what you going to do, it's a judgement call by the referee, so it doesn't go as a 10–8 round..." [...] Drakulich took a point from Castillo for hitting on the break in the eighth round after several warnings throughout the fight. With Castillo repeatedly hitting on the break, this led to a large number of his punches landing. George Foreman agreed with the decision ("That's what you want a referee to do"), although his counterpart Larry Merchant had an alternative view: [...] "I think this referee has been altogether too involved in the fight. Too officious". Drakulich struck again in the ninth round, this time taking a point away from Mayweather for using his elbows. Mayweather won the fight by using his jab effectively and staying away from Castillo for much of the fight. Having injured his left shoulder on the last day of training, he changed to a southpaw stance on several occasions to throw more right-handed punches.|$|E
2500|$|Three members (Garred, Pritchard and Harris) of The Kooks all met as {{students}} at the BRIT School in Croydon, all three moving further south to join BIMM (where they met Rafferty who was from Brighton) in 2002. The inspiration to form a band came to Pritchard as he and Garred were out shopping for clothes one day in Primark as a joke. Speaking to MTV Garred said, [...] "we had a vision on how we wanted the band to look and stuff—so we bought some clothes and these hats, it was fun." [...] Sharing a love of The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Police, and David Bowie, Pritchard got Harris and Rafferty involved {{under the guise of}} a school music project. Pritchard himself said [...] "We got together just on a whim, really." [...] With a strong demo of their material Garred and Pritchard went in search of a gig, and according to Garred, they were able to book their first show simply because the landlord liked their hats. [...] "So we went in to get a gig, we don't have a demo blid burnt, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> told us, 'Well, you can't get a gig if you don't have a demo, but I like your hats, so I'm {{going to give you a}} gig'", said Garred. However, the band was unable to make the performance as they were finishing off their demo at the time.|$|E
