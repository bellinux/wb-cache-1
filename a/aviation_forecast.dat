The report was prepared by the Quality Assessment Group of the Aviation Weather Research Program’s <b>Aviation</b> <b>Forecast</b> and Quality Assessment Product Development Team. The purpose of the report is to summarize the quality of IIDA diagnoses, in anticipation of IIDA’s transition through the D 4 /D 5 decision point of the Aviation Weather Technology Transfer process. The report includes (a) a brief summary of previous evaluations of IIDA and other in-flight icing forecasts and algorithms; (b) results from an intensive evaluation of IIDA diagnoses from winter 2000; and (c) results from ongoing operational verification of IIDA and other icing forecasts by the Forecast System’s Laboratory’s Real-time Verification System (RTVS). In all cases the IIDA diagnoses are evaluated using Yes and No pilot reports (PIREPs) of icing conditions.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. During {{the period of}} 12 through 14 March 1993 a major snow storm, later described as a White Hurricane, formed over the Gulf of Mexico, moved east-northeast across the Florida panhandle, and then headed northeast along the eastern seaboard. The extreme weather produced by this storm was responsible for 243 deaths and $ 1 billion in property damage. Because the storm was accompanied by unusually strong jet streaks, a diagnostic of the storm kinetic energy contents and generation of kinetic energy was undertaken. The vertically integrated kinetic energy (IKE) and vertically integrated generation of kinetic energy (IGK) are shown to be effective tools in determining how jet streaks influenced {{the development of this}} storm. Specifically, IKE can indicate geographically where jet streak maxima are located, whereas IGK can provide a measure of the effect of transverse circulations aloft. In addition, IGK combined with IKE can indicate if the jet streak is weakening or strengthening. The data used in this case study were primarily the National Weather Service's Global Spectral Model <b>aviation</b> <b>forecast</b> and analysis.

40|$|Abstract—Current {{research}} {{based on}} various approaches {{including the use}} of numerical prediction models, statistical models and machine learning models have provided some encouraging results in the area of long-term weather forecasting. But at the level of meso-scale and even micro-scale severe weather phenomena (involving very short-term chaotic perturbations) such as turbulence and wind shear phenomena, these approaches have not been so successful. This paper focuses on the use of chaotic oscillatory-based neural networks for the study of a meso-scale weather phenomenon, namely, wind shear, a challenging and complex meteorological phenomena which has a vital impact on aviation safety. Using LIDAR data collected at the Hong Kong International Airport via the Hong Kong Observatory, we are able to forecast the Doppler velocities with reasonable accuracy and validate our prediction model.

40|$|The {{threat of}} {{lightning}} {{is a daily}} concern during the warm season in Florida. Research has revealed distinct spatial and temporal distributions of lightning occurrence that are strongly influenced by large-scale atmospheric flow regimes. Previously, the Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) calculated the gridded lightning climatologies based on seven flow regimes over Florida for 1 -, 3 - and 6 -hr intervals in 5 -, 10 -, 20 -, and 30 -NM diameter range rings around the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) and eight other airfields in the National Weather Service in Melbourne (NWS MLB) county warning area (CWA). In this update to the work, the AMU recalculated the lightning climatologies for using individual lightning strike data to improve {{the accuracy of the}} climatologies. The AMU included all data regardless of flow regime as one of the stratifications, added monthly stratifications, added three years of data to the period of record and used modified flow regimes based work from the AMU's Objective Lightning Probability Forecast Tool, Phase II.
