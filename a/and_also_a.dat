5|$|A {{somewhat}} controversial recent {{addition to}} Caversham was the opening, in October 2013, of Whakamana Cannabis Museum, New Zealand's first museum {{dedicated to the}} history of cannabis use. Cannabis, while still a criminalised drug in New Zealand, has moved some way towards grudging acceptance, at least as a subject for open discussion. The museum, run from a former residential house in David Street, is designed to be an information centre on aspects of the history and legislation surrounding the drug, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> national centre for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party, a minor single-issue political party.|$|E

5|$|As the Chief Executive of the State of Maryland, the Governor {{heads the}} {{executive}} branch of government, which includes all state executive departments and agencies, as well as advisory boards, commissions, committees, and task forces. The main constitutional responsibility of the Governor of Maryland, and any other State's chief executive, is to carry out the business of the state and to enforce the laws passed by the Legislature. The Governor also has some say in these laws, since the Governor has the ability to veto any bill sent to his or her desk by the Maryland General Assembly, though the Assembly may override that veto. The Governor is also given a number of more specific powers as relates to appropriations of state funds, the appointment of state officials, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> variety of less prominent and less commonly utilized powers.|$|E

Theophilos was an ambitious man <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> convinced adherent of Byzantine Iconoclasm, which prohibited the depiction of divine figures and the veneration of icons.

5|$|Falling attendances {{due to the}} {{commercial}} nature of the district, <b>and</b> <b>also</b> <b>a</b> sense {{that there was some}} redundancy of provision given the nearby St Matthew's Church, caused the Manchester diocese to review the status of St John's and its parish in the 1920s. Following an internal review and a public consultation, in 1927 it was formally proposed that the two parishes should be merged as St Matthew's parish. The diocese preferred to retain St Matthew's and demolish St John's, at least in part because the former was a more recent construction. This was a reversal of a proposal made in 1919, when the predominantly transient Roman Catholic population of the St Matthew's parish was given as a reason to merge it into St John's.|$|E
