500|$|NASCAR {{officials}} reviewed video {{evidence of}} Smith's pass of Stewart {{on the final}} lap with Smith and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. president Max Siegel in attendance, and declared the manoeuvre illegal; Smith was issued a pass-through penalty which dropped him from second to 18th. Smith argued that he was forced down below the yellow line: [...] "I was always told that the rule is if you get forced down there, then you are {{the winner of the}} race, and on the last lap, anything goes. That’s what I was going with. I had a nose inside of him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> piled up the whole field." [...] Ninth-place finisher Johnson said there were rumors that drivers were allowed to go below the yellow line on the last lap of the previous day's Craftsman Truck Series race which were circulated {{on the day of the}} AMP Energy 500: [...] "I didn’t know what to really think about it, or understood it, or had seen it. It’s ironic how it played out today.” ...|$|E
500|$|Cecotto's driving {{which caused}} the multi-car pileup in the feature race {{received}} much attention. It was third such {{incident in the}} season when Cecotto courted controversy and criticism from drivers: he was disqualified from qualifying for the Sepang round when he forced Bird off the track but avoided being issued with a penalty in the Catalunya sprint race when he swerved into Canamasas during a battle for fifth position. Leimer claimed that Cecotto solely concentrated on him rather than making the corner, [...] "It's really, really disappointing as a lot was possible today <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> scored a lot of points. But once more due to another driver I lost out, while my competitors {{in the battle for}} the championship are scoring." [...] Palmer was more vocal in his criticism in Cecotto, remarking he would rather start from the pit lane than within two rows of Cecotto. Peter Allen of Formula Scout argued that while Cecotto's manoeuvre was not clearly malicious in intent, the Venezuelan deserved the race ban and that it would help him realise that he needed to control his aggressiveness.|$|E
2500|$|I couldn't {{understand}} the words. I {{wanted to hear}} the words. It was a great song, [...] "Maggie's Farm," [...] and the sound was distorted. I ran over to {{the guy at the}} controls and shouted, [...] "Fix the sound so you can hear the words." [...] He hollered back, [...] "This is the way they want it." [...] I said [...] "Damn it, if I had an axe, I'd cut the cable right now." [...] But I was at fault. I was the MC, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> said to the part of the crowd that booed Bob, [...] "you didn't boo Howlin' Wolf yesterday. He was electric!" [...] Though I still prefer to hear Dylan acoustic, some of his electric songs are absolutely great. Electric music is the vernacular of {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, to use my father's old term.|$|E

60|$|I had {{a glimpse}} of Jeeves as {{we went into the}} flat, sitting in his lair, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wished <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> called to him to rally round. Something told me that I was about to need him.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is all I have to say, if you please, sir, {{about how}} I first met with little Mary; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> told it {{in a way}} that was more fit for such as you to hear." ...|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} about Armageddon Sebastian spoke {{of how much}} The Memphis Album still influences his music, [...] "I headed across to Memphis and was very inspired by the music scene there. I got to work with some people who were instrumental in shaping the careers of artists who heavily influence me. Artists like Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and Sam Cooke. Being entrenched {{in that sort of}} environment really caused me to go 'You know what dude. Do what you want to do. Do what comes natural to you'." [...] Sebastian said it was a turning point for him, adding, [...] "From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing." [...] Sebastian feels his soul roots remained even when he delved into electro dance music with the single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] from his previous album, explaining it was an old school Sam Cooke type of melody, with modern lyrics, over a dance track. He said, [...] "I had that melody, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> gone so many ways with it. I could have produced an old-school soul song, but I went towards what you hear on the radio." ...|$|E
60|$|GEOFFREY Yes. Why not you? You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a jolly little fight.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not long}} in coming, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> kissed the old soldier for {{speaking}} as he did.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{believe it}} firmly, sir; and, what is more, I believe I {{was on his}} track. I was only too anxious to find him; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> found him {{if they would have}} let me stay in New York." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{knew that}} I was forgiven. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> thrown myself at Mr. Carvel's feet for happiness.|$|E

5000|$|Broadis' {{description}} of events with Shankly: [...] "Bill always regarded {{himself as the}} man who saved me, really - the man who gave me to England. I would maybe be lapping round <b>and</b> <b>I</b> admit <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> put a lot more into it.|$|R

6000|$|She nodded affirmation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{struck her}} in the face for her folly. I drew aside, and as she moved slowly on she murmured: ...|$|E

60|$|This {{seemed to}} pose him entirely, and he {{remained}} gazing upon {{me with a}} convincing air of youth <b>and</b> innocence. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> laughed, but <b>I</b> was not so inhumane.|$|R
60|$|My heart sank, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> cursed my folly {{for leaving}} my cabin. However, since I was {{discovered}} {{there was nothing}} to do but to make the best of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will do {{whatsoever}} you say, so {{that you}} spare my life," [...] he whined, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> kicked him for failing to show {{the spirit of a}} decent lad.|$|E
60|$|He {{was sitting}} on the couch, white-faced, one sea-boot in his hands, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> sworn his hands were shaking. That much I saw, and the next moment was out on deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Hetty. [...] "Your {{men could}} never march like that. It was {{footsteps}} going west, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> originated their dragging beat. I have heard it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so," [...] she answered, innocently, [...] "for I {{should have}} married {{him before he}} went, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been certain that he would return here {{whenever}} I wished it." ...|$|R
