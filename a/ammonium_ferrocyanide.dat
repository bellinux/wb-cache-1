40|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> {{monohydrate}} {{has been}} studied by NMR at 270 MHz and 500 MHz. Two chemically shifted (separation = 3. 55 ppm) signals observed are attributed to the $NH_ 4 ^+$ and $H_ 2 O$ protons. From the temperature dependence of the line-widths and the chemical shifts, both $NH_ 4 ^+$ and $H_ 2 O$ are concluded {{to take part in}} diffusion...|$|E
40|$|The protonic {{conductivity}} of <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> hydrate {{has been}} studied by the complex admittance method. The admittance plots show departures from ideal Debye behaviour. The values of ionic conductivity (sigma = 3. 7 X 10 (- 5) (OMEGA-cm) - 1) and diffusion coefficient (D = 3. 8 X 10 (- 10) cm 2 /s) obtained at room temperature {{are consistent with the}} corresponding values estimated by an earlier NMR study...|$|E
40|$|The {{diffusion}} coefficient, D, and the ionic mobility, μ, in the protonic conductor <b>ammonium</b> <b>ferrocyanide</b> hydrate {{have been}} {{determined by the}} isothermal transient ionic current method. D is also determined from the time dependence of the build up of potential across the samples and theretical expressions describing this build up in terms of double exponential dependence on time are obtained. The values obtained are D = 3. 875 × 10 ^- 11 m^ 2 s^- 1 and μ = 1. 65 × 10 ^- 9 m^ 2 V^- 1 s^- 1...|$|E
40|$|A highly ordered {{two-dimensional}} hybrid magnetic nanocomposite {{has been}} prepared by synthesizing and intercalating a new cationic aluminum-hydroxy ferric ferrocyanide compound into a cation-adsorbing nanoclay (montmorillonite). Chemical and structural properties were investigated by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray photoemission, and Mössbauer spectroscopies. Elemental analysis {{was based on}} proton-induced gamma ray emission and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy data, N/C elemental ratios, and cation-exchange capacity measurements. Magnetic properties were studied by SQUID magnetometry. The results suggest: (i) that the cationic Prussian blue analog comprises Al-hydroxy cations embedded into a monolayer thick two-dimensional ferric ferrocyanide array; and (ii) that the clay-Prussian blue nanohybrid consists of such arrays stacked between the clay layers. The latter material orders ferromagnetically at ~ 5 K showing a hundred times higher remanence {{than that of the}} starting material, soluble Prussian blue (<b>ammonium</b> ferric <b>ferrocyanide).</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Calcium cyanide is used almost {{exclusively}} in the mining industry. It serves as an inexpensive source of cyanide in many leaching or vat operation to obtain precious metals such as gold and silver from their ores. It does this by forming coordination complexes with the metals separating them from the ores.It is distributed in either solid flake form or in liquid form. Calcium cyanide's high toxicity to touch, inhale, or ingest makes it useful as a rodenticide. For example, {{it has been used}} in the management of the population of Indian crested porcupines (Hystrix indica). Its toxicity has been similarly exploited as an insecticide. However its high toxicity makes it unfavorable in many cases and oftentimes other less damaging chemicals are used instead. It is also used in the making of hydrogen cyanide, <b>ammonium</b> cyanide, and <b>ferrocyanides.</b>|$|R
