40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse how <b>advertising</b> <b>experts</b> assess the changes in {{branding}} in the current economic recession. In using the assessment of the <b>advertising</b> <b>experts,</b> it was important that they could analyse the general tendency of the market, without concentrating on any certain segment. There have yet to be any similar research done in Estonia and also there have not been any comprehensive studies available in studies abroad that emanate from the opinions of people who work in advertising agencies. Half of the volume of this thesis is dedicated to the theory, which compares the economical crises of Asia and Finland in the 1990 ’es to the current situation in Estonia. An overview is given about economical crises and branding. Also the general analysis of branding in the current crisis that started in 2008. The empirical part of the study consists of the conclusions of half-structured expert interviews conducted with nine <b>advertising</b> <b>experts.</b> The questions in the study were designed to analyse the current economic situation as well as to give the experts an opportunity to speculate about the future and to give organisations suggestions how to improve marketing communication during the recession. The most evident proved to be the <b>advertising</b> <b>expert’s</b> abilities to define changes in their work. Seven out of nine people pointed out that change in their daily work was evident because of the recession. Two of the most mentioned answers during the study were that people tend to focus on reduced prices in advertisements and also that customers of the advertising agencies are more price sensitive regarding projects. During the analysis of the study, it became clear that major advertising companies will continue with their current brand communication or increase its proportion. Regarding smaller companies, their situation will deteriorate and they may lose their current position in the market or in worst case scenario, disappear from the market all together. At the same time it was concluded that all parties in the advertising market are feeling insecure at the moment. The most popular suggestions, made by the experts, how to promote brands and better marketing communication during the recession, were to analyse the brand and continue communication even in the event that the situation of the company worsens. The main justification for these was that in doing so, consumers will not forget the company and that people wouldn’t gravitate away from the basic values of the brand. Regarding the changes in channels of marketing communication, an increase in the percentage of internet, television and public relation and a reduction of printed media was noted. It was based upon the theories of foreign countries, general noticeable tendencies in the market and also the relative cost of the fore mentioned channels. It was also found that it was not possible to analyse how much the changes in advertisement have happened as a result of the recession. The most important resources for an organization are most commonly considered money, motivation of leaders and the values of the organization. The most popular answer was in fact money, but it was always followed by a „but“. Money became vital only when it was combined with another resource, like skills or motivation of leaders. In terms, it can be concluded that regarding the success of organizations, it can only be achieved by the right combination of resources. The main general conclusions about this study would be that despite the uncertainty of the economic situation a calm and rational way of thinking should be preserved and each decision weighed thoroughly before any actions are made. Also a way to display unique qualities to consumers should be found and the core values of the brand should not be sacrificed by focusing on solely price promotions...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{artificial}} intelligence research has provided new tools and techniques for marketing model builders. These tools, {{when combined with}} problem-solving knowledge from a specific domain, {{can be used to}} create expert systems. This methodology is most applicable in semistructured problem domains where the key relationships are logical rather than numerical and problem-solving knowledge is incomplete. One such problem in marketing is advertising design. In this paper, we describe the application of expert system techniques to the development of ADCAD, a system designed to assist advertisers of consumer products with the formulation of advertising objectives, copy strategy, and the selection of communication approaches. The paper highlights the assembly of ADCAD's knowledge base of ad design heuristics from multiple sources of published research and practitioner expertise and describes its structure and content. We discuss the procedures and obstacles associated with building, implementing, and validating such an expert system. Our experiences with ADCAD suggest that knowledge-based systems have significant potential for the consolidation and integration of marketing knowledge as interactive input for decision makers.

40|$|This study {{explains}} {{the economics of}} billboard advertising, specifically pertaining to {{the internal and external}} elements that make them effective for both consumers and the brand.

After analyzing secondary articles and studies, primary research was conducted by interviewing a sample of consumers and experts to determine which internal and external elements they felt were most critical for a billboard to be considered “effective. ” The results from both samples proved that there are a few internal and external elements that seem to have priority over others. However, the sample size of consumers and experts would have needed to be much larger in order to determine a direct correlation between the internal and external elements.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} how advertising pioneers {{endeavored to}} professionalize the advertising trade in Norway {{in the years}} 1914 - 1918. Professionalization is usually understood as a process whereby an occupation goes through a transformation to become a profession. I argue that the reform work of Norwegian advertising pioneers is a special case of professionalization. By interpreting the thoughts and intentions of these pioneers through the professional journal Romilla Revue I explain this professionalization as a dual process. Robert Millar {{was the leader of}} these pioneers as they strived to develop a group of advertising consultants who would enjoy a status in society that was similar to that of traditional professions such as doctors, dentists, lawyers, priests and architects. The advertising consultant was the product of the ideas of Millar, based on models of <b>advertising</b> <b>experts</b> in countries such as the U. S and Great Britain where the advertising trade was more advanced than in Norway. As such the advertising consultant was very much an imagined profession. There was no existing or coherent occupational group that claimed jurisdiction over this area of work. An occupational group of consultants had to created before it could claim professional status. Further, Millar and other pioneers worked to professionalize the advertising trade as a whole. This entailed a cooperation between the different parts of the advertising trade, such as <b>advertising</b> <b>experts,</b> advertisement agencies, newspapers, printers, writers, draftsmen and various businesses, to create a more effective and coherent advertising trade. The analytical chapters are divided according to what I have seen as different phases of professionalization. This includes the establishment of a professional journal, advertising clubs and associations, developing advertising education and the establishment of a control or licensing office, among other developments. 1914 marks the beginning of the process as both the first advertising journal and advertising club was established in Trondheim in this year. The reform work of the Norwegian pioneers was influenced by developments abroad, especially in the U. S. The period until 1918 was highly active in terms of organizing and exchange of ideas between advertising pioneers, of how reform could be implemented. From the end of 1918 followed a period of low activity due to consequences brought by the ending of the First World War among other factors. The War had significant implications for how the advertising trade developed, because of its impact on the Norwegian economy leading to a boom period {{and at the same time}} a period of high cost of living. I analyze how the two concepts of professionalization were connected and how the professionalization of the advertising trade as a whole was a premise for the professionalization of advertising consultants...|$|R

40|$|Consumers can {{accumulate}} {{product information}} {{on the basis of}} a combination of searching, product <b>advertising</b> and <b>expert</b> advice. Examples of experts who provide product information include doctors advising patients on treatments, motor mechanics diagnosing car problems and recommending repairs, accountants recommending investment strategies, and plumbers making recommendations on alternative water heaters. In each of these examples, the transactions involve the sale of goods and services where the seller is at the same time an expert providing advice on the amount and type of product or service to be purchased. In the case of water heaters, the plumber advising a consumer on their choice of water heater will most likely also install the appliance. Because of the information asymmetry there is potentially a strategic element in the transmission of information from expert to consumer. This paper reports on an econometric investigation of the factors that determine the choices made by consumers and the recommendations made by plumbers and the extent to which plumbers act in the best interests of their customers. The empirical work is made possible by the availability of stated preference data generated by designed experiments involving separate samples of Australian consumers and plumbers. We find some evidence that plumbers have higher preferences than consumers for heater characteristics that increase their profit margin. ...|$|R

The underlying theory behind the study is an adapted version of Y旬 2 ̆ 7 s framework for global strategy (1 989, 1992) which provides a multi-dimensional view of the globalisation process. A follow-up working paper in this series provides an in-depth assessment if tge strategic response of advertising agencies to these globalisation drivers. This initial paper presents the theoretical background and methodology of the overall study. A thorough discussion of the development of the literature on globalisation and global strategy is presented. Y旬 2 ̆ 7 s framework is detailed and critiqued.

Vector autoregressive modeling of the metrics for more than 60 brands of four consumer goods shows that advertising awareness, brand consideration, and brand liking account for almost one-third of explained sales variance.

Our dreams and aspirations, opinions and beliefs, desires and fears, all are being controlled by mass media, <b>advertising</b> agencies, entertainment <b>experts,</b> politicians, faux intellectuals etc. Everything happens {{in order to maintain the}} system that is in favor of the one percent of the richest and most powerful people in the world. The system is held together not only by repressive forces, but mostly by ideological machineries of the state, especially by the corporate mass media, which indoctrinate people and dumb down the general quality of public discourse. As a result of this, people voluntarily suffer their own impoverishment and slave away for others who get richer and richer off of their work. The book consists of two large chapters: the author presents and analyses neo-Marxist concepts (critical concept of the Frankfurt School, Althusser's and Poulantzas's structuralism, cultural studies of S. Hall), analyses the critical insights of Noam Chomsky with an emphasis on topics like media manipulation and systematic political indoctrination, which affect the official public discourse (except for the cultural patterns of conduct of marginalized groups). Building upon the works of Frederic Jameson and James Scott, Blaha contemplates whether we have a chance to escape from the matrix of capitalism. He proposes the value of truth as an ideal of social emancipation as an opposition to total media manipulation. This can become a driving force for new social revolutions.|$|R

The purpose of these interviews was to explain the background of these cases and answer the following research questions: how do the parties of the regulation system regard the problem of mixing advertising and journalistic material so that it doesn’t distinguish each other?, where are the cases hereby analyzed placed judicially inside the regulation system?, is each party satisfied with the conditions of conflation between advertising and journalistic discourses?, is it, according to the existing normatives, possible to successfully supervise hidden advertisements? As consumers also form an important party of the problem herby analyzed, additional 25 short interviews were conducted among them to find out how they see the six cases, whether the separation of advertising and journalistic material is considered to be relevant and whether they trust the channels that conflate them. The research shows that hidden advertisement is a considered to be a problematic field in Estonian advertising regulation. Firstly, as resulted from the interviews, representatives of all interviewed parties regard it important to keep journalistic and advertising materials separated. Still, in practice the separation does not work due to the financial pressure of advertisers and the needs of commercial channels to meet their financial needs and this weighs over the ethical side of such action. Secondly, the conflated cases analyzed have all very different backgrounds and are, therefore, subject to different normatives from being an ethical question to breaking the law. All options can be considered but are disputable as the definition of hidden advertisement is very imprecise and arguments for justifying its legality are easy to find and, therefore, advertisers are almost free in their experimentations. Previous discussion leads to the situation which at first glance is beneficial to all influenced parties. Still, as resulted from the research the parties are not satisfied in with their roles in the system. Journalists and editors sense ethical conflicts although they are used to the inevitability of serving primarily the needs of advertisers. Producers take advantage of the situation, although in the creative point of view they dislike mixing the markets. Supervising organizations feel the normatives not being precise enough for successfully monitor the process {{in order to keep the}} situation under control, which hereby gives an answer to the last research question...|$|R
