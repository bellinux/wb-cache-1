50|$|As {{the front}} of the car slows down the air without a diffuser, this is the ideal place for an inlet. A {{splitter}} is commonly used here, serving to increase the amount of downforce at {{the front of}} the car. The airstream is brought to stagnation above the splitter by an air dam, causing an area of high pressure. Below the splitter, the air is redirected away from the stagnation zone and is accelerated, causing the pressure to drop. This, combined with the high pressure over the splitter, creates downforce. The larger the area of the splitter, the more downforce is generated. In most closed-wheel race cars, the underside of the splitter smoothly integrates with the undertray, creating one large flat plane that is driven by the rear diffuser. Some race cars, such as the Toyota GT-One, actually use an additional diffuser immediately behind the splitter to help create more downforce. The <b>air</b> <b>extracted</b> by this diffuser is exhausted through vents in the sidepods or above the car around the cockpit.|$|E

The major components of these landfill extracts were polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), with significant amounts of polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and small amounts of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs). The 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxic equivalency factor approach has been proposed to estimate the toxic potency of complex mixtures of chlorinated aromatics for environmental risk assessment. However, most components of environmental residues are nonplanar and do not act as aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor agonists, {{so there is a}} great risk of not identifying adverse responses that are not dioxinlike. We used a 2 -day prepubertal female rat bioassay to examine multiple biological responses, including both dioxinlike and nondioxinlike effects from these landfill extracts. As expected, both types of effects were detected. The soil and dust extracts produced similar dose-response relationships for 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase, 7 -pentoxyresorufin O-depentylase, 7 -benzyloxyresorufin O-debenzylase, and 4 -nitrophenol UDP-glucuronyltransferase induction; the dose response for the <b>air</b> <b>extract</b> deviated from the other two extracts.

However, the <b>air</b> <b>extracted</b> from the ice gives not only information about the atmospheric composition.

The difference between the age of the ice and the mean age of the gas at close-off depth has been calculated using a dynamic model for firn densification and diffusional mixing of the air in the firn including the heat transport in the firn and temperature dependence of the close-off density. The gravitational fractionation of 015 N which is constant in the atmosphere gives an independent measure of the close-off depth.
