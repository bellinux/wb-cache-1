5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} include other {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|Now {{facing a}} more rugged and {{hazardous}} trek, Young chose {{to follow the}} trail used by the Donner–Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. As the vanguard company traveled through the rugged mountains, they divided into three sections. Young and several {{other members of the}} party suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a “mountain fever” induced by wood ticks. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move farther <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> designated route.|$|E
5|$|Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force (RAF) met Eisenhower on {{the evening}} of 4 June. He and his {{meteorological}} team predicted that the weather would improve enough for the invasion to proceed on 6 June. The next available dates with the required tidal conditions (but without the desirable full moon) would be two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. Postponement of the invasion would have required recalling men and ships already in position to cross the Channel, and would have increased the chance that the invasion plans would be detected. After much discussion with the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 6th. A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} final stage of the Borneo Campaign was the capture of Balikpapan on the central east coast of the island. This {{operation}} had been opposed by General Blamey, who {{believed that it was}} unnecessary, but went <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orders of Macarthur. After a 20-day preliminary air and naval bombardment the 7th Division landed near the town on 1 July. Balikpapan and its surrounds were secured after some heavy fighting on 21 July but mopping up continued {{until the end of the}} war. The capture of Balikpapan was the last large-scale land operation conducted by the Western Allies during World WarII. Although the Borneo Campaign was criticised in Australia at the time, and in subsequent years, as pointless or a waste of the lives of soldiers, it did achieve a number of objectives, such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the Dutch East Indies, capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war, who were being held in deteriorating conditions.|$|E

A referendum on amending the constitution to allow {{the federal government to}} directly fund local councils, which was initially planned to be held on the same day as the federal election, could not go <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> date announced by Rudd. This is because Section 128 of the Constitution of Australia requires that a referendum be submitted to electors between two and six months after its passage through Parliament. As early voting started on 20 August it could not be submitted then.|$|E
25|$|Ralf Schumacher {{had made}} a much better start than Montoya and jumped ahead of his {{teammate}} off the grid and through the first corner.

Montoya pulled <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outside of Schumacher approaching the turn and so had the better line. When Schumacher turned into the corner from his inside position, he ran over the plastic curbing and his rear end slid around and contacted the side of Montoya's car as it went by. Schumacher subsequently made a pit stop for a new rear wing.|$|E
