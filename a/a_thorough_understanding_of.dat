Published {{at his own}} expense in 1532, it showed {{that he was a}} humanist in the tradition of Erasmus with <b>a</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> classical scholarship. His first theological work, the Psychopannychia, attempted to refute the doctrine of soul sleep as promulgated by the Anabaptists. Calvin probably wrote it during the period following Cop's speech, but it was not published until 1542 in Strasbourg.|$|E

25|$|Chinese input {{methods are}} methods that allow a {{computer}} user to input Chinese characters. Most, if not all, Chinese input methods fall {{into one of}} two categories: phonetic readings or root shapes. Methods under the phonetic category usually are easier to learn but are less efficient, thus resulting in slower typing speeds because they typically require users to choose from a list of phonetically similar characters for input; whereas methods under the root shape category allow very precise and speedy input but have a difficult learning curve because they often require <b>a</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> a character's strokes and composition.|$|E

25|$|The Revolution of 1946 was a novel {{development}} in Haiti's history, as the Garde assumed power as an institution, {{not as the}} instrument of a particular commander. The members of the junta, known as the Military Executive Committee (Comité Exécutif Militaire), were Garde commander Colonel Franck Lavaud, Major Antoine Levelt, and Major Paul E. Magloire, commander of the Presidential Guard. All three understood Haiti's traditional way of exercising power, but they lacked <b>a</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> what {{would be required to}} make the transition to an elected civilian government.

Judges are required to have good moral character, i.e. there must be no history of crime.

25|$|Martin {{finished}} {{his career with}} the Export-Import bank when he was called to the Treasury to be the assistant secretary for monetary affairs. Martin had been with the Treasury for about two years when its conflict with the Federal Reserve reached its climax. During the period immediately preceding the final negotiations with the Fed, Secretary of the Treasury John W. Snyder went into the hospital. Under these circumstances, Martin became the head negotiator for the Treasury. From the Treasury's perspective, Martin was a valuable representative. He had <b>a</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the Federal Reserve System and of financial markets; furthermore, he was viewed as an ally of Truman, who strongly opposed Fed independence. During negotiations, Martin reestablished communication between the Treasury and Fed, forbidden under Snyder.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{potential}} victim {{has come into}} contact with state authorities, identifying the child as a victim of trafficking takes time. The process often benefits from <b>a</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the child’s story. For a child who is in trouble with the law, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers and officers determine if the child is actually a victim of a crime herself, such as exploitation, abuse, or trafficking. For a child in an administrative process, such as an asylum procedure, hearing the child's full story helps caseworkers to detect cases of trafficking. Children may be hesitant to share their complete stories with authorities and appointed child welfare professionals. Some service providers have found that establishing trust and a stable relationship with the child encourages increased disclosure of experiences of exploitation and trafficking that might otherwise not be detected. The trust building process can include granting assistance and support services to ensure safety, well-being and development.|$|E

25|$|Little {{is known}} of Starkey's early education. Prior {{to the death of}} his father in 1637, Starkey most likely was tutored, perhaps by his parents or learned acquaintances of the family. After the death of the elder Stirk, Starkey was sent to New England around 1639 to {{continue}} his studies. In 1643 he matriculated at Harvard College, where he was exposed to a core curriculum in the classical languages and theology in addition to courses in logic, physics, mathematics, politics, and history. His studies soon focused on chemical philosophy and alchemist theory. Starkey earned his A.B. in 1646 and his A.M. by 1649, although the exact date is uncertain. During his years at Harvard, Starkey was introduced to alchemy through the physics curriculum, which included subjects on metallic transmutation and potable gold.

In 1864, he was apprenticed into the shipbuilding firm of J & W Dudgeon of Cubitt Town.

By the time he left in 1868 he was one of a few draughtsmen in the country with <b>a</b> <b>thorough</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the workings of both systems.
