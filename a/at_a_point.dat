5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{derivative}} can be extended to many other settings. The common thread is that the derivative of a function <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> serves as a linear approximation of the function at that point.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{designated}} by 1919 along a route that ran much farther {{west in the}} UP. Within its first decade, M-48 was extended to end <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> north of Newberry.

30|$|A {{small change}} in the {{location}} of the facilities may discontinuously shift the entire demand <b>at</b> <b>a</b> demand <b>point</b> from one facility to another. This is because a tenet of the proximity approach is that a facility attracts “all or nothing” of the buying power <b>at</b> <b>a</b> demand <b>point.</b> This property remains in deterministic utility models discussed in Sect. 2.2 where all consumers residing <b>at</b> <b>a</b> demand <b>point</b> patronize the facility which provides the maximum utility.|$|R

5|$|Another committee, led by Oddvar Halvorsen, was {{established}} in 1960 {{to look at the}} matter again. Also it recommended a tunnel and a central station. However, it felt that the tunnel should be longer and intersect with the Drammen Line <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> between Skarpsno and Skøyen, and build a second station at Frogner. The proposal was presented to the Parliament of Norway on 4 November 1961, along with several other matters related to rail transport investments. Construction of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station was passed unanimously.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> where the bulk density of the column {{is the same as}} the surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E
5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E

5|$|In August 1998, {{signs were}} {{installed}} along the Meadowbrook State Parkway dedicating {{the road in}} honor of State Senator Norman J. Levy, who died in February 1998 after brain surgery. Levy had served on the State Senate Transportation Committee since 1982 and sponsored the first seat belt law in the United States, and had also {{been part of the}} negotiations that helped work resume on the Meadowbrook–Northern State interchange. The new signs were unveiled in a ceremony in the median of the parkway just south of Merrick Road. Dignitaries at the honoring ceremony included then-Governor George Pataki, Senator Charles Fuschillo and Levy's widow, Joy Levy. Signs were erected {{at both ends of the}} Meadowbrook Parkway and <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> near the Babylon Turnpike interchange.|$|E

5|$|On September13, 1966, NY111 was realigned {{south of}} Hauppauge {{to follow a}} {{slightly}} more westerly alignment to the hamlet of Islip along Joshua's Path and Islip Avenue, two streets that ran parallel to the route's original path on Carleton Avenue and Wheeler Road. Ownership and maintenance of NY111's former routing was transferred to Suffolk County, which redesignated the road as CR17.

Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> just short of the crest.
