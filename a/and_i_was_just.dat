2500|$|Originally {{expected}} for a March 2006 release, the album had two title changes and three unofficial releases until its official release the following year.

Although manager Matthew Knowles initially insisted that the decision to push the release date from July 2006 was because more time would be needed to properly set up the project, Rowland later admitted that she had been unsatisfied with the album's direction, and thus, she asked to rework with a stable of new record producers on the project.
