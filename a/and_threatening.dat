5|$|A 1977 BBC {{television}} debate discussed {{arguments for}} and against Myra Hindley's release, with Lord Longford on the side who argued that Hindley should be released and Ann West (the mother of Lesley Ann Downey) on the side arguing against any suggestion of Hindley being released <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> to kill her if she ever got out of prison.|$|E
5|$|Among vertebrates, the Australian {{frilled lizard}} (Chlamydosaurus kingii) has a startling display in which wide semicircular frills {{on either side}} of the head are fanned out; the mouth is opened wide exposing the gape; the tail is waved over the body, and the body is raised, so that the animal appears as large <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> as possible.|$|E
5|$|At {{the charity}} signing before the Grammy Awards, {{the band was}} photographed {{together}} with former drummer Chris Slade. It was later confirmed that he had rejoined the band for the Grammys and upcoming tour. In April 2015, Rudd pleaded guilty to drug charges <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> to kill a former assistant. Shortly thereafter, the band's web site removed Rudd as the band's drummer and replaced him with Slade. On 9 July 2015 Rudd was denied a discharge without conviction and sentenced to eight months' home detention.|$|E

40|$|Definitions and {{categories}} of classification for endangered <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> vascular plants, {{as determined by}} the N. C.

The definition and classification of endangered <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species is the heart of any successful effort in conservation and protection. Ev- eryone interested in endangered <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species has probably been frustrated by plans, programs, definitions and lists which often complicate the situation rather than improve it. We of the North Carolina En- dangered <b>and</b> <b>Threatened</b> Plant Committee (The listed {{at the end of this}} paper.) have felt this same frustration.

5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor marks a {{break from}} the detached images of the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut is that of a soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> presence. This rugged soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted by most of the following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support of the troops to rule the empire.|$|E

Deimatic cephalopod displays involve suddenly creating bold stripes, often reinforced by stretching out the animal's arms, fins or web {{to make it look}} as big <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> as possible.|$|E

40|$|The native {{vegetation}} remnants in {{the agricultural}} country of subhumid Tasmania are important strongholds for regionally and globally rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species. A detailed survey of the best 100 of these remnants {{indicated that there was}} no relationship between the size, age and juxtaposition of the remnants and an index of rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species, either in the data set as a whole or in phytosociologically defined subsets. Rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species were found in remnants of widely varying integrity, as indicated by native and exotic species richness and cover. Some species were only found in remnants that were of poor integrity. Efforts to preserve vegetation remnants need to be directed towards both those that are representative and of high integrity, and those that contain rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> species. No great coincidence can be expected, because the causes of maintenance of good condition are not necessarily the causes of survival of many rare <b>and</b> <b>threatened</b> taxa...|$|R

Setting up camp {{in the land of}} the Bunnokee, a tribe of anthropomorphic rabbit Native Americans, he does good business there. This infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. Using technology that is more advanced than the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E

5|$|As {{the main}} war effort of Greece was {{initially}} turned towards Macedonia, on the Epirus front the Greek army was outnumbered by the Ottoman Yanya Corps at {{the outbreak of}} hostilities in October 1912. After stopping an initial attack by the Ottoman commander Esat Pasha at Gribovo, however, the Greeks succeeded in liberating Preveza (October 21) and pushing north {{in the direction of}} Ioannina, repulsing an Ottoman attack at Pente Pigadia (Beshpinar). On November 5, a small force from Corfu made a landing and captured the coastal area of Himarë without facing significant resistance, and on December 20 Greek troops improved their positions in Epirus and entered Korçë, north of Ioannina, thus cutting off its last supply route <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> the city's northeastern flank.|$|E

On December 5, Pole received twenty-six votes, only two short of the requisite two-thirds majority, prompting French ambassador Claude d'Urfé to rush {{to the door of the}} conclave, demanding that the conclave wait for the French cardinals, whom he claimed were in Corsica, <b>and</b> <b>threatening</b> that the election of a pope in their absence would be likely to cause a schism.|$|E
