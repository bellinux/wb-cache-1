25|$|Fighting was {{not limited}} to clan against clan. Because of his youth, Allan was {{vulnerable}} to being usurped by a Cameron cadet branch (distant family). Ewen Cameron of Erracht, uncle of the 14th chief of Clan Cameron, became suspect <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in the 1580s, Donald's men, Cameron of Lochiel, murdered Ewan Cameron of Erracht in battle at Inverlochy Castle on behalf of young Allen, and retaining the line of hereditary succession for Camerons of Lochiel.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} year, Caroline's daughter, Princess Charlotte, {{had married}} Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, {{and the future}} of the British monarchy looked bright. Then tragedy struck: in November 1817, Charlotte died after giving birth to her only child, a stillborn son. For the most part, Charlotte had been immensely popular with the public, and her death was a blow to the country. George refused to write to Caroline to inform her, leaving it for their son-in-law Leopold to do, but Leopold was deep in grief and delayed writing. George did, however, write to the pope of the tragedy, and by chance the courier carrying the letter passed by Pesaro, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Caroline heard the devastating news. Caroline had lost her daughter, but she had also lost any chance of regaining position through the succession of her daughter to the throne.|$|E
500|$|From June 1932 Murray was {{assigned}} {{for a year}} to Naval Service Headquarters in Ottawa as a Naval Staff Officer before setting back to sea for two years, leading the small fleet of East Coast destroyers from {{the bridge of his}} first operational command [...] At this point, in mid-1934, Murray was appointed to a new position of Senior Naval Officer, Halifax, a position that combined the Commander of the East Coast with the Command of the Naval Dockyard in Halifax. In June 1936 Murray was sent back to the UK to work in the Admiralty Operations Division, and in December 1936 he started his final tour with the Royal Navy serving as Executive Officer aboard the former battleship , where he participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. In August 1938, {{in the middle of a}} final year at the Imperial Defence College, Murray was promoted to Captain, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> on the eve of World War II when the Royal Navy was mobilized, Murray returned to Ottawa as a Captain, and Director Naval Operations and Training.|$|E

2500|$|Thus {{ended the}} {{extraordinary}} public career of Otto von Bismarck, who ... had {{presided over the}} affairs of a state he made great and glorious. ... Now the humble posture that he had necessarily adopted in his written communications with his royal master had become his real posture. The old servant, no matter how great and how brilliant, had become in reality what he had always played as on a stage: a servant who could be dismissed at will by his Sovereign. He had defended that royal prerogative because it had allowed him {{to carry out his}} immense will; now the absolute prerogative of the Emperor became what it has always been, the prerogative of the sovereign. Having crushed his parliamentary opponents, flattened and abused his ministers, and refused to allow himself to be bound by any loyalty, Bismarck had no ally left when he needed it. It was not his cabinet nor his parliamentary majority. He had made sure that it remained the sovereign's, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he fell because of a system that he preserved and bequeathed to the unstable young Emperor.|$|E
