40|$|The {{advances}} {{in the field of}} computers, digital and communication technologies have changed the way most professions are practised including surveying. In the field of surveying the advent of Geographic Information System and Satellite Positioning Systems have revolutionised the practice of the profession particularly in the areas of data acquisition, data processing, data analysis, data management and storage. These developments have direct consequence on the law, ethics, practice and boundary of the profession. These developments have compelled the Nigerian Institution of Surveyors (NIS) to institute a Mandatory Continuing Professional Development (MCPD) Programme aimed at exposing the members to current developments in the field of Surveying and Geoinformation. The programme covers the broad areas of basic computing, geoinformation technologies, professional discipline, ethics and environment. There is also a provision for the modification of the content of the programme as and when the need arises. The programme has been on for almost two years and has attracted strong support from surveyors and a few from <b>allied</b> <b>profession.</b> This strong interest is believed to be due to a desire to acquire geoinformatics knowledge {{and the fact that the}} institution is insisting that registration and re-registration will be dependent on attracting a minimum number of credits at the MCPD. 1...|$|E
40|$|Musicians are {{different}}. Not different like {{athletes are}} different, or like painters are different ??? but {{different from those}} who are different. Making music literally sounds like it is too much fun, which is sometimes a gross error in perception ??? sometimes it is profoundly sad, other times it is profoundly inspiring, still other times it is profoundly illuminating. But the true art of making music is always profound in some way. Fortunately, there is an <b>allied</b> <b>profession</b> that provides a similar result, and that is why most musicians wind up teaching music. When an individual devotes the majority of her life to making music and teaching it, those profound emotions become inextricably intertwined. Old music teachers never die, ???they just misplace their notes???, so to speak. This study, Segue, is a multiple case study of four teacher/musicians. Two of the participants are veteran teachers who had already left the profession, one left before the completion of this study, and their cases are examined as well as a fourth, who has been forced to delay retirement. In this study, the effects of retirement on the first three individuals are assessed, while the other teacher has been observed to note changes in attitudes and behaviors now that her retirement has been delayed. In all cases, these ???rites of passage??? were examined within the context of changes in music education praxis, as well as their impact on the other significant stakeholders in the process, including students, colleagues, and affected communities. The study illustrates that music teachers, as a group, remain committed to making music after retirement, at its base, for their own aesthetic needs, but also for sharing music with others, and their continued contributions to music education in multiple forms promotes a sense of value to the individual, as well as a sense of cherishing from the community...|$|E

40|$|Art therapy {{practice}} in palliative care offers a creative way {{of responding to}} the emotional, psychological and spiritual needs of the dying individual within the principles of integrated whole person care. In this research spirituality is identified and defined through a retrospective 'critical and imaginative ethnography of the everyday'. The methodology described in chapter two focuses on the ethnographic imagination and incorporates a reflexive approach to define the meaning-making {{that takes place in}} art therapy with people who are living with a life-threatening illness. The case studies focus on the artefacts created by the terminally ill and dying person within a typical art therapy intervention. The analysis reveals a variety of meanings attributed to the artefact with a particular emphasis on the spiritual significance of the art-making process and the drawings and paintings created. In order to achieve this reference is made to developments in practical theology as a way of throwing light on how art therapy can facilitate the expression and exploration of spiritual and religious areas of need. This is important for art therapy practice as spirituality in hospice and palliative care is considered to be an important concern and an essential dimension of support. The modem hospice movement has always valued this aspect of the experience of the terminally ill patient and continues {{to pay attention to the}} meaning of dying and death and its spiritual significance. The analysis of the art-making process and the artefacts in art therapy demonstrates the profound importance of meaning-making at the end of life. This also provides evidence of the contribution that art therapy can make to palliative care. This adds to the support of the continued relevance and preservation of a psychosocial model of care that integrates the emotional, spiritual, psychological, physical and social aspects of patient care. It also raises the profile of the pastoral dimension to care of the dying by placing art therapy as an <b>allied</b> <b>profession</b> to the role of chaplaincy within health care contexts. The argument in this study is that the integrated approach cannot be assumed to be a secular stronghold that ultimately marginalises the religious and spiritual significance of cultural and social relations. Spiritual and religious meaning continually refuses to disappear and occupies a significant place within the economy of health care practice. Throughout the modem hospice movement it has been argued that the bio-medical model has to be continually challenged and critiqued in order to prevent the erosion of psychosocial aspects of care. Equally, the organisations that provide the environment of care for the terminally ill and dying person need to foster a culture of open, reflective debate and dialogue to avoid institutionalised attitudes and behaviours becoming established that can ultimately crush the human spirit. Art therapy contributes to the community of hospice and palliative care as an integral part of the complex cultural and religious dimensions of human experience at the end of life...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is a case}} study in the sociology of professions. It reports on the Australian <b>allied</b> health <b>professions,</b> a group that has rarely been the subject of sustained research. The central purpose of the {{research is}} to examine the impact of local workplace organisation in Australian general hospitals in the public sector on the position of the <b>allied</b> health <b>professions</b> and their autonomy. Further, the research seeks to unbundle the competing claims about the utility of alternative organisational approaches and to examine how the <b>allied</b> health <b>professions</b> negotiate inter-professional relationships as a consequence of particular organisational approaches. The research draws on Eliot Freidson's professional dominance theory (medical dominance theory) as the underpinning theoretical framework. Medical dominance theory portrays the <b>allied</b> health <b>professions</b> as inevitably subject to medical dominance and subordination, a proposition which is critically appraised through a contemporary analysis of local workplace arrangements. To address these issues three models of <b>allied</b> health <b>profession</b> organisation were identified; the classical medical model, division of allied health model and the unit dispersement model. The research method involved a comparative case study approach and included fifty-three interviews, document analysis, observation strategies and key informants over a two year period. Data collection was guided by seventeen themes of inquiry which were identified from a multiple methods approach as likely to be important in a comparative analysis of the organisation of the <b>allied</b> health <b>professions...</b>|$|R
