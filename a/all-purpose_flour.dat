25|$|Fresh {{pasta is}} usually locally made with fresh {{ingredients}} {{unless it is}} destined to be shipped, in which case consideration {{is given to the}} spoilage rates of the desired ingredients such as eggs or herbs. Furthermore, fresh pasta is usually made with a mixture of eggs and <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> or “00” low-gluten flour. Since it contains eggs, it is more tender compared to dried pasta and only takes about half the time to cook. Delicate sauces are preferred for fresh pasta in order to let the pasta take front stage.|$|E
25|$|A light batter {{is made of}} {{cold water}} (sometimes {{sparkling}} water is used to keep the batter light) and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour).</b> Eggs, baking soda or baking powder, starch, oil, and/or spices may also be added. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare the}} chicken pieces for frying, {{they may be}} coated in a batter of flour and liquid (and seasonings) mixed together. The batter can contain {{ingredients}} like eggs, milk, and leavening. Alternatively, they may be dredged in flour or a similar dry substance, to coat the meat {{and to develop a}} crust. Seasonings such as salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, or ranch dressing mix can be mixed in with the flour. Either process may be preceded by marination or by dipping in milk or buttermilk. As the pieces of chicken cook, some of the moisture that exudes from the chicken is absorbed by the coating of flour and browns along with the flour, creating a flavorful crust. According to Nathan Bailey's 1736 cookbook, Dictionarium Domesticum, for example, the chicken can be covered in a marinade that consists of the juice of two large fresh lemons, malt vinegar, bay leaves, salt, pepper, ground cloves, and green onions; it then must be settled in the marinade for three hours before being dipped in the batter that consists of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour,</b> white wine, three egg yolks and salt, and then slowly submerged in a deep pot of either oil, lard, or clarified butter over an open fire. [...] It can then be topped with fresh, dried parsley dipped in the same frying oil.|$|E
50|$|Southern chefs {{may have}} had an {{advantage}} in creating biscuits. Northern American <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flours,</b> mainly grown in Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, are made from the hard spring wheats that grow in the North's cold-winter climate. Southern American bleached <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flours,</b> originally grown in the Carolinas, Georgia and Tennessee before national food distribution networks, are made from the soft winter wheat that grows in the warm southern summer. This summer growth results in wheat that has less protein, which is more suited {{to the creation of}} quick breads, as well as cookies, cakes and muffins.|$|R

2500|$|Hard Red Winter– Hard, brownish, mellow high-protein wheat {{used for}} bread, hard baked goods {{and as an}} adjunct in other flours to {{increase}} protein in pastry flour for pie crusts. Some brands of unbleached <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flours</b> are commonly made from hard red winter wheat alone. It is primarily traded on the Kansas City Board of Trade. One variety is known as [...] "turkey red wheat", and was brought to Kansas by Mennonite immigrants from Russia.|$|R
50|$|Special cake flour {{with a high}} starch-to-gluten {{ratio is}} made from fine-textured, soft, low-protein wheat. It is {{strongly}} bleached, and compared to <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour,</b> cake flour tends to result in cakes with a lighter, less dense texture. Therefore, it is frequently specified or preferred in cakes meant to be soft, light, and/or bright white, such as angel food cake. However, if cake flour is called for, a substitute {{can be made by}} replacing a small percentage of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> with cornstarch or removing two tablespoons from each cup of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour.</b> Some recipes explicitly specify or permit <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour,</b> notably where a firmer or denser cake texture is desired.|$|E
5000|$|<b>All-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> is {{the most}} common flour used in baking. Its protein content lies between bread and cake flours and pastry flours. All-purpose is used in many recipes for the reason that people find it’s {{acceptable}} for most household baking needs. It can generally be substituted for recipes that call for either bread or cake flour, however, the final texture of the product may vary slightly. High-protein bread flour absorbs more liquid, so substituting <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> may result in a slightly stickier dough; while low-protein flour absorbs less liquid, so substituting with <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> may result in a slightly dry batter.2 ...|$|E
50|$|Many dry ingredients, such as {{granulated}} sugar, are {{not very}} compressible, so volume measures are consistent. Others, notably flour, are more variable. For example, 1 cup of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> sifted into a cup and leveled weighs about 100 grams, whereas 1 cup of <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flour</b> scooped from its container and leveled weighs about 140 grams.|$|E
50|$|When wheat is milled to make flour, {{the parts}} of the grain are usually {{separated}} and then are recombined to make specific types of flour, such as whole wheat, whole grain, white cake and pastry <b>flour,</b> and <b>all-purpose</b> white <b>flour.</b> If all parts of the kernel are used in the same relative proportions as they exist in the original kernel, then the flour is considered whole grain.|$|R
50|$|Flour is grain {{ground to}} a powdery consistency. Flour {{provides}} the primary structure, starch and protein to the final baked bread. The protein content of the flour is the best indicator {{of the quality of}} the bread dough and the finished bread. While bread can be made from <b>all-purpose</b> wheat <b>flour,</b> a specialty bread flour, containing more protein (12-14%), is recommended for high-quality bread. If one uses a flour with a lower protein content (9-11%) to produce bread, a shorter mixing time is required to develop gluten strength properly. An extended mixing time leads to oxidization of the dough, which gives the finished product a whiter crumb, instead of the cream color preferred by most artisan bakers.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceFood ScienceFadi AramouniLittle in vivo {{research}} on glycemic index (GI) values or the digestive impact of sorghum based food products currently exists. Because sorghum is a gluten-free grain, its utilization in the United States is growing, especially in baking applications. Information on how sorghum affects {{blood sugar levels}} would be beneficial as new products emerge because glycemic effect {{has an impact on}} human health and in controlling diabetes. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the GI of a sorghum muffin, and compare this value to the GI of muffins made from commonly consumed grains in the United States. The effects of particle size and damaged starch on GI were also studied. GI values were determined for muffins made from white sorghum, corn, brown rice, whole wheat, and <b>all-purpose</b> <b>flours.</b> All muffin formulations were composed of flour, water, baking powder and salt. To determine the GI, weighed portions of muffin containing 20 g of available carbohydrates were eaten on separate occasions by eight healthy volunteers (ages 18 - 40) after an overnight fast (10 hours). Each muffin was administered twice. Two capillary blood samples were taken at 0 (fasting), 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after consumption and averaged. Blood glucose curves were constructed from mean blood glucose values. The GI was calculated by dividing the incremental area under the curve for the test food (muffin) by that for the standard (20 g dextrose drink) and multiplying by 100. The GI for the muffins was calculated as the mean from the respective average GIs of the 8 volunteers. The data indicated that sorghum flour milled at particle size < 400 um resulted in the lowest GI of 32 ± 16. 8. These findings should assist in development of lower GI sorghum foods...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the methods}} of {{improving}} the nutritional profile of baked-goods is the incorporation of dietary fibre (DF) to the formulation. However, DF retains more water than wheat flour, which affects dough rheological properties and thus the final product quality. Flour is the main ingredient in biscuits and contributes to the baked texture and shape of biscuits. There are large differences in quality among the flours from wheat cultivars and among non-wheat flours used for biscuit production. In previous works, different dietary fibres were tested and inulin {{was found to have}} a positive quality  effect on biscuits made from an <b>all-purpose</b> wheat <b>flour</b> without the need of introducing significant changes in dough properties. To know whether these results are extended to different types of flours {{that can be used for}} biscuit production, this paper aimed to analyse the effects of different levels of inulin incorporation on dough and biscuits quality made from three different wheat flours and one triticale flour. Chemical and physic-chemical characterization of the flour samples was performed and compared (moisture, ashes, gluten, solvent retention capacity (SRC) and protein content). Inulin was incorporated to biscuits formulation in two levels: 6 and 12 % (wheat replacement). Dough and biscuits quality was measured by spread rate during baking and biscuit factor, texture and surface colour. Inulin incorporation increased dough spreading and biscuit factor and decreased biscuit hardness. The enhancing effect of inulin was observed in all flour. The results confirmed the effect of inulin on biscuits obtained with all flour assayed, despite the differences in flour quality that was tested. </p...|$|R
