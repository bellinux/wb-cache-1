5|$|Antarctica is a {{de facto}} condominium, governed by parties to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> System that have {{consulting}} status. Twelve countries signed the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's ecozone. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> (also {{known as}} the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main {{instrument}} concerned with conservation and management of biodiversity in Antarctica. The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.|$|E
5|$|Other {{countries}} participating {{as members}} of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> have a territorial interest in Antarctica, but the provisions of the Treaty do not allow them to make their claims while it is in force.|$|E
5|$|New {{claims on}} Antarctica have been {{suspended}} since 1959, although in 2015 Norway formally defined Queen Maud Land as including the unclaimed area {{between it and the}} South Pole. Antarctica's status is regulated by the 1959 <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> and other related agreements, collectively called the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> System. Antarctica is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60° S {{for the purposes of the}} Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the Soviet Union (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the United States. It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica. This was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> prohibits any {{military}} activity in Antarctica, including {{the establishment of}} military bases and fortifications, military manoeuvres, and weapons testing. Military personnel or equipment are permitted only for scientific research or other peaceful purposes. The only documented military land manoeuvre has been the small Operation NINETY by the Argentine military in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis (October–November 1962) {{brought the}} world closer to nuclear war than ever before. The {{aftermath}} of the crisis led to the first efforts in the nuclear arms race at nuclear disarmament and improving relations, although the Cold War's first arms control agreement, the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty,</b> had come into force in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, {{gold and}} other {{minerals}} have been found, {{they have not}} been in large enough quantities to exploit. The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Peter I Island {{is one of}} Norway's two {{territorial}} {{claims in}} Antarctica, the other being Queen Maud Land. Peter I Island is the only claim within 90°W and 150°W and is also the only claim {{which is not a}} sector. Being south of 60°S, the island is subject to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty.</b> The treaty ensures free access to the island for any scientific investigation, and states that it can only be used for peaceful purposes. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognized each other's claims in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|The main mineral {{resource}} known {{on the continent}} is coal. It was first recorded near the Beardmore Glacier by Frank Wild on the Nimrod Expedition, and now low-grade coal is known across {{many parts of the}} Transantarctic Mountains. The Prince Charles Mountains contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the oil and natural gas fields found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all {{mineral resource}}s is banned until 2048 by the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty.</b>|$|E
5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is {{unlikely}} to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases to the native seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, {{the newly}} created Norwegian Polar Institute was {{assigned}} the administration of Norwegian territories in the Arctic and Antarctic, including Queen Maud Land. Norway sent two major expeditions to the territory in the 1940s and 1950s, but its efforts declined after that. On 21 June 1957, Queen Maud Land became subject to Norwegian sovereignty as a dependency (biland), and the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> officially came into force on 23 June 1961. Norwegian activity during the 1960s was limited to some minor co-expeditions with the United States, until it gradually picked up again following a larger expedition to western Queen Maud Land and the eastern Weddell Sea by the Norwegian Polar Institute in 1976–77.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen was {{the first}} person known to have set foot in the {{territory}}, in 1930. On 14 January 1939, the territory was claimed by Norway. From 1939 until 1945, Nazi Germany claimed New Swabia, which consisted of part of Queen Maud Land. On 23 June 1961, Queen Maud Land became part of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> System, making it a demilitarised zone. It is one of two Antarctic claims made by Norway, the other being Peter I Island. They are administrated by the Polar Affairs Department of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security in Oslo.|$|E
5|$|The {{basis for}} TrollSat was an {{agreement}} signed in 2006 between the Norwegian Polar Institute, the Norwegian Space Centre and Kongsberg Satellite Services. It specified that the Space Centre would install a Kongsberg-built radome, while the Polar Institute would provide power and undertake maintenance. In exchange, they could freely use the earth station {{for their own}} transmission needs. The commercial activities would {{be carried out by}} Kongsberg Satellite Services. A concern was raised regarding if satellite downloading would violate the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty,</b> but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negated. The station started operations on 1 March 2007 and was officially opened by Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} first sighted by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen on 21 January 1821 {{and was named}} for Peter I of Russia. Not until 2 February 1929 did anyone {{set foot on the}} island, when Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad's Second Norvegia Expedition, financed by Lars Christensen, was successful. They claimed it for Norway, who annexed it in 1931 and made it a {{dependency}} in 1933. The next landing occurred in 1948 and the island has been subject to some scientific research and a limited amount of tourism. The island became subject to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> in 1961. Since 1987, there has been an automated meteorological station on the island. Three amateur radio DX-peditions have visited the island and there are sporadic landings by tourists.|$|E
5|$|The next landing {{occurred}} on 10 February 1948 by Larsen's ship Brategg. Biological, geological and hydrographic surveys underwent for three days, before the pack ice forced the expedition to leave. The expedition built a hut {{and placed a}} copy of the document of occupation from 1929 inside. On 23 June 1961, Peter I Island became subject to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty,</b> after Norway's signing of the treaty in 1959. Since then, there have been several landings on the island by various nations for scientific investigations, as well as a limited number of ships that have successfully landed tourists on the island.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{it became}} {{increasingly}} {{important for the}} Government of Norway to have a permanent base in Queen Maud Land. The area had been annexed as a dependency on 14 January 1939, at the time mainly based on Norwegian whaling interests in the Antarctic. From 1956, Norway operated the research station Norway Station, but this was given to South Africa in 1959. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Norway's research activities in Antarctica were sporadic and without a fixed base. This gave the advantage that the research was not bound geographically, but it weakened the Norwegian claim for Queen Maud Land {{and the right to}} participate as a consultative member of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty.</b> In 1989, any party to the Treaty could ask for it to be renegotiated, and Norwegian authorities saw the need for a permanent base to strengthen Norway's claim to Queen Maud Land.|$|E
5|$|Emilio Marcos Palma was {{the first}} person born south of the 60th {{parallel}} south (the continental limit according to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty),</b> as well as the first one born on the Antarctic mainland, in 1978 at Base Esperanza, on the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the Argentine government to determine if the continent was suitable for family life. In 1984, Juan Pablo Camacho was born at the Frei Montalva Station, becoming the first Chilean born in Antarctica. Several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station. As of 2009, eleven children were born in Antarctica (south of the 60th parallel south): eight at the Argentine Esperanza Base and three at the Chilean Frei Montalva Station.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{designation}} of the Australian Antarctic Territory pre-dated {{the signing of the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty,</b> Australian laws that relate to Antarctica date from more than two decades before the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> era. In terms of criminal law, the laws that apply to the Jervis Bay Territory (which follows the laws of the Australian Capital Territory) apply to the Australian Antarctic Territory. Key Australian legislation applying <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> System decisions include the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Act 1960, the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> (Environment Protection) Act 1980 and the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Secretariat was {{established}} in Buenos Aires, Argentina in September 2004 by the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Consultative Meeting (ATCM). Jan Huber (Netherlands) served as the first Executive Secretary for five years until August 31, 2009. He was succeeded on September 1, 2009, by Manfred Reinke (Germany).|$|E

25|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> {{and related}} agreements, collectively {{known as the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> System (ATS), {{regulate}} international relations with respect to Antarctica, Earth's only continent without a native human population. For {{the purposes of the}} treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and having 53 parties as of 2016, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans military activity on that continent. The treaty was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War. The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Secretariat headquarters is located in Buenos Aires Argentina, since September 2004.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> System's yearly <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> Consultative Meetings (ATCM) are the {{international}} {{forum for the}} administration {{and management of the}} region. Only 29 of the 53 parties to the agreements have the right to participate in decision-making at these meetings, though the other 24 are still allowed to attend. The decision-making participants are the Consultative Parties and, in addition to the 12 original signatories, include 17 countries that have demonstrated their interest in Antarctica by carrying out substantial scientific activity there.|$|E
25|$|Governments {{that are}} {{party to the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> and its Protocol on Environmental Protection {{implement}} the articles of these agreements, and decisions taken under them, through national laws. These laws generally apply only to their own citizens, wherever they are in Antarctica, and serve to enforce the consensus decisions of the consultative parties: about which activities are acceptable, which areas require permits to enter, what processes of environmental impact assessment must precede activities, and so on. The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> is often considered to represent {{an example of the}} common heritage of mankind principle.|$|E
25|$|Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals {{is part of}} the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> System. It {{was signed}} at the {{conclusion}} of a multilateral conference in London on 11 February 1972.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 1982, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CAMLR Convention) {{came into}} force after discussions began in 1975 between {{parties of the}} then-current <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> to limit {{large-scale}} exploitation of krill by commercial fisheries. The Convention bound contracting nations to abide by previously agreed upon Antarctic territorial claims and peaceful use of the region while protecting ecosystem integrity south of the Antarctic Convergence and 60 S latitude. In so doing, it also established a commission of the original signatories and acceding parties called the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to advance these aims through protection, scientific study, and rational use, such as harvesting, of those marine resources. Though separate, the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> and CCAMLR, make up part the broader system of international agreements called the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> System. Since 1982, the CCAMLR meets annually to implement binding conservations measures like the creation of 'protected areas' {{at the suggestion of}} the convention's scientific committee.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> {{was signed}} on 1 December 1959 and came into force on 23 June 1961. Among other provisions, this treaty limits {{military}} {{activity in the}} Antarctic to the support of scientific research.|$|E
25|$|South African law {{applies to}} all South African {{citizens}} in Antarctica, and {{they are subject to}} the jurisdiction of the magistrate's court in Cape Town. In regard to violations of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> and related agreements, South Africa also asserts jurisdiction over South African residents and members of expeditions organised in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> System in 1959 the Falkland Islands Dependencies were reduced to include just South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Territory south of the 60th parallel was formed into a new dependency, the British Antarctic Territory, which overlaps claims by Argentina (Argentine Antarctica) and Chile (Antártica Chilena Province).|$|E
25|$|Additional {{regulations}} {{from the}} United Nations International Maritime Organization took effect on August 1, 2011, prohibiting ships using heavy oil from navigation in the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty</b> System area to prevent pollution. The IMO Guidelines For Ships Operating In Ice-Covered Waters also establishes requirements for a double-hull strengthened against ice-related damage. The Japanese factory ship Nisshin Maru does not currently meet these IMO standards.|$|E
25|$|This {{is a list}} of glaciers in the subantarctic. This list {{includes}} one snow field (Murray Snowfield). Snow fields are not glaciers in the strict sense of the word, but they are commonly found at the accumulation zone or head of a glacier. For the purposes of this list, Antarctica is defined as any latitude further south than 60° (the continental limit according to the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Treaty).</b>|$|E
