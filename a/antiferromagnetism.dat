5|$|Magnetism as a {{property}} of matter {{has been known}} in China since 4000 BC. However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started {{with the development of}} electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to magnetization. Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in ferromagnetic materials. In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets. The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired magnetization. The Ising model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous magnetization cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on <b>antiferromagnetism</b> led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices.|$|E
25|$|In certain {{crystalline}} materials individual magnetic moments may be {{aligned with}} each other (magnetic moment has both magnitude and direction). This gives rise to ferromagnetism, <b>antiferromagnetism</b> or ferrimagnetism. These are properties of the crystal as a whole, of little bearing on chemical properties.|$|E
25|$|Exchange {{interactions}} can act over infinite chains in one dimension, {{planes in}} two dimensions or over a whole crystal in three dimensions. These {{are examples of}} long-range magnetic ordering. They give rise to ferromagnetism, <b>antiferromagnetism</b> or ferrimagnetism, depending on the nature and relative orientations of the individual spins.|$|E
25|$|Compounds at {{temperatures}} below the Curie temperature exhibit long-range magnetic {{order in the}} form of ferromagnetism. Another critical temperature is the Néel temperature, below which <b>antiferromagnetism</b> occurs. The hexahydrate of nickel chloride, NiCl2·6H2O, has a Néel temperature of 8.3 K. The susceptibility is a maximum at this temperature. Below the Néel temperature the susceptibility decreases and the substance becomes antiferromagnetic.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} {{sufficient}} energy exchange between neighbouring dipoles they will interact, and may spontaneously align or anti-align and form magnetic domains, resulting in ferromagnetism (permanent magnets) or <b>antiferromagnetism,</b> respectively. Paramagnetic behavior can also be observed in ferromagnetic materials that are above their Curie temperature, and in antiferromagnets above their Néel temperature. At these temperatures, the available thermal energy simply overcomes the interaction energy between the spins.|$|E
25|$|Magnetochemistry is {{concerned}} with the magnetic properties of chemical compounds. Magnetic properties arise from the spin and orbital angular momentum of the electrons contained in a compound. Compounds are diamagnetic when they contain no unpaired electrons. Molecular compounds that contain one or more unpaired electrons are paramagnetic. The magnitude of the paramagnetism is expressed as an effective magnetic moment, μeff. For first-row transition metals the magnitude of μeff is, to a first approximation, a simple function of the number of unpaired electrons, the spin-only formula. In general, spin-orbit coupling causes μeff to deviate from the spin-only formula. For the heavier transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, spin-orbit coupling cannot be ignored. Exchange interaction can occur in clusters and infinite lattices, resulting in ferromagnetism, <b>antiferromagnetism</b> or ferrimagnetism depending on the relative orientations of the individual spins.|$|E

In contrast, the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons, i.e. the tendency [...] that they try to avoid each other by this repulsion, would lead to an antisymmetric orbital function (i.e. with the − sign) of these two particles, and complementary to a symmetric spin function (i.e. with the + sign, one of the so-called [...] "triplet functions"). Thus, now the spins would be parallel (ferromagnetism in a solid, paramagnetism in two-atomic gases).|$|E

50|$|Gorter studied {{many aspects}} of <b>antiferromagnetism</b> in CuCl2·2H2O. With Johannes Haantjes, he {{developed}} a theoretical model of <b>antiferromagnetism</b> in a double-lattice substance. After WWII he worked on liquid helium II and developed the theory which {{is now known as}} Coulomb blockade, the increase in electrical resistance in metal films at low temperatures. The Gorter-Mellink equation describes the mutual friction of two fluids in liquid helium II.|$|E

50|$|Ferrimagnetism is {{exhibited}} by ferrites and magnetic garnets. The oldest known magnetic substance, magnetite (iron(II,III) oxide; Fe3O4), is a ferrimagnet; {{it was originally}} classified as a ferromagnet before Néel's discovery of ferrimagnetism and <b>antiferromagnetism</b> in 1948.|$|E
50|$|Since 1948 in {{collaboration}} with Nikolay Bogoliubov he started to work on quantum theory of ferromagnetism and <b>antiferromagnetism.</b> In 1948 they developed a consistent theoretical polar model of metals.

50|$|At {{pressures}} above approximately 10 GPa {{and temperatures}} {{of a few}} hundred kelvin or less, α-iron changes into a hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure, which is also known as ε-iron or hexaferrum; the higher-temperature γ-phase also changes into ε-iron, but does so at a higher pressure. <b>Antiferromagnetism</b> in alloys of epsilon-Fe with Mn, Os and Ru has been observed.|$|E
50|$|Coordination {{polymers}} exhibit {{many kinds}} of magnetism. <b>Antiferromagnetism,</b> ferrimagnetism, and ferromagnetism are cooperative phenomena of the magnetic spins within a solid arising from coupling between the spins of the paramagnetic centers. In order to allow efficient magnetic, metal ions should be bridged by small ligands allowing for short metal-metal contacts (such as oxo, cyano, and azido bridges).|$|E
50|$|In some materials, {{the atoms}} (with net {{magnetic}} dipole moments) can {{interact with each}} other to align themselves {{even in the absence of}} any external magnetic field when the thermal agitation is low enough. Alignment could be parallel (ferromagnetism) or anti-parallel. In case of anti-parallel, the dipole moments may or may not cancel each other (<b>antiferromagnetism,</b> ferrimagnetism).|$|E
50|$|Lattice {{models with}} nearest-neighbor {{interactions}} {{have been used}} extensively to model {{a wide variety of}} systems and phenomena, including the lattice gas, binary liquid solutions, order-disorder phase transitions, ferromagnetism, and <b>antiferromagnetism.</b> Most calculations of correlation functions for nonrandom configurations are based on statistical mechanical techniques, which lead to equations that usually need to be solved numerically.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} application is by Nikolai Bogoliubov {{himself in the}} context of superfluidity.

50|$|An {{unpaired}} electron has a magnetic dipole moment, while an electron pair has no dipole moment {{because the two}} electrons have opposite spins so their magnetic dipole fields are in opposite directions and cancel.

50|$|Unlike the oxypnictides, large single {{crystals}} of the 122s can {{be easily}} synthesized by using the flux method.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Fabre or Bechgaard salts universal phase diagrams for all the ET-based salts have only been proposed yet.

While {{ferroelectric}} ferroelastics (with their associated piezoelectric and electrostrictive coupling) and ferromagnetic ferroelastics (with piezomagnetic and magnetomechanical coupling) are formally multiferroics, these days the term is usually {{used to describe the}} magnetoelectric multiferroics that are simultaneously ferromagnetic and ferroelectric. Sometimes the definition is expanded to include non-primary order parameters, such as <b>antiferromagnetism</b> or ferrimagnetism. In addition other types of primary order, such as ferroic arrangements of magneotelectric multipoles of which ferrotoroidicity is an example, have also been recently proposed.|$|E
