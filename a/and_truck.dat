5|$|May 13, 1972: Near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a {{scheduled}} trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck. The {{driver of the}} bus had begun to pass a car. Fourteen people, including both the bus <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> drivers, died. The National Transportation Safety Board determined {{that the cause of}} the crash was the Greyhound driver's overtaking maneuver and his failure to avoid the truck.|$|E

5|$|Trucks {{came into}} {{widespread}} {{use in the}} Western World during World War I, and quickly gained reputation {{as a means of}} long distance transportation of goods. Modern highways, such as the Trans-Canada Highway, Highway 1 (Australia) and Pan-American Highway allowed transport of goods and services across great distances. Automobiles continue to {{play a crucial role in}} the economies of the Industrialized countries, resulting in rise of businesses such as motor freight operation <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> transportation.|$|E

5|$|In March 1982 Massino was {{tipped off}} by a Colombo-associated FBI insider {{that he was about}} to be indicted and went into hiding in Pennsylvania with Leisenheimer. On March 25, 1982, Massino was also charged with {{conspiracy}} to murder Indelicato, Giaccone and Trinchera <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> hijacking. In hiding, Massino was able to see the prosecution's strategy and better plan his defense as well as eventually face trial without association with other mobsters. Pistone later speculated Massino also feared retaliation upon the revelation that his associate Raymond Wean had turned state's evidence. Massino was visited by many fellow mobsters, including Gotti, and Vitale would secretly deliver cash to support him.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> drivers have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector {{for at least the next}} 2–3 years.|$|E

5|$|A MD 30 bypass of Hampstead {{has been}} {{contemplated}} since the 1940s and planned {{since at least}} 1960. The heavy traffic along the highway consisted of three types of highway users: local traffic made up {{of people who had}} moved to Hampstead or Manchester for the municipalities' small-town charm; regional traffic comprising people who had moved to Pennsylvania for cheaper housing and lower taxes but continued to work in the Baltimore area; <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> traffic serving local industry and making connections between Baltimore and Hanover. The increase in congestion on MD 30 accelerated with the completion of I-795 in 1987. By the early 1990s, it took as long as 15 minutes for motorists to pass through each of the towns during rush hour; an average of 20,000 to 25,000 motorists used the highway through Hampstead each day by 2001. Progress toward construction of the bypass was continually delayed. The bypass was removed from MDSHA plans by 1979. The Hampstead Bypass had returned to state plans by 1990, when engineering and design work was underway and construction was planned to begin in 1992. However, in 1991, the bypass was shelved for six years for lack of funding.|$|E
5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|It was a {{daunting}} challenge. The Ho Chi Minh Trail (controlled by the 259th PAVN Logistical Group) {{consisted of a}} labyrinth of dirt roads, bicycle and foot paths, bypasses, storage areas, workshops, <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> parks that stretched from the mountain passes of North Vietnam, through the panhandle of Laos, and into east central Cambodia. The entire system was elaborately camouflaged from aerial observation and was constantly being maintained, expanded, and improved. By 1968 PAVN was relying less on manual labor and increasingly utilizing modern construction equipment. The CIA estimated during the year the 259th Group was using 20 bulldozers, eleven road graders, three rock crushers and two steamrollers on the network. Manual labor was still provided by an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Laotians (mostly pressed into service) and North Vietnamese volunteers.|$|E

5|$|The first {{prototype}} pylon {{was developed}} by Martin Jehart of Bellutti Protection Systems, an Austrian engineering firm specializing in the manufacturing of technical materials and tarpaulin. They initially used a latex balloon for crash tests and aerodynamic studies and after many tests and research settled {{on the use of}} a combination of different materials, the crucial component being spinnaker ripstop nylon, an extremely lightweight and flexible material used for making sails for boats. This would prove to be a breakthrough {{in the development of the}} Air Gates producing a pylon that would rip instantaneously when hit by a plane. Over 70 tests of the pylon were carried out on the ground using a car with a wing strapped on the roof before they were ready to undergo tests with a real plane. Eight different cars were used in these tests as well as a trailer <b>and</b> <b>truck.</b> Hungarian pilot, Péter Besenyei worked closely with the team and attempted the first deliberate pylon hit in early 2003 with positive results. The first Air Gates, which were cylindrical, were finally ready to be used at the very first Red Bull Air Races held in Austria and Hungary later that year.|$|E
5|$|The four {{lanes of}} I-35E pass through {{downtown}} Saint Paul {{in the center}} of the six lanes of I-94, with a short overlap occupying the blocks between 11th and 12th streets. Despite this short overlap, there is no weaving between the two highways, since an exit in each direction of I-35E—exit107A from I-35E north to I-94 east, and exit107B from I-35E south to I-94 west—takes traffic that would move to the right in the overlap instead to the right of the entire roadway. There are no interchanges on the common segment, and no direct access from I-35E northbound to I-94 west or I-94 eastbound to I-35E south. Kellogg Boulevard provides an indirect connection; Ayd Mill Road, further west, nears I-94 but does not connect without several turns and traffic lights. Unlike the west split of I-35E and I-94, all ramps are present at the east split; among other uses, the I-35E southbound to I-94 east and I-94 westbound to I-35E north ramps carry traffic following US Highway10 (US10), which overlaps I-35E north of downtown, <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> traffic using the nearby Lafayette Freeway (US52) to avoid the parkway through the West Seventh neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Within {{two decades}} {{the bridge was}} {{considered}} a safety hazard, due to increased traffic volume, speed, <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> sizes. The primary concerns were deficiency in the width and curve radius. The bridge was strengthened as well as widened in 1959–60. Removing the footpath and using that space for the road had been suggested, but instead the structure itself was widened by , leaving the footpath intact. The approaches to the bridges were widened, new piers were erected {{either side of the}} railway span, and eight new girders were installed – six of which were part of the previous Causeway structure. The work was undertaken from a suspended platform, which had to be quickly pulled up when trains went past. The widening, designed by Main Road's second bridge engineer Gilbert Marsh, cost approximately ₤20,000.|$|E

5|$|The Delaware State Route System {{includes}} Delaware's {{portion of}} the Interstate Highway System and U.S. Highway System along with state routes. The system also includes special routes of the U.S. and state routes, such as alternate, business, <b>and</b> <b>truck</b> routes. These routes consist of a banner denoting the type of special route above the route marker. Alternate routes provide a second alignment of a route between two points. DE 10 Alternate provides an alternate routing to DE 10 between Willow Grove and Rising Sun by passing through Woodside while DE 10 passes through Camden. Business routes pass through the business area of a city while the main route bypasses it. DE 1 Business passes through the central portion of Milford while DE 1 bypasses {{the city to the}} east. Truck routes provide an alternate route for trucks around a certain portion of a route. DE 14 Truck provides a route for truck traffic that bypasses the section of DE 14 that passes through Harrington. Suffixed routes also exist for short alignments that branch off their parent routes, in which a letter suffix is added after the route number. DE 1 has three suffixed routes in the Rehoboth Beach area while DE 9A provides access to the Port of Wilmington from DE 9. In addition to these systems are other state roads designated with a maintenance road number.|$|E
