500|$|Eleanor Roosevelt {{objected to}} the casting of Lionel Barrymore as her late husband, due to {{political}} remarks that Barrymore had made about the president in 1944.

The War Department and the White House reviewed the script, and both asked for changes.

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed at a former Chili's in the San Fernando Valley, {{in the city}} of Burbank. The episode was filmed [...] "from dawn, until very late at night", {{according}} to Kaling. During filming breaks, Kaling later joked that she took [...] "ladylike" [...] naps, while Paul Lieberstein made notes on the episode and its script. While filming, many parts of the script were changed so the restaurant would allow the shoot to continue. For instance, in the original script, Pam vomits at Chili's and Dwight responds, [...] "A woman has vomited!" [...] Because the completed script was not available for Chili's to review until shooting had already started, when they were finally given <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it, they objected to a customer vomiting in their restaurant. Chili's withdrew its permission to shoot, but, after a few hours, Steve Carell developed a compromise: Pam would fall off her bar stool and Dwight would respond, [...] "A woman has had a seizure!" [...] In the original version, Pam was also to be over-served alcohol by the Chili's staff, but Chili's—feeling that this would reflect poorly on their character as a company—did not want this in the episode either. To solve this issue, the writers had Pam steal drinks off other tables. The writers and producers also agreed to include a scene in which the actual owner of the Chili's restaurant (Jon Bosshart, not an actor) makes it clear that the restaurant does not over-serve alcohol to its customers. [...] Since Jenna Fischer does not drink much in real life, B. J. Novak took her out so she could get drunk while Novak described to her how she was behaving and how it did not match her own perception. She drew upon this experience for her performance.|$|E

50|$|The Little Boy Lost is a two stanza poem with 8 total lines. There is no set metre but it {{is similar}} to common metre.In the poem Blake uses {{internal}} rhyme in line 8 “The mire was deep, & the child did weep” with the words “weep” and “deep”. This {{played a role in}} the simplicity of reading the poem. The use of caesuras throughout the poem also contributes <b>to</b> the easy <b>reading,</b> giving the reader <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> slowly <b>read</b> and take in the words and meanings. The repetition words, such as “Father”, put an emphasis on the meaning of Father in the piece. The title “Father” serves the use of ambiguity, because one may interpret different meaning from the word. The poem itself is ambiguous, because it has its literal meaning and religious meaning. Blake incorporated symbolism in line 9 “And away the vapour flew”, “vapour” symbolise the “Father” from the beginning of the poem.|$|R

The teachers give the pupils <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> develop their <b>reading</b> ability by revealing different reading strategies, but the lack of motivation in the pupils is an obstacle to their development...|$|R
2500|$|John Houston {{arrived in}} Fort George {{in the fall}} of 1909 and bought {{property}} in South Fort George and began the Fort George Tribune. The first edition was published on November 6, 1909. Unfortunately, other than land claims notices there was little local news for his paper to report. In 1909, South Fort George was a First Nations village, a sawmill and a Hudson's Bay Store. Less than a dozen new residents lived in the infant town-site in tent shacks. [...] The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, John's favorite villain, was still far away: not even across the Alberta/BC border on the eastern end of construction, and the construction from the western end at Prince Rupert had just begun. John's South Fort George articles were often humorous and included notices as to whose cow recently had a calf and what he'd had to pay for eggs that week. He commented in one article about how his socks often froze to the floor while he sat at his printing press and worked on the newspaper. Nevertheless, whether there was little news to report or not, John was a busy man from November 1909 to March 1910. He responded to approximately 300 letters a month, written mostly by parties interested in purchasing land in the area, and he was working on formulating a platform for the Liberal Party. In March 1910, the work and excessively cold caught up with him and John contracted pneumonia and was pulled on a toboggan down the Blackwater Trail to the Quesnel hospital by his friend and fellow pioneer settler, William J Cooke. John died on March 8 at the hospital in Quesnel, but not before he got <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> his own obituary, one printed in error by the Vancouver Province. His nurse, knowing his sense of humor, showed him the article, and he supposedly joked that he respected the paper and that they didn't need to make a correction because he was planning on making good on their story. John was laid to rest in Nelson, where there is a memorial in his honor.|$|E

40|$|The writer' is a {{restorative}} story written {{years back}} in the melancholy of wanting significantly more published work in a market increasingly competitive, if not cutthroat, and driven by commercialism. Publishing houses such as Penguin or HarperCollins respond only to successful applicants, are closed to unsolicited manuscripts or consider only material submitted by a literary agent. The predicament of the new writer is such that a mass produced rejection slip is preferable to no reply. Writing competitions may preface entry into print, but extortionists exploit the gullible writer with soaring entry fees for middling prizes like free publication in an online journal few people ever read. However, winning or being shortlisted in international competitions-such as the Bridport Prize, Commonwealth Writers Prize, Writers Bureau Competition, or even the Australasian Association of Writing Programs' 'Chapter One' (2014) -offers some financial rewards or creditable publication. It also marks literary accomplishment and may grant <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> be <b>read</b> by leading literary agents {{with a view to}} representation.

In Cambridge I see Arthur Sedgwick and Howells; but little {{of any one}} else. Arthur seems not perhaps an enthusiastic, but a well-occupied man, and talks much in a wholesome way of meaning to go abroad. Howells edits, and observes and produces--the latter in his own particular line {{with more and more}} perfection. His recent sketches in the Atlantic, collected into a volume, belong, I think, by the wondrous cunning of their manner, to very good literature. He seems to have resolved himself, however, [into] one who can write solely of what his fleshly eyes have seen; and for this reason I wish he were [...] "located" [...] where they would rest upon richer and fairer things than this immediate landscape. Looking about for myself, I conclude that the face of nature and civilization in this our country is to a certain point a very sufficient literary field.

6000|$|It {{would be}} worth the while to select our reading, for books are the society we keep; to read only the serenely true; never statistics, nor fiction, nor news, nor reports, nor periodicals, but only great poems, and when they failed, read them again, or perchance write more. Instead of other sacrifice, we might offer up our perfect (<telei'a>) {{thoughts}} to the gods daily, in hymns or psalms. For we {{should be at the}} helm at least once a day. The whole of the day should not be daytime; there should be one hour, if no more, which the day did not bring forth. Scholars are wont to sell their birthright for a mess of learning. But is it necessary to know what the speculator prints, or the thoughtless study, or the idle read, the literature of the Russians and the Chinese, or even French philosophy and much of German criticism.

[...] Certainly, we {{do not need to be}} soothed and entertained always like children. He who resorts to the easy novel, because he is languid, does no better than if he took a nap. The front aspect of great thoughts can only be enjoyed by those who stand on the side whence they arrive. Books, not which afford us a cowering enjoyment, but in which each thought is of unusual daring; such as an idle man cannot read, and a timid one would not be entertained by, which even make us dangerous to existing institutions,--such call I good books.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Reading aloud {{can give}} pupils <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> {{experience}} what <b>reading</b> involves {{and an opportunity}} to discover new worlds. The aim of the study is to arrive at an understanding of the possibilities for conversation and activities that can be provided by teachers’ work with reading literature aloud in the classroom in grade 3. We proceed from questions about how the teaching of reading is organized and how the teachers talk to the pupils about the text. To achieve the aim and answer the questions, two observations were conducted. The study uses the concepts of sequential reading elements and text movability as analytical tools. The result shows that work is mainly done before and after the reading aloud. This takes the form of involving the pupils in predicting what will happen in the plot, discussing, and working with written assignments. The teachers give the pupils <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> talk about new words, to sum up the contents, <b>to</b> <b>read</b> between the lines and discuss the author’s intention with the text. Our study shows that the way two teachers organize reading aloud gives pupils opportunities in different ways to discuss and work with literary texts...|$|R

In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on. Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included. In July 2009, Marvel announced that Natalie Portman would portray Jane Foster. Jaimie Alexander and Colm Feore were reported to have joined the cast in September, with Alexander portraying Sif and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain. In an interview with Swedish news site Ystads Allehanda, Stellan Skarsgård stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role. By late October Anthony Hopkins had been cast as Odin in the film.

Security for the data is required, as there is always <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> for someone <b>to</b> <b>read</b> those secret data. The security is implemented by using steganography. Steganography is the good art of hiding information in ways so as to prevent detection of hidden messages. This paper designs software which tries to alter the originality of the data files into encrypted form using Tiny Encryption Algorithm. This Algorithm is to be designed for simplicity and better performance. In an encryption scheme, information is encrypted using tiny encryption algorithm that changes it into an unreadable cipher text. After encryption, the encrypted data is embed in a video by using the concept of steganography and then this video file sent via email.
