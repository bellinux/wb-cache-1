5|$|When the LM voted {{narrowly}} in May 1976 {{to rejoin}} the Liberals (222 to 211), Millhouse immediately created the New LM, and became its only parliamentary representative. He tried to put an optimistic view on the matter, saying that the close-run vote as <b>an</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> his position, and the merger {{as an opportunity to}} start with a clean slate with no debt. The merger was finalised on 4 June when the Liberals' State Council voted heavily in favour.|$|E
5|$|After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula {{replaced}} him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; {{according to the}} South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed {{by one of the}} whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would also write <b>an</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the proclamation.|$|E

5|$|Aside from non-military {{problems}} facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought that military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than <b>an</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening to undercut the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.|$|E
5|$|Christians {{had always}} been subject to local discrimination, but early {{emperors}} were either reluctant to issue general laws against them or, {{at least in the}} 3rd century (see Crisis of the Third Century), too caught up with more immediate issues to do so. It was not until the 250s, under the reigns of Decius and Valerian, that such laws were passed. Under this legislation, Christians were compelled to sacrifice to Roman gods or face imprisonment and execution. When Gallienus acceded in 260, he issued the first imperial edict regarding tolerance toward Christians, leading to nearly 40 years of peaceful coexistence. Diocletian's accession in 284 did not mark an immediate reversal of disregard to Christianity, but it did herald a gradual shift in official attitudes toward religious minorities. In the first 15 years of his rule, Diocletian purged the army of Christians, condemned Manicheans to death, and surrounded himself with public opponents of Christianity. Diocletian's preference for autocratic government, combined with his self-image as a restorer of past Roman glory, presaged the most pervasive persecution in Roman history. In the winter of 302, Galerius urged Diocletian to begin a general persecution of the Christians. Diocletian was wary, and asked the oracle of Apollo for guidance. The oracle's reply was read as <b>an</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> Galerius's position, and a general persecution was called on February 24, 303.|$|E

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{research has shown that}} individuals who show <b>a</b> greater <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> benevolently sexist beliefs are more likely to blame acquaintance rape victims in comparison to stranger rape victims (Abrams et al., 2003). Two studies investigating the role of benevolent sexism (BS) in accounting for participants 2 ̆ 7 responses to acquaintance vs. stranger rape perpetrators were conducted. Participants were presented with vignettes describing either an acquaintance rape or a stranger rape. As predicted, participants who showed <b>a</b> greater <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> benevolently sexist beliefs attributed less blame (Study 1) and recommended shorter sentences (Study 2) for the acquaintance rape perpetrator than participants with <b>a</b> lesser <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> benevolently sexist beliefs. Benevolent sexism was unrelated to reactions to the perpetrator in the stranger rape condition. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{his support}} of the Federal Marriage Amendment, the group {{declined}} to endorse the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004.

In 2000, she authored the opinion in Kasler v.

25|$|Robert Skidelsky offered <b>an</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> Corbyn's {{proposals}} {{to carry out}} QE through a National Investment Bank with minor quibbles. As the policy would change the central bank's focus on stabilising prices, however, {{it has been argued}} it would increase the perceived risk of investing in the UK and raise the prospect of increased inflation. It might also clash with Article 123 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty which prevents central banks from printing money to finance government spending and could cause a legal battle with the European Court of Justice, although {{it has been argued that}} money wouldn't be printed and would be issued in the form of bonds.|$|E
25|$|Elections held in 2014 saw highest voters {{turnout in}} 26 {{years of history}} in Jammu and Kashmir. However, analysts explain that the high voter turnout in Kashmir is not <b>an</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> Indian rule by the Kashmiri population, rather most people vote for daily issues such as food and electricity. An opinion poll {{conducted}} by the Chatham House international affairs think tank found that in the Kashmir valley – the mainly Muslim area in Indian Kashmir at {{the centre of the}} insurgency – support for independence varies between 74% to 95% in its various districts. Support for remaining with India was, however, extremely high in predominantly Hindu Jammu and Buddhist Ladakh.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{perceptions}} arise from Wagner's published opinions {{on a number}} of topics. Wagner was a voluminous writer and published essays and pamphlets {{on a wide range of}} subjects throughout his life. Wagner's writing style is verbose, unclear and turgid, which has greatly added to the confusion about his opinions. Several of his writings have achieved some notoriety, in particular his essay Das Judenthum in der Musik, (Jewishness in Music), a critical view on the influence of Jews in German culture and society at that time. The essays he wrote in his final years were also controversial, with many readers perceiving them to employ <b>an</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> racist beliefs. Some commentators also believe that some of Wagner's operas contain adverse caricatures of Jews.|$|E

25|$|Public {{institutions}} in the U.S. have also drawn fire for accommodating Islam {{at the expense of}} taxpayers. The University of Michigan–Dearborn and a public college in Minnesota have been criticized for accommodating Islamic prayer rituals by constructing footbaths for Muslim students using tax-payers' money. Critics said this special accommodation, which is made to satisfy the needs of Muslims alone, is a violation of Constitutional provisions separating church and state. Along the same constitutional lines, a San Diego public elementary school is being criticized for making special accommodations, specifically for American Muslims, by adding Arabic to its curriculum and giving breaks for Muslim prayers. Some critics said exceptions have not been made for any religious group in the past, and they see this as <b>an</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> Islam.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the election, Google {{changed their}} logo on the Turkish version of the search engine to {{represent}} the election. The second 'g' in 'Google' was changed to a ballot box with a Turkish flag, with a ballot being cast. The doodle generated controversy since the ballot was shown to have three options with the final option ticked. The format of the doodle had been used before to represent the 2014 European Parliament election, but generated criticism since the presidential election actually had three candidates. Since Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu was the third candidate on the actual ballot paper, the doodle was seen by some as <b>an</b> <b>endorsement</b> <b>of</b> İhsanoğlu. However, Republican People's Party (CHP) politicians also criticised the doodle since it could also be interpreted as an endorsement for Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in that the doodle's ballot paper turned landscape (similar to the actual ballot paper) actually shows a vote for Erdoğan in the first row.|$|E

Fielding refuted this assertion in the 1 August issue of the Journal, while labelling prostitutes a source of social evils.|$|E
