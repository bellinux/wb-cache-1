5|$|Many Gobioolithus minor {{specimens}} contain embryonic {{remains of}} the enantiornithine genus Gobipipus. The embryos have well-ossified skeletons, implying that they were at a late stage in development when they died. Their wings and shoulders are especially well-developed.

5|$|Although French is an {{official}} language {{for the purposes}} of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be {{an official}} language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide <b>a</b> <b>comparable</b> level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.|$|E
5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came to a complete standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at <b>a</b> <b>comparable</b> scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{characterize}} the morphology of a globular cluster {{by means of}} standard radii. These are the core radius (r'c), the half-light radius (r'h), and the tidal (or Jacobi) radius (r't). The overall luminosity of the cluster steadily decreases with distance from the core, and the core radius is the distance at which the apparent surface luminosity has dropped by half. <b>A</b> <b>comparable</b> quantity is the half-light radius, or {{the distance from the}} core within which half the total luminosity from the cluster is received.

5|$|Coronations {{are still}} {{observed}} in the United Kingdom, Tonga, and several Asian and African countries.

Besides a coronation, a monarch's accession may be marked in many ways: some nations may retain a religious dimension to their accession rituals while others have adopted simpler inauguration ceremonies, or even no ceremony at all. Some cultures use bathing or cleansing rites, the drinking of a sacred beverage, or other religious practices to achieve <b>a</b> <b>comparable</b> effect. Such acts symbolise the granting of divine favour to the monarch within the relevant spiritual-religious paradigm of the country.|$|E
