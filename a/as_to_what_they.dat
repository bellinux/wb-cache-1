25|$|In 2005, Oliver {{embarked}} {{upon his}} school dinners campaign {{to improve the}} quality of food fed to pupils in schools. While the campaign was arguably successful, at the time it was a controversial shake-up for students and parents, some of whom believed that the students should have a healthy option available, but still be given the choice <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want to eat.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{controversial}} nature, {{different countries}} vary {{in the discussion}} of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement. In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator (OFCOM) updated its code stating that freedom of expression {{is at the heart of}} any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a fully informed choice for themselves, should be protected. Hence a watershed and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people. Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.|$|E
500|$|Although the museum's {{motto is}} [...] "Art too bad to be ignored", MOBA holds {{rigorous}} standards <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will accept. According to Marie Jackson, [...] "Nine {{out of ten}} pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards." [...] As stated {{in the introduction to}} The Museum of Bad Art: Masterworks, the primary attribute of an objet d'art to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should [...] " [...] in a compelling image", or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an [...] "Oh my God" [...] quality.|$|E

500|$|While at New England, Madgwick {{continued}} his {{strong support for}} adult education (AE). The main differences between AE and external studies were that AE focused on classroom courses and the classes were not usually part of a degree program. In 1948, Madgwick secured a government grant to expand the school's adult education program. In June of that year, Arnold Walter Eberle was appointed adult education officer for the college, a position he held {{until his death in}} 1954. Eberle, with Madgwick's support, selected courses based on feedback from the local populace <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted to study, rather than adhering to the University of Sydney's established curriculum. The program, the first adult program based outside of Australia's capital cities, focused on functional, practical courses rather than formal, abstract, and theoretical instruction. As a result, [...] "effective" [...] enrolments (students who completed the class) in 1948 for New England adult courses were 88.8% compared with 66% for metropolitan Sydney adult classes. By 1949, 4% {{of the population of the}} New England area had attended one of the college's classes.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for its depth. IGN's Doug Perry called GoldenEye 007 an immersive game which [...] "blends smart strategy gameplay with fast-action gunmanship". Similarly, Greg Sewart of Gaming Age {{remarked that}} players have [...] "a bit of freedom <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{want to do}} in any given situation, and what order the directives are completed in". Reviewers also enjoyed the wide variety of weapons and the multi-objective-based missions, stating that they make the game stay [...] "fresh by never having you do the same thing twice". The controls were praised for being more intuitive than Acclaim's earlier well-received Nintendo 64 first-person shooter [...] Game Revolution credited the gameplay for being realistic and different from other shooters, but also criticised the campaign for being badly paced. The publication noted that GoldenEye 007 [...] "takes it for granted that you have already seen the movie" [...] and that players may get stuck due to the game's lack of orientation. At the time, the multiplayer mode was considered the best multiplayer game on the system, [...] "edging Mario Kart 64 by a hair" [...] according to IGN. Edge called it addictive and praised the originality of some of the scenarios such as You Only Live Twice.|$|E
500|$|The {{opposition}} has, {{from the}} introduction of the NCMP scheme, decried it as a [...] "sham" [...] and a [...] "toothless" [...] office. Opposition member J. B. Jeyaratnam questioned whether it was [...] "a trick or a ploy" [...] by the ruling party to maintain its dominance in Parliament. It has been argued that the system has placed the opposition at a disadvantage at general elections for a number of reasons. For one, there are restrictions on NCMPs <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can or cannot vote on in Parliament. Thus, {{it has been suggested that}} the presence of NCMPs in Parliament [...] "does not seem to extend beyond the decorative and the provision of debating foils for the younger PAP generation unexposed to the gladiatorial quality of parliamentary debate". Moreover, the effectiveness of the NCMP scheme is limited by the perception that the NCMP is obliged to be adversarial by virtue of being party to the opposition. This is so even if privately the Member can apprehend the benefits of a Government proposal. Finally, the NCMP scheme has been criticized as a ploy to discourage voters from voting in opposition MPs because of the guarantee of at least a number of NCMP seats. This inhibits the natural growth of an elected opposition voice in Parliament as the electorate's motivation to vote in an opposition Member into Parliament is conceivably diluted by the assurance that a default mechanism exists for the [...] "best losers".|$|E

500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared {{that he would not be}} able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would do with parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it." ...|$|E
500|$|Revie {{was made}} player-manager at Leeds United in March 1961 {{following}} {{the resignation of}} Jack Taylor, who left after Leeds found themselves struggling in the Second Division. He had initially applied for the vacant job at Bournemouth, but Bournemouth were unable to find the £6,000 Leeds demanded, and the Leeds directors decided to instead appoint Revie as manager. At the time the club was in debt and was located in a rugby league territory, with very little football tradition. Less than 7,000 turned out for the final home game of the 1960–61 season whilst Leeds's championship game of the 1960–61 Rugby League season had an attendance of over 50,000. He immediately began to institute radical changes such as ensuring the players stayed at higher quality hotels. He instilled a [...] "family atmosphere" [...] at Elland Road, making sure to {{take an interest in}} the lives of everyone at the club from the cleaning staff to the star players and ensuring there were no [...] "big egos" [...] at the club. He showed trust in his players, leaving them mainly to their own devices though he always made sure he was fully informed <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were up to off the pitch, even {{going so far as to}} tell them to dump their girlfriends if he viewed them as unsuitable. He also introduced lengthy dossiers on opposing teams to ensure his players knew every detail about the opposition and were able to exploit weaknesses and nullify threats. Other changes were based on some of his many superstitions, such as his belief that birds were bad luck which resulted in him getting rid of the owl on the club badge and the discontinuation of the Peacocks nickname in favour of the Whites.|$|E

Schwebel also observes {{that there is no}} authentic photo of the solar phenomena claimed, [...] "despite the presence of hundreds of reporters and photographers at the field" [...] and one photo often presented as authentic is actually [...] "a solar eclipse {{in another part of the}} world taken sometime before 1917".|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature and}} purpose of the symbols is a mystery. Although {{attempts}} have been made to interpret the symbols, there is no agreement <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> might mean. At first it was thought that the symbols were simple property marks, meaning [...] "this belongs to X". A prominent holder of this view is archaeologist Peter Biehl. This theory is now mostly abandoned, as the same symbols have been repeatedly found throughout the territory of the Vinča culture, in locations hundreds of kilometers and years away from each other. The prevailing theory is that the symbols were used for religious purposes in a traditional agricultural society. If so, the fact that the same symbols were used for centuries with little change suggests that the ritual meaning and culture represented by the symbols likewise remained constant for a very long time, with no need for further development. The use of the symbols appears to have been abandoned (along with the objects on which they appear) at the start of the Bronze Age, suggesting that the new technology brought with it significant changes in social organization and beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|For their part, the British {{wanted the}} McMahon Act's {{restrictions}} on nuclear cooperation to be relaxed. They {{wanted to know}} the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British V-bombers, and American warheads to be fitted to British Blue Streak missiles. This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium. While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted to provide. The United States Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, was concerned that a Special Relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies. Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire. Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were [...] "interdependent", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.|$|E
2500|$|Two days later, Emperor Wenzong {{summoned the}} senior officials, {{including}} {{the heads of}} the various key agencies of the imperial government, to inquire them <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> opined. [...] A number of advisory officials, including Cui Xuanliang (崔玄亮), Li Guyan, Wang Zhi (王質), Lu Jun (盧均), Shu Yuanbao (舒元褒), Jiang Xi (蔣係), Pei Xiu (裴休), and Wei Wen (韋溫), begged Emperor Wenzong to reopen the discussions with chancellors and move the entire investigations to the proper governmental authorities. [...] Emperor Wenzong told them that he had already discussed with the high level officials and ordered them to withdraw. [...] Cui bowed and wept, stating, [...] "One should be careful even when executing a commoner, and even more care should be paid when killing a chancellor." [...] Emperor Wenzong's anger somewhat subsided, and he summoned the chancellors again. [...] Niu then stated, [...] "The highest that a subject can reach is chancellor, and Song Shenxi is already a chancellor. [...] If the accusations were true, he could still only be chancellor, and why would he pursue that? [...] Surely that was not what he was planning." [...] Meanwhile, Zheng, fearing that the officials would win out and that a second round of investigations would show the truth, suggested to Wang Shoucheng that no executions be carried out, and instead Song should be exiled.|$|E
