5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E

40|$|The {{transformation}} of the austenite to the martensite provides the transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect which {{can contribute to the}} high work hardening rate and the good mechanical properties of 3 rd advanced high strength steels (AHSS). The high strength offered by AHSS can result in thinner components while providing the same or higher safety standard, leading to a lighter vehicle. The present thesis is aimed to study the stability of the individual metastable <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> in AHSSs. Firstly, it is studied by the nanoindentation technique. Several pop-ins are found in the corresponding load-displacement curves. The first pop-in is induced by the nucleation of dislocations. The second pop-in is due to the martensitic transformation. Therefore, the load at the second pop-in is the critical load to trigger the {{transformation of}} metastable austenite to martensite. The critical load increases with the increase of Mn content of the individual <b>austenite</b> <b>grains.</b> Different to the well-known factors affecting the stability of retained <b>austenite</b> <b>grains,</b> such as the <b>austenite</b> chemical concentration, <b>grain</b> size and morphology, the present thesis investigates the effect of free surface by using the focused ion beam (FIB) milling. It is found that the retained <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> transform to martensite automatically once a free surface is introduced in the retained <b>austenite</b> <b>grains.</b> This is ascribed to the reduction of the martensite nucleation energy barrier by introducing a new free surface. The present thesis demonstrates the importance of mechanical stability of <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> on the tensile properties of a medium Mn steel. It is found that the tailored mechanical stability of <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> is optimal for the tensile properties. The <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> with different grain size and C content are produced in a single steel. The large <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> with low C content have a lower mechanical stability, which transform to martensite and provide TRIP effect at small strain. The <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> with high C content have higher mechanical stability so that they do not transform to martensite but provide twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) effect in the medium strain regime till fracture. Some of the twinned <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> provide the martensite nucleation site and offer TRIP effect in the large strain regime up to fracture. Since fine ferritic phases are the intrinsic components in the 3 rd AHSS, the present thesis investigates their mechanical behavior by the nanoindentation technique. The lath martensite has the higher nanohardness than bainite and ferrite due to its high pre-existing dislocation density, high carbon content and carbide precipitation. The investigation on the as quenched lath martensite reveals that the small martensite block has a higher nanohardness than the large martensite block. Therefore, the as-quenched martensite may be considered as a composite material with the small but strong martensite blocks embedded in the large but soft martensite blocks, which provides an important information for the micromechanical modelling of martensitic steel. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Diffraction patterns were collected using a large 2 D detector as function of the position along the load axis as well as perpendicular to the load axis of hourglass-shaped ultrasonic fatigue specimens. Intensities, angular positions and widths of Bragg reflections from individual grains were studied as a function of load cycles and stress amplitudes. Whereas rocking curves (RC) of ferrite grains behave nearly unaffected by the cyclic load, a splitting of RCs of <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> was observed and is taken as an indication for the VHCF damage. The frequency of split RCs of <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> increases with the number of load cycles and is found to be a function of the local stress amplitude.

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} {{consolidated}} in this thesis is to understand the mechanics in steels using microscopy. In particular, the mechanical response of Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steels is correlated with their microstructures. Chapter 1 introduces {{the current state of}} the art of TRIP steels, highlighting the importance of microstructure - mechanical properties - applications relationships. In Chapter 2 the material properties and material processing are described into more detail, and an overview is presented of the characterization techniques used in this thesis. For the purpose of understanding the structure-property relationships, two TRIP steels (Al alloyed TRIP 700 and Si alloyed TRIP 800) and one TRIP assisted Multi Phase or TAMP (Nb microalloyed TAMP 800) steel were investigated in this study. The numbers (700, 800) designate the ultimate tensile strength of the materials. Despite the fact that steels are amongst the most extensively investigated materials, many features of the austenite-martensite transformation process during deformation remain unclarified to date. Deformation induced transformation behavior of retained <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> is assessed in Chapter 3 with the help of Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) techniques. The transformation tendency of retained <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> at the surface and inside the bulk as a result of uni-axial tension was investigated on TRIP 800 steel sheets. The experiments showed that the retained <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> at the surface have a stronger tendency to transform than the retained <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> in the bulk of the material. Local defects, such as twins, lower the stability of <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> and thus transform at the earlier stages of the deformation process. <b>Austenite</b> <b>grains</b> positioned at grain boundaries between multiple ferrite grains were amongst the first to transform, whereas <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> that are completely embedded in larger ferrite grains were often found to undergo rotations. These differences in strain-induced behavior are likely associated with different stress states and grain rotation capabilities of the <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> upon deformation. The rotation angles of embedded <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> were found to depend on the crystallographic orientation of the grains with respect to the straining direction. A lowering of Schmid factors of embedded <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> is seen to be the reason for the delayed transformation of these grains during the deformation process. The current findings suggest that grain rotation is an additional mechanism contributing to the high ductility of these steels and may be as important as the contribution of the austenite–martensite transformation. Furthermore, EBSD experiments were carried out on TRIP 700 steels which confirmed that the grain rotation behavior is consistent in both TRIP steels. In addition to the austenite-to-martensite phase transformation, the role of alloying elements such as C, Mn, Si, and Al, and their effect on transformations during deformation, are poorly understood and there is an increasing need to gain fundamental insight into this topic. Consequently, in Chapter 4, a combination of Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) and high-sensitivity Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) was used to correlate the changes in microstructural features of metastable <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> upon deformation along with their respective local chemical compositions in TRIP 700 and TRIP 800 steels. In contrast to current metallurgical beliefs, we found direct evidence that <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> with higher Mn content transformed earlier than the grains with lower Mn contents. Various microstructural factors such as the local carbon concentrations, grain size, morphology, crystal lattice orientation in relation to strain direction, location of the grain in relation to its surrounding grains, and the presence of local defects (twins) were investigated. Analysis performed on several twinned <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> showed higher enrichment of Mn contents and an early transformation during deformation. At a very local scale, the <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> with high Mn contents have an inhomogeneous Mn distribution which can result in local strain acting as a trigger for early transformation. The local variation in manganese content therefore allows for an overall gradual transformation of the retained <b>austenite</b> <b>grains,</b> providing another tunable parameter for deformation induced austenite-to-martensite transformation. Multiphase steels designed with composite strengthening may be further strengthened by grain refinement or precipitation by the addition of microalloying elements. In Chapter 5 we have therefore investigated microstructures and precipitates in a Nb microalloyed TRIP assissted multiphase (TAMP) steel containing ferrite, bainite, martensite and retained austenite. Precipitates were observed in the ferrite, martensite and bainite phases, but not in the austenite phase. Two kinds of precipitates were found in this steel: NbC and novel (Nb,Ti) N phases. The (Nb,Ti) N precipitates were found in different sizes, ranging from 10 - 150 nm, whereby the larger precipitates have a Ti/Nb atomic ratio of approximately 2. 83 - 0. 81 and were faceted in shape. Smaller NbC precipitates were found in a size range of 5 - 20 nm. The (Nb,Ti) N precipitates have a well-defined Nishiyama Wasserman (N-W) orientation relationship with the ferrite matrix, while the NbC precipitates have random orientations. Both NbC and (Nb,Ti) N carbide precipitates are expected to take part in strengthening of these steels. The comparison of calculated lattice parameters and experimental lattice parameters indicates that both precipitates are deficient in carbon and nitrogen contents. In Chapter 6 the investigations on nano-sized precipitates in Al alloyed TRIP 700 steel with Ti micro additions are described. Two types of Ti(N) precipitates were observed with cubic and faceted morphologies. The faceted precipitates were found in a size range of 40 - 70 nm and the cubic precipitates in a size range of 70 - 120 nm. The cubic precipitates had higher nitrogen concentrations and exhibited slightly larger lattice parameters than the faceted TiN precipitates. Additionally, spherical shaped Ti 2 CS precipitates were found with sizes ranging from 20 to 100 nm. Both the cubic and faceted Ti(N) precipitates and Ti 2 CS precipitates were found in random orientations with respect to the ferrite matrix. A novel iron carbide precipitate was observed in all ferrite grains. These Fe(C) precipitates have sizes ranging from 2 to 5 nm and exhibited disc-shaped morphologies. All the Fe(C) precipitates showed a well-defined Pitsch Schrader (P-S) orientation relationship with the ferrite matrix. From the precipitate size, inter-particle spacing, and lattice misfit calculations, the newly observed Fe(C) precipitates are considered to possess significant potential in enhancing the strength of these steels. Electron microscopy experiments were also carried out on Si alloyed TRIP 800 steels which confirmed that ultrafine Fe(C) precipitates exist in both TRIP counterparts. The elements Chromium (Cr) and Manganese (Mn) are well known in technologically important iron and steel alloys. In Chapter 7 it is revealed for the first time that Cr and Mn have combined to form two novel ternary carbides. These novel ternary carbide phases were identified in TRIP-assisted multi phase (TAMP) steel. The carbides were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Electron diffraction analysis revealed that the Orthorhombic carbide has lattice parameters a = 5. 09 Å, b = 6. 98 Å, and c = 4. 55 Å, with a Pnma space group, while the Monoclinic carbide has lattice parameters a = 6. 83 Å, b = 4. 54 Å, c = 5. 00 Å, and ? = 92. 2 ° with a P 21 /c space group. Excellent agreement was found between calculation and experiment on the lattice parameters and relative atomic positions. Remarkable Mn-Cr alloying leads to these ternary phases having high thermodynamic stabilities. The calculations have shown that introduction of carbon atoms strongly induce magnetism within these structures and that these carbides are stable also at higher pressures.

The pile-up of GND at the <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> boundary may increase the potency of martensite embryo by facilitating its plastic initiation, resulting in an increase of Ms temperature after small deformation. The formation of subgrains in <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> interior inhibits the propagation of the martensite glissile interface, leading to a decrease of Ms temperature after large deformation...|$|E
40|$|The prior <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> size (PAGS) exerts an {{important}} {{influence on the}} microstructures forged by continuous cooling in the steel and on their mechanical properties. Since microalloyed steels have received considerable attention {{in the last years}} and enormous difficulties have been repetitively to reveal the <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries in these steels, this work analyzes the different techniques effective in that sense, which enable thus an accurate determination of the PAGS. This paper presents results obtained applying different conventional techniques such us chemical etching of quenched microstructures, the application of thermal cycles that enable the formation of phases around the prior <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries or oxidation etching which reveals the <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries by the preferential accumulation of oxides. Finally, an innovative and effective technique to reveal the prior <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries is presented. This technique is based on the preferential transfer of matter from the grain boundaries to the surrounding austenite by complicated mechanisms such as evaporation-condensation and volume and surface diffusion of atoms.

40|$|The {{combined}} thermodynamic-micromechanical {{model of}} Fischer [1] {{is applied to}} a low-alloyed TRIP steel with,a volume fraction of 16 % of retained austenite. The model is implemented in a finite element code. The mesh consists of 9 by 9 by 9 cubical elements, each representing a single grain with a random crystallographic orientation. The retained <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> are randomly dispersed through the entire mesh. The extent of the martensitic transformation in all <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> is calculated. A large spread in transformation rate is observed. The most favourably oriented grains reach a full martensitic structure, while the martensite volume fraction of less favourably oriented grains is less than 50 %. When the chemical driving force is more negative, {{the onset of the}} transformation is delayed and the increase of the martensite volume fraction is slower. The calculated results are compared with experimentally obtained values. Although in general a reasonable agreement is found, Fischer's approach leads to some discrepancies with experimental observations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{martensitic}} transformation behaviour of the metastable austenite {{phase in}} low-alloyed transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steels {{has been studied}} in situ using high-energy X-ray diffraction during deformation. The austenite stability during tensile deformation has been evaluated at different length scales. A powder diffraction analysis has been performed to correlate the macroscopic behaviour of the material to the observed changes in the volume phase fraction. Moreover, the austenite deformation response has been studied at the length scale of individual grains, where an in-depth characterization of four selected grains has been performed, including grain volume, local carbon concentration and grain orientation. For the first time, a high-resolution far-field detector was used to study the initial and evolving structure of individual <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> during uniaxial tensile deformation. It {{was found that the}} austenite subgrain size does not change significantly during tensile deformation. Most <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> show a complete martensitic transformation in a single loading step. Delft University of Technolog...|$|R

Experimental {{results showed that}} the transformation of super bainite was accelerated by a coarse <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> size. This is because while coarse austenite grains provide less nucleation sites, it is beneficial for bainite sheaf growth. Meanwhile, there is a critical <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> size below which there is a distinct grain size effect and above which it is not evident. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

40|$|Hot torsion {{testing of}} a C–Mn–V steel {{was used to}} study the {{evolution}} of  ultrafine ferrite (UFF) formation by dynamic strain-induced transformation (DSIT) in conjunction with air-cooling for two prior <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> sizes. This study evaluated not only the evolution of DSIT ferrite during straining, but also the grain growth behaviour of DSIT ferrite grains during post-deformation cooling. For both <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> sizes, the DSIT ferrite initially nucleated on/or near prior <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries {{at an early stage}} of transformation followed by the grain interiors. The prior <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> size affected the distribution of DSIT ferrite nucleation sites at an early stage of transformation and the subsequent coarsening behaviour of the grain boundary (GB) and the intragranular ferrite (IG) grains during post-deformation cooling. For the fine prior <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> size, the distribution of DSIT ferrite grains was more homogenous compared with the coarse austenite and the coarsening occurred not only in the GB ferrite grains but also in the IG ferrite grains. However, the ferrite coarsening mostly occurred for the IG ferrite rather than the GB ferrite grains in the coarse austenite. The result suggests that normal grain growth occurred during the overall transformation in the GB ferrite grains for the coarse initial <b>austenite</b> <b>grain</b> size. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus added TRIP steels were {{subjected}} to Electron BackScattering Diffraction (EBSD) measurements in order to study {{the texture of the}} three different phases and in order to evaluate the orientation relations that are active during the transformation of austenite to bainite. The retained austenite had a maximum intensity on the Brass component and the intensity gradually decreased along the alpha and the beta fibre. The intensity of both BCC phases was comparable, but the bainite texture displayed clear transformation products that could be related with the dominant Brass component of the intercritical austenite. A detailed evaluation of the crystallographic orientation relationships between about 360 retained <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> and their BCC neighbours was performed. Three relationships were considered, namely Kurdjumov-Sachs, Nishiyama-Wassermann and Pitsch. It was found {{that the majority of the}} <b>austenite</b> <b>grains</b> had at least one neighbour that could be related with one of the three orientation relationships. The Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship appeared to be dominant and no strong indication for variant selection could be retrieved from the studied data...|$|R
