25|$|The {{idea for}} the series was {{conceived}} as Marc Cherry and his mother were watching a news report on Andrea Yates. Prior to Desperate Housewives, Cherry was best known for producing and writing episodes of Touchstone Television's hit comedy series The Golden Girls and its successor, The Golden Palace. In addition, he had created or co-created three sitcoms: The 5 Mrs. Buchanans, The Crew, <b>and</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Best Friends, none of which lasted longer than a year. Cherry had difficulty getting any television network interested in his new series; HBO, CBS, NBC, Fox, Showtime, and Lifetime all turned the show down. Finally, two new executives at ABC, Lloyd Braun and Susan Lyne, chose to greenlight it, reportedly after The O.C. on Fox premiered in 2003 and showed that a soap opera could succeed in prime time. Shortly thereafter, Disney had both Braun and Lyne fired, following their approval of another new drama series: Lost.|$|E
500|$|In early 1850, Dickinson {{wrote that}} [...] "Amherst is alive with fun this winter ... Oh, {{a very great}} town this is!" [...] Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died {{suddenly}} of [...] "brain congestion" [...] at age 25. Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:some {{of my friends are}} gone, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends are sleeping– sleeping the churchyard sleep– the hour of evening is sad– it was once my study hour– my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school alone, make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.|$|E
500|$|Extra Texture (Read All About It) was remastered for CD {{release in}} January 1992. The album was remastered again and reissued in September 2014, {{as both a}} {{separate}} release {{and as part of}} the Harrison box set The Apple Years 1968–75. The 2014 reissue includes a liner note essay by radio producer and author Kevin Howlett, and adds a new version of [...] "This Guitar", based on a demo that Harrison recorded in 1992 for Dave Stewart. Previously issued only as a digital download for the latter's Platinum Weird project, in 2006, the track features overdubs from Stewart, Harrison's son Dhani, Ringo Starr and singer Kara DioGuardi. Previewing the release on georgeharrison.com, Olivia Harrison spoke of the [...] "strong melodies and thought-provoking lyrics" [...] of many of the songs on Extra Texture, adding: [...] "They are moody and personal <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favourites." ...|$|E

500|$|Gaga {{created a}} pair of razor-blade sunglasses—which she {{believed}} portrayed tough female spirit—to wear in the video, explaining [...] "I wanted to design a pair {{for some of the}} toughest chicks <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> girlfriends ... they used to keep razor blades in the side of their mouths ... That tough female spirit is something that I want to project. It's meant to be, 'This is my shield, this is my weapon, this is my inner sense of fame, this is my monster.' Gaga also said that the video shows [...] "how the entertainment industry can, in a metaphorical way, simulate human trafficking - products being sold, the woman perceived as a commodity." [...] The white latex suits in the video were inspired by the wolf costume from the film Where the Wild Things Are. Gaga also wore designer Alexander McQueen's [...] high shoes and the famous [...] "Alien" [...] shoes.|$|E
500|$|Aquemini {{begins with}} the {{introductory}} track [...] "Hold On, Be Strong", which was written by session guitarist Donny Mathis and was originally a full song with verses, but the group preferred to only use the hook. André 3000 played a kalimba on the song after purchasing the instrument at a flea market, drawing inspiration from Earth, Wind & Fire. [...] "Return of the G" [...] addresses concerns from fans who felt that the group's style had changed too drastically since the release of Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, {{as well as those}} who make poor decisions in order to keep their street credibility. When discussing the lyrical content of the song, André 3000 explained, [...] "I was young and wilder <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fashion choices people didn't accept at the time. I started getting flak from some people, so they were like, 'Either he's gay or on drugs'... 'Return of the Gangsta' was trying to give them a sense of, 'Hey, I'm still a regular person.'" [...] "Rosa Parks" [...] contains blues-influenced guitar work and folksy harmonies that [...] "announce OutKast's distinctive style of Southern boogie. The groove goes into overdrive during a clapping, foot-stomping breakdown funkified by a fierce harmonica as the kick drum pounds incessantly." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Tatchell's {{personal}} website he states, [...] "My Guardian letter cited {{examples of}} youths in Papuan tribes <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends who, {{when they were}} under 16, had sex with adults (over 18s), but who do not feel they were harmed. I was not endorsing their viewpoint but merely stating {{that they had a}} different perspective from the mainstream opinion about inter-generational sex. They have every right for their perspective to be heard." [...] He also debunks various claims that his critics (such as the British National Party) made against him, such as his contributions to the Betrayal of Youth (BOY) book, published by Warren Middleton of the Paedophile Information Exchange, stating that: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{come right}} along <b>and</b> put <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> things on," [...] he said. [...] "Then, {{you are going}} with me to have breakfast at the hotel, {{and talk to the}} judge. I guess the women aren't going to have any use for us." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I have {{no use for}} beating {{round the}} bush," [...] he said. [...] "Dollars are getting scarce with me, <b>and,</b> like <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> neighbours, I had to sell out a draft of stock. The fact that I'm {{throwing}} them on the market now is significant." ...|$|R
6000|$|One hears strange {{stories of}} his saying <b>and</b> doings. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> [...] people were telling me to-day that {{he says it is}} to Austria that [...] he really owes his fall, and that he ought to have {{destroyed}} her [...] when he had her in his power.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{that need}} not be. My intendant Rodenard <b>and</b> <b>some</b> twenty <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{servants}} should be somewhere betwixt this and Paris. Let them be sought for monsieur, {{and let us}} pray God that they be still in Languedoc and {{may be found in}} time." ...|$|R

60|$|I was flattered {{as well as}} {{astonished}} by this attention. But Monsieur Vigo knew men, and he had given them time to turn around.

Monsieur Vigo was surprisingly calm.|$|E

60|$|Whilst he {{was singing}} his ballad, there had walked, or rather reeled, into the room, a gentleman in a {{military}} frock-coat and duck trousers of dubious hue, with whose name <b>and</b> person <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> readers are perhaps already acquainted.

60|$|I {{rang the}} bell at ten minutes past five. Billy was there. She greeted me with a little tremor of embarrassment, which sat oddly upon her, but which was not {{altogether}} unpleasing.

6000|$|... [At this time, and thenceforth, a great {{proportion}} <b>of</b> all <b>my</b> letters (including many {{which found}} their way into the newspapers) were not written by me but by my daughter; at first merely from her willingness to help in disposing of a mass of letters greater than I could get through without assistance, but afterwards because I thought the letters she wrote superior to mine, and more so in proportion to the difficulty and importance of the occasion. Even those which I wrote myself were generally much improved by her, as is also the case with all the more recent <b>of</b> <b>my</b> prepared speeches, <b>of</b> which, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> published writings, not a few passages, and those the most successful, were hers.] ...|$|R
