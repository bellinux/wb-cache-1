40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} the temporality aspect of verbs in the Western Dani Language (WDL) in Papua. The data were from Morfologi Bahasa Dani Barat, a research report by Purba, et al. (1994). The temporality was proved by the distributional method supplemented by permutation and deletion techniques. The findings show that WDL has nine verb forms. Those are ones with: 1) <b>a</b> singular <b>subject</b> for the present tense, 2) <b>a</b> singular <b>subject</b> for the recent past tense, 3) <b>a</b> singular <b>subject</b> for the remote past tense, 4) <b>a</b> singular <b>subject</b> for the future tense, 5) <b>a</b> plural <b>subject</b> for the present tense, 6) <b>a</b> plural <b>subject</b> for the recent past tense, 7) <b>a</b> plural <b>subject</b> for the remote past tense, 8) <b>a</b> plural <b>subject</b> for the future tense, and 9) the habitual present tense. Temporality verb forms are classified into two groups: eight verbs based on the time an event occurs and one verb of a habitual event. The nine verbs showing time are distinguished {{on the basis of}} singular and plural subjects...|$|R
5|$|Another related form of {{experiment}} is the double-task experiment, in which <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> must perform an extra task (such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables) while responding to linguistic stimuli; this kind {{of experiment}} {{has been used to}} investigate the use of working memory in language processing.|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue.

Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>subject’s</b> maximum {{voluntary}} contraction (MVC) is recorded {{and used to}} normalize both reference forces and results between subjects. During the test subjects are assisted in producing a reference force using various types of feedback (static weight or visual display of force generated). This is followed by an attempt of the subject to generate the reference force without assistance. The duration for both reference and matching tasks is usually four seconds. Results are taken as a mean value of force generated over a time interval set by the researcher. Time intervals are generally one second long and {{near the end of}} the attempt. Reference forces are typically set as a percentage of <b>a</b> <b>subject’s</b> MVC while error is typically reported as a percentage of <b>a</b> <b>subject’s</b> MVC.|$|R
