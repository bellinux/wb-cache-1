5|$|Article III has one section, {{confirming}} {{the principle of}} separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. Unlike the U.S. federal Constitution, the Virginia Constitution explicitly provides that no branch may exercise powers that properly belong to the others. Separation between the branches of government is also listed as a {{right of the people}} in §5 of <b>Article</b> <b>I.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Article</b> <b>I</b> {{contains}} the entire original Virginia Declaration of Rights from the 1776 Constitution. Several of the sections have been expanded to incorporate concepts from the United States Bill of Rights, {{including the right}} to due process, the prohibition against double jeopardy, and the right to bear arms. Like the Federal Constitution, the Virginia Bill of Rights, in §17, states that the listing of certain rights is not to be construed to exclude other rights held by the people.|$|E

5|$|Governor Lane {{kept the}} legal {{code of the}} {{dissolved}} provisional government, only immediately repealing the law authorizing the minting of the Beaver Coins, as this was incompatible with the United States Constitution (<b>Article</b> <b>I,</b> Section 8). The creation of the Washington Territory in 1854 removed the northern half of the Oregon Territory. Established on 14 February 1859, the state of Oregon was composed roughly the western half the territory, the remaining eastern section being added to the Washington Territory.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the legislators}} would become {{prominent}} figures during the territorial years of Oregon. At first {{the body was}} a small committee of nine people, but the group was altered when the Organic Laws of Oregon were revised in 1845 with the legislative branch of the Provisional Government becoming the Oregon House of Representatives {{with a minimum of}} 13 members. Once the government was dissolved in 1849, all the laws remained in effect, except for the one that authorized the minting of coins. Territorial Governor Joseph Lane nullified that law, because it was in conflict with <b>Article</b> <b>I,</b> Section 8 of the United States Constitution, giving Congress the sole right to coin money, thus ending production of the Beaver Coins.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 1789, New Jersey {{ratified}} {{eleven of}} the twelve amendments, rejecting Article II, which regulated Congressional pay raises. On December 19 and 22, respectively, Maryland and North Carolina ratified all twelve amendments. On January 19, 25, and 28, 1790, respectively, South Carolina, New Hampshire, and Delaware ratified the Bill, though New Hampshire rejected the amendment on Congressional pay raises, and Delaware rejected <b>Article</b> <b>I,</b> which regulated {{the size of the}} House. This brought the total of ratifying states to six of the required ten, but the process stalled in other states: Connecticut and Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify, while Massachusetts ratified most of the amendments, but failed to send official notice to the Secretary of State that it had done so.|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{selective}} review of Systems: New Paradigms for the Human Sciences, edited by Gabriel Altmann and Walter A. Koch (Berlin: Walter de Gryter, 1998). It is selective {{because it is}} impossible to engage such a varied collection of systems-theoretic essays in a review of reasonable length. To invoke a relevant dialectical idea: the characteristic strength of any system is often also its characteristic weakness. One strength and weakness of the systems field is its great diversity, and this diversity is reflected in this volume by the range of subjects addressed in its 27 <b>articles.</b> <b>I</b> will not attempt what the editors themselves have declined to undertake, namely an integrating overview, nor will I offer brief remarks on many <b>articles.</b> Instead, <b>I</b> want to comment in detail on just three articles which bear on my own interests. I do not mean to suggest that these articles are more valuable or central to systems theory than the others. After discussing the three <b>articles,</b> <b>I</b> will conclude by adding a few general remarks and by listing the authors and titles of the essays in the book, so that readers might be alerted to items of potential interest. From my study of the three <b>articles</b> <b>I</b> discuss and from my skimming of several other <b>articles,</b> <b>I</b> strongly recommend this book to system...|$|R

It {{is one of}} the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) is applied. In Europe it appears in 20 Important Bird Areas (IBAs), {{including}} Ireland, Svalbard, mainland Norway, Iceland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. It is also a listed species in 83 Special Protection Areas in the EU Natura 2000 network. The USDA National Forest Service has designated the common loon a species of special status, and in the upper Great Lake regions of the Huron-Manistee, Ottawa, and Hiawatha national forests as a regional forester sensitive species.|$|E
5|$|With little {{guidance}} on water allocation from the Supreme Court, {{proponents of the}} dam feared endless litigation. A Colorado attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river's basin (California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming) form an interstate compact, {{with the approval of}} Congress. Such compacts were authorized by <b>Article</b> <b>I</b> of the United States Constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then-Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the Wyoming v. Colorado decision undermining the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting Colorado River Compact was signed on November 24, 1922.|$|E
