5|$|Public or {{representative}} standing {{is standing}} possessed by an <b>applicant</b> who brings a case {{on behalf of}} a larger group of people, or even {{in the interest of the}} general public. The <b>applicant</b> need not show that a personal right or interest has been infringed. As long as the represented individuals have, or the public has, sufficient interest in the matter, the <b>applicant</b> will be held to have adequate standing to pursue the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{nomination}} {{process is}} not political. Applicants {{do not have to}} know their congressman to be nominated. The Academy <b>applicant</b> typically provides written essays and letters of recommendation. The <b>applicant</b> then submits to a formal interview. Admission to West Point is selective: 12.75% of applicants were admitted (total of 1292) to the Class of 2012.|$|E
50|$|Discrimination against {{pregnant}} <b>applicants</b> {{is illegal}} under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, which views pregnancy {{as a temporary}} disability and requires employers to treat pregnant <b>applicants</b> the same as all other <b>applicants.</b> Yet, discrimination against pregnant <b>applicants</b> continues both in the United States and internationally. Research shows that pregnant <b>applicants</b> compared to non-pregnant <b>applicants</b> {{are less likely to}} be recommended for hire. Interviewers appear concerned that pregnant <b>applicants</b> are more likely than non-pregnant <b>applicants</b> to miss work and even quit. Organizations who wish to reduce potential discrimination against pregnant <b>applicants</b> should consider implementing structured interviews, although some theoretical work suggests interviewers may still show biases even in these types of interviews.|$|R

Under special circumstances, the <b>applicant</b> need only be 15 if a member of a sporting club, or 16 if taught hunting in schools with such a curriculum. To obtain an A, D or E category license, the <b>applicant</b> must be 21.|$|E
5|$|An <b>applicant</b> has {{the burden}} of proving that a {{legislative}} restriction on {{the freedom of speech}} {{has nothing to do with}} public order, public health or morality. There must be some substance in the applicant's complaint – the Government does not have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech simply because the <b>applicant</b> complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).|$|E
5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the <b>applicant</b> seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an <b>applicant</b> who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the <b>applicant</b> must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the <b>applicant</b> must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no <b>applicant</b> has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered special damage and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E

We let four fictitious <b>applicants,</b> two with typical Arab/Muslim names and two with typical Swedish names, use application letters containing different amounts of information to apply for apartments over the Internet in Sweden. The Arab/Muslim <b>applicants</b> received fewer responses from the landlords than did the Swedish <b>applicants.</b> All of the <b>applicants</b> gained by providing more information about themselves, but the amount of discrimination against the Arab/Muslim <b>applicants</b> remained unchanged, indicating that {{increasing the amount of}} information about the <b>applicants</b> will not reduce discrimination. ...|$|R

5|$|In Borissik Svetlana v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the <b>applicant</b> and {{her husband}} owned a semi-detached house which they wished to redevelop. In 2002, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) had issued a {{circular}} imposing certain restrictions on the redevelopment of semi-detached houses. The URA rejected the applicant's redevelopment application {{on the basis of}} the circular. Counsel for the <b>applicant</b> argued before the High Court that the <b>applicant</b> had a legitimate expectation that the proposal to redevelop the house would be approved. The Court held that the URA had not acted in a way that could have led the <b>applicant</b> to have such a legitimate expectation. It adopted four conditions set out in De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) to determine whether a legitimate expectation has been created: the public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the <b>applicant,</b> who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply. The only legitimate expectation that could have arisen after the 2002 circular had been issued was that the URA would act in accordance with those guidelines unless the circumstances were such that an exception has to be made. The <b>applicant</b> in Borissik argued that she had a legitimate expectation to a substantive right, but since the Court decided that the URA had made no clear representation to her, it did not make any pronouncements on the approach that should be taken towards substantive legitimate expectations in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} the Home Office were an {{undisclosed}} number of letters that it had received objecting to Colbung's involvement in the repatriation process; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct <b>applicant.</b> In response Colbung asked his elders to ask the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) to tell the British Home Office {{that he was the}} correct <b>applicant.</b> ATSIC then convened a meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung's application could proceed.|$|E
50|$|If {{firms can}} assess the {{productivity}} of <b>applicants,</b> {{they will try to}} select the best among the <b>applicants.</b> A higher wage offer will attract more <b>applicants,</b> and in particular more highly qualified <b>applicants.</b> This permits a firm to raise its hiring standard and thereby enhance the firm's productivity. Wage compression makes it profitable for firms to screen <b>applicants</b> under such circumstances, and selection wages may be important.|$|R

5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between {{cases where the}} courts have found that an <b>applicant</b> has standing to represent identifiable individuals (associational standing), and cases where the <b>applicant</b> purports to represent the public interest (public interest standing). Under this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended that there should be a two-track system for standing. An <b>applicant</b> should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing.|$|E
5|$|Singaporean {{courts have}} {{accepted}} the existence of both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. In Re Siah Mooi Guat (1988), the <b>applicant</b> was a Malaysian national who was declared a prohibited immigrant under section 8(3)(k) of the Immigration Act and had her re-entry permit to Singapore and employment pass cancelled. As the applicant's appeal to the Minister for Home Affairs was rejected, the <b>applicant</b> took out an application to the High Court to quash {{the decision of the}} Minister. One ground of the application was that the <b>applicant</b> had a legitimate expectation to two procedural rights: the opportunity to make representations to the Minister before he considered her case under the Immigration Act, and the duty of the Minister to give reasons for his decision.|$|E

5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the <b>applicant</b> must submit evidence showing that the <b>applicant</b> had adopted the mark in good faith, that the <b>applicant</b> had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present evidence to the contrary, {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E
5|$|Any {{married person}} who alleges that {{reasonable}} grounds exist for supposing {{that the other}} party to the marriage is dead may apply to court to have it presumed that the other party is dead {{and to have the}} marriage dissolved. If the court is satisfied that such reasonable grounds exist, it may make an interim judgment of presumption of death and of divorce. In such proceedings, the fact that for seven years or more the other party to the marriage has been continually absent from the <b>applicant,</b> and the <b>applicant</b> has {{no reason to believe that}} the other party has been living within that time, is evidence that the missing person is dead until the contrary is proved.|$|E

The Commission attended technical presentations, participated in question-and-answer sessions about the Candidature File, and made inspections in all the existing venues across the city. Though considered a favorite entering the voting process, and despite personal appeals from such high-profile Chicagoans as U.S. President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and Oprah Winfrey, Chicago was eliminated on the first ballot in IOC voting on October 2, 2009, with 18 votes in a three-round exhaustive ballot of the IOC.|$|E

5|$|Fettering of {{discretion}} {{by a public}} authority {{is one of the}} grounds of judicial review in Singapore administrative law. It is regarded as a form of illegality. An <b>applicant</b> may challenge a decision by an authority on the basis that it has either rigidly adhered to a policy it has formulated, or has wrongfully delegated the exercise of its statutory powers to another body. If the High Court finds that a decision-maker has fettered its discretion, it may hold the decision to be ultra vires – beyond the decision-maker's powers – and grant the <b>applicant</b> a suitable remedy such as a quashing order to invalidate the decision.|$|E
