40|$|Single walled carbon {{nanotubes}} exhibit advanced {{electrical and}} surface properties useful for high performance nanoelectronics. Important to future manufacturing of nanotube circuits is large scale assembly of SWNTs into <b>aligned</b> <b>forms.</b> Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristine SWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for high current, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallel SWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of aligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to {{which is a}} non covalent polymer functionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in an organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film compression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and packing of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy. The monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by microfabrication, enabling the highest currents 3 mA through the narrowest regions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far.

40|$|This article {{questions}} {{the use of}} the term integral. It argues that although the use is well intentioned it draws its energy from the geophilosophical drive of the Western project. This project is imperialist in nature and bases its power on its ability to define. So although IF claims to be inclusive it actually establishes a self-referential dialogical relationship between itself and its interlocutor that privileges its position. This is clearly counter to the integral rhetoric of its most ardent exponents. It is argued that this imbalance is central to the entire Western philosophic project and is rooted in the geophilosophical gaze. Such a gaze is ultimately about assimilation not mutual discourse and should be set aside for more inclusive and less culturally <b>aligned</b> <b>forms</b> of cultural analysis such as Causal Layered Analysis which accounts for the primacy of context and local knowledge and finds agency in the working of those who constitute the multitude. Such work is process oriented and stands in real contrast to the definitional power (and terror) of the integral gaze...|$|E
40|$|Unfilled {{cross-linked}} poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) is a weak {{material and}} is generally filled {{with high levels}} of particulate fillers such as silica, calcium carbonate and carbon black to improve its mechanical properties. The use of fibrous fillers such as electrospun nanofibres and multi-walled carbon nanotubes as fillers for PDMS has not been widely studied. In this study anew copolymer, polyacrylonitrile-graft-poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PAN-g-PDMS), is used as fibrous filler for PDMS. The graft copolymer is electrospun to produce the fibre filler material. It is shown how the PDMS content of the graft copolymer provides increased compatibility with silicone matrices and excellent dispersion of the fibre fillers throughout a silicone matrix. It is also shown {{that it is possible to}} include multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the electrospun fibres which are subsequently dispersed in the PDMS matrix. Fibre mats were used in the non-woven and the <b>aligned</b> <b>forms.</b> The differently prepared fibre composites have significantly different mechanical properties. Conventional composites using fibrous fillers usually show increased strength and stiffness but usually with a resultant loss of strain. In the case of the composites produced in this study there is a dramatic improvement in the extensibility of the non-woven PAN-g-PDMS fibre mat filled silicone films of up to 470 %. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of some ambiguous and quantitative characters in Flora Republicae Popularis Sinicae 3 (1), species identifications of the series Gravesiana have been in disarray, requiring clarification. Two hundred and fifty-nine individuals from 47 different populations were collected for the estimation of morphological characters and phylogenetic analyses. Spores of 26 populations were observed through scanning electron microscope. Our results were {{different from those of}} previous research: (1) six identifiable species, rather than five species observed previously, were confirmed in the series Gravesiana, they are A. gravesii, A. juxtapositum, A. mariesii, A. dentatum, A. longzhouensis and A. obovatum, of which the latter three are newly recognized species. (2) Thirteen characters were measured and estimated through the program Mesquite v. 2. 71. The character whether the pinna stalks were 1 / 3 - 1 / 2 times longer than the pinna was used to distinguish A. gravesii and A. lianxianense previously and was found to be unreliable here, whereas such characters as the height of the plant (H), pinna <b>aligned</b> <b>forms</b> (FP), number of pinna (NP), pinna margin (M), number of veins flabellate at base (NV), sori number and shape per pinna (NSS), pinna texture (T), and powder-covered or not on the abaxial surface of the pinna (P) are estimated to be stable and reliable characters useful for identification.

40|$|Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) {{derived from}} {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN) {{have not yet}} demonstrated the high tensile strength and Young???s modulus of their microscale counterparts. This {{is due to the}} current lack of understanding of the effect of electrospinning conditions on the quality of PAN precursor nanofibers, as well as the effect of stabilization and carbonization temperatures on the structure and mechanical properties of CNFs. In this dissertation research, strong carbon nanofibers with diameters 150 - 500 nm were realized from PAN precursors following an optimization of key fabrication conditions. The uniqueness of these CNFs compared to existing vapor grown carbon nanofibers and nanotubes lies in their continuous and <b>aligned</b> <b>forms,</b> which are advantageous when incorporated into polymer composites for matrix strengthening and toughening. The carbon nanofibers were tested individually by a MEMS based nanoscale tension platform and the tensile strength reached a maximum at 1400 ??C, while the elastic modulus increased monotonically until 1700 ??C. The characteristic Weibull strength and the elastic modulus were 3. 6 GPa and 172 ?? 40 GPa, respectively, which are 600 % and almost 300 % larger than previously reported. This improvement {{was the result of a}} design of experimental procedures to determine appropriate conditions for PAN electrospinning as well as the optimum stabilization and carbonization temperatures. The carbon nanofibers had homogeneous cross-sections which resulted in large improvement of their mechanical properties, as opposed to the previously reported core-shell structure of carbonized nanofibers. The formation of turbostratic carbon crystallites with thicknesses increasing from 3 to 8 layers between 800 ??C and 1700 ??C improved the elastic modulus and tensile strength but was also the source for the strength reduction of nanofibers exposed to 1700 ??C. The discontinuity and random orientation of turbostratic carbon crystallites were identified as the limiting factors in achieving ultra-strong and stiff carbon nanofibers from PAN precursors...|$|E
40|$|Cross-sectioned and cross-fractured {{crayfish}} axons display {{regions in}} which axon and Schwann cell surface membranes are regularly curved and project into the axoplasm. At these regions (projections) the two membranes run precisely parallel, {{separated by a}} gap of 130 - 140 ~ [...] Longitudinal fractures through the axons expose the inner fractured surface of either the internal (face A) or the external (face B) leaflet of axon and adjacent Schwann cell surface membranes. On both membranes the projections appear as elongated structures oriented with the long axis parallel to the long axis of the nerve fiber. On face A of the axon surface membrane they are seen as elongated indentations 0. 5 - 1. 2 -~m long, 0. 12 - 0. 15 -~m wide. The indentations contain parallel chains of globules. The chains repeat every 120 - 125, ~ and are oriented obliquely {{in such a way}} that if one looks at the axon surface from the extracellular space, the axis of the chains is skewed counterclockwise to the long axis of the indentations by an acute angle (most often 55 - 60 °). The globules repeat along the chain every 80 - 85. ~. Globules of adjacent chains are in register {{in such a way that}} the axis on which globules of neighboring chains are <b>aligned</b> <b>forms</b> an angle of 75 - 85 ° with the axis of the chains.

The projections of the Schwann cell surface membrane also contain groupings of globules; however, these differ from those in the axonal projections in size, pattern of aggregation, and fracture properties. Several possible interpretations of the meaning of these membrane specializations could be proposed. They could be: (a) structures involved in the mechanism of excitation, (b) regions of presumed metabolic couplings, and (c) areas of cell-to-cell adhesion...|$|E

40|$|Hexagonal ferrites are {{a family}} of {{magnetic}} oxides which include M ferrite, {{the most commonly used}} magnetic material in the world today. They also have more specialist potential applications, such as microwave absorption and catalysis. They are highly complex crystal structures which usuaUy require high temperatures to form a well sintered product, at the expense of grain growth, which in tum affects the magnetic properties of the material. They all exhibit magneto crystalline anisotropy; depending upon the ferrite they can have a preferred direction of magnetisation along the c axis of the hexagonal crystal (uniaxial), or in the hexagonal plane or in a cone at an angle to the plane (ferroxplana). A material made in a fibrous form has many properties; firstly it can be incorporated into a matrix to form a composite material, imparting any special properties into the whole composite. Provided their microstructure is sufficiently fme, fibres tend to be stronger than the bulk ceramic form, and if fme enough they can even be woven into a cloth. It has also been suggested that some properties, such as magnetisation, will be enhanced when the material is an aligned fibre, although this specific case has never been proven previously. This thesis presents the manufacture of a range of hexagonal ferrite fme fibres from an inorganic aqueous sol-gel precursor, and their subsequent characterisation both physically and magnetically. The fibres were blow spun from a viscous solution using a modified commercial process, and they were collected in both random and <b>aligned</b> <b>forms.</b> The sols were made from the peptisation of a precipitated iron(III) hydroxide with a mineral acid, and various combinations of iron (III) salt and acid were investigated using PCS. The best results were found to come from iron(III) chloride precipitated by ammonia and peptised with HBr, with totally nitrate and chloride based systems proving inferior. Chloride was found to add structuring to the sol, aiding spinning but resulting in a thixotropic gel if too much was present. The stoichiometric ferrite sols were made by doping the iron (I II) sol with solution of metal salts, and these were found to be critical to the stability of the sol, with barium causing particular problems, and titania was added as a second colloidal species. Stoichiometric sols of BaM, SrM, BaCoxTixFel 12 - 12 xO 19, SrCoxTixFe 12 2 x 019, CozY, COzZ, COzW, CozX and CozU ferrites were made, among others, and aU were successfully spun as fibres.
