While he desired a tax code that would preclude {{the need for}} the state to borrow money, he encouraged legislators to keep taxes <b>as</b> <b>low</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> He also urged them to convert the militia into a youth army. The General Assembly routinely ignored his calls for reform but did pass a measure he advocated that allowed debtors a one-year stay on collection of their debts if they provided both bond and security.|$|E

While {{there has never been a}} formal entrance exam such as the SAT, non-native English speakers must provide designated proof of English proficiency or receive a minimum score on the TOEFL, IELTS, or PTEA. Additionally, the preadmission Expository Writing E-25 course requires students to complete E-15 with a grade of B or higher in EXPO 15 or successfully complete the Test of Critical Reading and Writing Skills.|$|E

25|$|During the {{ten years}} that Cosgrave and Cumann na nGaedheal were in power they adopted a {{conservative}} economic policy. Taxation was kept <b>as</b> <b>low</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> and the budget was balanced to avoid borrowing. The Irish currency remained linked to the British currency, resulting in the overvaluation of the Irish pound.
