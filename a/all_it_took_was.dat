It is what I do. There's a time I believe where I {{tried to}} {{suppress}} it. I think I lied {{for a few}} years in my teens telling my parents I wanted to be a doctor. But I wasn't interested in math and I was really loud. <b>All</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>was</b> a student performance of Lend Me a Tenor, and my parents hopes and dreams for their bright eyed middle child to be a doctor, dashed with the lines. See, I come from a Nigerian, well-educated ambitious bunch of arguing intellectuals. My mother is a nurse my father was an engineer who in his youth, fought in the Biafran War. He refers to me as Wahalla or problem maker for seeking a life in the arts. There are not many artists in our family. In fact I think I am the first actually. And so I came to UCSD heart in throat, arms crossed wanting "my education" I got so much more. This is the place where I was basically told all Wahalla are welcome. And so for three years I got to explore the woman, the artist, the black girl, and the African within me. I was taught by the leading troublemakers in the country. And I am a better artist for it. And if I am lucky, when I am out there in real world I too will dash inspire a young crop of in coming Wahalla and keep the cycle moving...|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonal}} cyclones {{stayed away}} from the Pacific Herbs Business Forum held in mid-February 2002 in Vanuatu. The winds of trade, though, blew like a gale through a sedate encounter of scientists, producers and traders of medicinal plants, blowing down quite a few illusions, and a fair number of business plans. The problem at hand was the apparent collapse of the European market (literally {{on the other side of}} the world) for the kava plant and its by-products, and worries that the key North American market would go wobbly too. Kava consists of the dried, whole or cut rhizome (stem) or root of Piper methysticum Forster, and has been widely used throughout the Pacific for untold centuries in religious ceremonies, and as a relaxant and socialising substance. With a surge in popularity in the West in the 1990 s, and despite some health cautions, the region s exports had risen to US$ 60 million (EUR 69 million) by the end of the decade. Then came a problem of overstocking, followed by drastic allegations that some 20 deaths in northern Europe were related to kava consumption. <b>All</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>was</b> for a few European governments to ask their health sectors to voluntarily withdraw kava products from shops, and the economies of several Pacific nations sagged immediately although the smart ones had already been building up alternative exports, such as cloves, ginger, vanilla and flowers. All this turned the three-day Forum into an non-stop 24 hours a day event: the days filled with a richly informative exchange of scientific and trading information on all sorts of medicinal plants. The nights, largely kava-free, bristled with Kava Crisis plans for lobbying the political and economic powers of the West to tone down the situation and seek a reasonable resolution. Somewhat chastened by their vulnerability to the fickle nature of the medicinal plant market, and perhaps, some murmured, to more sinister corporate competition, the hundred-plus delegates from two dozen nations adopted plans to diversify products and avoid over-dependence on market leaders the next one at risk seems to be noni, the juice of the fruit of the Morinda citrifolia L tree. The consensus is that strength lies in numbers and knowledge an object well understood by co-sponsors Commonwealth Secretariat, CTA and CTA s sister Centre for the Development of Enterprise. After a 2000 workshop in Africa, and this none-too pacific forum, plans are now being made for a Caribbean encounter. [caption to illustration] Kava prices have tumbled.
