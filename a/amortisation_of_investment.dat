40|$|The {{focus is}} effects <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> in {{airports}} and runways {{on the market}} for air travel and more in general for the production possibilities of the economy. In the case of Greenland two types of impacts can be sorted out. One is more efficient production of air transport due to increased density in the utilization of the net because of no use or less use of the airport in Kangerlussuaq. The other effect, connected to the first, is that resources are set free by avoidance of double work receiving the same passengers (and goods) in Kangerlussuaq and especially in Nuuk. Transformation curves are used to illustrate both effects and the first is dealt with also in an ordinary price quantity diagram. Using previous calculations and estimates done by the author two specific scenarios are treated in the theoretical framework presented: one is a lengthening of the runway in Nuuk to 1799 m and less intensive use of Kangerlussuaq, the other is the building of an airport south of Nuuk with a 3000 m runway in combination with abandoning Kangerlussuaq. Profitability and <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>investments</b> are reviewed in transformation curve diagrams. On the assumptions of the calculations both scenarios are profitable, but by far the most profitable is the big <b>investment</b> south <b>of</b> Nuuk. Concluding remarks stress the preliminary character of my calculations, but they also point out that decision makers’ choice of scenarios to be discussed and compared is unstable. None...|$|R

The study {{focuses on the}} published consolidated annual reports of a sample of top 150 listed Australian companies, ranked by market capitalisation, as at June 1989, over the period 1989 to 1990, whereas the previous study by Coombes et al. (1993) concentrates on the top 150 listed Australian companies, ranked by market capitalisation, as at 30 June, 1988, over the period 1986 to 1989. The empirical evidence of the present research using contracting theory suggests that management 2 ̆ 7 s choice of amortising lIAs depends on whether the <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> these assets has a valuable growth option to generate cash flows into the companies. The evidence {{does not support the}} practice of lIAs 2 ̆ 7 amortisation in order to reduce covenant limitations under existing debt contracts and future debt raisings, and to cause minimisation of political vulnerability. Support for the profit-based managerial compensation incentives to amortise liAs appears only in 1989, possibly due to the pending ED 49 2 ̆ 2 Accounting for Identifiable Intangible Assets 2 ̆ 2 issued by the Australian Accounting Research Foundation which required systematic <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> IIAs.

As transfer fee was considered as a purchase of a capital, the real effect of transfer fee was the <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> the transfer fee, which is proportionally to the contract length. For example, Fernando Torres' £50 million transfer fee had to be amortised by about £9 million a season, which in the 2010-11 season amounted to only £4.5 million (due to half season).

It singles out phases of rapid pre-crisis growth, crisis, post-crisis growth and stagnation. Stagnation and decline in recent years are caused by completed major investment projects, reduced own funds of enterprises, limited availability <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> resources and increased capital outflow. The article reveals that the growth <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital of the North in the post-crisis period {{is provided by the}} regions, carrying out major investment in oil and gas pipeline transport, oil extraction, production and distribution of electricity, gas and water. The changes in the sectoral structure <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital of the Northern regions are barely visible; the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in the traded sector is still high, especially in mining, due to the Northern regions’ specialization in the extractive industries. The share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in the public sector and social services remains low. The specific structure <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital has changed: the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in buildings (excluding housing) and structures has increased greatly; the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in machinery, equipment, vehicles has decreased due to insufficient investment in mining enterprises and financial shortages in manufacturing. In most regions the structure <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in fixed capital by directions is characterized by the increase in the share <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in machinery, equipment, vehicles in new construction, investment in buildings and structures and the decline in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>investment</b> in machinery, equipment, vehicles modernization and reconstruction and acquisition of new fixed assets.

40|$|UK {{accounting}} practice differs from International Accounting Standards (IASs) {{particularly with regard}} to <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill, provision for deferred taxation and the accounting treatment of pension costs. Under the core standards programme of the IASC the IASs have emerged closer to US practice. This paper evaluates the profit of those UK companies reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 1988 and 1994, spanning a period which saw the establishment of the ASB and the implementation of the IASC's comparability project. An increasing gap was found between the reported profit under UK accounting principles and that restated under US GAAP. The difference lay most frequently in accounting for goodwill, provision for deferred tax, and the accounting treatment of pension costs, with accounting for goodwill showing a particularly significant impact in 1994. Notwithstanding the introduction of FRS 10, an overall impression of increasing disharmony could continue to cause reconciliations to be required of UK companies seeking full listing on a US stock exchange, with consequent disadvantage relative to companies in other European countries seeking international capital in the US...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} preparers’ and non-preparers’ {{positions}} regarding accounting for goodwill are examined through studying submitted comment letters on ED 3 ‘Business Combinations’. Preparers have, because of economic consequences, incentives {{to lobby for}} the non-amortisation approach and non-preparers for the amortisation approach. As hypothesised, non-preparers are found to support <b>amortisation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill {{to a greater extent}} than do preparers. Moreover, the two groups’ supportive arguments, i. e. how they argue for or against the non-amortisation or amortisation approach, are studied. Again, as hypothesised, the results show that the two groups use the same type of ‘sophisticated’ framework based arguments instead of economic consequences arguments. Taken together the examination of the comment letters thus indicates that both preparers and non-preparers point at conceptual strengths and weaknesses, instead of pointing at the real cause of the lobbying activities, i. e. perceived economic consequences, when they try to affect the final outcome of the standard. These findings confirm earlier research which has suggested that self-interested lobbyists use accounting theories and concepts as useful justifications...|$|R
