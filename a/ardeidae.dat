5|$|The {{cattle egret}} (Bubulcus ibis) is a {{cosmopolitan}} species of heron (family <b>Ardeidae)</b> {{found in the}} tropics, subtropics and warm temperate zones. It is {{the only member of}} the monotypic genus Bubulcus, although some authorities regard two of its subspecies as full species, the western cattle egret and the eastern cattle egret. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus Egretta, it is more closely related to the herons of Ardea. Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world in the last century.|$|E

500|$|The family <b>Ardeidae</b> {{contains}} the herons, egrets, and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons {{are large and}} egrets are smaller. The cattle egret or [...] "cow bird" [...] is seen amongst flocks of cattle, for instance in ranches north of the Everglades. A bird will often attach itself to a particular bull, cow or calf, even being tolerated perching on the back or even {{the head of the}} animal. The birds are more shy than the animals, and will fly away if approached. The birds feed on various items turned over by the cattle as they graze and tramp the ground. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the <b>Ardeidae</b> fly with their necks pulled back into a curve.|$|E

50|$|Like all egrets, it is {{a member}} of the heron family, <b>Ardeidae.</b> Traditionally {{classified}} with the storks in the Ciconiiformes, the <b>Ardeidae</b> are closer relatives of pelicans and belong in the Pelecaniformes instead. The great egret—unlike the typical egrets—does not belong to the genus Egretta but together with the great herons is today placed in Ardea. In the past, however, it was sometimes placed in Egretta or separated in a monotypic genus Casmerodius.|$|E

50|$|The adult plumage is {{gray with}} fine zigzag barring, with a pale underside, {{standing}} about 32 cm(12.6 in) in height. Juveniles have a dark {{back with a}} brown head and underside. Due to its appearance it was often assigned to the tiger herons (Tigrisoma and allies). But in fact, it is a true bittern, having like these only 10 rectrices (other <b>Ardeidae</b> have 12) and being unequivocally placed in the bittern lineage by DNA sequence data too. Short legs and necks and cryptic plumage may thus be plesiomorphic among <b>Ardeidae</b> in general.|$|E
