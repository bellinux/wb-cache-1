Information in Salsa is collected {{from a variety}} of sources both inside and outside of email to create a profile for each person in our corporation that contains a photo, organizational details, friends, and an <b>aggregated</b> <b>feed</b> of shared content. Thus, Salsa uses a social networking approach to add social awareness to email. Salsa was deployed internally within our corporation and we trace its growth for six months and describe the results of a targeted user study. Findings demonstrate the extent to which and what type of social awareness is useful in our organization. Use of the <b>aggregated</b> <b>feed</b> is also discussed. In addition to identifying features that are useful for social networks in the enterprise...|$|E

Some third party businesses are providing consolidation of data feeds so that comparison sites {{do not have to}} import from many different merchants. Affiliate networks such as LinkShare, Commission Junction or TradeDoubler <b>aggregate</b> data <b>feeds</b> from many merchants and provide them to the price comparison sites. Many of the popular shopping websites like Amazon and Flipkart provides direct affiliation to the customer who wants to become affiliate partner. They provides their own API to the affiliate partner to show their products with specifications to the affiliate partner's website. For example, Shoesdekho is one of their affiliate partner where you can find shoes price comparison from Flipkart, Amazon, Jabong, Snapdeal etc. This enables price comparison sites to monetize the products contained in the feeds by earning commissions on click through traffic. Other price comparison sites like PriceGrabber have deals with merchants and <b>aggregate</b> <b>feeds</b> using their own technology.|$|R

40|$|Congestion {{control in}} packet-based {{networks}} is often realized by feedback protocols - {{in this paper}} we assess the performance under a back-pressure mechanism that has been proposed and standardized for Ethernet metropolitan networks. Relying on our earlier results for feedback fluid queues, we derive explicit expressions for the key performance metrics, in terms of the model parameters, as well as the parameters agreed upon in the service level agreement. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the main trade-offs of this model (for instance the trade-off between the signaling frequency and the throughput). These can be used to generate design guidelines. The paper is concluded by an elementary, yet powerful, Markovian model that can be used as an approximative model in situations of large traffic <b>aggregates</b> <b>feeding</b> into the system; the trade-offs and guidelines identified for the feedback fluid model turn out to carry over to this more stylized model. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

In batch plants, the fibre additive is added direct to the pugmill using individually wrapped press packs or bulk dispensing equipment. Mixing times may be extended ensure that fibre is homogeneously distributed throughout the mix and temperatures controlled in order to avoid overheating or damage to the fibre. In drum plants, particular care must be taken to ensure that both the additional filler content and fibre additive are incorporated into the mixture without excessive losses through the dust extraction system. Filler systems that add filler directly into the drum rather than <b>aggregate</b> <b>feed</b> are preferred. Pelletised fibres may be added through systems designed for addition of recycled materials, but a more effective means is addition through a special delivery line that is combined with the bitumen delivery, so that the fibre is captured by bitumen at the point of addition to the mixture.|$|R

The presence of loggerhead turtles in the central and eastern North Pacific is a prominent enigma in marine turtle distribution because the nearest documented nesting concentrations for this species are in Australia and Japan, over 10, 000 km from Baja California. To determine the origin of the Baja California <b>feeding</b> <b>aggregate</b> and North Pacific fishery mortalities, samples from nesting areas and pelagic <b>feeding</b> <b>aggregates</b> were compared with genetic markers derived from mtDNA control region sequences.

The disease begins focally and spreads contiguously, resulting in progressive paralysis. The pathological hallmark of ALS is the accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates containing Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) in motor neurons. The aim of this project was to clarify a molecular mechanism underlying the spread of lesion sites in the disease from the viewpoint of seeding activity of insoluble SOD 1 aggregates. I first established two different methods : oral intake of E. coli forming the aggregates by thermoregulation, and exposure of the purified aggregates. Although transgenic C. elegans harboring human SOD 1 were fed with the <b>aggregates,</b> <b>feeding</b> with either E. coli forming the aggregates or the purified aggregates did not induce the aggregation of human SOD 1 in C. elegans.
