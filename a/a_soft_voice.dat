500|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, three deleted {{scenes from}} [...] "The Stakeout" [...] were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first 75-second clip, a panicked Leslie asks Tom whether the marijuana plant could be a [...] "non-marijuana weed". In the second 80-second clip, Dave says he hates arresting people because he [...] "never wants to go". He also discusses his strategies for calming people down, including using <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> eye contact and tasing them. In the third minute-long clip, Ron tries unsuccessfully to eat his lunch and throw away the garbage without moving.|$|E
2500|$|Abbott {{took the}} stand and testified for four days, testifying in a calm and poised manner. He spoke in <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> and was steadfast in his denials of any {{knowledge}} of the crime. He said {{it was all a}} [...] "monstrous frame-up". The jury was out seven days before it returned a verdict of guilty of first degree murder. The judge imposed the death sentence.|$|E
2500|$|Stalin had <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> {{and when}} {{speaking}} Russian {{he did so}} slowly, carefully choosing his phrasing. Although he avoided doing so in public, in private Stalin used coarse language. Described as a poor orator, according to Volkogonov, Stalin's speaking style was [...] "simple and clear, without flights of fancy, catchy phrases or platform histrionics". He rarely spoke before large audiences, and preferred to express himself in written form. His writing style was similar, being characterised by its simplicity, clarity, and conciseness.|$|E
6000|$|The {{other was}} <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] <b>As</b> <b>soft</b> as honey-dew: [...] Quoth he, [...] "The man hath penance done, [...] And penance more will do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have few}} claims {{that any one}} seems bound to respect," [...] he returned, brusquely. Then, in <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> <b>voice,</b> he added, looking at her, gently,-- ...|$|R
5000|$|A new blue-colored Wrecking Ball was {{introduced}} in this episode, The Slow Wrecking Ball, plus the old Wrecking Ball has <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> <b>voice</b> in this episode. (hence the episode title reference) ...|$|R
2500|$|The celebrant and assistants {{follow the}} acolytes {{into the church}} wearing the biretta. Upon {{arriving}} in the sanctuary the acolytes place their candles on the lowest altar step, after which they are extinguished. [...] The celebrant and assistants kneel on the lowest step and recite the Aperi Domine silently, after which they go to their places and recite the Pater noster and Ave Maria silently. A curious practice which exists from ancient times is the intoning of the antiphons and psalms to the celebrant. The rubrics presuppose that the first assistant or cantors will intone all which the celebrant must sing by singing it to him first in <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> after which the celebrant sings it again aloud. The five antiphons and psalms are sung with the first assistant intoning the antiphons and the cantors intoning the psalms. During the singing of the psalms all sit. After the psalms, the acolytes relight their candles and carry them to {{each side of the}} lectern for the chapter. The assistants follow, standing facing each other in front of the lectern. The celebrant then sings the chapter, after which all return to their places. The first assistant intones the hymn to the celebrant, and all stand while the hymn is sung. The first assistant intones the Magnificat to the celebrant, who sings the first line aloud. The celebrant and the first two assistants go to altar, and the altar is then incensed as at Mass while the first two assistants hold the ends of the cope. [...] Other altars in the church may be incensed as well. The first assistant then incenses the celebrant, after which the thurifer incenses the others as at Mass. If there are commemorations, the acolytes and assistants again go to the lectern as described above for the chapter. The choir sings the antiphons, the cantors sing the versicles, and the celebrant sings the collects. After all commemorations, the celebrant sings Dominus vobiscum, the cantor sings Benedicamus Domino, and the celebrant sings Fidelium animae.... The Marian antiphon is said in the low voice. Especially in English-speaking countries, Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament often follows Solemn Vespers.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly Babalatchi {{began to}} speak in <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice.</b> Lingard blinked, cleared his throat--sat up straight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Ramoo," [...] {{he said in}} <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "you can do no good here, poor fellow, and {{the room}} must be closed. It is a heavy loss to you too." ...|$|R
6000|$|He paused, {{and then}} in <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> <b>voice,</b> humbly almost, [...] "It is my prayer," [...] he added, [...] "that {{hereafter}} in a happy future these last few weeks shall come to seem {{no more than an}} evil dream to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "George," [...] he said, in <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> <b>voice</b> {{than had}} ever been usual with him. [...] "I wish you to marry Caroline. Go back to her, and make it up. Tell her that I wish it, if it be {{necessary}} to tell her anything." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{said the}} father, with <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> <b>voice,</b> {{as he passed}} his one arm round the boy's body and lifted the reins. [...] "Hold tight {{when we come to}} the cross-roads, for we'll take the first turn, for old luck's sake, to the Mission." ...|$|R
6000|$|Last night, {{above the}} {{whistling}} wind, [...] I heard the welcome rain,-- [...] A fusillade upon the roof, [...] A tattoo on the pane: [...] The keyhole piped; the chimney-top [...] A warlike trumpet blew; [...] Yet, mingling with these sounds of strife, [...] <b>A</b> <b>softer</b> <b>voice</b> stole through.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>soft,</b> sweet <b>voice</b> answered. Didn't I {{know that}} voice? My hand holding the {{receiver}} shook.|$|R
6000|$|... "Plenty of time," [...] {{answered}} <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> with {{an underlying}} melancholy in it, plainly distinguishable {{though it had}} only spoken three words.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{must ask}} me more civilly, my rough hero,' replied <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> from {{underneath}} the awning. 'Beauty must be sued, and not commanded.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Where go?--" [...] said <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> female <b>voice,</b> {{speaking}} hurriedly, and in concern.--"Indian--red man savage--wicked warrior--that-a-way." ...|$|R
6000|$|The veiled {{attendant}} {{drew back}} and waved her hand, and some one glided forward, {{and said in}} <b>a</b> low, <b>soft</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "You have not forgotten me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{gleam of}} {{intelligence}} {{shot from the}} girl's expressive eyes, and she displayed a double row of beautiful teeth as in <b>a</b> low <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> she said--"Azinte." ...|$|R
6000|$|Marty now alighted; {{the lamp}} again shone upon her, {{and as the}} {{carriage}} rolled on, <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> said {{to her from the}} interior, [...] "Good-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|But <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> called {{across the}} blazing sands. A girl, faintly lemon-tinted, {{stood in the}} Calle Real and called. She was bare-armed--but what of that? ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{the fourth}} night, when all was quiet, little Gulliver saw a black shadow steal across the lawn, and heard <b>a</b> <b>soft</b> <b>voice</b> say to him: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Morris," [...] she said, in <b>a</b> <b>softer</b> <b>voice,</b> [...] "I am lazy, I know. Perhaps {{that is why}} I adore {{people who}} can work. So, {{although}} you don't think anything of me, I will do my honest best to get into sympathy with you again; yes, and to help in any way I can. No; it's not a joke.
