5|$|Coronary <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> is {{also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the blood flow to the heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary <b>artery</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hypertension (HTN or HT), {{also known}} as high blood {{pressure}} (HBP), is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms. Long-term high blood pressure, however, is a major risk factor for coronary <b>artery</b> <b>disease,</b> stroke, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, vision loss, and chronic kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|In general, for adults, doses {{are taken}} {{four times a}} day for fever or arthritis, with doses near the maximal daily dose used {{historically}} for the treatment of rheumatic fever. For the prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in someone with documented or suspected coronary <b>artery</b> <b>disease,</b> much lower doses are taken once daily.|$|E
40|$|An inverse {{relationship}} between birth weight and coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases</b> is well documented but it remains unclear which exposure in early life might underlie such association. Recently {{it has been reported}} an association between adenosine deaminase genetic polymorphism and coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases.</b> Gender differences in the degree of this association have been also observed. These observations prompted us to study the possible joint effects of BW, ADA, and gender on the susceptibility to coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases.</b> 222 subjects admitted to hospital for nonfatal coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases,</b> and 762 healthy consecutive newborns were studied. ADA genotypes were determined by DNA analysis. A highly significant complex relationship has emerged among ADA, birth weight, and gender concerning their role on susceptibility to coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases</b> in adult life. Odds ratio analysis suggests that low birth weight is more important in females than in males. ADA(*) 2 allele appears protective in males, while in females such effect is obscured by birth weight...|$|R

40|$|Coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases</b> affect both {{systolic}} and diastolic {{functions and}} can be assessed both globally and regionally. Tissue doppler imaging is a novel technique with additional advantages to the currently used two-dimensional echocardiography. This paper is {{a review of the}} published articles on documented Coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases</b> patients confirmed by angiography, without any previous myocardial infarction and with normal left ventricular ejection fraction. Accordingly, a significant relationship was achieved between systolic rather than diastolic parameters with Coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases.</b> Furthermore, major heterogeneity was noticed among the available studies in this respect. The incremental values of tissue doppler imaging in patients with stable angina in addition to other non invasive tests has led to its recommendation by ACC/AHA...|$|R

5|$|A multi-locus genetic {{risk score}} study {{based on a}} {{combination}} of 27 loci, including the APOA5 gene, identified individuals at increased risk for both incident and recurrent coronary <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> events, as well as an enhanced clinical benefit from statin therapy. The study was based on a community cohort study (the Malmo Diet and Cancer study) and four additional randomized controlled trials of primary prevention cohorts (JUPITER and ASCOT) and secondary prevention cohorts (CARE and PROVE IT-TIMI 22).|$|E
5|$|Although the {{negative}} health consequences of obesity {{in the general}} population are well supported by the available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox. The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis, and has subsequently been found in those with heart failure and peripheral <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> (PAD).|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{introduce}} the imaging characteristics of moyamoya disease (MMD) using high-resolution {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (HR-MRI) and to discuss the role of HR-MRI in differentiating MMD from other intracranial <b>artery</b> <b>diseases,</b> especially intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Data Sources: This review was based on the data in articles published between 2005 and 2015, which were obtained from PubMed. The keywords included HR-MRI, MMD, ICAD, and intracranial <b>artery</b> <b>diseases.</b> Study Selection: Articles related to HR-MRI for MMD or other intracranial <b>artery</b> <b>diseases</b> were selected for review. Results: There are differences between the characteristic patterns of HR-MRI in MMD and ICAD. MMD is associated with inward remodeling, smaller outer diameters, concentric occlusive lesions and homogeneous signal intensity, while ICAD {{is more likely to be}} associated with outward remodeling, normal outer diameters, eccentric occlusive lesions, and heterogeneous signal intensity. Other intracranial <b>artery</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as dissection and vasculitis, also have distinctive characteristics in HR-MRI. HR-MRI may become a useful tool for the differential diagnosis of MMD in the future. Conclusions: HR-MRI of MMD provides a more in-depth understanding of MMD, and it is helpful in evaluating pathological changes in the vessel wall and in differentiating MMD from other intracranial <b>artery</b> steno-occlusive <b>diseases,</b> particularly ICAD...|$|R

5|$|Before the {{widespread}} application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, {{was the main}} substance for nuclear cardiography. The nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> (CAD). This isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator {{which is similar to}} the technetium-99m generator. The generator contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours) which decays by electron capture to the thallium-201. The lead-201 can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by the (p,3n) and (d,4n) reactions.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E

5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
40|$|Backgroud: Heterozygous {{familial}} hypercholesterolemia are either classical cases with high LDL-C levels, tendon xanthomas and LDL receptor gene mutation or probable cases with hypercholesterolemia without known LDL receptor gene mutations. Aims & Objectives: This study {{was done to}} compare the severity of hypercholesterolemia and risk of CVD in classical and probable cases of heterozygous {{familial hypercholesterolemia}} in tertiary care hospitals of Karachi. This was a case-series done from June 2008 to July 2010 at Dr Ziauddin Hospital and National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: Out of more than 240 patients with dyslipidemia or premature coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases</b> 120 patients who had primary hypercholesterolemia and {{were found to have}} total cholesterol > 230 mg/dL and LDL-C > 160 mg/dL were included in the study. All these cases had premature coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases</b> or had a family history of coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases.</b> They were grouped as classical or probable cases depending on raised LDL-C, xanthelasmas, xanthoma, premature coronary <b>artery</b> <b>diseases</b> and LDL-R gene mutations. Their blood samples were collected after twelve hours fasting. PCR was done for mutation specific primers for exons 3, 4, 9 and 14. Results: Out of these 120 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, classical cases with LDL-receptor gene mutation were 42 (35 %) and probable cases without LDL-receptor gene mutations were 78 (65 %). Eleven (27 %) of these classical cases had severe hypercholesterolemia having total cholesterol (> 290 mg/dL) and LDL-C (> 200 mg/dL) and were found to have xanthelasmas, xanthomas and arcus cornealis. Discussion/Conclusions: Amongst the HeFH patients from the tertiary care hospitals of Karachi, classical cases with tendon xanthomas and LDL receptor gene mutations had severe hypercholesterolemia with greater risk of CVD, they required more aggressive treatment.

5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't beat out enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure can also lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of heart failure include coronary <b>artery</b> <b>disease,</b> valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E
