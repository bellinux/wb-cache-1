5|$|The {{historian}} R. A. Markus {{suggests that}} the reason for the conflicting <b>advice</b> <b>is</b> that the letter to Æthelberht was written first, and sent off with the returning missionaries. Markus argues that the pope, after thinking further about the circumstances of the mission in Britain, then sent a follow-up letter, the Epistolae ad Mellitum, to Mellitus, then en route to Canterbury, which contained new instructions. Markus sees this as a turning point in missionary history, in that forcible conversion gave way to persuasion. This traditional view that the Epistola represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht has been challenged by George Demacopoulos who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the king in spiritual matters, while the Epistola was sent to deal with purely practical matters, and thus the two do not contradict each other. Flora Spiegel, a writer on Anglo-Saxon literature, {{suggests that the}} theme of comparing the Anglo-Saxons to the Israelites was part of a conversion strategy involving gradual steps, including an explicitly proto-Jewish one between paganism and Christianity. Spiegel sees this as an extension of Gregory's view of Judaism as halfway between Christianity and paganism. Thus, Gregory felt that first the Anglo-Saxons must be brought up to the equivalent of Jewish practices, then after that stage was reached they could be brought completely up to Christian practices.|$|E

40|$|For a {{recently}} developed in-car speed, headway and lane use advisory system, this paper investigates empirically advice validity (advice given in correct traffic circumstances), credibility (advice logical to drivers) and frequency. The {{system has been}} developed to optimize traffic flow by giving advice on a tactical scale. This scale allows traffic flow improvement and fills a gap as most ITS which aim to optimize traffic flow operate on the operational or strategic scale. Using log files of the actual system {{for a period of}} two weeks, the validity, credibility and frequency of <b>advices</b> <b>is</b> determined. Validity is not guaranteed as the <b>advices</b> <b>are</b> determined based on a predicted traffic state due to data delay and as the <b>advices</b> <b>are</b> based on the predicted traffic state 1 minute in the future. Given that the advisory system is a first in its kind, a new methodology was developed to assess the system, based on the use of virtual trajectories and defining indicators to assess, validity, credibility and frequency. The analysis shows that many <b>advices</b> <b>are</b> indeed valid and credible, but some are not, allowing room for improvement. <b>Advice</b> frequency <b>is</b> found to be reasonable. The analysis also shows that in-car filtering of advices, i. e. merging equal <b>advices,</b> <b>is</b> important to lower the frequency. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} content of Dutch {{practice}} nurses' (PNs') advices about weight, nutrition and physical activity to overweight and obese patients. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A 100 videotaped real-life PN consultations (The Netherlands, 2010 / 2011) with overweight or obese patients were selected. An observational checklist was developed to assess frequency and content. Personalization of <b>advices</b> <b>was</b> scored, as also the guidelines on which PNs based their <b>advices.</b> Content analysis <b>was</b> used to identify different categories of advices. RESULTS: About one quarter of advices concerned weight, over two-thirds nutrition and one-third physical activity. Lose weight, eat less fat and be more physically active in general were the main categories {{for each type of}} advice. Despite high clarity of <b>advices,</b> lower scores <b>were</b> found for specificity and personalization. Very few nutrition <b>advices</b> <b>were</b> provided in combination with physical activity advices. CONCLUSIONS: Weight advices often related to the patient's complaint. PNs seldom set a concrete weight goal. Although benefits of physical activity were discussed, often no practical <b>advices</b> <b>were</b> provided about how to achieve this. Integrated lifestyle <b>advice</b> <b>was</b> not common: <b>advices</b> about nutrition and physical activity were fragmented throughout the consultation. Obesity prevention needs more emphasis in PNs' educational programs...|$|R
