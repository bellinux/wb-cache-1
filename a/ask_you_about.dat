2500|$|... — Evans prescribes {{ways for}} Mormons to address what they {{consider}} to be negative portrayals of Mormons in popular media, opining that such portrayals are [...] "ultimately [...] {{the cost of doing business}} as the restored Gospel" [...] and [...] "should receive their proper level of attention on : that is, none at all". Evans exhorts [...] "Let us not respond to evil by debasing ourselves with plaintive campaigns or angry rebuttals; rather, show people what our religion is really about by being the same kind, fun, interesting people we've always been. If people <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the book? Yawn, and respond that people are always saying crazy stuff about the Mormons." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Spoon, old man, when {{leaving you}} last evening I forgot to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> those {{excellent}} cigars. Where {{did you get}} them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Always, even if I come to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the work. I don't want {{anything}} to do with love when I'm at work. Work's work--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> my husband's case," [...] Mrs. Trevennack began, trembling. And {{the great}} specialist, all attention, {{leaned forward and}} listened to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were angry}} with our friends," [...] Dick began, [...] "when they <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> that report of your marriage. You won't {{be angry with}} Me. Are you {{really going to be}} the old maid's husband?" ...|$|R
5000|$|They will <b>ask</b> <b>thee</b> <b>about</b> {{wine and}} maysir. Say, ‘In {{both of them}} there is great sin (ithm) and also some uses for men, but their sin is greater than their usefulness.’ [...] Quran 2: 168/173 ...|$|R
60|$|It touches me to {{read what}} you write of your poor mother. But, of course, at her age, each winter counts heavily. Do give her my love, and tell her that I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's unfortunate,' {{said the}} dwarf, 'for I came, in fact, to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> him. A thought has {{occurred}} to me, Dick; your friend over the way--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I want to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> Harney. Isn't {{there some}} place around here {{where we might}} hide the prisoners? A cave, or {{something}} like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] Brooks said, {{dropping}} his voice a little. [...] "There are {{one or two}} more things which I should like to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Canada." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go below," [...] {{said the}} skipper sternly. The mate walked off. [...] "And {{take care of}} that chap. I’m going ashore. If anybody <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> these scratches, I got ’em in a row down Wapping—D’ye hear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Till now, Jethro, I {{have not}} <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> my father's funeral. When {{is it to}} be? I have thought of it often, but as you did not speak I thought it better not to {{question}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's {{the kind}} of a canter,' says I. 'Shake the New York dust off your hoofs and be a real {{agreeable}} kind of a centaur. You broke the ice, you know, and we're getting better acquainted every minute. Seems to me I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> your family?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{forget that}} I spoke {{my heart to}} you once, and that you kept it to yourself, even though the Boss himself came to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

30|$|I {{found it}} quite hard {{to choose a}} bit this time but this part, {{something}} unusual happened, well unusual {{in the sense that}} someone <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> something and then you go off and follow a path that you never intended to follow I suppose. That’s probably why I picked it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite true, Billie. You {{must not}} tell lies on any account whatever. Now, listen. If he <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> our {{conversation}} this morning, you {{must say that}} I told you you were never to open your lips about the subject again either to me or to him or to anybody. Mr Jenkins is an honourable man, and will not <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a single question after that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And here," [...] {{she said}} suddenly, [...] "here's {{a man you}} know.

6000|$|... "Not exactly, Perkins, {{considering}} I am due at ten o'clock, {{and therefore}} have only {{five minutes to}} stay. I just dropped in to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> something on which you can perhaps advise us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sound asleep, Songbird." [...] Sam {{paused for}} a moment. [...] "Come in," [...] and his chum did so, and Sam closed the door again. [...] "I wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Stanley and Spud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let us talk of {{something}} more interesting,' he said. 'I have a question to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> yourself. Am I right in believing that the sooner you get away from Venice the happier you will be?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then he goes by {{some other}} amongst us,' rejoined the girl, 'which I more than thought before. Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put into your house {{on the night of}} the robbery, I--suspecting this man--listened to a {{conversation}} held between him and Fagin in the dark. I found out, from what I heard, that Monks--the man I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> <b>you</b> know--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And be {{here again}} next Thursday,' {{continued}} he, shunning her puzzled gaze. 'And give him my thanks for permitting you to come--my best thanks, Catherine.

6000|$|... "'That time'," [...] he repeated. [...] "Why man, I {{have but}} just {{returned}} from the arena! You reached here {{almost as soon as}} I.

60|$|CLARE. I've {{thought of}} nursing, but it's a long training, and I do so hate {{watching}} pain. The fact is, I'm pretty hopeless; can't even do art work. I came to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the stage.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't. You mustn't think I {{object to}} people when I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> them. All that I wished {{was that you}} should think {{yourself}} what sort of influence he was. I think he's a very good influence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{century before}} the last? Thank you!" [...] Strether laughed. [...] "If I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> {{some of the}} ladies it can't be then that I may hope, as such a {{specimen}} of the rococo, to please them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I hadn't <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] he said. [...] "You puzzle me horribly." [...] But {{for that}} unendurable sense of perplexity, {{he would still}} have doubted and distrusted her as resolutely as ever. As it was, his bewildered mind unconsciously took its refuge in belief. [...] "If it was medicine," [...] asked the poor {{creature}} vacantly, [...] "what is the medicine good for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is very bad, Stevens," [...] Girdlestone said, {{stopping}} and jerking {{his head in}} the direction of the house. [...] "She is going downhill. I am afraid that she can't last long. If any one <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> her, <b>you</b> can say that she was despaired of. I am just sending off a telegram to a doctor in London, so that she may have the best advice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! old Rough and Tough: {{the picture}} hasn't {{anything}} to do with Peter Wilkins," [...] said Zack. [...] "Keep quiet, and wait here a minute for me. There are some friends of mine {{at the other end of}} the room that I must go and speak to. And, I say, if Blyth comes up to <b>you</b> and <b>asks</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the picture, say it's Columbus, and remarkably like him." ...|$|R
