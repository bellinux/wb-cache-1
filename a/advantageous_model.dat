So the structural and functional changes of the mutant PBSs in vivo can be handily detected by measurement of low temperature (77 K) fluorescence emission spectra. High concentration glycerol induced an obvious disassembly of PBSs and the dissociation of phycocyanins in the rod substructures into their oligomers and monomers. PBSs also disassembled at high temperatures and allophycocyanins were more sensitive to heat stress than phycocyanins.

40|$|The Microviridae are {{increasingly}} becoming {{recognized as one}} of the most globally ubiquitous and highly diverse virus families, and as such, provide an <b>advantageous</b> <b>model</b> for studying virus evolution and adaptation. Here, we utilize microvirus sequences from diverse physiochemical environments, including novel sequences from a high-temperature acidic lake, to chart the outcome of natural selection in the main structural protein of the virus. Each icosahedral microvirus virion is composed of sixty identical capsid proteins that interact along twofold, threefold and fivefold symmetry axis interfaces to encapsidate a small, circular, single-stranded DNA genome. Viable assembly of the virus is guided by scaffolding proteins, which coordinate inter-subunit contacts between the capsid proteins. Structure-based analysis indicates that amino acid sequence conservation is predominantly localized to the twofold axis interface. While preservation of this quaternary interface appears to be essential, tertiary and secondary structural features of the capsid protein are permissive to considerable sequence variation...|$|E

This study aimed to characterize the orthologue of the human NICASTRIN (NCSTN) gene in zebrafish, an <b>advantageous</b> <b>model</b> organism for the study of human disease. Zebrafish Nicastrin protein was predicted to possess the conserved glutamate 333 residue and DYIGS motif of human NCSTN that are important for substrate recognition processing in γ-secretase. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed the profile of relative zebrafish nicastrin (ncstn) transcript levels in embryos at different times during development and in adult tissues. The analysis of synteny conservation revealed local rearrangements of ncstn and another gene, mpz, relative to copa, and pex 19. In situ hybridization showed higher relative levels of ncstn transcripts in the developing brain and otic vesicles of embryos at 24 and 48 h post fertilization, respectively.

40|$|Background: Sexual {{reproduction}} {{entails the}} encounter {{of the sexes}} and the multiplicity of rituals {{is parallel to the}} diversity of mating systems.

Both males and females can possess pheromones that are involved either in close- or long-range communication.

We conducted laboratory experiments to explore the role of scents released during courtship by males of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis.

Tenascin-C, a glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix, is localized along developing axonal pathways {{where it may}} function by repulsion, restricting axons within specific boundaries. The lamprey olfactory pathway offers an <b>advantageous</b> <b>model</b> for studying the role of extracellular matrix proteins in axon guidance because the entire pathway is readily seen in horizontal sections and because lesioning the olfactory nerve will induce the system into a new phase of coordinated neurogenesis and axon outgrowth. Although tenascin-C expression was absent during embryonic development, olfactory nerve fascicles contained tenascin-C-immunoreactivity (IR) during the larval stage. During retrograde degeneration, the fascicles lost tenascin-C-IR. Diffuse unfasciculated axonal processes extending from the olfactory epithelium did not express tenascin-C-IR; however, acetylated tubulin and GAP- 43 -IR was present, indicating axonal outgrowth. When the newly extended axons of olfactory receptor neurons converged to form fascicles, tenascin-C-IR was evident within the fascicular boundaries. The absence of tenascin-C expression when axonal process were short and diffuse, and its return when axons coalesced within fascicles, supports the view that tenascin-C functions as a boundary molecule in the olfactory pathway...|$|E

Such incidents can shatter the construction of the self that has been formed by the individual as well as the ability to form and sustain relationships with others. One of the most important relationships that can be affected is that of a mother and her child. This research paper explores the potential value of drama therapy as a therapeutic approach for strengthening the attachment between women survivors of childhood sexual abuse and their children. The paper begins with an examination of the current state of knowledge about childhood sexual abuse and the impact upon the women who live through this experience as they grow into adulthood and motherhood.

Growing vertebrate oocytes represent an <b>advantageous</b> <b>model</b> to study the principles of nuclear structure and function. In this article, the data on three-dimensional (3 D) organisation of intact and non-deformed oocyte nuclei (germinal vesicles) in four species of birds (domestic chicken, Japanese quail, rock pigeon and chaffinch) obtained by confocal laser scan-ning microscopy are presented. The nucleus of the grow-ing avian oocyte has an unusual structure of RNA processing machinery. Germinal vesicles from any of the avian species studied, {{with the exception of the}} rock pigeon, are characterized by absence of extrachromo-somal RNA-enriched nuclear bodies including Cajal bodies, histone locus bodies and interchromatin granule clusters. The absence of Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies in chicken oocytes correlated with the inacti-vation of nucleolus organizer and clustered histone genes. Splicing factors such as SR-protein SC 35 accumulated in chromosome-associated domains that were classified as complex loops (terminal giant and lumpy loops). Formation of such depot in avian oocyte nuclei is supposed to be nucleated by tran-scripts of non-coding tandem repeats. The results obtained strongly support a model of RNA-mediated nuclear domains formation...|$|E

As nanomaterials get in contact with the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and the respiratory tract, these biological compartments are acting as barriers to the passage of nano-sized materials into the organism. These structural and functional barriers are provided by the epithelia serving as an interface between biological compartments. In order to initiate the reduction, refinement and replacement of time consuming, expensive and stressful (to the animals) in vivo experimental approaches, many in vitro epithelial cell culture models have been developed during the last decades. This review therefore, focuses on the functional as well as structural aspects of epithelial cells as well as the most commonly used in vitro epithelial models of the primary biological barriers with which nanomaterials might come in contact with either occupationally, or during their manufacturing and application.

40|$|Zebra finches utilize neural {{circuits}} in both cerebral hemispheres {{to produce}} their learned songs. Although direct reciprocal connections {{do not exist}} between song control nuclei across hemispheres, premotor activity in these nuclei during singing is precisely and continuously coordinated between the hemispheres. We hypothesized that this interhemispheric coordination is mediated by bilateral feedback projections from medullary and midbrain song control nuclei to the thalamic song control nucleus uvaeformis (Uva). Consistent with our hypothesis, bilateral lesions of Uva severely impaired singing. This impairment was longlasting, as it persisted for at least 35 days after the lesions. Unilateral lesions of Uva on either side also resulted in an immediate singing impairment. However, song recovered substantially after less than 15 days, suggesting a possible compensation by the unlesioned side. Although the acoustic structure of individual syllables recovered fully after unilateral lesioning, subtle changes in the sequencing of syllables were observed after song recovery, suggesting that the lesion led to an alteration in {{the functioning of the}} remaining song control network. These results demonstrate that the adult songbird brain can adjust to damage to certain parts of the song control network and recover from their associated singing deficits.

Self-esteem plays {{a critical role in}} this developmental process. We use self-esteem data measured at mean ages 13, 16 and 22, and anxiety disorder diagnosis at mean age of 33 to examine the impact of development of self-esteem on onset of adult anxiety disorder. To analyze these data, we propose a Bayesian joint model with: (1) a linear mixed effects model for the longitudinal measurements, and (2) a generalized linear model for the binary primary endpoint. Our analysis indicates that the mean level of self-esteem, not the change of self-esteem, significantly predicts the onset of adult anxiety disorder. A comparison shows that the joint model yields better predictive accuracy than a two-step model. The respective area under ROC curve (AUC) is 0. 60 and 0. 75 for the two-step model and the joint model, respectively. The two-step estimate may be biased because this method ignores variability in the individual random effects. We conclude that joint model is the most <b>advantageous</b> <b>model</b> to analyze early life longitudinal data combined with later binary outcome...|$|E

Although {{it is well}} accepted that vessels of a particular organ display specific features {{that enable them to}} fulfill distinct functions, the embryonic origins of tissue-specific vessels and the molecular mechanisms regulating their formation are poorly understood. The subintestinal plexus of the zebrafish embryo comprises vessels that vascularize the gut, liver and pancreas and, as such, represents an ideal model in which to investigate the early steps of organ-specific vessel formation. Here, we show that both arterial and venous components of the subintestinal plexus originate from a pool of specialized angioblasts residing in the floor of the posterior cardinal vein (PCV). Using live imaging of zebrafish embryos, in combination with photoconvertable transgenic reporters, we demonstrate that these angioblasts undergo two phases of migration and differentiation. Initially, a subintestinal vein forms and expands ventrally through a Bone Morphogenetic Protein-dependent step of collective migration. Concomitantly, a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-dependent shift in the directionality of migration, coupled to the upregulation of arterial markers, is observed, which culminates with the generation of the supraintestinal artery. Together, our results establish the zebrafish subintestinal plexus as an <b>advantageous</b> <b>model</b> for the study of organ-specific vessel development and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling its formation.
