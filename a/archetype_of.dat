5|$|While social {{mobility}} was not unknown in Byzantium {{the order of}} society was thought of as more enduring, with the average man regarding the court of Heaven to be the <b>archetype</b> <b>of</b> the imperial court in Constantinople. This society included various classes of people that were neither exclusive nor immutable. The most characteristic were the poor, the peasants, the soldiers, the teachers, entrepreneurs, and clergy.|$|E
5|$|A dwarf, in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy roleplaying game, is a {{humanoid}} race, one of {{the primary}} races available for player characters. The idea for the D dwarf comes from European mythologies and J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and has been used in D and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s. Variations from the standard dwarf <b>archetype</b> <b>of</b> a short and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, of which {{there are more than a}} dozen across many different rule sets and campaign settings.|$|E

5|$|Rand {{did not use}} a {{specific}} architect {{as a model for}} Keating. Her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: the neighbor wanted her material possessions and social standing to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an <b>archetype</b> <b>of</b> this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.|$|E
5|$|The Phra Thinang Dusit Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งดุสิตมหาปราสาท) {{dominates the}} Maha Prasat group. The throne hall {{was built on}} a {{symmetrical}} cruciform plan, the roof is topped with a tall gilded spire. The hall is considered an ideal <b>archetype</b> <b>of</b> Thai traditional architecture. Every aspect of the exterior decoration of the throne hall is imbuded with symbolism. The hall is built {{in the shape of}} a tall mountain to represent Mount Meru, the mythological centre of the universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{little that}} is known of Mac Scelling {{suggests}} {{that he was an}} early <b>archetype</b> <b>of</b> what latter became known as gallowglasses, heavily-armed mercenaries, recruited from the West Highlands and Islands of Scotland by Irish rulers in later centuries. Although first specifically recorded in {{the last decade of the}} thirteenth century, gallowglasses were almost certainly utilised at least a generation before. The aforesaid apparent reference to Mac Scelling by La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande could be evidence that he had taken up residence in Ireland like later gallowglasses.|$|E

The {{first is to}} reveal the <b>archetypes</b> <b>of</b> hero in The Complete Grimm’s Fairy Tales, the second is to reveal the <b>archetypes</b> <b>of</b> hero’s journey in The Complete Grimm’s Fairy Tales {{and the third is}} to reveal the literary methods used to reveal those archetypes. Jung’s archetype is the basis of analysis employed in this research. This research used qualitative approach. Content analysis is used as the technique of analysis of the short stories. The subject of this research is five fairy tales entitled “The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was”, “The Devil with Three Golden Hairs”, “The Golden Goose”, “The Water of Life” and “The King’s Son Who Feared Nothing”; all of which are compiled in The Complete Grimm’s Fairy Tales written by The Grimm’s Brothers. The data were some sentences and utterances showing the <b>archetypes</b> <b>of</b> hero and hero’s journey. The researcher collected the data using read-write technique. The data analysis dealt with the process of data reducing, data displays and conclusion drawing. To obtain trustworthiness, the researcher used triangulation technique. There are three results of this research. First, there are four <b>archetypes</b> <b>of</b> hero in five fairy tales employed, namely innocent, single-parented, special environment of birth, and noble hearted hero. Second, there are mainly eleven stages among twelve stages <b>of</b> the <b>archetypes</b> <b>of</b> hero’s journey found, namely Ordinary World, Call of Adventure, Meeting with the Mentor, Crossing the First Threshold, Test, Allies and Enemies, Approach to the Inmost Cave, The Ordeal, The Reward, The Road Back, The Resurrection, and Return with the Elixir with the absence of one stage namely Refusal of The Call. Third, the <b>archetypes</b> <b>of</b> hero are mainly revealed by character revelation, mostly through actions and speeches, the <b>archetypes</b> <b>of</b> hero’s journey are presented through plot and setting of time and place...|$|R

5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes are disproportionately large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the <b>archetype</b> <b>of</b> the vengeful mother, influenced by Eugène Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Martín Quesada establishes {{a context of}} wealthy characters. Quesada is a businessman and Formula 1 driver, but is not presented as selfish or greedy as is the <b>archetype</b> <b>of</b> entrepreneurs in soap operas. The two locations associated with him are the Quesada Group office, presided over by him, and his home. The office has the characters of Quesada's chief adviser Alfredo Uribe, the secretary Mercedes, and his cousin Miguel Quesada, who serves as vice-president, and the lawyer Felix Perez Garmendia. His girlfriend Constanza Insua and his cousin Debbie are also included. Martín lives with his housekeeper Rosa, Rosa's grandson Tony, and three adopted orphan siblings, José, Laura, and Coqui. Another recurring site is the apartment of Miguel and Debbie, which would be also used as the house of Constanza or Garmendia if needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{literary}} critic G. Koster writes that, when writing Siti Akbari, Lie Kim Hok was {{limited by the}} formulaic Pandji romances and syair poems common in Malay literature at the time. Koster notes basic structural similarities between Siti Akbari and the existing poetic forms. The work followed the <b>archetype</b> <b>of</b> a hero or heroine going from a lawful kingdom into exile then into a chaotic kingdom, one which Koster suggests {{is representative of the}} cycle of oral law. Such an archetype and formulas were used in contemporary works such as Syair Siti Zubaidah Perang Cina (Poem on Siti Zubaidah and the War against China). The plot device of a woman passing herself as a man to do war was likewise common in Malay and Javanese literature. Lie deviated greatly from the established traditions, mixing European and native literary influences.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Todd Garth {{argues that}} I, the Supreme is {{influenced}} by twentieth-century Argentine writer Macedonio Fernández, {{as well as other}} avant garde artists such as Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar. Garth suggests that Macedonio and Roa Bastos are similar in use of metaphysical language and techniques used to reconstruct reality, as Dr. Francia does in his dictated creation of the Supreme, the ruler of all reality. Macedonio's writing utilized characters that did not fit the <b>archetype</b> <b>of</b> Western fiction, each only having meaning through their interaction with others in a collective and often never experiencing growth or development in order to construct atemporal spaces of mythmaking that challenge reality. Roa Bastos borrows from these ideas yet situates them in existing political and social history to challenge perceived conceptions of the past's factuality. He dismantles national Paraguayan mythology which is so intimately intertwined with the life of Dr. Francia, elucidating the distinctions between mythic and mythological. The novel can only accomplish this task within the metaphysical space of mythmaking. Whereas Macedonio attacks the concept of the individual as subject while admitting the fact that to write makes oneself a subject, Roa Bastos recognizes this paradox and exploits it, utilizing it in concerns of political and social nature.|$|E
5|$|Mac Scelling (fl. 11541173/1174), {{also known}} as Mac Scilling, was a {{prominent}} twelfth-century military commander engaged in conflicts throughout Ireland. He is first recorded in 1154 commanding the maritime forces of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain in a bloody encounter against Toirrdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. Muirchertach's naval forces were drawn from the western peripheries of Scotland and the Isles. He next appears on record in 1173/1174, supporting the cause of Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht against the English colonisation of Mide. An early modern Scottish source claims that {{a man of the}} same name was a bastard son of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles. If Mac Scelling was indeed related to Somairle, this relationship could cast light on the latter's conflict with Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of the Isles, a man who appears to have opposed Muirchertach at some point in his career. Although not termed so in contemporary sources, Mac Scelling may be regarded as an early <b>archetype</b> <b>of</b> later gallowglasses, heavily-armed Scottish mercenaries recruited by Irish rulers in centuries that followed.|$|E
