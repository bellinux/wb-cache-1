5|$|The {{game has}} two endings, a good ending <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> ending. The good ending {{can only be}} {{achieved}} by completing secret minigames, in which various animatronic characters bring a cake to {{what seems to be}} a sorrowful child's soul. This ending is thought to imply that the souls of the murdered children have been set free, although connoted meanings are disputed.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of Trollope's triangles, Mary is not called upon to judge between a good suitor <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> one, but between two good men. Gilmore {{is presented as a}} sympathetic and admirable character; the reader learns far less about Captain Marrable's character, and is given no reason why Mary should prefer him to his rival. To Trollope, a woman does not necessarily fall in love because of a man's merits; and it is very wrong for a woman to marry where she does not love, regardless of her suitor's worthy qualities.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{she had her}} {{breakout}} film role as {{the title}} character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. She has since appeared {{in a number of}} comedy films, including Couples Retreat (2009), When in Rome (2010), You Again (2010), The Boss (2016), Bad Moms (2016) <b>and</b> <b>A</b> <b>Bad</b> Moms Christmas (2017). Bell garnered further recognition for voicing Princess Anna in the Disney animated fantasy film Frozen (2013), the short films Frozen Fever (2015) and Olaf's Frozen Adventure (2017), and the upcoming Frozen 2 (2019). From 2012 to 2016, she starred as Jeannie van der Hooven, the female lead on the Showtime series House of Lies. Since 2016, she has starred in the main role of Eleanor Shellstrop on the NBC comedy series The Good Place.|$|E

5|$|Scotland {{failed to}} qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, {{finishing}} third in their qualifying group behind Croatia and Belgium. This second successive failure to qualify prompted Craig Brown to resign from his position after the final qualifying match. The SFA appointed former Germany manager Berti Vogts as Brown's successor. Scotland reached the qualification play-offs for Euro 2004. Scotland beat Netherlands 1–0 at Hampden Park, but suffered a 6–0 defeat in the return leg. Poor results in friendly matches <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> start to the 2006 World Cup qualification caused the team to drop to a record low of 77th in the FIFA World Rankings. Vogts announced his resignation in 2004, blaming the hostile media for his departure.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat in}} Mile High Stadium {{proved to be}} the last of Cleveland's streak of playoff {{appearances}} in the mid- to late-1980s. Kosar played through numerous injuries in 1989, including bruising on his right arm <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> knee. Strong defense had carried the Browns to the playoffs even when the offense faltered, but that all crumbled in 1990. Kosar threw more interceptions than touchdowns {{for the first time in}} his career, and the defense allowed more points than any other in the league. The Browns' 2–7 start cost Carson his job. Jim Shofner was named interim head coach, and the team finished 3–13. After the season Bill Belichick, the defensive coordinator of the then-Super Bowl champion New York Giants, was named head coach.|$|E
