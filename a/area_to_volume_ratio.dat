5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread out position it allows {{for an increase in}} surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very close to the surface allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|The common {{features}} of passive solar architecture are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio),</b> selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes {{is determined by the}} bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
50|$|In warm climates, Allen's rule {{predicts that}} animals should have {{comparatively}} high <b>ratios</b> of surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume.</b> Because animals with low surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> will overheat quickly, Allen's rule predicts that animals in warm climates should have high surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> <b>to</b> maximize {{the surface area}} by which they dissipate heat, allowing them to dissipate more heat.|$|R
2500|$|Smaller organisms tend to {{have higher}} surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios,</b> causing them <b>to</b> gain {{resources}} at a proportionally higher rate than large organisms. [...] As a consequence, small organisms can have higher volume-specific metabolic rates.|$|R
50|$|Increased {{surface area}} {{can also lead}} to {{biological}} problems. More contact with the environment through the surface of a cell or an organ (relative <b>to</b> its <b>volume)</b> increases loss of water and dissolved substances. High surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> also present problems of temperature control in unfavorable environments.|$|R
5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E
25|$|Tropical forest {{clearing}} {{efforts by}} humans has detrimented {{the survival of}} Eciton burchellii colonies. Since they are above-ground foragers, they are extremely sensitive to forest clearing and habitat destruction. These habitats have more variable ground-level temperatures, exposure to direct sunlight, and increased visibility. Insects, in general, are very vulnerable {{to the effects of}} dehydration because of their large surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> Survival in the exposed conditions brought about by forest clearing is physiologically difficult.|$|E
25|$|Among the Platonic solids, {{either the}} dodecahedron or the {{icosahedron}} {{may be seen}} as the best approximation to the sphere. The icosahedron has the largest number of faces and the largest dihedral angle, it hugs its inscribed sphere the most tightly, and its surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> is closest to that of a sphere of the same size (i.e. either the same surface area or the same volume.) The dodecahedron, on the other hand, has the smallest angular defect, the largest vertex solid angle, and it fills out its circumscribed sphere the most.|$|E
50|$|In cold climates, Allen's rule {{predicts that}} animals should have {{comparatively}} low <b>ratios</b> of surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume.</b> Because animals in cold climates need to conserve as much heat as possible, Allen's rule predicts {{that they should}} have low surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> <b>to</b> minimize the surface area by which they dissipate heat, allowing them to retain more heat.|$|R
50|$|Decreasing day {{period and}} {{dropping}} temperatures {{have been found}} to initiate the production of juvenile hormone. This represses the development of gonadal activity, mating behaviors, and egg-laying. While in diapause new behaviors emerge such as the development of social nectaring groups and late afternoon formation of night-time clusters or roosts. Roosting reduces water loss, probably due <b>to</b> decreased surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> reducing evaporative water loss.|$|R
5000|$|The iron {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} {{a lack of}} iron in the ecosystem prevents phytoplankton from achieving an algal bloom. [...] Iron is necessary for nitrogen fixation which is required for the production of amino acids. [...] This iron limitation inhibits the growth of larger phytoplankton, such as diatoms. Instead, HNLC regions are characterized by small phytoplankton flagellates which can take up iron at lower concentrations due <b>to</b> greater surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|R
25|$|The common ostrich is a xeric animal, due to {{the fact}} that it lives in {{habitats}} that are both dry and hot. Water is scarce in dry and hot environment, and this poses a challenge to the ostrich's water consumption. Also the ostrich is a ground bird and cannot fly to find water sources, which poses a further challenge. Because of their size, common ostriches cannot easily escape the heat of their environment; however, they dehydrate less than their small bird counterparts because of their small surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> Hot, arid habitats pose osmotic stress, such as dehydration, which triggers the common ostrich’s homeostatic response to osmoregulate.|$|E
25|$|Water {{regulation}} {{is an important}} aspect of centipede ecology, since they lose water rapidly in dry conditions and are found in moist microhabitats. Water loss is a result of centipedes lacking a waxy covering of their exoskeleton and excreting waste nitrogen as ammonia, which requires extra water. Centipedes deal with water loss through a variety of adaptations. Geophilomorphs lose water less rapidly than lithobiomorphs, though they have a greater surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> This may be because geophilomorphs have a more heavily sclerotized pleural membrane. Spiracle shape, size, and ability to constrict also have an influence on rate of water loss. In addition, the number and size of coxal pores may be variables affecting centipede water balance.|$|E
25|$|In {{conventional}} cell culture, {{growth is}} restricted to one plane, causing monolayer formation with most cells contacting the surface; however, the 3D curvature of the aragonite surface allows multiple layers to develop and for astrocytes far apart to contact each other. It is important to promote process formation similar to 3D in vivo conditions, because astrocytic process morphology is essential in guiding directionality of regenerating axons. The aragonite topography provides a high surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> and lacks edges, {{which leads to a}} reduction of the culture edge effect. Crystalline matrices such as the aragonite mentioned here are allowed for the promotion of a complex 3D tissue formation that approaches in vivo conditions.|$|E
50|$|Heat is {{primarily}} generated in muscle tissue, including the heart, {{and in the}} liver, while it is lost through the skin (90%) and lungs (10%). Heat production may be increased two- to four-fold through muscle contractions (i.e. exercise and shivering). The rate of heat loss is determined, as with any object, by convection, conduction, and radiation. The rates of these can be affected by body mass index, body surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios,</b> clothing and other environmental conditions.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of using semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) and polyethylene-based passive sampler devices (PSDs) for monitoring PAHs in stormwater. Firstly, SPMDs were deployed at one site and SPMD-derived water concentrations were compared with water concentration measured from grab samples. In a subsequent deployment the performance of SPMDs and PSDs was compared. Finally PSDs of multiple surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> were used <b>to</b> compare PAH concentrations at the two sites. The results obtained in this study show that SPMDs can be used to measure the water concentration of PAHs with reasonable accuracy, when compared with grab samples collected at the same site. Importantly, several PAHs which could not be detected in a 10 L grab sample could be detected in the SPMDs. PSD and SPMD samplers produced similar results when deployed at the same site, with most estimated water concentrations within a factor of 1. 5. The use of PSDs in multiple surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> proved <b>to</b> be an effective means of characterizing the uptake kinetics for PAHs in situ. Overall passive water samplers proved to be an efficient technique for monitoring PAHs in stormwater...|$|R

25|$|In higher plants thylakoids are {{organized}} into a granum-stroma membrane assembly. A granum (plural grana) is {{a stack of}} thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or lamellae. Grana thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. Grana contribute to chloroplasts' large surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio.</b> Different interpretations of electron tomography imaging of thylakoid membranes has resulted in two models for grana structure. Both posit that lamellae intersect grana stacks in parallel sheets, though whether these sheets intersect in planes perpendicular to the grana stack axis, or are arranged in a right-handed helix is debated.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{explored}} the thermoregulatory capacity of rodent tails by subjecting test organisms to {{varying levels of}} physical activity and quantifying heat conduction via the animals' tails. One study demonstrated a significant disparity in heat dissipation from a rat's tail relative to its abdomen. This observation was attributed to the higher proportion of vascularity in the tail, {{as well as its}} higher surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio,</b> which directly relates to heat's ability to dissipate via the skin. These findings were confirmed in a separate study analyzing the relationships of heat storage and mechanical efficiency in rodents that exercise in warm environments. In this study, the tail was a focal point in measuring heat accumulation and modulation.|$|E

50|$|Aggregations {{are common}} among diapausing {{tropical}} insects, {{especially in the}} orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera. Aggregations {{may be used as}} protection against predation, since aggregating species are frequently toxic and predators quickly learn to avoid them. They can also serve to reduce water loss, as seen in the fungus beetle, Stenotarsus rotundus, which forms aggregations of up to 70,000 individuals, which may be eight beetles deep. Relative humidity is increased within the aggregations and beetles experience less water loss, probably due <b>to</b> decreased surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios</b> reducing evaporative water loss.|$|R
40|$|NEMS is {{an acronym}} for Nanoelectromechanical systems. NEMS have the {{potential}} to extend device miniaturization to the molecular level. NEMS are synthetic devices with functionality at the nanometer on a length scale (between 1 and 100 nm). The term NEMS is often applied to electromechanical systems operating at the meso-length scale (between nano and micro). NEMS have structural elements at or below 100 nm, microelectromechancial systems (MEMS), have structural elements on the micrometer length scale.

50|$|Rangeomorphs dwelt {{in shallow}} to abyssal marine environments, {{were unable to}} move, and had no {{apparent}} reproductive organs, perhaps reproducing asexually by dropping off new fronds. There is little evidence of a gut or mouth, while the organisms have high surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratios,</b> {{which has led to}} the hypothesis that they gathered nutrients from seawater by osmosis. However, others argue this is implausible and suggest filter feeding or other mechanisms. Most were attached to the sea floor by a stalk or holdfast, although others (such as the spindle-shaped Fractofusus) lay flat on the sediment surface.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{phenomena}} become pronounced as {{the size}} of the system decreases. These include statistical mechanical effects, as well as quantum mechanical effects, for example the [...] "quantum size effect" [...] where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called quantum realm. Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the increase in surface <b>area</b> <b>to</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics.
