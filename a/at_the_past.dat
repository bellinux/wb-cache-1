25|$|This {{account is}} {{consistent}} with teleological explanations of life, which account for phenomena in terms of purpose or goal-directedness. Thus, the whiteness of the polar bear's coat is explained by its purpose of camouflage. The direction of causality (from the future to the past) is in contradiction with the scientific evidence for natural selection, which explains the consequence {{in terms of a}} prior cause. Biological features are explained not by looking at future optimal results, but by looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> evolutionary history of a species, which led to the natural selection of the features in question.|$|E

Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) finally gets evidence of Dr. Arden's (James Cromwell) horrific past, but puts someone's life and her career at stake as Arden, Monsignor Howard (Joseph Fiennes), and Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe) indirectly form an evil union. Lana (Sarah Paulson) remains a hostage of Dr. Thredson (Zachary Quinto), but is told what set him off onto his dark path. Chloë Sevigny guest stars as Shelley.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese wolf {{inhabited}} Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu islands but not Hokkaido Island. This {{indicates that}} its ancestor may have migrated from the Asian continent through the Korean Peninsula into Japan. The phylogenetic tree generated from its mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed a long branch {{that separated the}} Japanese wolf from other gray wolf populations and that {{it belongs to the}} ancient mDNA haplogroup 2 (represented today by the Italian wolf and scattered pockets of other wolves across Eurasia), while the Hokkaido wolf belongs to mDNA haplogroup 1 and this suggests that the Japanese wolf was the first arrival on the Japanese archipelago with the Hokkaido wolf arriving more recently from the north. The wolf was estimated to have arrived in Japan during the Late Pleistocene between 25,000–125,000 years ago, however a more recent study that looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> sea levels of the Korean Strait together with the timing of the Japanese wolf sequences indicated that it arrived to the southern islands less than 20,000 YBP.|$|E

[...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E
500|$|At Woodland Hills, Akeelah meets Dylan Chiu, a Chinese American {{boy who had}} won {{second place}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two {{national}} spelling bees. Contemptuous, he asks her to spell [...] "xanthosis". When she starts with a [...] "z", he tells her she needs a coach. At {{the conclusion of the}} spelling club meeting, Javier invites Akeelah to his birthday party. At the party, Akeelah nearly beats Dylan in Scrabble. The boy is reprimanded by his father for nearly losing to [...] "a little black girl". After the party, Tanya is depressed over her husband's death and concerned about her daughter's grades and frequent truancy. As she finds out about Akeelah going alone to Woodland Hills, she subsequently forbids Akeelah from participating in the upcoming state bee. To circumvent this prohibition, Akeelah forges her deceased father's signature on the consent form and secretly studies with Dr. Larabee. During the state bee, Tanya comes inside and interrupts her daughter before she can spell her word. Tanya relents after a side discussion with Dr. Larabee and Mr. Welch. Javier protects Akeelah from disqualification by stalling until she can return. Dylan, Javier and Akeelah advance to the Scripps National Spelling Bee.|$|E
500|$|Childe was {{a proponent}} of the culture-historical {{approach}} to archaeology, coming {{to be seen as}} one of its [...] "founders and chief exponents". Culture-historical archaeology revolved around the concept of [...] "culture", which it had adopted from anthropology. This has been seen as [...] "a major turning point {{in the history of the}} discipline", allowing archaeologists to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> through a spatial dynamic rather than simply a temporal one. Childe adopted the concept of [...] "culture" [...] from German philologist and archaeologist Gustav Kossinna, before using it in three of his books [...] The Dawn of European Civilisation (1925), The Aryans (1926) and The Most Ancient East (1928) [...] without defining it. He proceeded to give it a specifically archaeological definition in The Danube in Prehistory (1929). There, he defined a [...] "culture" [...] as being a set of [...] "regularly associated traits" [...] in the material culture [...] i.e. [...] "pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites, house forms" [...] that are repeatedly found across a certain area. He stated that in this respect a [...] "culture" [...] was the archaeological equivalent of a [...] "people". Childe's use of the term was non-racial, and he considered a [...] "people" [...] to be a social grouping, not a biological race. He opposed the equation of archaeological cultures with biological races, as various nationalists were doing in Europe at the time, and was a vociferous critic of Nazi uses of archaeology, arguing that the Jewish people were not a distinct biological race but a socio-cultural grouping.|$|E

2500|$|Feminist historians see mainly two {{specific}} histories. The {{first is}} the public, singular history. It is composed of political events and newspapers. The second {{is made up of}} women’s history and analyzed primary sources. The integration of these two histories helps historians to look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> with a more feminist lens, the way feminist historians do. Professor Peter G. Filene of the University of North Carolina recounted in his paper Integrating Women’s History and Regular History that “ purpose is to help students understand the values and behavior of people who are unlike themselves. Through history we enter other lives, analyze the forces that shaped those lives, and ultimately understand patterns of culture." [...] In fact, when Filene was asked to teach a course on the history of American women, the revelations of past women allowed him to recognize that he wasn’t learning heroine history, or herstory, but a compensatory history. However, this thought limited his studies. He found himself thinking of women’s contributions to what men had already written down. Rather than having the histories of the ‘public’ and the ‘domestic’ sphere, one should know that this line between the two is imaginary.|$|E
2500|$|American Jews have {{displayed}} {{a very strong}} interest in foreign affairs, especially regarding Germany in the 1930s, and Israel since 1945. [...] Both major parties have made strong commitments in support of Israel. [...] Dr. Eric Uslaner of the University of Maryland argues, {{with regard to the}} 2004 election: [...] "Only 15% of Jews said that Israel was a key voting issue. Among those voters, 55% voted for Kerry (compared to 83% of Jewish voters not concerned with Israel)." [...] Uslander goes on to point out that negative views of Evangelical Christians had a distinctly negative impact for Republicans among Jewish voters, while Orthodox Jews, traditionally more conservative in outlook as to social issues, favored the Republican Party. A New York Times article suggests that the Jewish movement to the Republican party is focused heavily on faith-based issues, similar to the Catholic vote, which is credited for helping President Bush taking Florida in 2004. However, Natan Guttman, The Forward’s Washington bureau chief, dismisses this notion, writing in Moment that while [...] "t is true that Republicans are making small and steady strides into the Jewish community…a look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> three decades of exit polls, which are more reliable than pre-election polls, and the numbers are clear: Jews vote overwhelmingly Democratic," [...] an assertion confirmed by the most recent presidential election results.|$|E
