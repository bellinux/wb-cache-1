5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him {{that they did not have}} to dig because somebody already dug the coffin up and scratched the lid up. While they drive off with the body, Abbott inspects a dead tree. The creature is within and it eviscerates Abbott.|$|E

The surface-to-air missiles or multiple launch rocket systems were being offered by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd. and Israel Military Industries Ltd., both based in Israel.

It is available on prescription, subject to a licence to trap badgers from Natural England, but only where injections are carried out by trained vaccinators. Defra funded a programme of vaccinations in 2010/11, and other organisations that have funded smaller vaccination programmes include the National Trust in Devon, the Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, and a joint project by the National Farmers' Union and the Badger Trust.|$|E

25|$|A {{person may}} become {{caught in a}} ‘catch-22’ situation: {{if they want to}} become a citizen of their new country, but cannot until they have renounced their {{existing}} citizenship, they are unable to renounce their New Zealand citizenship and the Minister of Internal Affairs will not register the renunciation of their New Zealand citizenship, because the law specifies that a person must <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> citizenship of at least one other country at the time of applying for renunciation of New Zealand citizenship. Therefore, for example, an individual who only has New Zealand citizenship {{will never be able to}} apply for Singaporean citizenship because once her Singaporean citizenship application has been approved, she must first renounce her existing nationality before she can attend a Singaporean citizenship ceremony and officially obtain Singaporean nationality.|$|E
25|$|Hulu {{is unable}} to launch in Canada due to the {{relatively}} small size of Canada's online advertising market and because Canada's television networks <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> exclusive online streaming rights in Canada to several titles offered on Hulu, including many mainstream American television network programs. The absence of Hulu in the Canadian market raised concerns by fans of the sitcom The Mindy Project when it was cancelled by Fox {{in the spring of}} 2015 and subsequently picked up by Hulu; the show's Canadian broadcaster, City, subsequently announced it would continue to air the series in Canada. At present, Canadian consumers have access to several other streaming systems, including a Canadian version of Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, CraveTV and Crackle, but with CraveTV streaming some programming from inaccessible-to-Canadian-viewers platforms such as Hulu.|$|E

A number of Aquatic ships are destroyed, which buys the Reptilians {{enough time to}} finally activate the codes. Dolim (Scott MacDonald) has the superweapon enter a vortex and heads for Earth, escorted by allied ships. Inside one of the vessels, having witnessed the interference of the Guardians, the Insectoid leader begins to doubt the motives of the Reptilians. Since the Reptilians <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Insectoid's launch code, they dissolve their alliance by destroying the Insectoid's ship. Archer makes a plan to pursue Dolim using Degra's faster spaceship, taking a sickened Sato with his team to guide them through the superweapon.|$|E
500|$|Albatrosses reach sexual {{maturity}} slowly, after about five years, but even {{once they have}} reached maturity, they will not begin to breed for another couple of years (even up to 10 years for some species). Young non-breeders will attend a colony prior to beginning to breed, spending many years practising the elaborate breeding rituals and [...] "dances" [...] that the family is famous for. Birds arriving back at the colony {{for the first time}} <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> stereotyped behaviours that compose albatross language, but can neither [...] "read" [...] that behaviour as exhibited by other birds nor respond appropriately. After a period of trial and error learning, the young birds learn the syntax and perfect the dances. This language is mastered more rapidly if the younger birds are around older birds.|$|E

I just fell in love with it; it gets under your skin. Woodside Petroleum are planning to build one of the world's biggest LNG (liquified natural gas) processing plants on the Kimberley coast, just north of Broome. They would be drilling for the gas out at sea and bringing it onshore at this plant, which would just be devastating for the region. The question everyone is asking is, why not process it offshore or pipe it to one of the mining towns down south that <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> infrastructure in place?

500|$|Once {{the site}} of a castle had been selected– whether a {{strategic}} position or one intended to dominate the landscape as a mark of power– the building material had to be selected. An earth and timber castle was cheaper and easier to erect than one built from stone. The costs involved in construction are not well-recorded, and most surviving records relate to royal castles. A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, and timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an unskilled workforce. The source of man-power was probably from the local lordship, and the tenants would <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> necessary skills of felling trees, digging, and working timber necessary for an earth and timber castle. Possibly coerced into working for their lord, the construction of an earth and timber castle would not have been a drain on a client's funds. In terms of time, {{it has been estimated that}} an average sized motte– [...] high and [...] wide at the summit– would have taken 50people about 40working days. An exceptionally expensive motte and bailey was that of Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 for £20. The high cost, relative to other castles of its type, was because labourers had to be imported.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing and}} {{recording}} for her debut album, Stefani cited her major influences as Club Nouveau, Lisa Lisa, Prince, New Order, The Cure and early Madonna and advised the producers and writers {{that she wanted}} a similar sound for the album. According to MTV's Jennifer Vineyard, musician and songwriter Linda Perry [...] "put Gwen in a headlock" [...] during a party after the Grammys and told her they could make beautiful music together"; however, Stefani felt scared and insecure about working with Perry. While recording at Perry's house, Stefani was initially insecure about her writing process and [...] "would go into another room to try to write some lyrics, {{and when she came}} back, Perry would <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> whole song nailed." [...] After a writing session where [...] "What You Waiting For?" [...] was created, Stefani became less insecure and felt more comfortable when making songs. After working with other musicians, Stefani and Perry worked together on [...] "The Real Thing". On October 3, 2005, Interscope Records released the song as a promotional single exclusively in the Philippines. The label released a CD single, which featured the album version and a remix by Wendy & Lisa of the song.|$|E
