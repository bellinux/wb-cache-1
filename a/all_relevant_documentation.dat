5000|$|A postulator, {{instructed}} by the petitioner, initiates a cause by presenting {{to the bishop}} of the diocese where the candidate for beatification died, a written petition with supporting documentation. The documentation must include (i) a biography of the candidate, {{or at least a}} chronology of his life, indicating the heroic virtues and sanctity of life or the martyrdom that justifies beatification; (ii) authentic copies of all the candidate's writings; and (iii) in recent cases, a list of those persons who can help [...] "bring to light the truth about the virtues or the martyrdom of the candidate, and about his or her reputation of sanctity or of signs miracles." [...] The bishop decides whether to accept the petition. If accepted, the cause must be discussed with the bishops of neighboring dioceses and publicized so that anyone with relevant information might come forward and make it known. The candidate's writings are examined to see if they present theological difficulties. If problems or obstacles emerge, the postulator is given an opportunity to resolve them. Once the way is clear for the cause to proceed, the bishop will initiates the diocesan inquiry stage of the process, which is divided into two separate areas of investigation: the inquiry into heroic virtues or martyrdom; and the inquiry into [...] "signs" [...] or miracles, normally medical in nature, that are attributed to the intercession of the candidate. The postulator identifies the relevant witnesses, but is not allowed to testify while serving as postulator. [...] When the bishop or his delegate has completed these inquiries, the postulator has the right to examine the official record and supplement it as he needs to.

30|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{uncertainties}} that surround the fulfillment of sustainability criteria, their influence on the market development, their impacts on sustainability, and their indirect effects on other markets and policies [48], continuous monitoring of how sustainability criteria are functioning is desirable. A voluntary sustainability standard might require an explicit confirmation of the host state that a project in its territory contributes to sustainable development [49]. It is advisable that monitoring of how the sustainability criteria are fulfilled is transparent [50], which implies that all necessary information is freely available and directly accessible {{to those who are}} affected by sustainability criteria and their implementation.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe the development of a collective QS for eight Dutch General Practitioner (GP) specialty training institutes to provide insights into the considerations that are involved in developing a QS in medical education. METHODS: Experts in the field of GP education and quality assurance developed the QS. They studied the literature, prior QSs and involved stakeholders. The team interviewed the directors, and all meetings and steps in the development process were transcribed. <b>All</b> interviews and <b>relevant</b> <b>documentation</b> were analyzed. Results were checked by the developers. RESULTS: Stakeholders agreed on the goals, the relevance of the resulting domains, and the methods to assess. However, one major theme emerged. To enable benchmarking, the team developed detailed quantifiable indicators. Especially the development of these indicators gave discussion. CONCLUSIONS: Involving stakeholders was crucial as they directed the development of the QS. The framework of the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) provided guidance in covering <b>all</b> the <b>relevant</b> processes. The major challenge consisted of formulating indicators. Our experience indicates that the process of quantifying indicators is not straightforward.

We report on the adaptations development, approval and implementation process from the Project Accept voluntary counseling and testing, community mobilization and post-test support services intervention. Methods We reviewed <b>all</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>documentation</b> collected during the study intervention period (e. g. monthly progress reports; bi-annual steering committee presentations) and {{conducted a series of}} semi-structured interviews with project directors and between 12 and 23 field staff at each study site in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Thailand and Tanzania during 2009. Respondents were asked to describe (1) the adaptations development and approval process and (2) the most successful site-specific adaptations from the perspective of facilitating intervention implementation. Results Across sites, proposed adaptations were identified by field staff and submitted to project directors for review on a formally planned basis. The cross-site intervention sub-committee then ensured fidelity to the study protocol before approval. Successfully-implemented adaptations included: intervention delivery adaptations (e. g. development of tailored counseling messages for immigrant labour groups in South Africa) political, environmental and infrastructural adaptations (e. g. use of local community centers as VCT venues in Zimbabwe); religious adaptations (e. g. dividing clients by gender in Muslim areas of Tanzania); economic adaptations (e. g. co-provision of income generating skills classes in Zimbabwe); epidemiological adaptations (e. g. provision of ‘youth-friendly’ services in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Tanzania), and social adaptations (e. g. modification of terminology to local dialects in Thailand: and adjustment of service delivery schedules to suit seasonal and daily work schedules across sites).

40|$|So you are {{thinking}} about implementing a smart grid infrastructure. You have read <b>all</b> the <b>relevant</b> <b>documentation</b> and standards {{and looked at the}} newest and most innovative technologies. You have even talked to existing smart grid users about their experience. But with all of that information there is still this lingering question – is smart grid the right path for my utility? The traditional model to support your decision process is a cost-benefit analysis. More often than not, these analyses follow a feature oriented approach. Starting from technology, the customer implementation environment is evaluated and a path is suggested to realize certain benefits offered by a specific feature. Furthermore smart metering is frequently focused on efficiency improvements to the key utility operational processes. This is even truer for the gas industry: some of the major smart metering drivers for the electricity utilities such as peak load reduction or load control do not apply to gas. Especially in the quickly developing countries, operational efficiency is not a key factor either – low labor costs often outbalance the substantial cost of a smart meter implementation. In this paper Itron introduces its consultancy service for gas utilities that follows a much broader, problem focused approach. Instead of starting from features and afterwards finding problems that can be solved with this technology, Itron’s consulting services take a technological neutral standpoint and focus on the core building blocks that make up a gas utilities’ business model to identify relevant external and internal risks. In his article, André Wankelmuth, director of strategic market development at Itron, provides insight into Itron’s methodology and puts a special focus on key findings as they relate to the Turkish market...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. (Business Management) Research and Development (R&D) {{facilities}} {{have been used}} to develop new or better products and services for a long time. Organisations utilise knowledge gained from their R&D facilities to gain access to new markets and to improve the organisation’s competitiveness in the market. R&D facilities are referred to as learning organisations that employ people who specialise in specific technologies. These employees are referred to as ‘knowledge employees’. Sasol R&D was formed in 1955 to assist the organisation to develop and improve the Fischer-Tropch (F-T) technology that was adopted by the organisation to produce synthetic fuels from coal. At the time the technology had not been sufficiently proven on a commercial scale and this necessitated that research be conducted to ensure that the processes related to (F-T) technology are efficiently operated. The use of the knowledge generated by Sasol R&D has resulted in Sasol being recognised as the world leader in F-T technology and has led to joint ventures with other organisations around the world. The management of acquired knowledge has been critical in the development of Sasol and the successes that the organisation has enjoyed. It is therefore important that the employees of Sasol and those of Sasol R&D are well equipped to utilise the knowledge that was generated by previous employees to continuously improve and develop technologies. The objective {{of this study was to}} establish the perception that knowledge employees have of Knowledge Management (KM) and what Sasol R&D can improve on in this regard, i. e. business performance and individual employees’ career development. Respondents generally agree with the importance of KM in Sasol R&D and also indicated that a successful KM strategy can help improve individuals’ careers. The respondents also indicated that they were familiar with the concept of KM and the advantages for the organisation in the successful implementation of such a KM strategy. The main recommendations from the study are: 1. Employees should be involved in current the future KM strategies that the management of Sasol R&D wants to implement. 2. The adopted KM strategy’s objectives and benefits should be made clear and understandable to all employees. In addition, <b>all</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>documentation</b> should be made available to the employees...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Owner {{companies}} should consider {{all elements of}} Document Management during a project’s life cycle, identify shortcomings and address them successfully to ensure successful completion of projects and ultimately to also ensure legal compliance as stipulated by contractual agreements. Proper governance during the execution of projects involves, amongst others, the establishment of structures and processes, with appropriate checks and balances built into these structures and processes, to enable all stakeholders {{to be in a}} position to have access to relevant documentation. Executing projects makes a huge demand on the flow and management of project related documentation through the different phases of these projects. The research, as documented in this dissertation, investigates and evaluates whether Sasol Technology, as the project execution agent for the Sasol Business Units, has efficient governing Document Management processes and procedures in place to support the successful execution of capital projects. Sasol Technology uses a stage gate model, associated with project life cycles, as a systematic approach for the execution of capital projects. Document Management is a new business function that was established in 2008. Not all the functions involved in the life cycle of project execution are fully aligned with the central function managing documentation. There is thus a need for a fully integrated Document Management System, involving all the functions of Sasol which are involved during the different phases of project execution. The literature study analyses existing world best document management and records management practices and procedures and points out that meticulous and strict document and records management practices form the backbone of organisational authentic evidence compliance. The research design method that was chosen to authenticate the research question is an Exploratory Qualitative Approach, combined with a Descriptive Approach. Results are obtained from a combination of three methods. Published and available existing data of how documents are managed in Sasol was gathered and secondary findings are established. Focused and structured interviews were then conducted with experienced team members from the different functions involved in project execution and lastly, e-mail administrated questionnaires were developed and distributed to relevant project team members within Sasol Technology to assess the current system and to determine additional requirements for an enhanced Document Management System, specifically applicable to owner companies in the project execution environment. Whereas the scrutiny of the secondary sources provides a background and the progress iii made with regard to setting requirements for a standardised Document Management System for the execution of projects in the Sasol Technology and some of the other Sasol Business Units, the primary data findings indicate how the project team members perceive the existing Sasol Technology Document Management System to be. Key findings include, that documentation life cycle management is not fully developed and needs to be addressed in the Sasol Technology project execution environment. Furthermore, integration of the documentation management of the various departments, functions and structures in Sasol will enable better and improved management of project documentation. The specific output of this dissertation is the recommendation of an improved Document Management System to allow the different functions within Sasol Technology and some other Sasol Business Units to have access to an integrated system, included in it <b>all</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>documentation</b> requirements during the life cycle of projects.
