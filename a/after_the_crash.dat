5|$|Nikki is {{manipulative}} of Paulo {{and appears}} to care more about the diamonds than her relationship. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> Paulo becomes suspicious Nikki is just using {{him to get the}} diamonds. The first thing she asks him <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> is the whereabouts of the diamonds, and avoids answering Paulo when he asks if they would still be together if she did not need him to help find the diamonds. Paulo does what Nikki tells him to because of his fear of losing her, which results in their deaths.|$|E

5|$|A week <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> the {{families}} of various passengers aboard Flight 706 began filing lawsuits and court papers against Hughes Airwest and, later, {{the government of the}} United States.

This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|E

In addition to the aircraft passengers and building occupants, hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed.

5|$|Following his 23rd {{victory on}} 1 April, Voss fired upon pilot and plane {{on the ground}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash.</b> On 6 April 1917, he staked two victory claims 15 minutes apart, having brought down a {{two-seater}} and a Sopwith Pup near one another {{on either side of}} the front lines. The two-seater pilot braved both Voss's strafing and incoming German artillery to retrieve aerial photography plates for their military intelligence value. The Sopwith Pup, though later seen with Jasta 2 in German markings after its capture, was an unconfirmed victory despite landing behind German lines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E

25|$|Crashes {{were not}} uncommon, almost always in lakes.

5|$|Many crash {{survivors}} suffered long recoveries {{from the}} physical and psychological traumas they endured. A month <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>crash,</b> an orderly caravan of around 1,000 vehicles drove to JFK while some demonstrators laid wreaths in the international terminal lobby to protest {{the handling of the}} flight. Some survivors sued the FAA, accusing the agency of failing to ensure the flight's safety. In July 1990, Avianca offered $75,000 to crash survivors and the relatives of those killed. The U.S. government eventually joined Avianca and reached a settlement estimated at over $200million in damages to the victims.|$|E
