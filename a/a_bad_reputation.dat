5|$|Although {{signed by}} Pierce and Santa Anna, the treaty needed a 2/3 {{vote in favor}} of {{ratification}} in the US Senate, where it met strong opposition. Antislavery senators opposed further acquisition of slave territory. Lobbying by speculators gave the treaty <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation.</b> Some senators objected to furnishing Santa Anna financial assistance.|$|E
5|$|The poem was {{revised and}} {{included}} in Keats's 1820 collection of poetry titled Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. Although the publishers Taylor and Hessey feared {{the kind of}} bad reviews that had plagued Keats's 1818 edition of Endymion, {{they were willing to}} publish the collection after the removal of any potentially controversial poems to ensure {{that there would be no}} politically motivated reviews that could give the volume <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation,</b> because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E

5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E
5|$|In all, 45 Israelis were killed, 50 were wounded, and 5 {{captured}} by Egypt. Of them, 29 killed and 34 wounded were from Zur's 54th Company. Egyptian sources reported 15 killed and 30 wounded, although {{this does not}} include the casualties suffered by the intercepted reinforcements from Majdal. Even before the final retreating troops came home, the Givati command had issued a new operation order, calling for renewed artillery and air bombardment of Isdud, and small harassment operations. The 57th Battalion, which gained <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> after its failures in Yibna and Isdud, carried out several such successful operations, regaining prestige in the brigade.|$|E
5|$|The Finns {{had many}} reasons {{to turn down the}} Soviet proposals. Finland had started {{negotiations}} for a military co-operation with Sweden, and the Finns had great hopes for the joint Finnish–Swedish defense for the Ålands islands {{and did not want to}} jeopardize these negotiations. In addition, the violent collectivization, purges, show trials and executions in Stalin's Soviet Union had given the country <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation.</b> Furthermore, most of the Finnish Communist leadership in the Soviet Union was executed during the Great Purge. The Soviet Union did not therefore seem to be a reliable contracting party. The Soviet envoys sent to negotiate with Finns were officially of relatively low rank, but as Väinö Tanner put it later, the Finns assumed rightly that they represented of some higher organ of State, probably the Soviet secret police NKVD.|$|E

50|$|The school {{opened on}} its current site on Newbold Road in 1956 as Newbold Grange High School. Until the early 1990s, under the headship of Mr Turbayne, {{the school was}} subject to much criticism, with <b>a</b> {{relatively}} <b>bad</b> <b>reputation.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sanitary {{conditions}} were bad throughout urban America in the 19th century, but Newark had <b>an</b> especially <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> {{because of the}} accumulation of human and horse waste built up on the city streets, its inadequate sewage systems, and the dubious quality of its water supply.|$|R
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{offense to}} the Chinese was the supposed kidnapping of children by the Portuguese {{so they could}} eat them. In reality, Simão had earned the Portuguese <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> for buying young Chinese slaves, presumably {{some of whom were}} kidnapped after Simão offered local Chinese huge sums of money for child slaves. In fact, some boys and girls from wealthy Chinese families were later found by Portuguese authorities at Diu in western India. However, there were no official reports of Simão's abuses, even though he stayed until September 1520; yet rumors of his behavior (which became associated with all Portuguese) no doubt reached as far as the court of Beijing, which would soon condemn the Portuguese for this and other reasons.|$|E
5|$|According to the Arab chroniclers, the {{realization}} of Egypt's vulnerability from the sea led, after {{a long period of}} neglect, to the urgent strengthening of Egypt's maritime defences by Governor Anbasah. Within nine months of the raid, Damietta was refortified along with Tinnis and Alexandria. Various works were undertaken at Rosetta, Borollos, Ashmun, at-Tina, and Nastarawwa. Ships were constructed and new crews were raised. Most seamen were forcibly conscripted from among the Copts and the Arabs of the interior, earning Anbasah <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> in contemporary sources. Complaints against him were directed to Caliph al-Mutawakkil. Later Arabic sources like al-Maqrizi and Coptic sources confirm that the new fleet was used in raids against the Byzantines in subsequent years, although no details are recorded. This activity is generally held to have marked the rebirth of the Egyptian navy. Under the Tulunid dynasty (868–905) it numbered 100 ships and reached its peak later under the Fatimids (969–1171).|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the large}} number of factions created for the game, {{developers}} reintroduced the reputation system that was first used in Fallout 2 and had been absent in Fallout 3. Much like Karma, a player's standing with a faction can change depending on how they interact with them and what decisions they make. If, for example, players help a faction, their reputation with them improves in all locations controlled by that faction; opting to kill their members will cause a loss of reputation. The type of reputation the player has with each faction affects how non-player characters (NPCs) behave towards them; a good reputation might make completing some quests easier, provide discounts with the faction's vendors, and cause faction members to offer gifts; <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> may lead to the faction refusing to help the player or attacking them on sight, or sending thugs after the player.|$|E

50|$|Fredegund has {{traditionally}} been given <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>reputation,</b> foremost by the accounts of Gregory of Tours, who depicts her as ruthlessly murderous and sadistically cruel, and she is known for the many cruel stories about her, particularly for her long going feud with queen Brunhilda of Austrasia.|$|R
50|$|Londoners were {{familiar}} with violent attacks in the street at night, and Ratcliffe Highway had <b>a</b> particularly <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> for robbery. However, these murders shocked the public because the Marrs had been a hardworking family with no apparent ties to criminal elements. They seemed to be entirely random victims.|$|R
5|$|The Trinity is {{a popular}} {{whitewater}} rafting and kayaking river. Dam releases for fish restoration have incidentally increased {{the amount of water}} available for boating year-round. The river has three main whitewater runs, all known for their scenery and wildlife. The Pigeon Point section, alongside Highway 299, contains Class II-III (beginner to intermediate) rapids. Below the takeout at Cedar Flat, the Trinity flows through the extremely hazardous Class V Burnt Ranch Gorge, which was first run in 1971 by three kayakers, one of whom {{died of a heart attack}} soon after finishing the run, due to the arduous work of portaging many rapids. This gave the area <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> for many years; it was not until 1983 when commercial trips began on this section of the river. The lower Trinity, much of which flows through the Hoopa Valley Reservation, is a Class II river with gentler and lower gradient despite having a greater volume of water flow.|$|E
5|$|Crowley soon progressed {{through the}} lower grades of the Golden Dawn, {{and was ready}} to enter the group's inner Second Order. He was unpopular in the group; his {{bisexuality}} and libertine lifestyle had gained him <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation,</b> and he had developed feuds with some of the members, including W.B. Yeats. When the Golden Dawn's London lodge refused to initiate Crowley into the Second Order, he visited Mathers in Paris, who personally admitted him into the Adeptus Minor Grade. A schism had developed between Mathers and the London members of the Golden Dawn, who were unhappy with his autocratic rule. Acting under Mathers' orders, Crowley – {{with the help of his}} mistress and fellow initiate Elaine Simpson – attempted to seize the Vault of the Adepts, a temple space at 36 Blythe Road in West Kensington, from the London lodge members. When the case was taken to court, the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge, as they had paid for the space's rent, leaving both Crowley and Mathers isolated from the group. Spence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Mathers' authority.|$|E
25|$|A new {{experimental}} {{scheme to}} knock down old council flats in Micklefield {{and replace them with}} housing association properties was approved by John Prescott in 2003 after overwhelming approval by council residents. There are many different housing areas within the town, some of which such as the Castlefield district have gained <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> for crime and drug-related problems.|$|E

50|$|The suburb was {{constructed}} from scratch on {{an area of}} previously uninhabited wetland (suo in Finnish) starting in the mid-1970s as migration from rural areas to the city increased heavily in volume. Since then, the city's policy of placing many refugees and unemployed people in certain few districts has led to Varissuo, together with Lauste and Halinen, attaining <b>a</b> somewhat <b>bad</b> <b>reputation.</b>|$|R
25|$|Despite their popularity, taxis {{have gained}} <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> for often refusing {{passengers}} when the requested route {{is not to}} the driver's convenience. Motorcycle taxis were previously unregulated, and subject to extortion by organized crime gangs. Since 2003, registration has been required for motorcycle taxi ranks, and drivers now wear distinctive numbered vests designating their district of registration {{and where they are}} allowed to accept passengers.|$|E
25|$|Other Chinatowns in European capitals, {{including}} Paris and London, {{were established}} {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. The first Chinatown in London was located in the Limehouse area of the East End of London at the start of the 20th century. The Chinese population engaged in business which catered to the Chinese sailors who frequented the Docklands. The area acquired <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> from exaggerated reports of opium dens and slum housing.|$|E
25|$|The {{camp was}} under the {{supervision}} of the Swiss Army. From the beginning, Wauwilermoos had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation.</b> The penal camp was guarded day and night by soldiers with dogs. A sergeant led a guard dog section of 10 soldiers, and {{was under the}} direct command of the commanding officer of the facility. In all 47 rifle men formed the guard troops as of 13 February 1945. The camp was additionally secured by several rows of barbed wire.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{recently}} graduated {{players from}} Salisbury, Matty Shover, Sean Kelley, Ashton Thomas, and Tyler Wickline, were welcomed to Gorge.

The Salisbury Four {{found a home}} in Gorge because of a similar culture {{and a desire to}} have fun.|$|R
50|$|He had <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> in Iceland; he {{was noted}} for his cruelty and harsh money-collecting {{and had been}} outlawed from Iceland in 1348.

50|$|Nevertheless, the SIM had <b>a</b> {{deserved}} <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> {{among the}} population. It had clandestine prisons in Madrid and Barcelona, used torture to obtain confessions (beatings, mock executions, disorientation and sensory-deprivation techniques) {{and carried out}} extrajudicial executions of suspects. Moreover, in February 1938 military tribunals were established which worked under summary procedure and without any legal guarantees for the accused. According to Gabriel Jackson, the SIM carried out around 1,000 executions.|$|R
25|$|In Europe, {{the demand}} grew for {{surgeons}} to formally study {{for many years}} before practicing; universities such as Montpellier, Padua and Bologna were particularly renowned. In the 12th century, Rogerius Salernitanus composed his Chirurgia, laying the foundation for modern Western surgical manuals. Barber-surgeons generally had <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> that was not to improve until the development of academic surgery as a specialty of medicine, rather than an accessory field. Basic surgical principles for asepsis etc., are known as Halsteads principles.|$|E
25|$|The vǫlur {{were known}} for their art of seduction, {{which was one of}} the reasons why they were {{considered}} dangerous. One of the stanzas in Hávamál warns against sexual intercourse with a woman who is skilled in magic, because the one who does so runs the risk of being caught in a magic bond and also risks getting ill. Freyja, who is the mistress of seiðr, has a free sexual life that gives her <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>reputation</b> in certain myths.|$|E
25|$|Soon afterward, the Republic of Ezo was established, and as {{a result}} of the first attempt at {{democratic}} elections that Japan had ever seen, Ōtori was elected Minister of the Army.

5000|$|Haga {{is a city}} {{district}} in Gothenburg, Sweden, renowned for its picturesque wooden houses, 19th century-atmosphere and cafés.
