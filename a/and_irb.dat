25|$|In May 1915, Clarke and MacDermott {{established}} a Military Committee or Military Council within the IRB, consisting of Pearse, Plunkett and Ceannt, {{to draw up}} plans for a rising. Clarke and MacDermott joined it shortly after. The Military Council was able to promote its own policies and personnel independently of both the Volunteer Executive and the IRB Executive. Although the Volunteer <b>and</b> <b>IRB</b> leaders were not against a rising in principle, they were {{of the opinion that}} it was not opportune at that moment. Volunteer Chief-of-Staff Eoin MacNeill supported a rising only if the British government attempted to suppress the Volunteers or introduce conscription, and if such a rising had some chance of success. IRB President Denis McCullough and prominent IRB member Bulmer Hobson held similar views. The Military Council kept its plans secret, so as to prevent the British authorities learning of the plans, and to thwart those within the organisation who might try to stop the rising. IRB members held officer rank in the Volunteers throughout the country and took their orders from the Military Council, not from MacNeill.|$|E

One of the first British prisoners taken in the GPO was Second Lieutenant AD Chalmers, who was bound with telephone wire and lodged in a telephone box by the young Volunteer Captain <b>and</b> <b>IRB</b> activist, Michael Collins. Chalmers later recalled O'Rahilly's kindness to him. In a statement to a newspaper reporter, {{he said that he}} was taken from the phone box after three hours and brought up to O'Rahilly, who ordered: [...] "I want this officer to watch the safe to see that nothing is touched. You will see that no harm comes to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Players {{who have}} the ability to play a number of {{positions}} in a team are called utility players. Utility players can be seen as [...] "Jack of all trades" [...] and they generally occupy the reserve position in a team. For this reason, many try to avoid being labelled as utilities. Players in the forward positions are generally more specialised than those that play in the backs. However, flankers can usually play number eight and sometimes the blindside may be used as a lock. The front row positions are usually very specialised, although some props can play both sides or even hooker. South African captain <b>and</b> <b>IRB</b> Hall of Fame member John Smit has played test matches in every front row position. Another IRB Hall member to have played multiple forward positions is 2013 inductee John Thornett, an Australian utility forward who played at flanker, number 8, lock and prop for the Wallabies from 1955 to 1967. Utility backs tend to cover a greater number of positions, with players commonly switching between scrum-half and fly-half, fly-half and centre or wing and full-back.|$|E

40|$|Although {{international}} {{research is}} increasing in volume and importance, {{there remains a}} dearth of knowledge on similarities and differences in “national human research ethics” (NHREs), that is, national ethical guidelines (NEGs), Institutional Review Boards (<b>IRBs),</b> <b>and</b> research stakeholder’ ethical attitudes and behaviors (EABs). We begin to address this situation by reporting upon our experiences in conducting a multinational study into {{the mental health of}} children who had a parent/carer in prison. The study was conducted in 4 countries: Germany, Great Britain, Romania, and Sweden. Data on NHREs were gathered via a questionnaire survey, two ethics-related seminars, and ongoing contact between members of the research consortium. There was correspondence but even more so divergence between countries in the availability of NEGs <b>and</b> <b>IRBs</b> <b>and</b> in researcher’ EABs. Differences in NHREs have implications particularly in terms of harmonization but also for ethical philosophy and practice and for research integrity...|$|R
