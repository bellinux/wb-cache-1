40|$|Abstract: Primary {{methods of}} {{measurement}} are essential in {{the realization of}} the SI units. In 1995, the CCQM (Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière) identified titrimetry as a primary method of measurement. Titrimetry is a method that has wide range of applications for amount of substance measurements and can be applied at primary level and <b>at</b> <b>working</b> <b>level</b> depending on the uncertainty values. The aim of this work is to present the results of potentiometric titration of a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl). The potentiometric titration method was carried out with the solution addition controlled gravimetrically. The results were accurate and HCl concentration of (0. 010042 ± 0. 000112) mol kg − 1, k = 2 for approximately 95 % confidence level was obtained. The molality determination of HCl solution is a prerequisite for the use of a Harned cell, the primary method for the realization of pH measurement. The HCl solution is used in the pH primary system at Inmetro to obtain accurate value of the silver-silver chloride electrode potential. This standard potential is very important for the correct measurement of pH to certificate pH buffer...|$|E

40|$|Daylight {{illuminance}} uniformity is {{a common}} criterion when assessing the performance of fenestration and solar control. To evaluate a design according to this requirement, a grid of horizontal illuminance readings for a given time is required. In simulation based assessments, this can be calculated by defining sensor points <b>at</b> <b>working</b> plane <b>level</b> and running a simulation for a single time step, or an annual simulation to assess the uniformity for a typical year. Backing such predicted assessments with measured data has been a task involving installation and calibration of sensors, cabling and data acquisition systems, which typically render the assessed space unusable for the time of assessment. Using sequential readings from handheld devices as a convenient alternative ignores the dynamics of daylight, as the sky conditions cannot be assumed constant during {{the time required to}} record the illuminance at the required amount of locations. We propose instantaneous image-based measurements of horizontal illuminance for assessments of daylight uniformity. Instead of cabled sensors, near-Lambertian reflectors are placed <b>at</b> <b>working</b> plane <b>level</b> in the assessed space. High Dynamic Range (HDR) images of the working plane with markers are taken and the luminance of the marker surfaces is extracted from the corresponding pixel values. These luminance values can be used to calculate horizontal illuminance for each marker location, assuming Lambertian reflection. As direct sunlight <b>at</b> <b>working</b> plane is considered to exceed the range of acceptable illuminance for uniformly lid spaces, only readings below a threshold of 3000 lm/m 2 are considered...|$|R

An experimental set up with and without acclimation to heat followed by recovery [stepwise acclimation {{and recovery}} (SAR) and stepwise recovery (SR), respectively] was applied to two grapevine varieties,Touriga Nacional (TN),and Trincadeira (TR), with different tolerance to abiotic stress. Major {{differences were found between}} leaves of SAR and SR,especially after recovery; in SAR, almost all parameters returned to basal levels while in SR they remained altered. Acclimation led to a swifter and short-term antioxidative response, affecting the plant to a lesser extent than SR. Signiﬁcant differences were found among varieties: upon stress, TN signiﬁcantly increased ascorbate and glutathione reduction levels, boosting the cell’s redox-buffering capacity, while TR needed to synthesize both metabolites, its response being insufﬁcient to keep the redox state <b>at</b> <b>working</b> <b>levels.</b> TR was affected by stress for a longer period and the up-regulation pattern of antioxidative stress genes was more obvious.
