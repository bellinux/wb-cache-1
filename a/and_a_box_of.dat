5|$|At 3:40 pm, Murray withdrew $280 from an ATM. Closed-circuit footage showed {{she was alone}}. At {{a nearby}} liquor store she {{purchased}} about $40 worth of alcoholic beverages, including Baileys Irish Cream, Kahlúa, vodka, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> Franzia wine. Security footage again shows she was alone when she made that purchase. At {{some point in the}} day, she also picked up accident-report forms from the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Marge is {{depressed}} that Homer {{takes her}} for granted. She calls Dr. Marvin Monroe's radio call-in therapy {{show and the}} doctor urges her to confront Homer, who hears the call on a radio at work, feels bad and wonders how {{to change the way}} Marge feels about him. He goes to Moe's Tavern after work and, on Moe's advice, brings home a single rose <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> chocolates. Marge's mood immediately softens, and Homer invites her to a dinner at a fancy restaurant, dancing, and spend a night at a motel.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, {{it did not have}} the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E

Inside his tomb were found cloths were (pseudo-)Arabic lettering, a ring with a Latin transcription from Arabic <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>boxes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Spanish style, all suggesting that Ulger had contacts with Spain during his lifetime. The metal- and enamelwork on his tomb is probably of Spanish origin.|$|R

The film starred Collins' wife Tianna, and features public sex scenes in front of the city's main tourist attractions.|$|E

A 256-page biography of his footballing career entitled A Tenner <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Box</b> <b>of</b> Kippers, written by Jonathan Strange, was published in 2006. After reading the book, Houchen admitted that his comments about Hartlepool United came across as [...] "a bit harsh".|$|E
500|$|For the Iron Clad Lover: [...] "Dick makes love to Bessie while Tom plays a game {{of chess}} with her father. Tom, {{naturally}} nervous, plays such a poor game {{that he and the}} old man quarrel and Tom is ordered from the house. Next day is Bessie's birthday. Tom brings a bouquet <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> candy. But he is turned away from the house and has the gifts thrown at his head by Bessie's father. Dick arrives and is welcomed. Tom, in desperation, buys a suit of armor, puts it on and has himself delivered to the house as a present to Bessie. Dick finds out that Tom is inside the armor and makes life miserable for him, blowing cigar smoke through the visor and making love to Bessie. Tom, unable to stand this, tries to announce himself, but only succeeds in stumbling over and breaking a valuable vase. Bessie's pa has the 'armor' thrown out. Dick's conscience makes him tell Bessie that Tom was in the armor and they started the rescue. They were horrified to learn that the old man has sold the armor to a junk dealer; and Dick and Bessie have an exciting chase before the junk man is rounded up, when it takes combined efforts of a policeman, locksmith, and plumber to release Tom from his iron suit." ...|$|E

He shot a security guard in the left arm, and following his arrest he told police {{that he wanted to}} use the sandwiches to [...] "make a statement against the people who work in that building ... and with their stance against gay rights and Chick-fil-A", and that he planned [...] "to kill as many people as I could ... then smear a Chicken-fil-A [...] sandwich on their face".|$|E
2500|$|One classic hack {{involved}} {{a police car}} with its flashing warning lights operating. The unusual aspect of this hack was its position — on top of MIT's Great Dome. The car {{was found to be}} a gutted, junked, heavy Chevrolet, painted meticulously to match the MIT Campus Police patrol cars. The car's number was pi. [...] Its license plate read [...] "IHTFP", the abbreviation for MIT's unofficial slogan. [...] A dummy dressed as a campus patrolman was seated inside with mug of coffee <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> donuts. [...] Some years later, the police car has now been semi-permanently re-installed in the Stata Center as an all-time classic.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 1946, plans for the grounds and the new church were presented, {{requesting}} the State Park land. [...] "In May of 1948, the Commission granted them the land {{for the price of}} $1.00 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> candy for the secretary." [...] The original church was built in a [...] "long house" [...] style and designed by Alden B. Dow, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, to look upon the wooded area that surrounded it. It was completed by Memorial Day weekend of 1949. Today, this area houses the gift shop, main office and the nun doll museum in the lower level.|$|E

2500|$|Molly Norris {{drew the}} original, poster-like cartoon on April 20, 2010, which {{declared}} May 20, 2010, {{to be the}} first annual [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". The drawing showed various anthropomorphized objects, including a coffee cup, a cherry <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> pasta, each claiming to be the likeness of Muhammad. Norris used an alternate transliteration of [...] "Mohammed" [...] on her poster. Across the top of the illustration she wrote: [...] The poster included a claim of sponsorship by an organization named [...] "Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor or CACAH (pronounced ca-ca)", which Norris later said was purely fictional. Norris dedicated the cartoon to the creators of South Park, Matt Stone and Trey Parker.|$|E
2500|$|On January 6, 1903, the university's only {{building}} {{burned down}} and destroyed many {{records of the}} early university. Construction began immediately on a new building, as several other towns hoped to convince the university to move. President Boyd and the faculty were not dismayed by the loss. Mathematics professor Frederick Elder said, [...] "What {{do you need to}} keep classes going? Two yards of blackboard <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> chalk." [...] As a response to the fire, English professor Vernon Louis Parrington created a plan {{for the development of the}} campus. Most of the plan was never implemented, but Parrington's suggestion for the campus core formed the basis for the North Oval. The North and South Ovals are now distinctive features of the campus.|$|E
2500|$|Mac Rauch's {{original}} 30-page {{treatment was}} entitled Find the Jetcar, Said the President - A Buckaroo Banzai Thriller. Early on, {{one of the}} revisions Mac Rauch made was changing Buckaroo's surname from Bandy to Banzai but he wasn't crazy about it. However, Richter convinced him to keep the name. The Hong Kong Cavaliers also appeared in these early drafts, but, according to Richter, [...] "it never really went to a completed script. Mac wrote and wrote but never wrote the end". Another early draft was entitled The Strange Case of Mr. Cigars, about a huge robot <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> Hitler's cigars. Mac Rauch shelved his work {{for a few years}} while he wrote New York, New York for Martin Scorsese and other un-produced screenplays.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of Monday, 7 November 1938, he {{purchased}} a revolver <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> bullets, {{then went to the}} German embassy and asked to see an embassy official. After he was taken to the office of Ernst vom Rath, Grynszpan fired five bullets at Vom Rath, two of which hit him in the abdomen. Vom Rath was a professional diplomat with the Foreign Office who expressed anti-Nazi sympathies, largely based on the Nazis' treatment of the Jews, and was under Gestapo investigation for being politically unreliable. Grynszpan made no attempt to escape the French police and freely confessed to the shooting. In his pocket, he carried a postcard to his parents with the message, [...] "May God forgive me ... I must protest so that the whole world hears my protest, and that I will do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a desert}} in Morocco, Abdullah, a goatherder, buys a [...]270 Winchester M70 rifle <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> {{ammunition}} from his neighbor Hassan Ibrahim {{to shoot the}} jackals that have been preying on his goats. Abdullah gives the rifle to his two young sons, Yussef and Ahmed, and sends them out to tend the herd. Ahmed, the older of the two, criticises Yussef for spying on his sister while she changes her clothes. Doubtful of the rifle's purported three-kilometer range, they decide to test it out, aiming first at rocks, a moving car on a highway below, and then at a bus carrying Western tourists. Yussef's bullet hits the bus, critically wounding Susan Jones (Cate Blanchett), an American woman from San Diego who is traveling with her husband Richard (Brad Pitt) on vacation. The two boys realize what has happened and flee the scene, hiding the rifle in the hills.|$|E
2500|$|On May 20, 1981, Wuornos {{was arrested}} in Edgewater, Florida, for the armed robbery of a {{convenience}} store, where she stole $35 and two packs of cigarettes. She was sentenced to prison on May 4, 1982, and released on June 30, 1983. On May 1, 1984, Wuornos was arrested for attempting to pass forged checks at a bank in Key West. On November 30, 1985, she was named as {{a suspect in the}} theft of a revolver and ammunition in Pasco County. On January 4, 1986, Wuornos {{was arrested in}} Miami and charged with car theft, resisting arrest, and obstruction of justice for providing identification bearing her aunt's name. Miami police officers found a [...]38-caliber revolver <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> ammunition in the stolen car. On June 2, 1986, Volusia County deputy sheriffs detained Wuornos for questioning after a male companion accused her of pulling a gun in his car and demanding $200. Wuornos was found to be carrying spare ammunition, and police discovered a [...]22 pistol under the passenger seat she had occupied.|$|E

2500|$|Aboard ships, Huncke would {{overcome}} his drug addiction or maintain it with morphine syrettes {{supplied by the}} ship medic. When he returned to New York, he returned to 42nd Street, and it was after one such trip where he met the then-unknown William S. Burroughs, who was selling a sub-machine gun <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> syrettes. Their first meeting was not cordial: from Burroughs' appearance and manner, Huncke suspected that he was [...] "heat" [...] (undercover police or FBI). Assured that Burroughs was harmless, Huncke bought the morphine and, at Burroughs' request, immediately gave him an injection. Burroughs later wrote a fictionalized account of the meeting in his first novel, Junkie. Huncke also became {{a close friend of}} Joan Adams Vollmer Burroughs, William's common-law wife, sharing with her a taste for amphetamines. In the late 1940s he was invited to Texas to grow marijuana on the Burroughs farm. It was here he renewed his acquaintance with the young Abe Green, a fellow train jumper and much later on in the early beatnik scene, a regular reciter of his own enigmatic brand of spontaneous poetry. Despite his comparative youth, Green was often referred to by Huncke as [...] "Old Faithful". Huncke valued loyalty and it is thought that Abe Green was of [...] "inestimable assistance" [...] to Lucien Carr and Jack Kerouac {{when it came to the}} concealment of the weapon used to kill David Kammerer some years later.|$|E
2500|$|Canada {{came to be}} at {{war when}} in 1914 King George V {{declared}} that the British Empire was at war with its German counterpart. At the time, Canada had in Ottawa a royal viceroy {{in the form of}} Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn; though well intended, the Prince donned his Field Marshal's uniform and, without ministerial advice, went to military training grounds and barracks to address the troops and see them off on their voyage to Europe. This was much to the chagrin of the prime minister at the time, Robert Borden, who saw the Governor General as overstepping constitutional conventions. Though Borden blamed the military secretary of the day, Edward Stanton, he also opined that Prince Arthur [...] "laboured under the handicap of his position {{as a member of the}} Royal Family and never realised his limitations as Governor General." [...] Arthur's wife, Princess Louise Margaret, Duchess of Connaught, also helped in the war effort, forming volunteer groups to make supplies for Canadian soldiers overseas; for Christmas in 1915, she sent a card <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> <b>of</b> maple sugar to every Canadian serving in Europe and she had a knitting machine installed at Rideau Hall, on which she made thousands of pairs of socks for soldiers. Princess Patricia, the Connaughts' daughter, became so active with the military that Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry was in 1914 named in her honour; the Princess personally chose the infantry's colours, designed its badge, and was appointed as its colonel-in-chief at the cessation of hostilities in 1918.|$|E
