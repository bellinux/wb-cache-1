2500|$|In 1983, Rebecca Welles {{arranged}} {{to see her}} mother {{for the first time}} in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. [...] "Rita barely knows me now," [...] Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. [...] "When it was over, I came over to her table <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly." ...|$|E
2500|$|None of Brown's online {{writings}} {{in his two}} and a {{half years}} at Maclean's made the then weekly magazine's print issue. Summarizing his 2011-2013 Maclean's experience during a discussion on an October 2016 Canadaland podcast, Brown said: [...] "They had an in-house distinction — a caste system if you will — with magazine writers on one hand getting paid a certain wage and web bloggers on the other getting a contract wage that's a quarter of that. The web for them was always the ugly stepchild product — an afterthought — because you can't not have a website so they just got some kids to write some stuff. It was frustrating only contributing to the online product because sometimes I'd look at the traffic, which at that time the contributors could still actually look at, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> some of the web-only content was doing better online than the stuff that had first appeared in the magazine ... and this always fell upon deaf ears".|$|E

2500|$|From a New York Times {{interview}} in 1942: [...] "When the war started... {{felt that it}} was up to me to do something, and the only thing I know is show business. I went around during the last war <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army." [...] Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering [...] "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he [...] "would work without pay... would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed United Services Organization (USO), [...] "the group his letter to Early had helped create".|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} mainly written and {{recorded}} in the girls' home in Los Angeles with German songwriter Toby Gad. Jessica Origliasso states [...] "It was really great. Toby works on a simplified set-up on his Mac computer. It takes all the pressure out {{of being in a}} recording studio. We were able to take our time and get it right and not stress about time ticking." [...] When working on the album the girls knew exactly which songwriters they wanted to work with including Billy Steinberg (who has worked with Madonna) and John Feldmann (who has worked with Good Charlotte and The Used). The songwriting saw the girls write about personal things in life mainly to do with love. The song [...] "Revenge Is Sweeter (Than You Ever Were)" [...] is about a person who Lisa Origliasso dated overseas, she states [...] "When it comes down to it, that song's about cheating. A {{lot of people have been}} through it, like I've been through it, so it was very easy to relate to that situation. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> whole situation go on, so it wasn't hard to write that song with her." [...] Another personal song includes [...] "In Another Life", is the most emotional song they've ever written. Lisa states that [...] "While recording this song we couldn't sing it properly because we were bawling our eyes out". Jess says, [...] "You actually hear me sniffing in the background".|$|E
2500|$|Russell {{soon came}} to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, {{especially}} after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: [...] "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced." [...] Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: [...] "I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is the young man one hopes for." [...] Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life. However, while this encouragement played a positive role, Wittgenstein’s later life was riddled with depression nonetheless. The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: [...] "His criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected everything I have done since. I saw that he was right, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy." ...|$|E
