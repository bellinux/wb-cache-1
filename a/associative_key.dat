40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{associative}} model of classical conditioning based on a neural network. The new model is compared {{with a number of}} other well-known models of classical conditioning. The experiments that are used to evaluate the new model are commonly used and they represent the set of tasks that a model of classical conditioning needs to address in order to be successful. The new neural network based model is composed of a number of interconnected Bayesian confidence propagating neural networks (BCPNNs). The BCPNN implements Hebbian learning. This new BCPNN based model sorts under the category of <b>associative</b> models. A <b>key</b> concept of this model is to make a closer tie between the output and the underlying neural activity. The BCPNN model does not use delaylines as many other models of conditioning. The output from the BCPNN model fit the results of classical conditioning experiments...|$|R
40|$|Striatal {{cholinergic}} interneurons {{are critical}} {{elements of the}} striatal circuitry controlling motor planning, movement, and associative learning. Intrastriatal release of dopamine and inhibition of interneuron activity {{is thought to be}} a critical link between behaviorally relevant events, such as reward, and alterations in striatal function. However, the mechanisms mediating this modulation are unclear. Using a combination of electrophysiological, molecular, and computational approaches, the studies reported here show that D 2 dopamine receptor modulation of Na � currents underlying autonomous spiking contributes to a slowing of discharge rate, such as that seen in vivo. Four lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, D 2 receptor stimulation in tissue slices reduced the autonomous spiking in the presence of synaptic blockers. Second, in acutely isolated neurons, D 2 receptor activation led to a reduction in Na � currents underlying pacemaking. The modulation was mediated by a protein kinase C-dependent enhancement of channel entry into a slow-inactivated state at depolarized potentials. Third, the sodium channel blocker TTX mimicked the effects of D 2 receptor agonists on pacemaking. Fourth, simulation of cholinergic interneuron pacemaking revealed that a modest increase in the entry of Na � channels into the slowinactivated state was sufficient to account for the slowing of pacemaker discharge. These studies establish a cellular mechanism linking dopamine and the reduction in striatal cholinergic interneuron activity seen in the initial stages of <b>associative</b> learning. <b>Key</b> words: sodium channel; dopamine; striatum; scRT-PCR; neuromodulation; voltage clamp; slice; Parkinson’s diseas...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{examined}} the inhibition of stimulus-stimulus associations (formally ‘conditioned inhibition’) in Tourette syndrome (TS). Method: The present study used video game style conditioned inhibition procedures suitable {{for children and}} adolescents. We tested 15 participants with a clinical diagnosis of TS {{in the absence of}} co-morbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and compared them with 19 typically developing age and sex matched controls (both groups aged 10 – 20 years). All children were tested for inhibition by summation test using two test stimuli in each of two conditioned inhibition tasks. Results: TS participants showed overall normal inhibition of stimulus-stimulus associations, and there was no correlation between inhibitory learning scores and symptom severity ratings. However, there was a clear reduction in conditioned inhibition in 7 TS participants medicated with clonidine. There was no significant effect of medication on excitatory learning of the stimulus-stimulus associations. Conclusions: We suggest that clonidine’s effect on inhibitory as opposed to excitatory learning could be related to reduced noradrenergic activity. In terms of clinical implications for TS, impaired conditioned inhibition could reduce the ability of susceptible individuals to learn to control tics in the presence of <b>associative</b> triggers. <b>Key</b> words: Tourette syndrome; associative learning; conditioned inhibition; clonidine Résumé Objectif: étudier l’inhibition dans les associations stimulus-stimulus (officiellement appelées inhibitions conditionnées) chez les sujets atteints du syndrome Gilles de la Tourette (SGT).

40|$|Impairments in both {{recognition}} {{memory and}} concurrent discrimination learning {{have been shown}} to follow perirhinal cortex ablation in the monkey. The pattern of these impairments is consistent with the hypothesis that the perirhinal cortex has a role in the visual identification of objects. In this study we compared the performance of a group of three cynomolgus monkeys with bilateral perirhinal cortex ablation with that of a group of three normal controls in two tasks designed to test this hypothesis more directly. In experiment 1 the subjects relearned a set of 40 familiar concurrent discrimination problems; the stimuli in each trial were digitized images of real objects presented in one of three different views. After attaining criterion they were tested on the same problems using similar, but previously unseen, views of the objects. In experiment 2 the subjects were tested on their ability to perform 10 of these familiar discriminations with each problem presented in the unfamiliar context of a digitized image of a unique complex scene. The subjects with ablations were significantly impaired on both tasks. These results demonstrate that the role of the perirhinal cortex is not restricted to memory, and they support the hypothesis that the perirhinal cortex is involved in visual object identification. We suggest that the perirhinal cortex is crucially involved in processing coherent concepts of individual objects. A deficit of this nature could underlie the pattern of impairments that follow perirhinal cortex damage in both visual object recognition memory and visual <b>associative</b> memory. <b>Key</b> words: monkey; macaque; learning; memory; object identification; perirhinal cortex; TE; inferior temporal cortex; temporal lob...|$|R
40|$|The {{demand for}} {{high-density}} data storage with ultrafast accessibility motivates {{the search for}} new memory implementations. Ideally such storage devices should be robust to input error and to unreliability of individual elements; furthermore information {{should be addressed by}} its content rather than by its location. Here we present a concept for an <b>associative</b> memory whose <b>key</b> component is a superconducting array with natural multiconnectivity. Its intrinsic redundancy is crucial for the content-addressability of the resulting storage device and also leads to parallel image retrieval. Because patterns are stored nonlocally both physically and logically in the proposed device, information access and retrieval are fault-tolerant. This superconducting memory should exhibit picosecond single-bit acquisition times with negligible energy dissipation during switching and multiple non-destructive read-outs of the stored data. The key component of our proposed associative memory is a superconducting array with multiple interconnections (Figure 1), where each bit is represented by a wire and thus is physically delocalized. More specifically this network consists of a stack of two perpendicular set...|$|R
40|$|The global {{workspace}} (GW) theory {{proposes that}} conscious processing results from coherent neuronal activity between widely distributed brain regions, with fronto-parietal <b>associative</b> cortices as <b>key</b> elements. In this model, transition between conscious and non conscious states are predicted {{to be caused}} by abrupt non-linear massive changes of the level of coherence within this distributed neural space. Epileptic seizures offer a unique model to explore the validity of this central hypothesis. Seizures are often characterized by the occurrence of brutal alterations of consciousness (AOC) which are largely negatively impacting patients' lives. Recently, we have shown that these sudden AOC are contemporary to non-linear increases of neural synchrony within distant cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic networks. We interpreted these results in the light of GW theory, and suggested that excessive synchrony could prevent this distributed network to reach the minimal level of differentiation and complexity necessary to the coding of conscious representations. These observations both confirm some predictions of the GW model, and further specify the physiological window of neural coherence (minimum and maximum) associated with conscious processing...|$|R
30|$|Our {{study is}} about the entrepreneurs’ {{strategies}} employed to respond to and address healthcare system actors’ pressures wherever they are related to content, control, or context. These strategies materialize under the firms’ competitive actions {{as well as their}} social construction efforts over the institutionalization of actors’ practices, their tendency to become similar with time, and the interactions and contextual elements within the organizational field. These strategies are derived and adapted from the empirical research of Lawrence and Suddaby (2006), who have observed several distinct sets of practices through which actors have engaged in actions that have resulted in the creation, maintenance, or disrupting institutions. They can be political at an important level (lobbies and associations) as well as at a low level (direct channel of communication between company representatives and key actors). They can also be <b>associative,</b> by recruiting <b>key</b> influencers, investing in medical education, and increasing representative visits, or normative, by increasing communications through formal channels and push regulatory submissions. Finally, identity strategies are employed by constructing formal agreements between firms and healthcare system actors and involving firms to participate in the elaboration of a unified and cohesive acquisition process.|$|R

40|$|<b>Associative</b> {{learning}} is <b>key</b> to how bees recognize {{and return to}} rewarding floral resources. It thus {{plays a major role}} in pollinator floral constancy and plant gene flow. Honeybees are the primary model for pollinator associative learning, but bumblebees play an important ecological role in a wider range of habitats, and their associative learning abilities are less well understood. We assayed learning with the proboscis extension reflex (PER), using a novel method for restraining bees (capsules) designed to improve bumblebee learning. We present the first results demonstrating that bumblebees exhibit the memory spacing effect. They improve their associative learning of odor and nectar reward by exhibiting increased memory acquisition, a component of long-term memory formation, when the time interval between rewarding trials is increased. Bombus impatiens forager memory acquisition (average discrimination index values) improved by 129 % and 65 % at inter-trial intervals (ITI) of 5 and 3  min, respectively, as compared to an ITI of 1  min. Memory acquisition rate also increased with increasing ITI. Encapsulation significantly increases olfactory memory acquisition. Ten times more foragers exhibited at least one PER response during training in capsules as compared to traditional PER harnesses. Thus, a novel conditioning assay, encapsulation, enabled us to improve bumblebee-learning acquisition and demonstrate that spaced learning results in better memory consolidation. Such spaced learning likely plays a role in forming long-term memories of rewarding floral resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} and broad applications of nano-magnetic colloids have generated {{much interest in}} recent years. Specially, Fe 304 nanoparticles have attracted {{a great deal of}} attention since their magnetic properties can be used for hyperthermia treatment or drug targeting. For example, enhanced levels of intracellular gene delivery can be achieved using Fe 304 nano-vectors in the presence of an external magnetic field, a process known as 2 ̆ 7 magnetofection 2 ̆ 7. The low cytotoxicity, tunable particle size, ease of surface functionalization, and ability to generate thermal energy using an external alternating magnetic field (AMF) are properties have propelled Fe 304 research to the forefront of nanoparticle research. The strategy of nanoparticle-mediated, AMF-induced heat generation has been used to effect intracellular hyperthermia. One application of this 2 ̆ 7 magnetic hyperthermia 2 ̆ 7 is heat activated local delivery of a therapeutic effector (e. g.; drug or polynucleotide). This thesis describes the development of a magnetic nano-vector for AMF-induced, heat-activated pDNA and small molecule delivery. The use of heat-inducible vectors, such as heat shock protein (hsp) genes, is a promising mode of gene therapy that would restrict gene expression to a local region by focusing a heat stimulus only at a target region. We thus aimed to design an Fe 304 nanoparticle-mediated gene transfer vehicle for AMF-induced localized gene expression. We opted to use 2 ̆ 7 click 2 ̆ 7 oximation techniques to assemble the magnetic gene transfer vector. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis, characterization, and transfection studies of the oxime ether lipid-based nano-magnetic vectors MLP and dMLP. The synthesis and characterization of a novel series of quaternary ammonium aminooxy reagents (2. 1 - 2. 4) is described. These cationic aminooxy compounds were loaded onto nanoparticles for ligation with carbonyl groups and also to impart a net positive charge on the nanoparticle surface. Our studies indicated that the non-toxic magnetoplexes (magnetic nanoparticle + pDNA complex) derived from dMLP deliver pDNA into mammalian cells even without external magnetic assistance. To date, dMLP is the only polymer-free magnetic gene delivery system that can deliver pDNA without any magnetic assistance. Chapter 3 of this thesis outlines the synthesis and characterization of other oxime ether lipids and details studies using derived-lipoplexes. These lipids were evaluated in pDNA and siRNA transfection studies in various mammalian cell lines. This work constitutes the first use of an oxime ether as the linking domain in cationic transfection lipids. These biocompatible oxime ether lipids can be readily assembled by click chemistry through ligation of hydrophobic aldehydes with quaternary ammonium aminooxy salts. Our studies showed that the oxime ether lipids transfected pDNA and siRNA efficiently in MCF - 7, H 1792, and in PAR C 10 cells comparable to and in some cases better than commercial transfection lipids. Chapter 4 describes the design and characterization of a nano-magnetic delivery system for AMF-induced drug (doxorubicin) release. In efforts to develop a magnetic formulation free from thermo sensitive materials, such as hydrogels, we synthesized three nanoparticle-based doxorubicin formulations using charge interactions as the <b>key</b> <b>associative</b> force. To do so, we synthesized and characterized a novel cationic oxime ether conjugate at C- 13 of doxorubicin. Our investigation indicated that the positive charge of the oxime ether drug conjugate tended to bind better to the negatively charged nanoparticle than did the other formulations prepared in stepwise manner. Our findings show that the nano-magnetic formulations remained essestially inactive at body temperature (37. 5 °C) and released a majority of the cargo only when exposed to an external AMF. Our designed magnetic drug delivery platform is the first example of an AMF-inducible system that does not depend on the inclusion of thermo sensitive materials. Finally, we have developed a bioanalytical application of the highly chemoselective oximation chemistry using aminooxy reagent 2. 1. Chapter 5 describes a silica microchip containing micropillars coated with cationic aminooxy reagent 2. 1. The microchip captures gaseous ketones and aldehydes from exhaled human breath. A brief description of microchip fabricated breath analyzer and breath analysis is described in Chapter 5. Our studies showed that the acetone capture efficiency of the aminooxy-loaded microchip was 98...|$|R
