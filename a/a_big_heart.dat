Her granddaughter Laurence Huot-Solovieff, the daughter of Maria's daughter Tatyana, recalled in 2005 [...] that according to Maria, their infamous great-grandfather was a [...] "simple man with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>heart</b> and strong spiritual power, who loved Russia, God, and the Tsar." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, Winfrey {{interview}}ed U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, her first-ever {{interview with}} a sitting president and First Lady. They talked about the challenges of parenting at the White House, {{the strength of their}} relationship, and their concern for the country's future.

2500|$|... here {{seems to}} be no pattern, no purpose to her life. She swings from one emotion to another, but she gains nothing, stores up nothing for the future. She lives entirely in the present, not even for today, but in the moment. Clara is the total nonconformist. What she wants she gets, if she can. What she desires to do she does. She has <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>heart,</b> a {{remarkable}} brain, and the most utter contempt for the world in general. Time doesn't exist for her, except that she thinks it will stop tomorrow. She has real courage, because she lives boldly. Who are we, after all, to say she is wrong? ...|$|E

5000|$|Nicola's persona is complex, she {{has been}} shown to be manipulative, usually with good intentions. Of this Bailey {{described}} her during an interview with the Herald Sun stating: [...] "She's a bit of a vixen, but is quite down to earth as well. When you first see her, she's trying to impress everybody - she's dressed up, her hair is done and there's a lot of make-up, But gradually she feels more comfortable in Ramsay St and realises she doesn't have to do that, so the real her emerges." [...] Defending her 'man eating' ways she added: [...] "She does have a bit of sexual prowess but also has <b>a</b> very <b>big</b> <b>heart</b> and she's not coming from a really bad place. She's just looking for love. She has her femme-fatale moments, but she's a femme fatale with <b>a</b> really <b>big</b> <b>heart</b> and when the doors are closed she's not as sure of herself as she'd like people to think she is." [...] According to Bailey Nicola's best qualities the fact she is a sexy siren and <b>a</b> <b>big</b> trouble-maker.|$|R

[...] Former First Lady Nancy Reagan said that she was [...] "heartbroken" [...] over Heston's death and released a statement, reading, [...] "I will never forget Chuck as a hero on the big screen in the roles he played, but more importantly I considered him a hero in life for the many times that he stepped up to support Ronnie in whatever he was doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Lofty was written with Mead in mind. Producers created the role after Daniel Anthony's decision to quit {{his role as}} nurse, Jamie Collier. They realised the show would be lacking a young, male nurse and decided to cast Mead. Mead explained {{that they were looking}} for a nurse who [...] "had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>heart</b> and cares for his patients with a unique insight". Show writer Matthew Barry said that having Mead in mind helped the writing team write for Lofty. The show's executive producer Oliver Kent asked Mead's agent if Mead would read for the role and when his agent told him the news, Mead believed he was [...] "joking". At the audition, Mead read for the show's producer and casting directors. He believed that he had delivered what they wanted, but was not sure he was [...] "in the frame" [...] for the character. He was originally signed to the serial for a year and expressed a possibility in renewing his contract.|$|E
2500|$|During the storyline with Silas, viewers {{were able}} to see a {{stronger}} and more determined side to the character. A writer for E4's official Hollyoaks website said viewers should not let the character's [...] "delicate exterior" [...] fool them, as beneath it she had [...] "the heart and courage of a lion". They explained that Lynsey was required to prove she had a backbone during several crisis situations, in which she demonstrated her [...] "superhero antics". But that her real test of character came after she was attacked by Silas. They added that the attack marked the beginning of a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse that led to Lynsey losing her friends, job, home and nearly her sanity. Various media sources described Lynsey as flirty, determined, brave, plucky, gorgeous and a beauty. After her exit, Hassan said she would like Lynsey to be remembered as a [...] "serial killer hunter extraordinaire", the girl next door with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>heart,</b> Cheryl's best friend and [...] "the girl who could never really find the man of her dreams!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Charlie has wild curly hair, is wary of people, and {{frequently}} enthralled with objects and patterns. According to Krumholtz, Charlie wants {{to understand how}} the world works. His father has said Charlie is easily fascinated, possesses <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>heart</b> and is thorough, but he misses certain things completely. Meanwhile, Larry observed that he is [...] "a talented theoretician with an ego problem" [...] and a student once described him as fast-talking and disorganized, to the agreement of Larry. Fleinhardt also accurately noticed that his colleague has a high standard of guilt and is a pragmatist. Charlie is rather fond of providing excessive explanations (e.g., his discussion of Occam's razor) and reducing complex phenomena to intuitively obvious situations through practical analogies that are quite unlike Larry's metaphysical musings and cosmic metaphors. (These analogies are known as [...] "audience visions" [...] or, as friend Megan Reeves calls them, [...] "those cute little analogies.") While contemplating, his antics and mannerisms may even disconcert more conventional thinkers. Wearing his headset, Dr. Eppes has an intense focusing ability as he voraciously writes equations, often covering several chalkboards with a staccato clacking and the aid of a red chalk holder. Nevertheless, if his line of thought is interrupted during a tense moment, as one of restricted foresight, he can become very disgruntled. Further, when deeply concentrating on a particular problem, it seems Charlie is unable to provide insights to other topics for the sake that they are simply needed or wanted—he has to write what is in his head. Like his brother Don, he is characteristically stubborn and obsessive ("one part exuberance, two parts obsession"), {{especially when it comes to}} work, but he's rather naïve when it comes to human behavior. The latter often interferes with his FBI work and, thus, is the cause of much distress for him at times.|$|E

This gun-throwing cowboy had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
