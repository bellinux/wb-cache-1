50|$|Modern Air's {{historic}} {{arrival in}} Moscow was memorable {{for a different}} reason as well. In common with other contemporary jet aircraft types, such as the Boeing 707/720, deHavilland Comet, Douglas DC-8, Sud Aviation Caravelle and Vickers VC-10, Convair's 880/990 lacked an auxiliary power unit (APU). This made the Convair jets dependent on an external ground power unit (GPU) to provide electrical power for the aircraft while stationary on the ground, including starting the engines. When Polar Byrd I needed power externally supplied by a GPU to start its engines {{at the end of the}} stopover in Moscow to resume its journey, it was found that the Soviet GPUs could not be connected to the CV-990s <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> due to an incompatibility between the ground equipment's fittings and the aircraft's valve. This necessitated flying in a Modern Air GPU from West Berlin and resulted in the delay of the onward flight. It also resulted in a subsequent collaboration between Modern Air's maintenance department and Garrett AiResearch to design and test a CV-990 APU, which was located in a hollow area behind the fuel tank inside the aircraft's inboard anti-shock body on the starboard wing. This however proved unsuccessful, resulting in the unit's removal after the first installation.|$|E
5000|$|Investigating this {{pressure}} spike, the Day Board Operator fully opened the level control valve {{to the heavy}} raffinate storage tank and shut off of the gas fueling the furnace, but the raffinate feed into the splitter tower was not shut off. Hot raffinate flowed into the blowdown drum and stack and as it filled, some of the fluid started to flow into the ISOM unit sewer system via a 6 in pipeline {{at the base of}} the blowdown drum, but the high level alarm for the blowdown drum didn't sound. As the blowdown drum and stack filled up, hot raffinate shot out of the top of the stack and into the air, forming a 20 ft [...] "geyser". The hot raffinate rained down on the ground and ran down the side of the blow-down drum and stack and pooled {{at the base of the}} unit. A radio call was received in the control room that hot hydrocarbons were overflowing from the stack. A pick-up truck, with its engine running, had been carelessly parked within 30 ft of the blowdown stack; the vapor cloud reached the vehicle, and hydrocarbon fumes were drawn directly into the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>valve,</b> causing the engine to race. Nearby workers frantically tried to shut down the engine, without success. The expanding vapor cloud forced the workers who were trying to shut down the overspeeding truck engine to retreat. The cloud continued to spread across the ISOM plant, across the pipe-rack to the West and into the trailer area unimpeded. No emergency alarm sounded, and at approximately 1:20 p.m., the vapor cloud was ignited by a backfire seen from the overheating truck engine by nearby witnesses, producing a massive explosion that was heard for miles. The blast pressure wave struck the contractor trailers, either completely destroying or severely damaging many of them. The force of the explosion sent debris flying, instantly killing 15 people in and around the trailers and severely injuring 180 others. The pressure wave was so powerful it blew out windows off site up to a distance of 3/4 mi away. An area estimated at 200000 sq ft of the refinery was badly burned by the subsequent fire that followed the violent explosion, damaging millions of dollars worth of refinery equipment. The entire ISOM unit was severely damaged by the explosion and subsequent fire, and as a result, remained out of operation for more than 2 years.|$|E
40|$|Presented paper {{shows the}} results of the {{laboratory}} tests on the relationship between throttling of both air intake duct and exhaust gas duct and a gaseous emission from the marine engine. The object of research is a laboratory, four-stroke, DI diesel engine, operated at loads from 50 kW to 250 kW at a constant speed equal to 750 rpm. During the laboratory tests over 50 parameters of the engine were measured with its technical condition recognized as a „working properly” and with simulated leakage of both <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> and exhaust gas valve on the second cylinder. The results of this laboratory research confirm that the leakage of cylinder valves causes no significant changes of the thermodynamic parameters of the engine. Simulated leakages through the inlet and exhaust valve caused a significant increase in fuel consumption of the engine. Valve leakages cause an increase of the exhaust gas temperature behind the cylinder with leakage and behind other cylinders. The exhaust gas temperature increase is relatively small and clearly visible only at low loads of the engine. The increase of the temperature and pressure of the charging air behind the intercooler were observed too. Charging air temperature is significantly higher during the engine operation with inlet valve leakage. The study results show significant increases of the CO, NOx and CO 2 emission for all the mentioned malfunctions. The conclusion is that {{the results of}} measurements of the composition of the exhaust gas may contain valuable diagnostic information about the technical condition of the air intake duct and the exhaust gas duct of the marine engine...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> {{systems of}} {{internal}} combustion engines are comprised of ducts and air boxes (e. g. air cleaner). The lengths of the ducts induce resonances {{that may be}} excited by the air pulsations generated by the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> of the engine. In cases of loud <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> noise, when acoustic devices cannot be used to counteract resonances, a common solution is to use porous ducts: non woven ducts, or ducts with slits (considered as local porosities). Such a solution has an important drawbacks: (1) Dust can fill the pores, leading to loss of effectiveness; (2) The acoustic power radiated along the duct increases. The last issue is addressed here with measurements: the acoustic power radiated along the duct is compared to the acoustic power radiated by the nozzle, in different conditions (with or without porosity, homogeneous or discrete porosity, various airflow velocities). The aim is to validate that porosities give a good balance between the decrease of nozzle noise resonances and the increase of radiated noise along the duct...|$|R

To this unit were mounted the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor and Idle Air Control (IAC) valve (initially {{referred to as the}} [...] "AIS Motor"). A steel cable connected the accelerator pedal inside the vehicle to a mechanical linkage {{at the side of the}} throttle body, which acted to open the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> butterfly <b>valves</b> inside the venturis.

25|$|Chevrolet {{engineered}} several modifications for the Z06 to {{best use}} the increased power. Starting {{with the most}} structurally rigid body style, the hardtop or FRC, new components included: uprated FE4 suspension, larger wheels and tires, revised gearing ratios, and functional brake cooling ducts. The Z06 is 38 pounds lighter than a standard C5 hardtop thanks to weight-saving measures such as a titanium exhaust, thinner glass, lighter wheel, non-EMT tires, reduced sound proofing, fixed rear radio aerial, and a lighter battery. Starting with the 2002 model year, the LS6 engine output was increased to 405hp (302kW) due to a larger CFM <b>air</b> <b>intake,</b> stiffer <b>valve</b> springs, lighter sodium filled valves and more aggressive camshaft lift and timing.|$|R

5000|$|In 2001, BMW {{introduced}} the Valvetronic system. The Valvetronic system can continuously and precisely vary <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> lift, and in addition, the independent Double VANOS system can concurrently vary the timing {{for both the}} <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>valves.</b> The precise control the system has over the <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> allows for the intake charge to be controlled entirely by the <b>intake</b> <b>valves,</b> {{eliminating the need for}} a throttle valve and greatly reducing pumping loss. The latter alone can boost both power output and fuel economy 10-15%. Furthermore, both systems can also be combined with BMW DIVA (Differentiated Variable <b>Air</b> <b>Intake)</b> system which is the world's first continuously variable length intake manifold. As 2017 BMW is the only company which can implement all three Variable Valve Timing, Lift and Intake Manifold in continuous adjustment form on production car.|$|R
50|$|The {{theoretical}} {{maximum power}} output from a hydrogen engine {{depends on the}} air/fuel ratio and fuel injection method used. The stoichiometric air/fuel ratio for hydrogen is 34:1. At this air/fuel ratio, hydrogen will displace 29% of the combustion chamber leaving only 71% for the air. As a result, the energy content of this mixture will be less {{than it would be}} if the fuel were gasoline.Since both the carbureted and port injection methods mix the fuel and air prior to it entering the combustion chamber, these systems limit the maximum theoretical power obtainable to approximately 85% of that of gasoline engines. Fordirect injection systems, which mix the fuel with the <b>air</b> after the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> has closed (and thus the combustion chamberhas 100% air), the maximum output of the engine can be approximately 15% higher than that for gasoline engines.|$|R

40|$|Gas {{admission}} valve is strategically important component on gas engine. Short response time, large flow rate capacity through the valve, {{ability to work}} at large pressure difference and fault tolerant are characteristics that a good valve should be fulfilled. The solenoid based gas {{admission valve}} used at the moment has short response time and large flow rate capacity but the main problem is that if pressure difference over the valve is too large, the valve will not open. The goal of this thesis is to design, model and simulate a new gas admission valve which utilizes the principle of digitalization. The application of the thesis is an <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> which has been integrated gas flow edges. Through the flow edges the gas flows into the engine’s cylinder. The control of the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> is realized by using digital hydraulics. The second application of the thesis is digital pneumatic gas admission valve. The valve is realized by using binary coded digital flow control unit. As the results show, digital hydraulic <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> with gas flow edges is a realistic construction.

5000|$|Early <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closing (EIVC)Another way to {{decrease}} the pumping losses associated with low engine speed, high vacuum conditions is by closing the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> earlier than normal. This involves closing the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> midway through the intake stroke. Air/fuel demands are so low at low-load conditions and the work required to fill the cylinder is relatively high, so Early <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closing greatly reduces pumping losses. [...] Studies have shown early <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closing reduces pumping losses by 40%, and increases fuel economy by 7%.

40|$|International audienceReducing fuel {{consumption}} {{is a prime}} objective in the automotive industry {{in order to meet}} regulatory and customer demands. Variable valve actuation offers many opportunities for improving the spark ignition engine’s performance in areas such as fuel economy and pollutant emissions. Our studies revealed that the ability to control maximum <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> lift does indeed offer the ability to control <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> mass, but also has the added benefit that it improves the fuel-air mixing process thanks to an increased turbulence, caused by the increased intake flow velocity. This is particularly important at idle and low part loads when low maximum lifts are to be used for improving the fuel economy or for achieving the required power. The paper focuses on the experimental results obtained when approaching idle operation with different <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> laws.

The intake air&# 13; flow rates are corresponding to the three engine speeds of 1000, 2000 and 3000 rev/min., at all the static intake valve&# 13; opening conditions. In this study, in-cylinder flow structure {{is characterized by the}} tumble ratio and maximum&# 13; turbulent kinetic energy of the flow fields. In addition, at two specified lines of the combustion chamber, the radial&# 13; and axial velocity profiles have been plotted. From the results, it is found that the overall airflow direction at the exit&# 13; of the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> does not change significantly with the air flow rate and <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> opening conditions. The&# 13; tumble ratio increases with increase in <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> opening and not much affected by the change in the air flow rates. &# 13; It is also found that, the variations of the velocity profiles at the two specified lines are smooth at full intake valve&# 13; opening irrespective of the air flow rate.
