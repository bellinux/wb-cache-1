The design {{was based on}} German drawings for the submarine Pu110 ("smaller, quickly <b>assemblable</b> submarine prototype"). Launched on 2 July 1930, Saukko was declared ready for service on 16 December 1930. At {{that time it was}} the world's smallest submarine, officially weighing only 99 tonnes. Saukkos crew consisted of 15 men. The outer hull was designed for icy conditions.|$|E

As a consequence, there is little understanding on whether a design is <b>assemblable,</b> or on how much time the assembling process might take. This paper proposes a new formal method to evaluate assemblability of interlocking planar parts that uses Network Analysis to evaluate assembly structure and System Dynamics to evaluate performance of assembling process...|$|E

Antenna, collector, and reflector missions are generalized to define a similar set of system requirements and characteristics. Although many concepts exist for both deployable and space <b>assemblable</b> large structures, four technically mature deployable concepts are reviewed. Two of these concepts are probably applicable to only antenna/collector missions, whereas the other two employ continuous trusses which can be configured for {{a broad range of}} planar, linear, or curved structures. Finally, technology problems or needs associated with large deployable systems are reviewed to highlight additional research and development, both analytical and experimental, required to reduce mission risk...|$|E

Space Station Freedom (SSF) will support permanent human presence {{in space and}} {{has the potential to}} enable scientific and exploratory endeavors unequalled in history. With larger and more ambitious spacecraft being developed, it will serve as a site for construction, checkout, and deployment. A facility attached to SSF is required to develop and demonstrate the techniques that will enable on-orbit construction of future large spacecraft. Examples of attached scientific experiments that currently envision in-space construction and that are discussed are: Solar X-ray Pinhole Occulter Facility, Astromag, and X-ray Large Array. Examples of large <b>assemblable</b> spacecraft which are discussed are: Large Deployable Reflector (LDR), Geostationary Platforms, and interplanetary vehicles...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} {{and characteristics of}} a recently proposed anisotropic metamaterial based upon layered arrays of tightly coupled pairs of "dogbone" shaped stripe conductors have been explored in detail. It {{has been found that}} a metamaterial composed of such stacked layers exhibits artificial magnetism and may support backward wave propagation. The equivalent network models of the constitutive conductor pairs arranged in the periodic array have been devised and applied to the identification of the specific types of resonances, and to the analysis of their contribution into the effective dielectric and magnetic properties of the artificial medium. The proposed "dogbone" configuration of conductor pairs has the advantage of being entirely realizable and <b>assemblable</b> in planar technology. It also appears more prospective than simple cut-wire or metal-plate pairs because the additional geometrical parameters provide an efficient control of separation between the electric and magnetic resonances that, in turn, makes it possible to obtain a fairly broadband left-handed behaviour of the structure at low frequencies. © 2009...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{assembly}} sequencing is {{to plan a}} feasible series of operations to construct a product from its individual parts. Previous research has investigated assembly sequencing {{under the assumption that}} parts have nominal geometry. This paper considers the case where parts have toleranced geometry.

So far, only the rst has been implemented (for the planar case). This work assumes a simple, but non-trivial tolerance language that falls short of capturing all imperfections of a manufacturing process. In particular, it assumes that faces and edges have perfect relative orientations. Thus, it is only one step toward dealing with tolerances in assembly sequencing...|$|E
30|$|Anything {{we design}} is only {{ever going to}} be a part of the overall {{learning}} environment of the student. Teachers and learning designers who seek to support smart learning environments must let go of our illusions of control because we cannot ever actually possess it. This implies a need to make it beneficial for learners to share their findings with one another, to personalize their own learning (not to attempt to personalize it for them). Adaptive technologies have a place, but only when they are descriptive, not prescriptive: we need systems that advise, rather than systems that try to dictate a learning path. We should provide <b>assemblable</b> pieces rather than engineered complete solutions. The online or augmented technology environments we build should become part of the learners’ PLEs as easily as possible, through pedagogical design and through technological standards. It is better to design smart devices according to the distributed rather than the centralized model, because it increases the potential for assembly. Open standards such as RSS/Atom, xAPI, Caliper, LTI, HTML 5, and so on should be embraced, and proprietary formats should be eschewed, because they are less capable of assembly. Alternative methods of assessment that provide greater learner control such as mastery learning, contract grading, pass/fail marking (Schneider & Hutt, 2014), portfolios, challenge processes, and competence-based techniques should be used to decouple credentialing from the learning process, and thus limit extrinsic drivers to learning.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} control the shape, position, alignment, length and {{assembly}} of carbon nanotubes over large areas has become an essential but very difficult goal {{in the field of}} nanotechnology. Current assembly efforts for nanostructures (such as carbon nanotubes) are mostly based on the concept of planting seeds and growing them into nanostructures, which cannot integrate nanostructures to micro/macro structures deterministically in a long-range order. So to overcome the problem of assembly at nanoscale, this thesis investigates a new way of growth and assembly of nanostructures (carbon nanotube). This process is termed as nanopelleting, which refers to control length, alignment, handling and transportation of a nanostructure (carbon nanotube). Nanopelleting is a new concept to embed nanostructures into <b>assemblable</b> micro-blocks, and then have them individually transplanted, located and assembled. This method includes vertical growth of single strand carbon nanotubes, pellet casting, planarization, pellet separation, transplanting and bonding. A new CNT PECVD machine has been designed and built to custom fit to our specifications for vertically grown single strand CNTs. (cont.) We have built a dc plasma reactor because it is simple to build and the growth mechanism of CNTs is optimal. By embedding a single strand CNT in a cylindrical SU- 8 pellet, a high aspect ratio pellet (nanocandle) is fabricated. The sizes of the pellets are 75 - 100 um diameters, so they can be easily handled and transported to the required location. As an application of this nanopellet, we report the concept of an in-plane AFM probe specifically designed for the needs of imaging biological samples with its low stiffness and high-aspect-ratio tip. The designed and fabricated pellet is also used as a nanotemplate to transduct thermal nano-dots in a desired pattern on a large surface area. by Sunil Doddasanagouda [sic]. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Handling and {{assembling}} individual nanostructures {{to bigger}} scale {{systems such as}} MEMS have been the biggest challenge. A deterministic assembly of individual carbon nanotubes by transplanting them to MEMS structures is demonstrated with a new assembly method, "transplanting assembly. " This thesis describes development of a novel assembly technique by transforming individual CNTs <b>assemblable,</b> which enables manual, parallel or automated assembly of individual CNTs in a deterministic way. The key idea of transplanting assembly is to grow individual CNT strands on a substrate at optimal growth conditions, to encapsulate individual CNTs into micro-scale carrier blocks and to transplant them to the target locations. This new assembly method enables products such as CNT-tipped AFM probes in a predictable and repeatable manner. The major research topics discussed in this thesis are: (1) the methods to grow vertically aligned single strand CNTs at predefined locations, (2) the encapsulation method to preserve/control the orientation/exposed length of an individual CNT during transplanting, and (3) the assembly scheme to locate/release an individual CNT at the target location. An array of CNTs was grown from the nickel nano-dots, which were defined on Si substrates using electron-beam lithography followed by metal deposition and lift-off processes. Each CNT strand was embedded into a MEMS scale polymer block {{which serves as a}} CNT carrier. A double polymeric layer encapsulation was designed and implemented: the top SU- 8 forms the body of the carrier while the bottom PMGI layer holds the body until the release of the carrier from the substrate and then is going to be removed to expose the CNT tip with a predefined length. A model was developed to predict mechanical behavior of individual CNTs under the flow of liquid polymers. Manual assembly of a polymer block {{to the end of a}} tipless AFM cantilever forms a CNT-tipped AFM probe, which can be accomplished in minutes without laborious weeding, trimming and welding process. The AFM scanning results confirmed the CNTtipped AFM probe's much improved imaging performance and potential for scanning soft biological samples at nanometer resolutions. by Soohyimg Kim.

40|$|AbstractMany {{industries}} {{all over}} the world have special, sector-specific requirements concerning anti-corrosion protection. This contributes to large savings in corrosion-related costs, which account for about 6 % of the Gross Domestic Product in developed countries. In 1999, the General Directorate for Public Roads published, {{for the first time in}} Poland, its requirements concerning the application and acceptance of anti-corrosion coatings for steel components of road and bridge structures. They were updated in 2006. In 2010, the military department of the General Directorate for National Roads and Motorways issued anti-corrosion instructions applicable to <b>assemblable</b> bridge structures stored as part of the military mobilization reserves of the State. The General Directorate decided to publish them due to the openwork design of these structures and the unusual conditions of their use and storage. In 2013, the Road Management Authorities in Warsaw commissioned a catalogue of anti-corrosion technologies for structures made of thin-walled sections or sheet metal with a thickness of up to 3 mm. In particular, the catalogue focuses on highly durable anti-corrosion coatings for metal constructions of noise barriers. All these documents have been developed by the Road and Bridge Research Institute. As set out in the first two of these documents, the maximum duration of anti-corrosion protection is 15 years, in conformity with ISO 12944. The last document provides for anti-corrosion coatings with durability of over 25 years. It also pays more attention to aesthetic qualities of anti-corrosion coatings, whose colour may not change in a noticeable way during the first 10 years of their use (ΔE < 2, while the reduction of gloss may not exceed 20 %). The new coating materials are based on resins that have never been used before, such as polysiloxane resins, polyfluorinated resins, polyurea resins, new fillers and pigments. Modern, eco-friendly powder coatings (including paints with the zinc fillers) are also being used on an ever-increasing scale, especially for outdoor applications of high durability. Other new generation products include conversion coatings, which improve the adhesion and durability of systems, as well as nano-ceramic coatings, self assembling molecules, baths based on transitional metal compounds with complex-forming properties such as titanium and zirconium (also with polymers), etc. Application of these materials makes it necessary to use more and more sophisticated inspection methods and devices. This creates new requirements for professionals, from the designer and the investor to contractors and inspectors, who all need to be well aware of corrosion-related issues. The analysis of these documents focus on the development of anti-corrosion materials and anti-corrosion protection technologies. Any documents of this type must be constantly revised to keep an owner up to date with modern solutions...|$|E
