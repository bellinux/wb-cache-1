5|$|Adi Da {{published}} his fourth book, titled Garbage and the Goddess: The Last Miracles and Final Spiritual Instructions of Bubba Free John. It documented the relatively unexpurgated lectures <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> this period. It quickly sold out its first print run, {{and a second}} was sent to bookstores. However, due to the controversial nature of its contents, all available copies were quickly retrieved and ritually burned at Adi Da's behest.|$|E
5|$|The Corpus {{forms the}} basis of Latin {{jurisprudence}} (including ecclesiastical Canon Law) and, for historians, provides a valuable insight into the concerns <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> the later Roman Empire. As a collection it gathers together the many sources in which the leges (laws) and the other rules were expressed or published: proper laws, senatorial consults (senatusconsulta), imperial decrees, case law, and jurists' opinions and interpretations (responsa prudentum).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{pesticides}} on microbial in soil is susally {{used as an}} important guide line for estimating the ecological safty of soil. Effects of pesticide-contamination on population <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> bacteria were investigated in purple paddy soil by in door culture method. The {{results showed that the}} population <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> methanogens was stimulated slightly by adding carbofuran or butachlor in paddy soil, but significantly inhibited by adding of butachlor (10 mg kg- 1), carbofuran (0. 5 mg kg- 1) and carbendazim (10 mg kg- 1) in paddy soil. At 7 th day the inhibition reached the maximum and then gradually reduced down to the level in control. 1 mg kg- 1 carbufuran and butachlor markedly stimulate the populations <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> soil methane-producing bacteria, soil anti-nitrifying bacteria, soil nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and soil sulfate-reducing bacteria in purple paddy rice soils. Higher concentration carbufuran and butachlor significantly inhibite the populations <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> above bacteria. Then the inhibition effects of the contaminants were gradually attenuating. The population <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> above bacteria were inhibited by different level carbendazim...|$|R

5|$|As a {{traveller}} {{he visited}} Scotland {{and many other}} parts of Britain and wrote about them. Many of his travels took him to places that were little known to the British public and the travelogues he produced, accompanied by painted and engraved colour plates, were much appreciated. Each tour started at his home and related in detail the route, the scenery, the habits <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> the people he met, their customs and superstitions and the wildlife he saw or heard about. He travelled on horseback accompanied by his servant, Moses Griffiths, who sketched the things they encountered, later to work these up into illustrations for the books. He was an amiable man with a large circle of friends and was still busily following his interests into his sixties. He enjoyed good health throughout his life and died at Downing at the age of seventy two.|$|E
5|$|In 1935–1937, {{the ship}} was {{converted}} to radio-control which allowed her to be maneuvered by operators aboard another ship and additional armor was added. At {{the beginning of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, she transported a battalion of naval troops to the Shanghai area. Settsu simulated the radio traffic of eight aircraft carriers {{at the beginning of the}} Pacific War in an effort to deceive Allied intelligence as to the locations <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese carriers. For the rest of the war she served as a target for carrier pilots. Settsu was badly damaged when Allied carrier aircraft attacked the IJN base at Kure in July 1945 and was forced to beach herself lest she sink. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 20 November and her hulk was raised and broken up in 1946–1947.|$|E

5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to his particular tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Ministry {{estimated}} {{there were}} 750,000 Mischlinge as of April 1935 (studies done {{after the war}} put the number of Mischlinge at around 200,000). As Jews {{became more and more}} excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> their own. Economic problems were not so easily solved, however; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing Aryanization process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, usually at prices far below market value) that the regime had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed. Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.|$|E
5|$|The episode's five flashbacks {{focus on}} the {{reactions}} <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> the freighter's crew who made contact with the Oceanic 815 survivors; Daniel Faraday (Jeremy Davies) is shown crying while watching a newscast confirming the deaths of all Oceanic 815 passengers. His caretaker asks why he is crying, and he answers {{that he does not}} know. Miles Straume (Ken Leung) is a medium hired by an elderly woman to remove the ghost of her grandson from her home. After conversing with the spirit, Miles finds a hidden cache of money and drugs. Charlotte Lewis (Rebecca Mader) is an anthropologist who finds a polar bear skeleton bearing a Dharma Initiative collar buried in the Tunisian desert. Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) is an alcoholic who was originally scheduled to pilot flight 815. He phones the Oceanic hotline while watching the newscast and claims that the footage of the plane wreckage being aired on television is not authentic, while Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) is shown in a posthumous flashback, criticizing her employer Matthew Abaddon (Lance Reddick) for his choice in her coworkers.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{was set up to}} {{investigate}} the effects of Trichostatin A (TSA), a prototypical epigenetic modifier, on the expression <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> hepatic drug uptake transporters in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. To this end, the expression of the sinusoidal transporters sodium-dependent taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 4 (Oatp 4) was monitored by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis <b>and</b> immunoblotting. The <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the uptake transporters was analyzed using radiolabeled substrates and chemical inhibitors. Downregulation <b>of</b> the expression <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> Oatp 4 <b>and</b> Ntcp was observed {{as a function of the}} cultivation time and could not be counteracted by TSA. In conclusion, the epigenetic modifier TSA does not seem to exert a positive effect on the expression <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the investigated uptake transporters in primary rat hepatocyte cultures...|$|R
5|$|The {{negotiations}} were first mentioned publicly in 1949 when Stephen Clissold published his Whirlwind: An Account of Marshal Tito's Rise to Power. This was closely followed by Wilhelm Höttl's Die Geheime Front, Organisation, Personen und Aktionen des deutschen Geheimdienstes (The Secret Front, the Organisation, People <b>and</b> <b>Activities</b> <b>of</b> the German Secret Service) in 1950. There was another mention {{in a book}} published in German in 1956, Generalmajor Rudolf Kiszling's Die Kroaten. Der Schicksalsweg eines Südslawenvolkes (The Croats: The Fateful Path of the South Slav People). Ilija Jukić obtained evidence from German Foreign Ministry sources, which he included in his 1965 book Pogledi na prošlost, sadašnjost i budućnost hrvatskog narodna (Views on the Past, Present and Future of the Croatian Nation), published in London. In 1967, the Yugoslav historian Mišo Leković was officially commissioned to produce a full report on the talks. In 1969, Ivan Avakumović published his Mihailović prema nemačkim dokumentima (Mihailović according to German documents), which used captured German military documents.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Settsu was {{converted}} into a target ship and she played a minor role {{at the beginning of}} the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. At the beginning of the Pacific War in 1941, the ship was used in an attempt to deceive the Allies as to the locations <b>and</b> <b>activities</b> <b>of</b> the Japanese aircraft carriers. Settsu reverted to her normal role as a target ship for the rest of the war; she was badly damaged when Allied aircraft carriers struck the naval base at Kure Naval District in July 1945. The ship was refloated after the war and scrapped in 1946–47.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{was found}} that C-reactive protein (CRP) could {{significantly}} increase the expression <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> tissue factor (TF), but decrease that of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in dose- and time-dependent manners, which could be antagonized by PDTC and U 0126. CRP could also increase protein expression of phosphorylated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), IκB-α and ERK 1 / 2 in dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, neutralizing antibody to CD 32 (FcgammaR II) could significantly attenuate the expression <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> TF <b>and</b> TFPI induced by CRP. These results suggest that CRP may promote coagulation by enhancing the expression <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> TF <b>and</b> reducing that of TFPI by activating NF-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase via FcgammaR II...|$|R
