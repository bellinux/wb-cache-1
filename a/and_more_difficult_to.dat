Lead's toxicity has led to its phasing out for some uses.|$|E
5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, {{the speed of light}} in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of stone}} in Egyptian temples {{emphasized}} their purpose as eternal houses for {{the gods and}} set them apart from buildings {{for the use of}} mortals, which were built of mudbrick. Early temples were built of brick and other perishable materials, and most of the outlying buildings in temple enclosures remained brick-built throughout Egyptian history. The main stones used in temple construction were limestone and sandstone, which are common in Egypt; stones that are harder <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> carve, such as granite, were used in smaller amounts for individual elements like obelisks. The stone to build a temple might be quarried nearby or shipped on the Nile from quarries elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The clade Oviraptorosauria is {{generally}} regarded {{as a group of}} non-avian (or non-bird) theropod dinosaurs, and their similarity to birds (Aves) has often been noted. Fossils of oviraptorosaurs in the family Caenagnathidae have historically been confused with those of birds, and some researchers have {{gone so far as to}} consider oviraptorosaurs as a whole more closely related to birds than to other non-avian dinosaurs. In 2002 Lü and colleagues used the then unnamed Nemegtomaia to show similarities between birds and oviraptorosaurs, and found the latter group to be closer to birds than to bird-like dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurs. They therefore concluded that oviraptorosaurs were flightless birds rather than non-avian dinosaurs, and noted that the boundary between birds and dinosaurs was becoming more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> delineate. Other researchers have instead found dromaeosaurs and troodontids to be most closely related to birds, together forming the group Paraves; oviraptorosaurs, therizinosaurs, and alvarezsaurs are just outside this group. The wider group that includes oviraptorosaurs and Paraves is called Pennaraptora, and this group is defined by the presence of pennaceous feathers (feathers with a stalk).|$|E

5|$|The {{rocks in}} Glacier National Park {{are the best}} {{preserved}} Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in the world, {{with some of the}} world's most fruitful sources for records of early life. Sedimentary rocks of similar age located in other regions have been greatly altered by mountain building and other metamorphic changes; consequently fossils are less common <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> observe. The rocks in the park preserve such features as millimeter-scale lamination, ripple marks, mud cracks, salt-crystal casts, raindrop impressions, oolites, and other sedimentary bedding characteristics. Six fossilized species of Stromatolites, early organisms consisting of primarily blue-green algae, have been documented and dated at about 1billion years. The discovery of the Appekunny Formation, a well preserved rock stratum in the park, pushed back the established date for the origination of animal life a full billion years. This rock formation has bedding structures which are believed to be the remains of the earliest identified metazoan (animal) life on Earth.|$|E

25|$|The game {{revolves}} around an undercover agent named Kyle Crane who {{is sent to}} infiltrate a quarantine zone in a city called Harran.

The gameplay is focused on weapons-based combat and parkour. The game also features an asymmetrical multiplayer mode (originally set to be a pre-order bonus); and a four-player, co-operative multiplayer mode.|$|E
25|$|Black {{light is}} {{commonly}} used to authenticate oil paintings, antiques and banknotes. Black lights {{can be used to}} differentiate real currency from counterfeit notes because, in many countries, legal banknotes have fluorescent symbols on them that only show under a black light. In addition, the paper used for printing money does not contain any of the brightening agents which cause commercially available papers to fluoresce under black light. Both of these features make illegal notes easier to detect <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> successfully counterfeit. The same security features can be applied to identification cards.|$|E

Anglo-Saxons used symbolism, not just to communicate, but as tools to aid their thinking about the world.

25|$|To {{accommodate}} a folding wing the designers considered retracting the {{main landing gear}} rearward but, for the chord of wing that was chosen, {{it was difficult to}} make the landing gear struts long enough to provide ground clearance for the large propeller. Their solution was an inverted gull wing, which considerably shortened the required length of the main gear legs. The anhedral of the wing's center-section also permitted the wing and fuselage to meet at the optimum angle for minimizing drag, without using wing root fairings. The bent wing, however, was heavier <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> construct, offsetting these benefits.|$|E
25|$|The {{quantity}} of the world's remaining energy resources {{is a matter}} of dispute and serious concern. Between 2005 and 2007, despite the trebling of oil prices, oil production remained relatively flat, a sign according to many that oil production has peaked. Studies by Dave Rutledge of the California Institute of Technology, and by the Energy Watch Group of Germany indicate that global coal production will also peak within the current generation, perhaps as soon as 2030. A parallel study by the Energy Watch Group also indicates the limited supply of uranium; this report states that like UK coal production 200 years ago, the production of uranium has first targeted high quality ores, and remaining sources are less dense <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> access.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} wage dispute, {{there were other}} {{elements}} of grievances {{that contributed to the}} strike of 1968. A change in the way trash was collected in the city reduced the amount of sanitation workers needed to perform the work. Under the old system approximately 280 men were needed, as opposed to the reduced 235 men needed under the new streamlined system. The savings from this new system of garbage collection was to be passed onto the sanitation workers, which according to the workers never materialized. Furthermore, older workers with seniority in the department feared termination over the newly implemented trash containers as they were heavier <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> handle. Strikers explained that there was a long list of “broken promises” behind the strike as well as a need for respect within the sanitation department and the community.|$|E
