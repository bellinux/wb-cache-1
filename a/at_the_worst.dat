5|$|Neither the mutiny nor {{the popular}} {{uprising}} came entirely {{as a surprise}} to the French authorities. The colonial government's first large scale crackdown on the VNQDD in 1929 had substantially damaged the party, which had modelled itself on the Chinese Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek. The crackdown also had the effect of increasing the violent tendencies within what remained of the VNQDĐ. Its remaining leadership was now willing to intensify preparations for a violent overthrow of colonial rule to create an independent Vietnamese republic. Most of the party's leadership ranks, but not its lower-ranking members and affiliates, seem to have concluded that they were too weak and too closely spied on by the Sûreté to have a meaningful chance of success. At the most optimistic, they could hope to trigger a spontaneous uprising; <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst,</b> the subsequent French reprisals would transform them into anti-colonial martyrs. Finally, there was disagreement or a communication problem over the timing of the insurrection: after Hoc had ordered the postponement of the mutiny, Nhu still proceeded.|$|E
5|$|The {{strong winds}} left {{considerable}} tree and powerline damage. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the storm, 23,000 of the island's 30,000power subscribers were without electricity. Damage to power lines totaled to $385,000 (2001USD, $468,700 2008USD). The strong winds also caused considerable damage to vegetation. Three cruise ships weathered the storm at Saint George Harbour, where the powerful winds ripped out a post and snapped a mooring line, leaving a ship drifting in the harbor. One crew member was minorly injured. Over a dozen boats broke free from their moorings, resulting in them running aground or sinking. In all, 87boats were affected to some degree, with marine damage totaling to about $665,000 (2001USD, $809,600 2008USD). The winds also caused minor damage to 175properties on the island, primarily to houses. Damage to houses amounted to about $425,000 (2001USD, $517,400 2008USD). Overall damage was moderate, totaling to about $1.4million (2001USD, $1.7million 2008USD). No fatalities were reported, {{though a few}} storm-related injuries occurred.|$|E

25|$|There is one {{fundamental}} lesson we {{must learn}} from this experience: electricity is really different from everything else. It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities {{to take advantage of}} a deregulated market endless.

If Murphy's Law were written for a market approach to electricity, then the law would state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> possible time.' And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.|$|E

[...] Although a successful craftsman, he remains within the working class, not seeking to rise above his station, and is content with his lot. [...] His children are not willing to remain within that class, however: the sons run away and the daughters seek to marry well, symbolizing the change being wrought by industrialization. Robert Dunne points out that the working classes are not depicted favorably in Hay's novel, but as [...] "stupid and ill-bred, at the best loyal servants to the gentry and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> overly ambitious and a threat to the welfare of Buffland". Sloane considers unfavorable depictions of the working classes inevitable given the plot, and less noticeable than skewed portrayals of the wealthy in other books of the time.|$|E

[...] Brian McNair, the author of Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratization of Desire, stated that upon the album's release [...] "academic books began to appear about the 'Madonna phenomenon', while pro- and anti-porn feminists made of her a symbol of all that was good or bad (depending on their viewpoint) about contemporary sexual culture."

500|$|Hurricane Fabian struck Bermuda on Friday, the 5 September, 2003, with {{sustained}} winds having reached [...] by 0800, [...] by 1400, and 150mph (240km/h) by 1755. The eye did {{not pass}} directly over the archipelago, instead passing to the west (placing Bermuda in the North-East quarter where the winds were particularly powerful) with the eye wall dragging over Bermuda for three hours. This prolonged the damaging winds the island was subjected to. The storm produced a 10-minute average wind speed of 120mph (195km/h), while a peak wind gust of 164mph (264km/h) occurred at Bermuda Harbour Radio. The strongest of the winds lasted approximately three to four hours, and while the eastern portion of the eyewall moved over the island, winds decreased to 60mph (95km/h). Large waves battered the southern portion of the island for several days, reaching heights of 25 to 35feet (7 to 10m) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> of the hurricane, and upon passing the island, the hurricane produced a storm surge exceeding 11feet (3m) in height. Due to its fast motion, rainfall totals rose to only 1.82inches (46.2mm). There were several unofficial reports of tornadoes as well. Strong rip currents from the hurricane persisted for several days prior to Fabian passing the island; two swimmers {{were caught in the}} currents and relied on lifeguard assistance to return to shore. As a result, rip tide warnings were posted for the island.|$|E

500|$|There {{were about}} an {{estimated}} 15–20,000 mature sarus cranes {{left in the}} wild in 2009. The Indian population is less than 10,000, but of the three subspecies, is the healthiest in terms of numbers. They are considered sacred and the birds are traditionally left unharmed, and in many areas they are unafraid of humans. They used to be found on occasion in Pakistan, but have not been seen there since the late 1980s. The population in India has however declined. Estimates of the global population suggest that the population in 2000 was at best about 10% and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> just 2.5% of the numbers that existed in 1850. Many farmers in India believe that these cranes damage standing crops, particularly rice, although studies show that direct feeding on rice grains resulted in losses amounting to {{less than one percent}} and trampling could account for grain loss of about [...] The attitude of farmers tends to be positive in spite of these damages, and this has helped in conserving the species within agricultural areas. The role of rice paddies may be particularly important for the birds' conservation, since natural wetlands are increasingly threatened by human activity. The conversion of wetlands to farmland, and farmland to more urban uses are major causes for habitat loss and long-term population decline. Compensating farmers for crop losses has been suggested as a measure that may help. The Australian population is greater than 5,000 birds and may be increasing, however, the Southeast Asian population has been decimated by war and habitat change (such as intensive agriculture, deforestation, and draining of wetlands) and by the mid-20th century had disappeared from large parts of its range which once stretched up to southern China; some 1500–2000 birds are left in several fragmented subpopulations. Payment to locals to guard nests and help increase breeding success has been attempted in northern Cambodia. Nest success of protected nests was significantly higher than that of unprotected nests, and positive population-level impacts were apparent. However, the program also caused local jealousies leading to deliberate disturbance of nests, and did nothing to alleviate larger-scale and more permanent threats due to habitat losses leading to the conclusion that such payment-for-conservation programs are at best a short-term complement, and not a substitute, to more permanent interventions that include habitat preservation. The little-known Philippine population became extinct in the late 1960s.|$|E
