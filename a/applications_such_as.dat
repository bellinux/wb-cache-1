5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets {{can have}} up to 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding <b>applications,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines. This substitution would require up to 100grams of dysprosium per electric car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2million units per year, the use of dysprosium in <b>applications</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> this would quickly exhaust its available supply. The dysprosium substitution may also be useful in other applications because it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets.|$|E

5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxide–nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage <b>applications,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> in hard disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in electric car motors and wind turbine generators.|$|E
