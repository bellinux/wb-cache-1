5|$|The mass {{deportation}} of Jews {{from the}} Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July 1942 {{with the first}} shipment of 6,000 people. The gas chambers started operation the following morning. For the next two months, deportations from Warsaw continued {{on a daily basis}} via two shuttle trains (the second one, from 6 August 1942), each carrying about 4,000 to 7,000 people crying for water. No other trains were allowed to stop at the Treblinka station. The first daily trains came in the early morning, often after an overnight wait, and the second, in mid-afternoon. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the Sonderkommando squad that managed the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform,</b> and from there to the gas chambers. According to German records, including the official report by SS Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, 265,000 Jews were transported in freight trains from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka during the period from 22 July to 12 September 1942.|$|E
25|$|When {{steam and}} diesel trains run together, it is normal for the diesel to lead up the mountain. This allows the steam train {{to enter the}} {{departure}} platform and load at its leisure, while the diesel moves across from the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> from a quick turn-around.|$|E
25|$|The diesel {{locomotives}} are {{used on the}} normal trains, with the steam locomotives being used on higher priced Heritage Steam trains. On arrival at Llanberis, diesel-hauled trains run directly from the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> to the departure platform, load and depart at the scheduled time. Steam-hauled trains take at least {{half an hour to}} transfer from the arrival to the departure platform, thus making no more than one trip every three hours.|$|E

50|$|The {{double-sided}} and symmetrically arranged station building {{consisted of}} two protruding wings and a recessed central section. The neo-classical single-storey building included two 96 metres-long train sheds with arched arcades, one covering the <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms</b> and the other the departure platforms. Two other tracks ran between the train sheds that were designed for the movement of rolling stock. The two station buildings differed only with regard to a few functionally-related trifles. The departure platforms could only be accessed through an entrance hall, which contained a ticket office, baggage acceptance facilities and restaurants. In contrast, the <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms</b> were freely accessible and bigger to cope better with the surge of traffic when trains arrived.|$|R
6000|$|The crowd melted away, {{after the}} bustling fashion common to <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms,</b> and I was {{beginning}} to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty looking girl stepped up to me, and after a quick glance said, [...] "Dr. Seward, is it not?" ...|$|R
25|$|As Piccadilly was {{originally}} a terminus of the system, one platform {{was originally}} used for arrivals from Altrincham, Bury, and later Eccles, {{and the other}} platform was used for departures. Empty trams ran from the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> into a reversing siding in a tunnel, where they would reverse and then enter the departure platform. The stop was built with extension in mind, and since {{the opening of the}} extension towards Ashton in 2013, the former arrivals platform is also used for departures towards Ashton as well as terminating trams, while the former departures platform now also handles arrivals from Ashton. Terminating trams use a reversing siding on the Ashton line between Piccadilly and New Islington tram stops.|$|E
25|$|At {{the three}} Reinhard camps {{the victims were}} killed by the exhaust fumes of {{stationary}} diesel engines. Gold fillings were pulled from the corpses before burial, but the women's hair was cut before death. At Treblinka, in order to calm the arriving victims, the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> was made to look like a train station, complete with fake clock. Majdanek used Zyklon-B gas in its gas chambers. In contrast to Auschwitz, the three Reinhard camps were quite small. At these camps, most of the initial victims were buried in pits, but in 1942 in order to hide the evidence of the extermination, the exhumation of the bodies and cremation of them was begun. Sobibór and Bełżec began the process in late 1942 but Treblinka did not start until March 1943. The bodies were burned in open fireplaces and the remaining bones were crushed into powder.|$|E
500|$|The {{main station}} between Bishop's Bridge Road and Praed Street was {{designed}} by Brunel, who was enthusiastic {{at the idea of}} being able to design a railway station himself, although much of the architectural detailing was by his associate Matthew Digby Wyatt. [...] He took inspiration from Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace and the München Hauptbahnhof. The glazed roof is supported by wrought iron arches in three spans, respectively spanning , [...] and [...] The roof is [...] long, and the original roof spans had two transepts connecting the three spans. It is commonly believed that these were provided by Brunel to accommodate traversers to carry coaches between the tracks within the station. However recent research, using early documents and photographs, does not seem to support this belief, and their actual purpose is unknown. The original station used four platforms, a -wide and -wide departure platform, [...] a [...] <b>arrival</b> <b>platform,</b> and a [...] combined <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and cab road. A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} a large {{building}} facing Paradise Road near the junction with Kings Road. A tall tower {{was part of the}} main building which stood on the departure platform. The departure and <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms</b> and two sidings between were covered by two substantial train sheds with wide glazed arches at the end. The goods yard was situated to the south of the passenger station.|$|R
5000|$|Behind {{the main}} {{entrance}} building, the L&B station had a wrought iron framed trainshed which had two spans, and covered an area 217 feet (66 metres) long and 113 feet (34 metres) wide. It had two platforms, one for departures and one for arrivals. The Grand Junction Railway had parallel departure and <b>arrivals</b> <b>platforms</b> and a separate entrance building and booking office (now demolished) further along Curzon Street, designed by Joseph Franklin.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} four storeys above ground level. The ground floor has a taxi stand outside and {{has access to}} the {{concourse}} on the first floor. The concourse is integrated with the Maritime Square shopping centre. The second floor houses the Tung Chung line platform for trains heading for Hong Kong Station, and the third floor houses the Tung Chung line platform for services towards Tung Chung Station. At the Airport Express departure and <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms,</b> there is a free WiFi hotspot available. Unlike at Kowloon and Hong Kong stations, there are no in-town check-in facilities in this station.|$|R
2500|$|The {{shipments}} to camps under Operation Reinhard came {{mainly from the}} ghettos. The Warsaw Ghetto created by Nazi Germans on 16 November 1940 held eventually over 450,000 Jews cramped in an area meant for about 60,000 people. The second-largest Łódź Ghetto held 204,000 Jews. Both ghettos had collection points known as Umschlagplatz along the rail tracks, with most deportations from Warsaw to Treblinka taking place between 22 July through to 12 September 1942. The gassing at Treblinka started on 23 July 1942, with two pendulum trains delivering victims six days each week ranging from about 4,000 to 7,000 victims per transport, {{the first in the}} early morning and the second in the mid-afternoon. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the Sonderkommando squad that managed the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform,</b> and from there to the gas chambers. According to German records, including the official report by SS Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, some 265,000 Jews were transported in freight trains from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka during this period. The murder operation code-named Grossaktion Warsaw concluded several months before the subsequent Warsaw Ghetto Uprising resulting in new deportations. The Nazi 1942 record {{of the total number of}} victims most of whom were transported by train to Operation Reinhard death camps, including cumulative numbers known today, is as follows: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The next witness, Constable Thomas Taylor, {{had noticed}} a shabbily dressed individual, with shaggy hair and beard, loafing about {{the station and}} waiting-rooms in the {{afternoon}} of December the 10th. He seemed to be watching the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> of the Tilbury and Southend trains.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then a {{gigantic}} sigh of expectancy came from {{every one of}} the spectators. The 'fun' was about to begin. James Buckland, a porter at Fenchurch Street railway station, had just sworn to tell all the truth, etc. After all, it did not amount to much. He said that at six o'clock in the afternoon of December the 10th, in the midst of one of the densest fogs he ever remembers, the 5.5 from Tilbury steamed into the station, being just about an hour late. He was on the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform,</b> and was hailed by a passenger in a first-class carriage. He could see very little of him beyond an enormous black fur coat and a travelling cap of fur also.|$|E
50|$|The {{platform}} accommodation in {{the station}} was modest, having an <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and a departure platform, with two sidings between them. The siding adjacent to the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> was equipped with ground frame points to release an arriving train engine.|$|E
50|$|Network Rail has proposed, {{in their}} North West RUS, {{installing}} a facing cross-over {{which will allow}} platform 1 to become fully operational as an <b>arrival</b> and departure <b>platform.</b> Doing this will {{reduce the number of}} shunt moves.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} platforms- Platforms 1 and 2 can be (and are) used for any {{combination}} of <b>arrival</b> or departure. <b>Platform</b> 3 cannot be used for arrivals from the West Coastway or departures towards London in the up direction.|$|R
50|$|The MOB {{begins its}} journey in Montreux, departing trains {{normally}} {{making use of}} <b>platform</b> 5 and <b>arrivals</b> <b>platform</b> 6, between the Swiss Federal Railway platforms {{and those of the}} rack and pinion railway to the Rochers de Naye. Winding its way up through the vineyards above Lake Geneva via Chamby, as far as Les Avants, the line passes through the crown tunnel under the Col de Jaman to reach the Saane Valley. In Montbovon there is a connection to the Transports Publics Fribourgeois (TPF; previously GFM) network. Following the Saane upstream, passing the famous hot-air ballooning centre of Château-d'Oex, it leaves the French-speaking canton of Vaud near Rougemont and enters the German-speaking canton of Berne. After Saanen the planners would have liked a direct ascent of the Sannenmöser Pass but without the aid of a rack and pinion system this was impossible and the line was diverted to loop around the village of Gstaad, adding greatly to the development and prosperity of the community. Beyond Gstaad railway station it begins the climb to the head of Saanenmöser Pass, the highest point on the line at 1270 m (3937 ft). On the other side it descends the Simmen Valley to Zweisimmen, where there is a connection to the standard gauge line of the BLS to Spiez.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport is}} served by Line E of the Porto Metro. The station has three {{platforms}} and the trains leave the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and reverse {{into one of the}} departure platforms.|$|E
50|$|Note: Since {{this station}} is the {{terminus}} {{of the branch}} line, one platform is designated as the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and the other as the departure platform. However, in actual service only one platform is used at any given time.|$|E

50|$|Platform 2 is {{the main}} <b>platform</b> for <b>arrivals</b> and {{departure}}s. <b>Platform</b> 1 is a departure platform by shunt move, which is usually used in early mornings by the first trains of the day which have been stabled overnight or when attachment/detachment of a unit to/from a formation is required.|$|R
5000|$|The Y&NM {{opened its}} first section from a {{temporary}} station outside {{the walls of}} York in May 1839 but Hudson wanted to bring the railway {{into the heart of}} York, which meant breaching the city walls. Andrews provided the favoured design for the requisite entry {{in the form of a}} Tudor arch. The new station was laid out to a plan by Robert Stephenson, which was a development of his plan for Euston station making allowances for York's status as a junction. Andrews designed the station buildings. They comprised two separate trainsheds, joined at each end, producing a hipped appearance, which became one of Andrew's trademarks. Each shed was (like Euston) of 40 ft span and the roof was supported by wrought iron [...] "Euston trusses", giving a more slender airy construction than contemporary wooden station roofs. The train sheds were clad with slate on wooden planking, with the portion nearest the apex being glazed. The main station facilities were ranged along the departure platform with a central booking office flanked by the waiting rooms for each class (and a separate waiting room for ladies); provision was also made for parcels traffic, left luggage, the station master and the maintenance of lamps. On the first floor was the Y&NM boardroom and offices. Adjacent to the <b>arrivals</b> <b>platform</b> were 1st and 2nd class refreshment rooms and a bar with bedrooms above.|$|R
25|$|The {{underground}} station at Waterloo was {{located within the}} existing transverse arches of the main line station, with the <b>arrival</b> and departure <b>platforms</b> in separate arches, and a staircase access. Siding accommodation and a reversing siding were provided beyond the platforms: after disembarkation of passengers, an arriving train would continue forward to the reversing sidings, {{and then return to}} the departure platform. An additional lay-by siding was provided later.|$|R
50|$|The {{station on}} the Sakaisuji Line is located under the station on Nankai Railway, and was {{constructed}} together with the elevation of the Nankai Railway lines. An island platform serving 2 tracks and a side platform serving a track are located on the first basement. The side platform (1 train departs every day) is used as the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> in the rush hours.|$|E
50|$|The main {{building}} {{is on the}} south side of the line, nearest the town centre and facing the bus station; it dates from 2000. It contains a booking office and shop.

60|$|Why the {{man should}} {{have spoken to}} me at all I could not tell. Yet it is certain that I heard his simple and courteous inquiry with a thrill of pleasure, not unmixed with excitement. From the first moment of my <b>arrival</b> upon the <b>platform</b> I had singled him out, the only {{interesting}} figure in a crowd of nonentities. Perhaps I had lingered a little too closely by his side, had manifested more curiosity in him than was altogether seemly. At any rate, he spoke to me.|$|R
5000|$|The track layout was reorganised in 1967, {{abolishing the}} {{distinction}} between <b>arrival</b> and departure <b>platforms</b> {{that had been a}} feature of Paddington since opening. A new set of sidings was built south of Royal Oak, and the track curve into Paddington was eased. Services to the Midlands were rerouted via [...] during this time. The station concourse was enlarged in 1970, and the ticket office was rebuilt in the same year. Unlike other London termini such as Euston, the rebuilding work was done with an eye towards preserving Brunel and Wyatt's original station design.|$|R
