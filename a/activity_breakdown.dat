Systemic injection of 3 x 10 (4) U TNF caused an initial increase in functional volume in the tumour, but a strong decrease from 1 to 48 h after treatment. Early effects of intralesional treatment were more moderate.

40|$|Recent {{data suggest}} that gelatinase A (matrix metalloproteinase- 2, MMP- 2) plays an {{important}} role in the degradation of collagen of soft connective tissues. In an attempt to investigate its participation in more detail we assessed the digestion of collagen in cultured rabbit periosteal explants and compared this with the level of active MMP- 2 and collagenases. The data demonstrated that both collagen degradation and MMP activity increased with time. Conditioned medium obtained from explants cultured for 72 h showed that the level of active MMP- 2 correlated with collagen degradation (r = 0. 80, d. f. = 23, P < 0. 0001). Such a relationship was not found with collagenase activity (r = - 0. 08, d. f. = 21, NS). The possible involvement of MMP- 2 in collagen degradation was investigated further by incubating explants with selective gelatinase inhibitors (CT 1166, CT 1399 and CT 1746). In the presence of these compounds breakdown of collagen was almost completely abolished (approximately 80 %).

It has been the basis for the design, testing and evaluation of a prototype system of information and communication technology (ICT), specifically adapted to the domain. Different wound healing clinics were examined using a combination of ‘hard ’ and ‘soft ’ methods to allow a richer perspective of the activity and gain a deeper understanding of the human activity, its relation to the working information system, the existing information technology (IT), and the potential of a comprehensive IT system to manipulate live data in clinic. Clinicians and administration staff were included in all aspects of the process to enhance the design lifecycle and the understanding of the process. An observe, report, plan and act (ORPA) cycle, based on the dictates of action research, was established to accomplish the design and testing of a system that clinicians were comfortable enough with to consider its use in clinic.

40|$|Abstract. Leaf litter inputs {{have been}} {{excluded}} from 1 of 2 Ist-order streams at Coweeta Hydro-logic Laboratory, North Carolina since August 1993 {{to examine the}} bottom-up effects of resource reduction on stream ecosystems. As {{part of the larger}} project, we studied the effect of litter exclusion on the extracellular enzyme activity and fungal biomass of wood biofilms in the presence and absence of leaf litter. Replicate strips of wood veneer were incubated in both streams for 28, 58, and 86 d. Ergosterol content (to estimate fungal biomass), the activity of 5 lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, acid phosphatase <b>activity,</b> <b>breakdown</b> rates, and % organic matter were determined when the veneer strips were collected. Hydrolytic enzyme activity and wood breakdown rates in the litter-excluded stream were significantly higher than in the reference stream. Enzyme activities of all hydrolytic enzymes were highly correlated with each other. Measurement of relative activities of selected extra-cellular enzymes comparing carbon and nutrient acquisition suggested nutrient limitation of hetero-trophic biofilms in the reference stream. Microbial activity of wood biofilms was significantly altered by the exclusion of leaf litter, and hydrolytic enzyme activity, as an indicator of carbon cycling, was higher on wood in streams without leaf litter.

40|$|AbstractThe proper {{functioning}} of the cell depends on preserving the cellular genome. In yeast cells, {{a limited number of}} genes are located on mitochondrial DNA. Although the mechanisms underlying nuclear genome maintenance are well understood, much less is known about the mechanisms that ensure mitochondrial genome stability. Mitochondria influence the stability of the nuclear genome and vice versa. Little is known about the two-way communication and mutual influence of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Although the mitochondrial genome replicates independent of the nuclear genome and is organized by a distinct set of mitochondrial nucleoid proteins, nearly all genome stability mechanisms responsible for maintaining the nuclear genome, such as mismatch repair, base excision repair, and double-strand break repair via homologous recombination or the nonhomologous end-joining pathway, also act to protect mitochondrial DNA. In addition to mitochondria-specific DNA polymerase γ, the polymerases α, η, ζ, and Rev 1 have been found in this organelle. A nuclear genome instability phenotype results from a failure of various mitochondrial functions, such as an electron transport chain <b>activity</b> <b>breakdown</b> leading to a decrease in ATP production, a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ), and a block in nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis. The loss of ΔΨ inhibits the production of iron–sulfur prosthetic groups, which impairs the assembly of Fe–S proteins, including those that mediate DNA transactions; disturbs iron homeostasis; leads to oxidative stress; and perturbs wobble tRNA modification and ribosome assembly, thereby affecting translation and leading to proteotoxic stress. In this review, we present the current knowledge of the mechanisms that govern mitochondrial genome maintenance and demonstrate ways in which the impairment of mitochondrial function can affect nuclear genome stability...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Surgical {{procedures}} aim at preserving {{human life}} and improving life quality. However, there are many poten- tial risk sources that can cause serious harm to patients. For centuries, managers believed that the technical competence of the surgeon is the only key to a successful surgery. But over the past decade, risks have been considered in terms of process-based safety procedures, teamwork and inter departmental communication. This study aims {{to determine how the}} process-biased surgical risk management should be done in terms of project management tool named <b>activity</b> <b>breakdown</b> structure (ABC). Methods: This study was conducted in two stages. First, literature review and meeting with professors was done to de- termine principles and framework of surgical risk management. Responsible teams for surgical patient journey were then involved in subsequent meetings to develop the process-biased surgical risk management. This study is a qualitative research in which the inductive approach is used on focus groups. Sampling was performed to achieve representative- ness through intensity sampling biased on experience and seniority. Context analysis of interviews and consensus themes extracted from focus discussion group meetings discussion was the analysis tool. Results: We structured the patient journey process in five main phases, 24 activities and 108 tasks. Then, the responsible teams were involved, and the transposition and allocated places for performing were chosen. Because of their importance, some activities and task themes such as patient identification and records review were repeated in each phase. Conclusions: Risk management of surgical departments is significant as this is typically the hospital facility with the both the highest cost and revenue. Communication between the surgical team and other clinical teams outside the surgery department through process-biased perspective could improve the safety of patients.

40|$|The 1997 SAM for Costa Rica {{takes into}} account the new {{non-traditional}} export sectors spurred by the export promotion policies of the past two decades. The existing SAMs for Costa Rica do not include these new sectors and the productive linkages between these {{and the rest of the}} economy. To attend this serious gap,an effort was carried out to compile a 1997 SAM for Costa Rica, the construction of which is explained in this document along the lines of a ‘top-down’ estimation procedure. The entries of the new SAM were first adjusted in a summary set of national accounts and then subsets of estimates were adjusted to the controlling aggregate totals. The elimination of data discrepancies, in particular the reconciliation of national accounts data and survey data, was successfully implemented using the Cross-Entropy (CE) method whereby a comprehensive set of constraints could be imposed using all the prior reliable information available. The macro SAM was disaggregated to arrive at a ‘raw micro SAM’. The activity account was split into the 17 production activity accounts, including but not limited to domestic, traditional and non-traditional export agriculture, food industries, textiles, wood products, oil and chemicals, paper, construction, trade, restaurants and hotels, transport and communucation, electricity, gas and water, financial services and insurance.

The current population status and habitat preference of flamingos in the area are still poorly known. Likewise, data on diurnal and seasonal activity pattern of the species are scarce and this leads to the misunderstanding of how Flamingos use local wetlands throughout the different seasons. Data regarding population size and activity pattern were gathered during the wet and dry seasons. Point-count method was used to estimate the population size. Behaviors were recorded using scan sampling techniques. A total of 53671 individuals representing two species of flamingo were counted during both wet and dry seasons from the three lakes. There were more flamingos during the dry season than the wet season in Lake Abijata contrary to Lakes Shalla and Chitu during the wet season. Lesser flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor) were the most abundant species comprising 95. 39 %, while Greater Flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus) accounted for 4. 61 % of the total population. Lake Abijata is the major stronghold of Lesser Flamingos in the area. There was significant variation in the mean number of both species during the wet and dry season in the different study sites of the lake, respectively. The species were known to use varied habitats within the lakes. The Lesser Flamingo mainly preferred the shoreline and mudflat areas of the lakes. However, Greater Flamingo on several occasions showed preference to offshore area of the lakes. Seasonal average flock sizes were not similar between the species.

40|$|Freshwater amphipods in {{southern}} Africa {{are divided into}} three distinct elements. Five ingolfiellid species occur in Namibia, six Sternophysinx species {{are found in the}} northern Cape Province and Transvaal, while 12 Paramelita species are restricted to the south-western Cape. The crangonyctoid genus Paramelita was last reviewed in 1981 based mainly on a reassessment of museum material. Thus, large scale field surveys of these amphipods have not been undertaken since they were first described by Barnard in 1916 and 1927. In addition, {{little is known about the}} ecology of these amphipods. This thesis examines the systematics, distribution and aspects of the ecology of Paramelita. After an extensive sampling programme in 1989 and 1990, several new species were discovered. Four new species, whose affinities with the known species were not immediately evident, were initially described, and later, after further analyses. of morphological and genetic differentiation amongst Paramelita populations, eight other new species were recognised. A phenetic analysis of the 24 Paramelita species revealed the existence of three distinct groups. The new genus Afrocrangonyx was proposed to accommodate seven of these species, whilst a single species was placed in the new genus Aquadulcaris. Sixteen species remained in Paramelita. Based on a cladistic analysis of morphological data, a fully resolved phylogenetic tree was obtained for Afrocrangonyx, but not for Paramelita, suggesting that the latter genus is not monophyletic. A population of P. nigroculus in Window Stream, Table Mountain, was selected for a detailed ecological study. P. nigroculus occurred at high densities, and showed no seasonal breeding patterns. An investigation of thermal acclimation and tolerances to high temperatures in P. nigroculus individuals showed that their acclimation rates and lethal limits were similar to many other crustaceans. P. nigroculus individuals feed mainly on allochthonous input. An investigation of the nature, timing and magnitude of this input indicated that litter was dominated by abscissed leaves which fall throughout the year, peaking in summer. Leaf fall values and benthic detritus standing stocks were within the range reported for headwaters worldwide. A study of leaf retention capabilities of two similar headwaters revealed that amphipod abundances were positively correlated with leaf retention characteristics. Leaf retention was strongly influenced by discharge, with increasing discharges resulting in decreases in retention and stream bed complexity. Thus the stream with higher discharges was less favourable for colonisation by amphipods. Since P. nigroculus occurred at such high densities, it was expected to play a significant role in breakdown of detritus. Breakdown of three riparian leaf species in litter bags submerged in two streams was investigated. Litter bags were designed to allow amphipod access, yet retain fragments which resulted from physical abrasion and feeding <b>activity.</b> <b>Breakdown</b> was rapid, and the decomposition rate of one of the leaf species was the highest ever recorded for a riparian leaf species.

We also performed a reciprocal exchange experiment of leaves that had been colonized by microorganisms in two streams with contrasting water chemistries. Decom- poser activity varied greatly depending on the stream in which the leaves were placed. Variation in breakdown rates of yellow poplar leaves was over 9 -fold maximum ATP concentrations associated with leaves varied as much as 8 -fold, and maximum sporulation rates of fungi associated with leaves varied over 80 -fold among streams. Among all streams, nitrate, phosphate, and temperature were positively correlated {{with one another and}} with decomposer biomass and activity. When hardwater streams were analyzed separately, nitrate concentration was the only variable that was significantly correlated with all measures of microbial <b>activity</b> and leaf <b>breakdown.</b> Consequently, nitrate concentration appeared to explain much of the variation we detected among streams. Responses to the reciprocal exchange experiment were rapid, with significant changes occurring within the first 5 d after the transfer. Leaves transferred from the hardwater stream containing relatively high concentrations of nitrate and phosphate to the softwater stream containing low concentra- tions of nutrients exhibited by large decreases in both ATP concentrations and sporulation rates, whereas ATP concentrations and sporulation rates increased when leaves received the reciprocal transfer. The fungi associated with decomposing leaves in streams appear to obtain a significant portion of their nutrients (e. g., nitrogen and phosphorus) from the water passing over the leaf surface. These results indicate that the chemistry of the water can be an important regulator of leaf breakdown in streams by affecting the activity of decomposer fungi...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{emergent}} importance of benefits realisation applied to healthcare infrastructure and service development programs, HaCIRIC has undertaken a research initiative targeting {{the development of}} a robust and comprehensive Benefits Realisation (BeReal©) process. The resulting model is focusing on how benefits should be elicited at the initial strategic stages, and how benefits should be deployed, managed and traced along the lifecycle of a programme so their realisation contributes to successful health outcomes. Subsequently BeReal© aspires to be an appropriate method to drive and control the programme plan; providing tools and techniques for defining specific benefits. It also allows the measurement and evaluation {{of the extent to which}} those benefits are delivered. We have set ourselves the objective of identifying current best practices and demonstrate how to improve benefits realisation in healthcare infrastructure provision. The HaCIRIC team in active collaboration with leading industry partners have undertaken various case and comparator studies not only to define a business critical process but to set out an ideology which places benefits realisation at the heart of securing wholly integrated (collective) change. We believe that to deliver consistent high quality infrastructure and services within an ever changing investment model requires a different level of thinking and understanding towards benefits realisation. The challenge of answering community needs through intelligent investment in infrastructure is complex and demands a deeper and inclusive awareness and appreciation of how to deliver benefits and effectively allocate resources. The BeReal© initiative seeks to contribute methodologically and intends to help spending money intelligently, working with programme and project related stakeholders, securing that the best possible benefits are obtained for the overall healthcare communities. This report highlights selected performed initiatives and summarises BeReal© process’s major characteristics, covering far more than the follow-up of a competitive tendering process and of {{the development of a}} traditional business case.
