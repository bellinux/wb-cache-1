Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills a spider. Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E
5|$|U 956 {{was first}} {{documented}} by Johannes Haquini Rhezelius (d. 1666), {{and later by}} Johan Peringskiöld (1710), who commented that the inscription was legible {{in spite of the}} stone having been split in two parts. Unlike modern scholars, Peringskiöld connected this stone, like the other Greece runestones, to the Gothic wars in south-eastern Europe from the 3rd century and onwards. Olof Celsius visited the stone three times, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> was in 1726 together with his nephew Anders Celsius. Olof Celsius noted that Peringskiöld had been wrong and that the stone was intact, although it gives an impression of being split in two, and the same observation was made by Richard Dybeck in 1866.|$|E

This is also the earliest presidential election where all four major party presidential and vice presidential candidates are still living, the most recent when both Georgia and Montana would vote Democratic, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> the state of Florida backed the losing candidate.

Victor Wegria and Josip Weber won the title 3 consecutive times (resp. between 1958–59 and 1960–61 while at RFC Liégeois and between 1991–92 and 1993–94 while at Cercle Brugge KSV).

25|$|This was {{the last}} time a Republican {{candidate}} won an electoral vote in the region of New England until 2016, with Donald Trump winning the 2nd Congressional District of Maine. As of 2017, this {{was the last}} election where a Republican candidate won New Hampshire, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> the state of Iowa backed the losing candidate. Likewise, this was also the first presidential election that Delaware and Pennsylvania, would fail to vote for the wining candidate since 1948, and 1968, with California, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, and New Jersey all failing to do the same since 1976 respectively as well. This was also the first presidential election since Jimmy Carter's narrow victory in 1976, that a presidential candidate from either party would win a presidential election with fewer than 300 electoral votes, and the first time a Republican would win without breaking that amount since William McKinley's victory in 1900.|$|E
25|$|During the Mission Status Briefing, the STS-135 lead flight {{director}} Mr. Kwatsi Alibaruho said that transfers were right on timeline with 70% complete. The crew {{was ahead of}} timeline on earlier days but the computer problem caused them to slow down. He further mentioned that the latch on Atlantis's middeck locker for LiOH canisters is broken, and as a result, the entire panel had been fastened to floor with fasteners. The LiOH canisters are used to scrub Carbon Dioxide from the cabin air inside the shuttle. When Atlantis is docked to the Space station, the station Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) takes care of both the station's and Atlantis's air revitalization. However, when Atlantis flies solo after undocking, LiOH canisters are required. Regarding the GPC-4 issue, Mr. Alibaruho {{said that it was}} a very infrequent failure, happened before only on STS-9 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> a problem occurred on GPC 4 was on Atlantis's STS-71 mission.|$|E

The mayor is elected in odd numbered years following the United States Presidential Election, as are the aldermen representing odd-numbered wards. The President of the Board of Aldermen and the aldermen from even-numbered wards are elected in the off-years. The Democratic Party has dominated St. Louis city politics for decades. The city {{has not had a}} Republican mayor since 1949 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> a Republican was elected to another citywide office was in the 1970s. As of 2015, all 28 of the city's Aldermen are Democrats. Forty-Six individuals have held the office of mayor of St. Louis, four of whom—William Carr Lane, John Fletcher Darby, John Wimer, and John How—served non-consecutive terms. The most terms served by a mayor was by Lane who served 8 full terms plus the unexpired term of Darby. The current mayor is Lyda Krewson, who took office April 18, 2017 The second-longest serving mayor was Henry Kiel, who took office April 15, 1913 and left office April 21, 1925, a total of 12 years and 9 days over three terms in office. Two others—Raymond Tucker, and Vincent C. Schoemehl—also served three terms as mayor, but served seven fewer days. The shortest serving mayor was Arthur Barret who died 11 days after taking office.|$|E

500|$|The fourth {{legislative}} assembly election of Madras State (later renamed as Tamil Nadu) {{was held in}} February 1967. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) led coalition {{under the leadership of}} C.N. Annadurai won the election defeating the Indian National Congress (Congress). Anti-Hindi agitations, the rising prices of essential commodities and a shortage of rice were the dominant issues. K. Kamaraj's resignation as the Chief Minister in 1963, to concentrate on party affairs, along with persistent rumours of corruption had weakened the incumbent Congress Government. This was the second time after Communist Party of India winning Kerala assembly elections in 1957, for a non-Congress party to gain majority in a state in India, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>time</b> that Congress held power in Tamil Nadu. It was the first time a party or pre-election alliance was formed a nob-Congress government with absolute majority. [...] It marked the beginning of Dravidian dominance in the politics of Tamil Nadu.
