5|$|The major {{function}} of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body's calcium and phosphate levels within <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. The parathyroid glands do this by secreting parathyroid hormone.|$|E
5|$|Although blue phases are of {{interest}} for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, they exist in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> temperature range, usually less than a few kelvin. Recently the stabilization of blue phases over a temperature range of more than 60K including room temperature (260–326K) has been demonstrated. Blue phases stabilized at room temperature allow electro-optical switching with response times {{of the order of}} 10−4s.|$|E
5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided to attach the straps; the scabbard between was covered by a (tube) fitting. The hilt was covered with ray skin and the scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E
40|$|It is a {{misunderstanding}} to focus {{too much and}} unilaterlly on the "scholastic" acquisition {{of the language of}} the host country and to forget the complexity in the mechanisms of integration of allophone new comers in a country.

5|$|Parasitoids {{lay their}} eggs on or {{in the body of}} an insect host, which is then used as a food for {{developing}} larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Most insect parasitoids are wasps or flies, and many have <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> host range. The most important groups are the ichneumonid wasps, which mainly use caterpillars as hosts; braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including aphids; chalcid wasps, which parasitize eggs and larvae of many insect species; and tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, beetle adults and larvae, and true bugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe is {{the proposition}} that the conditions that allow life in the Universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical constants lie within <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> range, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or life as it is understood. The proposition is discussed among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents of creationism.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{variation}} lies {{in the definition of}} species, and whether closely related taxa are considered separate species or subspecies. Thus, a very wide view of each species, such as Webb's results in few species, while <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> view such as that of Fernandes results in a larger number. Another factor is the status of hybrids, given natural hybridisation, with a distinction between 'ancient hybrids' and 'recent hybrids'. The term 'ancient hybrid' refers to hybrids found growing over a large area, and therefore now considered as separate species, while 'recent hybrid' refers to solitary plants found amongst their parents, with a more restricted range.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} from the Givetian of Middle Devonian Greenland, of Canning Land, to be precise. H. kochi has <b>a</b> {{comparatively}} <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> nuchal plate.|$|R

50|$|The larvae feed on Globularia cordifolia. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine {{consists}} of <b>a</b> straight, <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> corridor which is completely filled with frass. Often the mine crosses to another leaf, where the corridor becomes somewhat wider.|$|R
5|$|The Korean War was an {{escalation}} of border clashes between two rival Korean regimes (each {{of which was}} supported by external powers) with each Korean regime trying to topple the other through political and guerrilla tactics. In <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> sense, some may {{refer to it as}} a civil war, though many other factors were at play. After failing to strengthen their cause in the free elections held in South Korea during May 1950 and the refusal of South Korea to hold new elections per North Korean demands, the communist North Korean Army moved south on June 25, 1950 to attempt to reunite the Korean peninsula, which had been formally divided since 1948. The conflict was then expanded by the United States and the Soviet Union's involvement as part of the larger Cold War. The main hostilities were during the period from June 25, 1950 until the armistice was signed on July 27, 1953.|$|E

50|$|The larvae feed on Trema orientalis. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine has {{the form of a}} rather large, irregular, oblong, {{transparent}} blotch mine which starts as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> long, <b>narrow</b> gallery.|$|R

I'm not happy about it. ... The leadership starts at the top, and I think that Chairman Michael Steele is on <b>a</b> <b>very</b> short leash, he has <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> opportunity to show that he can raise the money, that he can be a strong leader for the party. Otherwise, I think perhaps the clock {{in the back of his}} head in his office might be ticking".|$|R

25|$|In September 1970 Suleiman Franjieh, who {{had left}} the country briefly for Latakia in the 1950s after being accused of killing {{hundreds}} of people including other Maronites, was elected president by <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> vote in parliament. In November, his personal friend Hafiz al-Asad, who had received him during his exile, seized power in Syria. Later, in 1976, Franjieh would invite the Syrians into Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|Wiercinski's {{research}} methods and conclusions are not {{accepted by the}} vast majority of Mesoamerican scholars, in part because of his reliance on the Polish Comparative-Morphological methodology which limits the placement of skull types within <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>narrow</b> spectrum that is often within Caucasian, Negroid, and Mongoloid. Native Americans are thus made to fit within these groups which often yields false and contradictory assumptions as a result of sample bias.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Rubus species, {{including}} Rubus occidentalis. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine is <b>a</b> long, <b>very</b> <b>narrow,</b> serpentine tract on the upper surface of the leaf.
