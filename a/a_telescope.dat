5|$|The {{orbital motion}} of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular {{separation}} of 3arcseconds and a maximum of 11arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> with at least 300mm (12in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A periastron occurred in 1994 and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with <b>a</b> <b>telescope.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{its closest}} approach, the angular size of Mars is 25arcseconds (a unit of degree); {{this is much}} {{too small for the}} naked eye to resolve. Hence, prior to the {{invention}} of the telescope, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.|$|E

5|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to view the Pleiades through <b>a</b> <b>telescope.</b> He thereby discovered that the cluster contains many stars too dim {{to be seen with}} the naked eye.

5|$|Gamma Circini is {{a binary}} star 450light-years away, whose {{components}} need <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> of 150mm to be seen, {{as they are}} only 0.8 arcseconds apart. The brighter component is a bluish Be star of spectral type B5IV+ and magnitude 4.51, while the dimmer component is a yellow star of magnitude 5.5. They orbit each other every 180 years. Delta Circini is also a multiple star whose components have magnitudes of 5.1 and 13.4 and orbit around a common centre of gravity every 3.9 days. The brighter component is a close eclipsing binary (specifically, a rotating ellipsoidal variable), with a minor dip of magnitude (0.1). Both are hot blue stars of spectral types O7III-V and O9.5V, respectively, and are estimated to have around 22 and 12 times the Sun's mass. Over 3600light-years away, this system would outshine Venus at magnitude −4.8 if it were 32light-years (10parsecs) distant. The two main components are separated by 50 arcseconds, resolvable {{to the naked eye}} for individuals with good vision and easily discernible with <b>a</b> <b>telescope.</b>|$|E

5|$|Like the {{classical}} planets, Uranus is {{visible to the}} naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.

5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude of Ariel is 14.8; {{similar to that}} of Pluto near perihelion. However, while Pluto can be seen through <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> of 30cm aperture, Ariel, due to its proximity to Uranus's glare, is often not visible to telescopes of 40cm aperture.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} ring of Neptune {{is called}} the Galle ring after Johann Gottfried Galle, {{the first person to}} see Neptune through <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> (1846). It is about 2,000km wide and orbits 41,000–43,000km from the planet. It is a faint ring with an average normal optical depth of around 10−4, and with an equivalent depth of 0.15km. The fraction of dust in this ring is estimated from 40% to 70%.|$|E

5|$|The star's {{magnitude}} as observed from Earth is 9; this signifies {{that the}} body is not visible with the naked eye, but can be seen with <b>a</b> <b>telescope.</b> HD 2039 lies roughly 330 light years from the Sun, which is about {{as far from the}} Sun as the second brightest star in the night sky, Canopus.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude between +7.7 and +8.0, Neptune is never {{visible to the}} naked eye and can be outshone by Jupiter's Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno, and 6 Hebe. <b>A</b> <b>telescope</b> or strong binoculars will resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to Uranus.|$|E
5|$|A {{degree to}} the {{northwest}} of ζ Tauri is the Crab Nebula (M1), a supernova remnant. This expanding nebula was created by a Type II supernova explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> to observe. North American peoples also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.|$|E

5|$|All four Galilean moons {{are bright}} {{enough that they}} could be sighted from Earth without <b>a</b> <b>telescope,</b> if they were farther away from Jupiter. (They are, however, easily visible with even low-powered binoculars.) They have {{apparent}} magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun, and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction. The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter since they are obscured by its brightness. The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 10 minutes of arc from Jupiter, which is close to the limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.|$|E
5|$|Andromeda's {{most celebrated}} open cluster is NGC 752 (Caldwell 28) at an overall {{magnitude}} of 5.7. It is a loosely scattered cluster in the Milky Way that measures 49 arcminutes across and features approximately twelve bright stars, although more than 60 stars of approximately 9th magnitude become visible at low magnifications in <b>a</b> <b>telescope.</b> It {{is considered to}} be one of the more inconspicuous open clusters. The other open cluster in Andromeda is NGC 7686, which has a similar magnitude of 5.6 and is also a part of the Milky Way. It contains approximately 20 stars in a diameter of 15 arcminutes, making it a tighter cluster than NGC 752.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build <b>a</b> <b>telescope</b> that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
