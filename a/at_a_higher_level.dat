5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|E

However, the Flyers subsequently sent him to their farm team in the International Hockey League (IHL), the Kalamazoo Wings.

He played 19games for Kalamazoo, recording six wins and a GAA of4.35.

5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where its range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky crag martin, the pale crag martin breeds at a higher altitude. Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian crag martin, which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the pale crag martin favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level.</b> The separation by altitude and aridity means that it is not known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise.

Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from the NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members.

5|$|Alonso {{returned}} to the team for the , where the engine was retuned to operate <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of performance and the team introduced a range of aerodynamic updates including sidepod fins and a new front wing. However, Alonso and Button still qualified on the penultimate row of the grid ahead of the Manor Marussia drivers Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens. Both cars retired from the race with mechanical problems. The team did not score any points during {{the first round of}} flyaway races, struggling with poor reliability and a lack of engine performance; the Chinese Grand Prix was the only race where both cars were classified as finishing. Although Alonso repeated the team's best finish of eleventh place in Bahrain, any hope of improved performance was arrested with the start of the European season at the next round in Spain, where Button finished sixteenth and Alonso retired with brake problems.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong is {{the first}} example of a {{complete}} narrative told in video game form, and like 1980's Pac-Man, it employs cutscenes to advance its plot. The game opens with the gorilla climbing a pair of ladders {{to the top of}} a construction site. He sets Pauline down and stomps his feet, causing the steel beams to change shape. He then moves to his final perch and sneers. This brief animation sets the scene and adds background to the gameplay, a first for video games. Upon reaching the end of the stage, another cutscene begins. A heart appears between Mario and Pauline, but Donkey Kong grabs the woman and climbs higher, causing the heart to break. The narrative concludes when Mario reaches the end of the rivet stage. He and Pauline are reunited, and a short intermission plays. The gameplay then loops from the beginning <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of difficulty, without any formal ending.|$|E
5|$|Passage through Hull {{had long}} been difficult, {{because of the number}} of ships which used the river for loading and {{unloading}} goods. In 1794, the merchants of Beverley had advocated the building of docks at Hull, with a separate entrance, so that traffic to the upper river would not be impeded, while the Driffield Navigation had unsuccessful attempted to get a clause inserted into the Act of Parliament which the Hull Dock Company obtained in 1840, to ensure free passage for vessels, and the removal of tolls for boats not using the docks. The Navigation Company also received complaints from the Beverley and Barmston Drainage Commissioners, who believed that water levels were being kept <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> than was good for drainage.|$|E
5|$|The league {{currently}} has no title sponsor. Previously {{it has been}} sponsored by Sport Italia, the Wolverhampton-based Express & Star newspaper, and Black Country brewery Banks's. In the 2014–15 season, 55 teams are competing in the league, comprising 22 in the Premier Division, 16 in Division One and 17 in Division Two. Some of the teams in the lower two divisions are reserve teams of clubs playing <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level.</b> Each division is contested on a double round-robin basis, with each team playing {{each of the other}} teams in the division once at home and once away. Three points are awarded for a win (increased from two with effect from the 1988–89 season), one for a draw and zero for a defeat. Goal difference is used to separate teams on the same points, having replaced goal average {{at the start of the}} 1978–79 season.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2001 {{and into}} 2002, CZW's {{territory}} (that is, the area at which they held {{the majority of their}} events) was shifting from Sewell, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in order to hold events regularly at the old ECW arena, beginning with December 15's Cage of Death 3. At this event, they faced Nick Gage and Nate Hatred, but wore masks and were identified as The Midnight Outlaws. This was likely to get around the fact that Jay was only 17 and Mark only 16 at the time; this meant, as they were under 18 years of age, that they could not legally work in a sport wrestling exhibition in the state of Pennsylvania. As CZW regularly began holding shows in the Philadelphia area, the Midnight Outlaws made appearances at the next four CZW events. <b>At</b> <b>A</b> <b>Higher</b> <b>Level</b> of Pain on April 13, 2002, Jay appeared across the ring from the Midnight Outlaws, tagging with Ruckus against Mark and someone else. By this time, he had turned 18. Jay and Ruckus were won the match, and this was the last time either Jay or Mark appeared for CZW until April 12, 2003, where Jay and Mark both returned for Best of the Best 3. Jay was a surprise entrant after being taunted by A.J. Styles, and Mark filling in for the injured Ruckus. Jay advanced to the semi finals, where he lost to B-Boy, and Mark lost his fill-in match to Sonjay Dutt. The two faced off with the Backseat Boyz for the CZW World Tag Team Championship at Truth or Consequences on June 14, but failed to win the belts.|$|E
5|$|Eastbourne Pier {{was built}} between 1866 and 1872 at the {{junction}} of Grand and Marine Parades. The pier interrupts what {{would otherwise have been}} a ribbon development of buildings – to the west, high-class hotels, with modest family hotels and boarding houses to the east. The Eastbourne Pier Company was registered in April 1865 with a capital of £15,000 and on 18 April 1866 work began. It was opened by Lord Edward Cavendish on 13 June 1870, although it was not actually completed until two years later. On New Year's Day 1877 the landward half was swept away in a storm. It was rebuilt <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level,</b> creating a drop {{towards the end of the}} pier. The pier is effectively built on stilts that rest in cups on the sea-bed allowing the whole structure to move during rough weather. It is roughly 300metres (1000ft) long. A domed 400-seater pavilion was constructed at a cost of £250 at the seaward end in 1888. A 1,000-seater theatre, bar, camera obscura and office suite replaced this in 1899/1901. At the same time, two saloons were built midway along the pier. Access to the camera obscura was destroyed by an arson attack in 1970, but was restored in 2003 with a new stairway built.|$|E
