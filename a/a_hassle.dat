500|$|Some commenters on Wright's Facebook page {{were skeptical}} of his claims, {{pointing}} {{to differences in}} the costume between the two videos; Wright explained the differences by saying he wanted, and made, a better cloak for the second video. Krahbichler accepted Wright's claims. [...] "It {{would be too much}} of <b>a</b> <b>hassle</b> just to play along for this long, and making up stories that fit so well," [...] he wrote shortly after the second video was posted. [...] "I believe it is very safe to say that PWW is indeed the creator". In an early December exchange on Facebook, Wright had told him he had chosen him as the recipient since he had [...] "won the business card lottery ... you handed me your business card, at some point". Krahbichler speculated that Wright had probably attended {{at least one of the}} many tech shows where he had had a booth.|$|E
500|$|Indiewire's Max O'Connell criticised the church's {{approach}} for being counterproductive. He predicted that [...] "their {{campaign against the}} film {{is going to be}} the best publicity that Alex Gibney and company could ever hope for, if also <b>a</b> <b>hassle</b> for critics and filmmakers and (this is no small thing) a nightmare for the ex-CoS members who dared to speak out against the Church's practices. But then, they don't seem terribly aware that attacking everyone who criticizes you doesn't do a lot of good for your image." [...] Paul Haggis, who was labeled [...] "doughy" [...] and [...] "pasty" [...] by the church, likewise felt that the attacks were backfiring: [...] "You don't think that makes you look really bad trying to slander me in that way? I'm an imperfect human being. And I've made many, many mistakes in my life. So you can absolutely publicize any of those. But this, really, (you’re) thinking that makes you look good?" ...|$|E

In mid-1948, NSHQ collected $14,105 from the owners, of which $3,427.37 was divided up among the ship's company. Due to delay in locating civilian addresses of men who had left the service when the war ended, the last cheque was not sent out until nine years after the event, 11 September 1950.

2500|$|In {{terms of}} the game's controls, Sean Velasco wanted {{something}} [...] "very intuitive for the family crowd" [...] and wanted to [...] "avoid anything that doesn't directly serve the game itself" [...] such as, [...] "waggle controls simply {{for the sake of}} waggle". The [...] "hug" [...] button is a vestigial feature of a more fleshed out emotion system abandoned during development. Managing the blob's emotions and keeping him happy throughout the game proved too much of <b>a</b> <b>hassle</b> during testing, so the mechanics were largely thrown out. However, Sean Velasco felt the in-game hug was [...] "too heart-melting to ignore," [...] so it was kept.|$|E

50|$|In April 1994, {{the city}} invited reporters {{to observe the}} first test of the new {{automated}} baggage system. Reporters were treated to scenes of clothing and other personal effects scattered beneath the system's tracks, while the actuators that moved luggage from belt to belt would often toss the luggage right off the system instead.
