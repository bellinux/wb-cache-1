25|$|The early 1880s began {{badly for}} the GNR {{for a number}} of reasons: Coal strikes and poor harvests reduced income from goods traffic. Floods forced the {{complete}} closure of the Spalding to Bourne line from 9 October 1880 until 1 February 1881, this was a Midland & Eastern line worked by the GNR, and the GNR found themselves paying the lease on a line they could derive no revenue from; <b>and</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> Sutton Bridge Docks opened on 14 May 1881, into which the GNR had invested £55,000, but within a few days the docks began to subside due to being built on unstable ground. The engineers could find no remedy and the investment was written off.|$|E
500|$|In the 1640s, {{constitutional}} issues arose concerning {{the power of}} the magistrates and assistants. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow's errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court's decision, sparking the controversy. Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because [...] "a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted the meanest <b>and</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> forms of government." ...|$|E
500|$|Between 1629 and {{his death}} in 1649, he served 19 annual terms as {{governor}} or lieutenant-governor and was a force of comparative moderation in the religiously conservative colony, clashing with the more conservative Thomas Dudley and the more liberal Roger Williams and Henry Vane. [...] Winthrop was a respected political figure, and his attitude toward governance seems authoritarian to modern sensibilities. He resisted attempts to widen voting and other civil rights beyond a narrow class of religiously approved individuals, opposed attempts to codify a body of laws that the colonial magistrates would be bound by, and also opposed unconstrained democracy, calling it [...] "the meanest <b>and</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> forms of government". The authoritarian and religiously conservative nature of Massachusetts rule was influential {{in the formation of}} neighboring colonies, which were formed in some instances by individuals and groups opposed to the rule of the Massachusetts elders.|$|E

500|$|In 1988, Alex Shoumatoff, {{writing in}} The New Yorker, makes Bates's Naturalist his choice {{if he were}} allowed only one book for a {{tropical}} journey. In his view, it is [...] "the basic text" [...] and a monument of scientific travel writing. Shoumatoff had in fact spent eight months in Bates's [...] "glorious forest" [...] (he quotes) with a copy in his backpack; he thus admires Bates's acceptance of the inevitable discomfort and homesickness from personal knowledge, noting that Bates only complained when all the following had occurred together: he had been robbed, he had gone barefoot having worn out his shoes, he had received no parcels from England, <b>and</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> he had nothing left to read. But otherwise Bates was [...] "lost in wonder" [...] at the astonishing diversity of {{the natural history of}} the Amazons. He was, writes Shoumatoff, one of the four largely self-educated geniuses who pioneered tropical biology, and who all knew each other: Darwin, Wallace, Bates, and the botanist Richard Spruce.|$|E

[...] Bellingham and Saltonstall were often in a minority that opposed the more conservative views of Winthrop and Thomas Dudley.

2500|$|In {{a letter}} to the court, Hill {{continued}} to deny that the state had a right to inquire into the origins of his wound, leaving little doubt that the judges would affirm the conviction. Chief Justice Daniel Straup wrote that his unexplained wound was [...] "a distinguishing mark," [...] and that [...] "the defendant may not avoid the natural and reasonable inferences of remaining silent." [...] In an article for the socialist newspaper Appeal to Reason, Hill wrote: [...] "Owing to the prominence of Mr Morrison, {{there had to be a}} 'goat' [...] and the undersigned being, as they thought, a friendless tramp, a Swede, <b>and</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> an IWW, had no right to live anyway, and was therefore duly selected to be 'the goat'." ...|$|E

In addition to sloppy workmanship and poor materials the airplane was underpowered with substandard engines and had serious design flaws in the wings and tail that made it unsafe. The head of the Aviation Section was unsympathetic to the complaints and slow to correct them, aggravating already serious divisions between the aviators and their nonflying commanders that had begun the year before when the pusher airplanes had shown similarly unsafe performance characteristics. The matter {{came to a head}} when the acting commander of the Brownsville detachment, 1st Lt. Byron Q. Jones, bypassed the chain of command and sent a written complaint directly to the commanding general of the Southern Department, who grounded the aircraft. Two newer JN3s arrived as replacements and the six remaining JN2s were modified with new wings, empennages, and engines to JN3 standard.|$|E
2500|$|Xavier March. A {{detective in}} the Kriminalpolizei with the {{concurrent}} honorary rank of Sturmbannführer (Major) in the SS, March (nicknamed [...] "Zavi" [...] by his friends) is a 42-year-old divorcé living in Berlin. He has one son, Pili (Paul), {{who lives with}} March's ex-wife, Klara. March's father died in 1929 from wounds sustained while serving in the Imperial German Navy during the Great War {{and his mother was}} killed in a Royal Air Force bombing raid in 1942. March commanded a U-Boat in World War II and was decorated for bravery and promoted. He married his nurse after the war, but the marriage steadily deteriorated afterward. His military service helped him rise through the police ranks to detective. By 1964, however, he is secretly under Gestapo surveillance for what they correctly perceive to be an intense dislike of the Nazi regime. For example, March refuses to donate to the 'winter-relief', showed [...] "insufficient enthusiasm" [...] for his son's involvement in the Jungvolk, has rebuffed all incentives to join the Nazi Party, tells [...] "jokes about the Party", <b>and</b> <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> - has shown some curiosity about what happened to a Jewish family who used to live in his present apartment.|$|E
