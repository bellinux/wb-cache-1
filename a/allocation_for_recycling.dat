40|$|Purpose This paper {{illustrates}} the consensus {{achieved by the}} members of the European Food Sustainable Consumption and Production Round Table Working Group 1 in their second scientific workshop held in the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) site of Ispra, Italy on July 5 th- 7 th, 2011. This workshop came after having run a detailed analysis of data and methodologies for assessing the environmental performance of food and drink products. In particular, the aim of this workshop was to reach consensus amongst key stakeholders on those approaches found diverging across methodologies and on which the forthcoming Protocol for the ENVIronmental assessment of FOOds and Drinks (ENVIFOOD Protocol) is expected to provide guidance to the sector. Methods Almost thirty Round Table members joined the workshop. Most of them were representatives from business associations associated with the food and drink supply chain and their member companies, EU member state governments, government-supported initiatives on environmental labelling schemes, NGOs, and The Sustainability Consortium. A pool of selected senior scientists on food LCA, data and environmental impact assessment methods from academia were also invited to join the workshop and actively contributed to the discussion. Several European Commission staff members also participated in the workshop. A pre-analysis of key existing guidelines and the Guiding Principles for voluntary environmental assessment and communication agreed by the Food Round Table members provided the basis for the workshop. Besides two plenary sessions, one {{at the beginning of the}} workshop to introduce the topics and one in the end to draw conclusions, those approaches where consensus is missing across environmental assessment methodologies were analysed in three ad hoc break-out sessions over the two days. Results and conclusions Functional unit equal to 100 g or ml in the context of those assessments instrumental to Business-to-Consumer (B 2 C) communication, and clear identification of a reference flow (instead of a functional unit) for those assessments conducted for Business-to-Business (B 2 B) communication are just a few recommendations coming out from the workshop. These and many other approaches on calculation rules, data quality and impact assessment were agreed by Round Table members. These will be likely integrated into the ENVIFOOD Protocol. Despite the workshop was relatively successful in terms of consensus achieved, some issues still remained. Round Table members are continuing the discussion inside the working group 1 drafting group to address those issues where no consensus was reached (e. g. system boundary for assessments instrumental to Business-to-Consumer (B 2 C) communication) or where a more in-depth background analysis was needed (e. g. accounting for land use change, <b>allocation</b> <b>for</b> <b>recycling).</b> A public consultation will be run in 2012 to ensure that the coming ENVIFOOD Protocol is both scientifically sound and practical to implement.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} optimal power <b>allocation</b> <b>for</b> energy <b>recycling</b> cooperative communications systems, employing full duplex relays, based on the criterion of maximizing the rate, or equivalently the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), of the system. A system model is investigated where each time slot is split into an information transmission phase, during which the Source (S) transmits information to the destination (D) and a full-duplex Relay (R), and an energy harvesting phase. During the energy harvesting phase, R relays information to D, while concurrently it performs energy harvesting, exploiting a signal transmitted by S and energy recycling, exploiting its own transmission. For this system model, we formulate a rate/SNR maximization problem, in order to compute the optimal source power levels for both information transfer and energy transfer phases. The cost function of this optimization problem is then substituted by a sharp approximation, which allows for obtaining an analytically tractable power allocation. The performance of the resulting power allocation is then assessed by means of Monte Carlo simulations, and {{it is found that}} it outperforms existing solutions. It is therefore shown that our proposed solution can contribute towards increasing the range of IoT networks...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePurpose: Environmental {{data for}} steel {{products}} are generally proposed at a continental or a global scale. The question we are tackling here is: does {{the fact that}} steel as a global market necessarily reduces the need for national data? Methods: In this study, {{the environmental impact of}} reinforcing steel sold in France is evaluated. To do so, a specific environmental inventory is adapted from Ecoinvent database. CML method is used for impact calculation and both methods "recycled content" as well as "end of life recycling approach" are tested. Results and discussion: This study shows that there is a specificity of reinforcing steel products sold in France compared to European value. It {{is due to the fact}} that reinforcing steel is mainly made with recycled steel as the market growth for construction product in France is limited allowing a very high recycled content. This result is not sensitive neither to the <b>allocation</b> method used <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> (cut-off approach or system expansion) nor to transport distance and electricity country mix used. Conclusions: The result of this study can be used with confidence in every construction site work located on the French territory. Furthermore, the present study advocates for an adaptation of global database to local context defined by a specific industrial sector and a geographic region even for product such as steel that may be considered as a first approximation as a global product. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

40|$|The current paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of design <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> strategies <b>for</b> plastic components. Interviews and site visits were conducted with computer disassemblers and plastics recyclers based in the United States and Europe to investigate the effectiveness of design <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> guidelines. Both manual and automated <b>recycling</b> technologies <b>for</b> plastics were investigated. Based on this investigation, six key design <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> guidelines are prioritized based on their potential for improving the recyclability of plastic components. The results of this study can be used to help prioritize design <b>for</b> <b>recycling</b> strategies so that both product recyclability and design productivity are maximized. I...|$|R
