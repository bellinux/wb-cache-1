40|$|The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources {{added to}} Food (<b>ANS</b> <b>Panel)</b> has {{previously}} provided a scientific opinion re-evaluating {{the safety of}} Sunset Yellow FCF (E 110) as a food additive in the EU and establishing a temporary acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 1 mg/kg bw/day (EFSA <b>ANS</b> <b>Panel,</b> 2009). Following a request by the European Commission, the <b>ANS</b> <b>Panel</b> was asked to assess newly submitted data from a study conducted {{as a result of}} the recommendations contained in the 2009 opinion. In addition, EFSA was requested to carry out the refined exposure assessment of Sunset Yellow FCF. The new information assessed comprised an evaluation of the 28 -day study report, the data considered by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in its latest evaluation from 2011, and any additional toxicological information that had become available since the completion of the previous evaluation by the <b>ANS</b> <b>Panel.</b> The <b>ANS</b> <b>Panel</b> has considered that the newly submitted data from the 28 -day study and the overall available toxicological database on Sunset Yellow FCF provides a basis to revise the established temporary ADI and concluded that, based on the NOAEL of 375 mg/kg bw/day from the long-term feeding study in rats and an uncertainty factor of 100, a new ADI for Sunset Yellow FCF of 4 mg/kg bw/day can be established, in agreement with th...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources {{added to}} Food (ANS) {{delivers}} a scientific opinion evaluating the safety in use of medium viscosity white mineral oil (MVMO) (kinematic viscosity between 8. 5 – 11 mm 2 /s at 100  °C) {{as a food}} additive. In 2009, EFSA evaluated the safety of high viscosity white mineral oils (HVMO) (kinematic viscosity ≥ 11 mm 2 /s at 100  °C). In this evaluation, the <b>ANS</b> <b>Panel</b> considered as pivotal a 2 -year feeding study in the rat on chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity of two mineral oils: MVMO and HVMO. Based {{on the results of}} the study the Panel concluded that no carcinogenic effect was observed in F 344 rats tested with MVMO and HVMO. The <b>ANS</b> <b>Panel</b> considered the NOAEL for both MVMO and HVMO in the above study to be 1200 mg/kg bw/day, the highest dose tested. Presently the Panel confirmed this conclusion and established a group ADI of 12 mg/kg bw/day for HVMO (kinematic viscosity ≥ 11 mm 2 /s at 100  °C) and for MVMO (kinematic viscosity between 8. 5 - 11 mm 2 /s at 100  °C). The Panel noted that conservative estimates indicated that the potential dietary intake of MVMO and/or HVMO from the proposed uses and use levels as food additive in high consumers would reach up to approximately 10. 1 mg/kg bw/day for toddlers. This exposure is below the established group ADI. The Panel also noted that additional exposure to MVMO and/or HVMO via other sources could represent a major source of exposure. With the data presently available it is difficult to draw conclusions as to the magnitude of exposure and the number of consumers affected by this potential additional exposure...|$|E
40|$|The <b>ANS</b> <b>Panel</b> {{has been}} asked by EFSA to assess the new {{scientific}} information that has become available since {{the adoption of the}} opinion on the re-evaluation of the food colouring agent Allura Red AC in 2009, in particular the positive findings from an in vivo comet assay in mice. The findings from this study have been interpreted in conjunction with all the available relevant data from genotoxicity testing, metabolism and carcinogenicity, and in consideration of possible species differences between mouse and rat. These new data have been considered {{in the context of the}} overall relevant data available not only for Allura Red AC but also for a number of other structurally related sulphonated mono azo dyes authorised as food additives, namely: Amaranth, Ponceau 4 R, Sunset Yellow FCF, Tartrazine and Azorubine/Carmoisine. The Panel concluded that the new data by themselves were insufficient at this time to change the conclusions of the 2009 opinion on the safety of Allura Red AC and that there is currently no reason to revise the ADI. The read-across exercise has highlighted a shared pattern of effects for this class of substances that would warrant further investigation The Panel therefore recommended a repetition of the in vivo comet assay in mice, to be performed in compliance with the most recent and internationally validated experimental protocol, using whole cells and examining a wide range of tissues. These recommendations apply to all the sulphonated mono azo dyes included in this review...|$|E

40|$|This EFSA {{statement}} is a refined exposure assessment of caramel colours (E 150 a, E 150 c and E 150 d) {{taking into account}} additional information on its use in foods as consumed. The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) adopted a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of caramel colours (E 150 a, E 150 b, E 150 c, E 150 d) used as food additives in 2011. In that opinion, the Panel concluded that the anticipated dietary exposure of child and adult populations may exceed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for caramel colours E 150 a, E 150 c and E 150 d, but exposure estimates to E 150 b were below the ADI. Following this conclusion, new data from industry were submitted to EFSA providing updated use levels of caramel colours in foods ready to be consumed. A refined exposure assessment was performed for caramel colours that were exceeding the ADI in <b>ANS</b> <b>Panel</b> opinion (EFSA, 2011 a) i. e. E 150 a, E 150 c and E 150 d {{and concluded that the}} anticipated dietary exposure are considerably lower than in the previous exposure assessment. However, toddlers and adults have a higher exposure to caramel colour E 150 c and could still exceed the ADI of 100 mg/kg bw/day for this caramel colour. The estimated combined exposure to the four caramel colours (E 150 a, E 150 b, E 150 c, E 150 d) are considerably lower and the group ADI of 300 mg/kg bw/day is not exceeded for any population group in the current review...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources {{added to}} Food (ANS) {{provides}} a scientific opinion re-evaluating {{the safety of}} ChromoPrecise® cellular bound chromium yeast added for nutritional purposes {{as a source of}} chromium in food supplements and the bioavailability of chromium from this source. ChromoPrecise® is a yeast preparation with an enriched trivalent chromium content, obtained by culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of chromium chloride. A daily intake of 100 µg chromium(III). There are limited data on the nature and identity of the organic chromium(III) compounds contained in chromium-enriched yeast and on their toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic behaviour in the body. Overall, the Panel concluded that the bioavailability in man of chromium from chromium-enriched yeast is potentially up to approximately ten times higher than that of chromium from chromium chloride. A NOAEL of 2500 mg/kg bw/day ChromoPrecise® was identified in a 90 -day feeding study in rats; no evidence of adverse effects of chromium yeasts were reported in other animal studies investigating the effects of dietary supplementation with chromium yeast. ChromoPrecise® chromium yeast was non-genotoxic in a range of in vitro genotoxicity studies. Although no information was available on the chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity of ChromoPrecise® chromium yeast, the <b>ANS</b> <b>Panel</b> has previously concluded that trivalent chromium is not carcinogenic, and limited data on other chromium yeasts provide no evidence of an effect on reproductive endpoints. No adverse effects have been reported in clinical efficacy trials with chromium yeasts. The Panel concluded that the use of ChromoPrecise® chromium yeast in food supplements is not of concern, despite the lack of data on the nature and identity of the organic chromium(III) compounds contained in the product, provided that the intake does not exceed 250 μg/day, as recommended by the WHO...|$|E
40|$|The EFSA <b>ANS</b> <b>Panel</b> {{provides}} a scientific opinion re-evaluating {{the safety of}} propionic acid (E 280), sodium propionate (E 281), calcium propionate (E 282) and potassium propionate (E 283) which are authorised as food additives in the EU and have been previously evaluated by the SCF and JECFA. JECFA allocated an ADI “not limited”. The SCF concluded that potassium propionate could {{be added to the}} list of preservatives and established an ADI ”not specified”. Propionates are naturally occurring substances in the normal diet. The Panel considered that forestomach hyperplasia reported in long-term studies in rodents is not a relevant endpoint for humans because humans lack this organ. Based on the reported presence of reversible diffuse epithelial hyperplasia in the oesophagus the LOAEL for a 90 -day study in dogs was considered by the Panel to be 1  % propionic acid in the diet and the NOAEL to be 0. 3  % propionic acid in the diet. The Panel considered that there is no concern with respect to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. The Panel concluded that the present database did not allow allocation of an ADI for propionic acid - propionates. The overall mean and 95 th percentile exposures to propionic acid - propionates resulting from their use as food additives (major contributor to exposure) ranged from 0. 7 - 21. 1 and 3. 6 - 40. 8 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The Panel noted that the concentration provoking site of contact effect in the 90 -day study in dogs (1 % propionic acid in the diet) is a factor of three higher than the concentration of propionic acid - propionates in food at the highest permitted level and concluded that for food as consumed, there would not be a safety concern from the maximum concentrations of propionic acid and its salts at their currently authorised uses and use levels as food additives...|$|E

40|$|Executive summary The {{draft report}} on the safety of aspartame, issued by the European Food Safety Authority’s <b>ANS</b> <b>panel</b> on 8 January 2013, is deeply flawed. There {{are at least two}} main types of flaws: those arising from the {{criteria}} by which ‘evidence’ has been selected, and those arising from the criteria by which those studies are interpreted. The criteria of inclusion have been overly narrow, and have in particular excluded vital documents that bear directly on the scientific competence with which some pivotal studies were conducting and on the accuracy with which they were reported. Such documentary evidence is directly relevant to the reliability of the reported data, and on the truth of the claims based on those studies. The implicit criteria of interpretation of the studies that have been included are perverse and biased. The panel could only have reached its conclusion that aspartame is safe by implicitly assuming that almost all studies indicating no adverse effects are entirely reliable, even though they have numerous weaknesses and were almost all commercially funded, while all the studies indicating that aspartame may be unsafe are deemed unreliable, even though they sometimes have particular methodological strengths and even though they have all been funded independently of vested commercial interests. On each of the 80 occasions when the panel discusses a study that indicated no apparent risks from aspartame those studies are taken at face value and typically assumed to be reliable. However, on each of the 27 occasions when the panel discusses studies that indicate that aspartame may pose risks, the panel is unremittingly critical of them, implicitly assuming that they must be misleading, so dismissing them. Often those worrying studies are dismissed not because of evidence but on flimsy grounds, for example by invoking speculative hypotheses without supporting evidence. The panel reached its conclusion that aspartame is safe not by applying uniformly critical standards to all the evidence from all studies, but by routinely forgiving the shortcomings of favourable studies yet being unremitting critical of all the studies suggesting any possible risks. The panel’s overall conclusions is driven more by the panel’s biased assumptions than by the evidence adduced. One possible explanation for the asymmetric bias in the interpretation of studies might be found in the pattern of conflicts of interest that characterise the members of the panel. Of the 17 members of the EFSA panel, 7 have direct commercial conflicts of interest, and another 5 have institutional conflicts of interest – for example because their employers have already announced that aspartame is safe. Only 4 panel members are not characterised by some relevant conflicts of interest. EFSA should therefore discount the draft report, convene a new panel composed only of, and supported only by, experts who are free of any conflicts of interest. They should be asked to review all the evidence, not just some of it. They should also make explicit their criteria of interpretation, and then show that those criteria have been consistently applied, and they should be applied to prioritises the protection of consumer and public health over commercial or industrial considerations. The European Commission and the European Parliament should also take responsibility for ensuring that EFSA acts properly to protect consumers rather than assisting the food and chemical industrie...|$|E
