Because of the capacitive technique, {{it does not require}} electrical contact with the finger, nor does it require the finger to exert pressure on the pad. It measures very small capacitance changes, due to a finger's proximity, among electrodes in a grid buried beneath the insulating surface of the pad. From these measurements, it can determine if a finger is touching the pad, and if so, the finger's <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> horizontally and vertically on the surface. Subtraction of a preceding <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> from the present <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> yields the relative motion of the finger during that time.

50|$|Robot {{calibration}} can remarkably {{improve the}} accuracy of robots programmed offline, also known as Off-line programming (robotics). A calibrated robot has a higher absolute as well as relative positioning accuracy than an uncalibrated one, i.e., the real position of the robot end effector corresponds better to the position calculated from the mathematical model of the robot. <b>Absolute</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy is particularly relevant in connection with robot exchangeability and Off-line programming (robotics) of precision applications. Besides the calibration of the robot, the calibration of its tools and the workpieces it works with (the so-called cell calibration) can minimize occurring inaccuracies and improve process security.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{framework}} called rigid body localization for joint position and orientation estimation of a rigid body. We consider a setup {{in which a}} few sensors are mounted on a rigid body. The <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> of the sensors on the rigid body, or the <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> of the rigid body itself is not known. However, we know how the sensors are mounted on the rigid body, i. e., the sensor topology is known. Using range-only measurements between the sensors and a few anchors (nodes with known <b>absolute</b> <b>positions),</b> and without using any inertial measurements (e. g., accelerometers), we estimate the position and orientation of the rigid body. For this purpose, the <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> of the sensors is expressed as an affine function of the Stiefel manifold. In other words, we represent the orientation as a rotation matrix, and <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> as a translation vector. We propose a least-squares (LS), simplified unitarily constrained LS (SUC-LS), and optimal unitarily constrained least-squares (OUC-LS) estimator, where the latter is based on Newton's method. As a benchmark, we derive a unitarily constrained Cram√©r-Rao bound (UC-CRB). The known topology of the sensors can sometimes be perturbed during fabrication. To take these perturbations into account, a simplified unitarily constrained total-least-squares (SUC-TLS), and an optimal unitarily constrained total-least-squares (OUC-TLS) estimator are also proposed.

The resulting accuracy depends on {{the accuracy of the}} dead reckoning estimation and on the accuracy and frequency of the <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> measurement. As an <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> measurement system several alternatives can be used.

50|$|Mechanical {{motion capture}} systems {{directly}} track body joint angles {{and are often}} referred to as exoskeleton motion capture systems, due to the way the sensors are attached to the body. A performer attaches the skeletal-like structure to their body and as they move so do the articulated mechanical parts, measuring the performer‚Äôs relative motion. Mechanical motion capture systems are real-time, relatively low-cost, free-of-occlusion, and wireless (untethered) systems that have unlimited capture volume. Typically, they are rigid structures of jointed, straight metal or plastic rods linked together with potentiometers that articulate at the joints of the body.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{capacitive}} sensing system: mutual capacitance, where the object (finger, conductive stylus) alters the mutual coupling between row and column electrodes, which are scanned sequentially; and self- or absolute capacitance where the object (such as a finger) loads the sensor or increases the parasitic capacitance to ground. In both cases, the difference of a preceding <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> from the present <b>absolute</b> <b>position</b> yields the relative motion of the object or finger during that time.

40|$|The Chinese Gaofen- 3 (GF- 3) {{mission was}} {{launched}} in August 2016, equipped with a full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor in the C-band, with a resolution of up to 1 m. The <b>absolute</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy of GF- 3 is of great importance, and in-orbit geometric calibration is a key technology for improving <b>absolute</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy. Conventional geometric calibration is used to accurately calibrate the geometric calibration parameters of the image (internal delay and azimuth shifts) using high-precision ground control data, which are highly dependent on the control data of the calibration field, but it remains costly and labor-intensive to monitor changes in GF- 3 ‚Äôs geometric calibration parameters. Based on the positioning consistency constraint of the conjugate points, this study presents a geometric cross-calibration method for the rapid and accurate calibration of GF- 3. The proposed method can accurately calibrate geometric calibration parameters without using corner reflectors and high-precision digital elevation models, thus improving <b>absolute</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy of the GF- 3 image. GF- 3 images from multiple regions were collected to verify the <b>absolute</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy after cross-calibration.
