5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct <b>ancestor</b> of one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in the fossil record is a direct <b>ancestor</b> of any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record is a direct <b>ancestor</b> of any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an <b>ancestor</b> of another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common <b>ancestor</b> with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>ancestors</b> of the MRCA are by {{definition}} also common <b>ancestors,</b> {{we can continue}} to find (less recent) common <b>ancestors</b> by pushing further back in time to find more and more <b>ancestors</b> who are the <b>ancestors</b> of all people alive today. Eventually we will reach a point in the past where all humans can be divided into two groups: those who have no descendants today and those who are common <b>ancestors</b> of all living humans today.

40|$|This paper, {{based on}} {{fieldwork}} conducted among the Tumbuka people of Northern Malawi, reaffirms the continued belief in <b>ancestors</b> by the Tumbuka {{people and the}} continued role of the <b>ancestors</b> {{in the lives of}} their descendants. <b>Ancestors</b> can cause misfortunes to their descendants and these are revealed through the processes of divination, dreaming and the sighting of certain snake and grasshopper species. What is apparent from this paper is the <b>ancestor’s</b> desire to see their descendants living peacefully. Fighting and quarrelling amongst relatives is deplored by the <b>ancestors.</b> <b>Ancestors</b> also desire the continuation of what are described as the Tumbuka customs, for example, that men should not abandon the land of their <b>ancestors</b> and build a home elsewhere. Once misfortunes including illnesses caused by <b>ancestors</b> are known, the Tumbuka believe that traditional as well as western medicines are unnecessary. “Medication ” consists of talking to the <b>ancestors</b> using established systems and addressing the reasons why the <b>ancestors</b> caused the misfortunes...|$|R

5|$|Lice {{have been}} the subject of {{significant}} DNA research in the 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution. The three species of sucking lice that parasitize human beings belong to two genera, Pediculus and Pthirus: head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis), body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis), and pubic lice (Pthirus pubis). Human head and body lice (genus Pediculus) share a common <b>ancestor</b> with chimpanzee lice, while pubic lice (genus Pthirus) share a common <b>ancestor</b> with gorilla lice. Using phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analysis, Reed et al. hypothesized that Pediculus and Pthirus are sister taxa and monophyletic. In other words, the two genera descended from the same common <b>ancestor.</b> The age of divergence between Pediculus and its common <b>ancestor</b> is estimated to be 6-7 million years ago, which matches the age predicted by chimpanzee-hominid divergence. Because parasites rely on their hosts, host-parasite cospeciation events are likely.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{paleontology}} {{has often}} classified Archaeopteryx {{as the most}} primitive bird. It is not {{thought to be a}} true <b>ancestor</b> of modern birds, but rather, a close relative of that <b>ancestor.</b> Nonetheless, Archaeopteryx was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird. Several authors have done so. Lowe (1935) and Thulborn (1984) questioned whether Archaeopteryx truly was the first bird. They suggested that Archaeopteryx was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that Avimimus was more likely to be the <b>ancestor</b> of all birds than Archaeopteryx. Barsbold (1983) and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997) noted that many maniraptoran lineages are extremely birdlike, and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.|$|E

5|$|The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is {{well known}} as one of the first {{transitional}} fossils to be found, and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century.

It is not considered a direct <b>ancestor</b> of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true <b>ancestor.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{study of}} early dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor {{therefore}} {{has important implications}} for the concept of dinosaurs as a monophyletic group (a group descended from a common <b>ancestor).</b> The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who compiled a list of cranial and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the common <b>ancestor).</b> Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of Herrerasaurus by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a common <b>ancestor,</b> and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of Herrerasaurus also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.|$|E
