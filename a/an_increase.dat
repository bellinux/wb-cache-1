5|$|Associations {{with various}} climate and {{environmental}} trends exist. For example, <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> {{in the sea}} surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.|$|E
5|$|Its effects, {{depending}} on dosage, include <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in sodium excretion by the kidneys, <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in urine output, <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in heart rate, and <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the {{sympathetic nervous system}} to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors.|$|E

5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise <b>an</b> <b>increase</b> in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
