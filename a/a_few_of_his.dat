5|$|Maclean {{raised a}} force of about 180 Emigrants, {{and a number of}} militia. By the time he reached Sorel on October 14, he had raised, in {{addition}} to the Emigrants, about 400 militia men, sometimes using threatening tactics to gain recruits. His and Carleton's hopes were dashed on October 30, when Carleton's attempted landing at Longueuil of a force numbering about 1,000 (mostly militia, with some Emigrants and Indian support) was repulsed by the Americans. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> boats were landed, but most were driven off by Seth Warner's use of field artillery that had been captured at Chambly.|$|E

5|$|Many of Riley's {{poems are}} filled with musical references. Riley had no musical education, and could not read sheet music, but learned from his father how to play guitar, and from a friend how to play violin.

5|$|On the Persian side, Kardarigan {{was also}} eager {{to fight and}} {{confident}} of victory. He arranged to be escorted by many camels carrying water for his troops in case the Byzantines refused to engage but continued to block access to the Arzamon, and had allegedly prepared iron bars and chains for the prisoners he would take. His movements, however, were detected when the Byzantines' Arab foederati captured <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men, allowing Philippicus to prepare his forces. This early warning was of particular importance since Kardarigan intended to attack on Sunday, a day of rest for the Christian Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Staunton's often-criticized {{description}} of Anderssen as Germany's second best player, after Anderssen {{had won the}} 1851 London International tournament, may have been reasonable {{on the basis of}} what is now known about von der Lasa's skill. Staunton was sometimes an objective chess commentator: a large percentage of his 1860 book Chess Praxis was devoted to Morphy's games, which he praised highly; and in The Chess-Player's Companion (1849) Staunton sometimes criticised his own play, and presented <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> losses.|$|E

5|$|The 1st-centuryAD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas {{second only}} to Callimachus among the elegiac poets. Philitas' {{influence}} has been found or suspected {{in a wide range}} of ancient writing; Longus' 2nd centuryAD novel Daphnis and Chloe contains a character likely named after him.

5|$|When Seungsahn {{first began}} {{teaching}} in the United States, there was an underemphasis in his message on the significance of zazen. Under advice from some students, however, he soon came to incorporate zazen into the curriculum more frequently. More than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> earliest students had practiced Zen previously under the Sōtō priest Shunryū Suzuki, laying out a convincing argument about how zazen and Zen were seen as inseparable in the Western psyche.|$|E

5|$|After {{stopping}} one of Fat Tony's operations, Homer practically rids Springfield of crime. However, Fat Tony escapes and vows to kill Homer {{unless he}} leaves town. Homer {{is unable to}} get protection from the citizens he protects (only Ned Flanders volunteers, but Homer ignores his offer) and Lenny and Carl lock themselves in a jail cell. When Homer does not leave, Fat Tony arrives with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own henchmen (including Johnny Tightlips), as well as mafia muscle—the characters of the Sopranos series. Just before {{they are about to}} kill Homer, someone shoots the mobsters and injures them. Safe again, Homer resigns as police chief and offers the job to the first person who comes along, which is Wiggum (who notes that an identical situation is how he became chief in the first place). When Marge thanks him for saving Homer, Wiggum says that he did not shoot anyone, having lost his gun, badge and nearly his squad car. Unbeknownst to them, the person who saved Homer was Maggie, who fires at the mobsters from her window with a scoped sporting rifle.|$|E
5|$|By his own reckoning, Offenbach {{composed}} {{more than}} 100 operas. Both {{the number and}} the noun are open to question: some works were so extensively revised that he evidently counted the revised versions as new, and commentators generally refer to all but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stage works as operettas, rather than operas. Offenbach reserved the term opérette (English: operetta) or opérette bouffe for some of his one-act works, more often using the term opéra bouffe for his full-length ones (though {{there are a number}} of one- and two-act examples of this type). It was only with the further development of the Operette genre in Vienna after 1870 that the French term opérette began to be used for works longer than one act. Offenbach also used the term opéra-comique for at least 24 of his works in either one, two or three acts.|$|E
5|$|The Cat in the Hat is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall anthropomorphic cat, who wears a red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her unnamed brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Ignoring repeated objections from the children's fish, the Cat shows the children <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish become more and more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up. He then says his goodbyes and disappears just before the children's mother walks in.|$|E

5|$|De Grasse had {{detached}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{ships to}} blockade the York and James Rivers {{farther up the}} bay, {{and many of the}} ships at anchor were missing officers, men, and boats when the British fleet was sighted. He faced the difficult proposition of organizing a line of battle while sailing against an incoming tide, with winds and land features that would require him to do so on a tack opposite that of the British fleet. At 11:30 am, 24 ships of the French fleet cut their anchor lines and began sailing out of the bay with the noon tide, leaving behind the shore contingents and ships' boats. Some ships were so seriously undermanned, missing as many as 200 men, that not all of their guns could be manned. De Grasse had ordered the ships to form into a line as they exited the bay, in order of speed and without regard to its normal sailing order. Admiral Louis de Bougainville's Auguste {{was one of the first}} ships out. With a squadron of three other ships Bougainville ended up well ahead of the rest of the French line; by 3:45 pm the gap was large enough that the British could have cut his squadron off from the rest of the French fleet.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their first}} landing in Sicily {{in the late}} 820s, the Aghlabids had tried several times, without success, to capture Syracuse. They were able to {{gradually}} take over the western half of the island, however, and in 875, a new and energetic governor, Ja'far ibn Muhammad, was appointed, determined to capture the city. Ja'far began the siege in August 877, but soon left it in charge of his son Abu Ishaq, while he retired to Palermo. The Arabs were well supplied with siege weapons, while the inhabitants of Syracuse were left largely unsupported by the Byzantine fleet, which was busy with transporting marble for a new church in Constantinople, and was then delayed by adverse weather. Consequently, the besieged populace faced great hardships and famine, described in detail by the eyewitness account of Theodosios the Monk. Finally, the Aghlabids managed to effect a breach in the seaward walls, and on 21 May 878 managed to break through it into the city. The defenders {{and much of the}} populace were massacred, while others, including Theodosios, were taken prisoner. The Byzantine patrikios who commanded the defence surrendered with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men, but they were executed after a week, while a handful of soldiers escaped and brought the news east to the fleet that had belatedly set sail to aid the city. The Muslims were unable to capitalize upon this success due to internal rivalries, which even led to a full-scale civil war. Small-scale warfare with the Byzantines continued without any side gaining a decisive advantage until the arrival of the deposed Aghlabid emir Ibrahim II, who in 902 rallied the Sicilian Muslims and captured Taormina, effectively completing the Muslim conquest of Sicily, although a few fortresses remained in Byzantine hands until 965.|$|E
5|$|In October 1200 Geoffrey {{refused to}} allow the {{collection}} of carucage, a tax on land, on his property, and his lands were confiscated in retaliation. He then excommunicated the new sheriff of Yorkshire, James of Poterne, who had ravaged Geoffrey's lands in revenge. In November 1200, Geoffrey and John were reconciled at Hugh of Lincoln's funeral, which allowed Geoffrey to regain his confiscated estates, but the archbishop's continued refusal to allow the collection of carucage led to the truce falling apart. In January 1201, John made peace with his half brother, {{but it did not}} last, as Geoffrey continued to refuse to allow the tax to be collected. John then renewed the demand for the payment for the office of sheriff due from Richard's reign, which forced Geoffrey to rescind his excommunication and offer another payment in return for peace, which occurred in May 1201. But it was short-lived; disputes over the appointments in the diocese of York broke out, but with the support of Pope Innocent Geoffrey was able to secure the appointment of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own candidates. Geoffrey also quarrelled with some of the monasteries in his diocese, with the usual claims and counterclaims going to the papacy for judgement. Among the religious houses Geoffrey had disagreements with were Guisborough Priory, Meaux Abbey, and Fountains Abbey. Most of these conflicts arose from disputed appointments to offices, but the quarrel with Meaux involved claims of tithe exemption by that house.|$|E

5|$|On September 16, {{while on}} patrol west of Philadelphia, Pulaski spotted {{significant}} British forces {{moving toward the}} Continental position. Upon being informed by Pulaski, Washington prepared for a battle, but the encounter {{was interrupted by a}} major storm before either side was organized. On October 4, Pulaski took part in the Battle of Germantown. He spent the winter of 1777 to 1778 with most of the army at Valley Forge. Pulaski argued that the military operations should continue through the winter, but this idea was rejected by the general staff. In turn, he focused on reorganizing the cavalry force, mostly stationed in Trenton. While at Trenton his assistance was requested by General Anthony Wayne, whom Washington had dispatched on a foraging expedition into southern New Jersey. Wayne was in danger of encountering a much larger British force sent to oppose his movements. Pulaski and 50 cavalry rode south to Burlington, where they skirmished with British sentries on February 28. After this minor encounter the British commander, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Stirling, was apparently convinced that he was facing a much larger force than expected, and prepared to withdraw his troops across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania at Cooper's Ferry (present-day Gloucester City). Pulaski and Wayne joined forces to attack Stirling's position on February 29 while he awaited suitable weather conditions to cross. In the resulting skirmish (which only involved a few hundred men out of the larger forces on either side), Pulaski's horse was shot out from under him and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cavalry were wounded.|$|E
