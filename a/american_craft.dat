5|$|As Revenge was {{the nearest}} {{of the three}} pirate vessels to the Americans, Allen ordered Alligator boats lowered to run inshore and attack her. Some 40 men armed with small arms were put into the boats, with Allen {{personally}} taking command of the launch, Lieutenant Dale the cutter, and midshipman Henley the gig. Revenge was already underway {{by the time it}} was sighted and attempted to escape the Americans despite the lack of wind, using its sweeps. After the American boats had rowed about , the pirate schooner made an about-face and raised a red flag. Upon approaching the pirates, the <b>American</b> <b>craft</b> were fired on with both grape and round shot. The American boats returned fire with small arms and moved in to board the vessel. Rather than try to fight off the boarding attempt, the pirates abandoned Revenge while another schooner covered their escape. Alligator gig manned by Henley and four men was sent off to take Revenge as a prize.|$|E

25|$|Summertime Wheat, {{a summer}} seasonal, is a Bavarian-style wheat beer, or Hefeweizen, with rye {{added to the}} grist (the brewery has called it a Roggen-Weizen, or rye-wheat, for this reason).

Live Oak Brewing Company's Hefe Weizen {{is another example of}} the more traditional Bavarian style. This brew is available from May through June.|$|E
