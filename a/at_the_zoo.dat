5|$|In late October 2007, 50 tuatara {{collected}} as {{eggs from}} North Brother Island and hatched at Victoria University were being released onto Long Island {{in the outer}} Marlborough Sounds. The animals had been cared for at Wellington Zoo {{for the last five}} years and have been kept in secret in a specially built enclosure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> off display.|$|E
5|$|The English artist Henry Stacy Marks (1829-1888) took {{a special}} {{interest}} in birds and many of his paintings were based on birds in the London Zoo and a number of his works included depictions of greater adjutants. Some of his paintings that include adjutants are Convocation (1878), Science is Measurement (1879), Half hours <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Zoo</b> and An Episcopal Visitation.|$|E
5|$|Carl and Ellie grow up, {{get married}} {{and live in the}} {{restored}} house. Carl sells toy balloons <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> where Ellie works. After she suffers a miscarriage and they are told they cannot have a child, the two decide to realize their dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They save for the trip, but repeatedly have to spend the money on more pressing needs. Finally, the now elderly Carl arranges for the trip, but Ellie falls ill and dies.|$|E

5000|$|Arguably {{the most}} famous animal {{resident}} in <b>the</b> Cleveland Metropark <b>Zoo's</b> history, Timmy attained greater fame as a very prolific sire <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bronx <b>Zoo.</b> Although, {{he was known as}} the [...] "dud stud" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Cleveland <b>zoo,</b> he proved to be quite virile after he arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bronx <b>Zoo</b> on loan. Timmy was managed indoors in human care for 25 years before being sent on breeding loan to the Wildlife Conservation Society's main campus and headquarters <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bronx <b>Zoo.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Timmy (1959- August 2, 2011) was {{a western}} lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and a 25-year-long {{resident}} of <b>the</b> Cleveland Metroparks <b>Zoo.</b> He was primarily housed indoors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Zoo's</b> Primate, Cat & Aquatics building. [...] The even-tempered silverback gorilla was euthanized <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Louisville <b>Zoo</b> after suffering from chronic cardiovascular disease and osteoarthritis in 2011.|$|R
5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1962, the zoo {{has focused on}} animal {{conservation}} efforts. Programs at the Phoenix Zoo include captive breeding for reintroduction (for instance the Arabian oryx, black-footed ferret, Mexican wolf, Ramsey Canyon leopard frog, and thick-billed parrot, sanctuary for animals that are no longer breeding (for instance the African painted dogs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo),</b> and rescue and rehabilitation (for instance lead poisoning treatments for the California condor).|$|E
5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo.</b> Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
50|$|The Sauter Garden is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> {{south end}} towards Binningen. The land was {{acquired}} {{with money from}} the local goldsmith Ulrich Sauter and {{opened to the public}} in 1939.|$|R
50|$|South America is the {{original}} and oldest section of <b>the</b> <b>zoo.</b> It utilizes what remains of <b>the</b> petting <b>zoo</b> that originally opened <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> current location in 1972. The enclosures here are more antiquated, and this section is full of smaller, more traditional and less modern exhibits.|$|R
50|$|Colo resided <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Columbus <b>Zoo</b> {{longer than}} any other animal in <b>the</b> <b>zoo's</b> collection. She celebrated her 50th {{birthday}} in 2006 with her keeper Gregory Moore with a chimps' tea party. Colo and her progeny, five of which still reside <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Columbus <b>Zoo,</b> comprised about one-third of Columbus Zoo's gorilla collection of 17 as of 2015.|$|R
5|$|Beebe had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} {{with some of}} his superiors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe's constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to caring for the zoo itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had borrowed from the Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go missing for years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{survey the}} {{damage in the}} city, which {{appears to have been}} caused by an {{elephant}} even though none was seen. Ed Meecham, an animal handler <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo,</b> recounts how he came to the elephant's locked cage to find it empty. His boss, Willa Ambrose, tells the agents that the zoo is in danger of closing due to other animal disappearances. She blames the zoo's decline on an animal rights group which is known to free captive animals. The group's leader, Kyle Lang, denies any involvement in the elephant's release. Lang tells them that Ambrose is being sued by the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla she took from their country ten years prior.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{provides}} {{lead poisoning}} treatment for California condors from the Grand Canyon area. These birds {{are one of}} the most endangered species on the planet, having at one time been reduced to 22 individuals in the wild. In February 2006, they treated a female (#149) who had been released in the 1990s and her son (#304) who survived a very rare birth in the wild. Both birds were captured in the Grand Canyon region and brought back to the zoo to be treated. A California condor (#133) was still being treated for lead poisoning <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> as of March 2010.|$|E
50|$|Iberian lynx can be {{observed}} in captivity only <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Jerez <b>Zoo,</b> since December 2014 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Lisbon <b>Zoo,</b> and since July 2016 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Madrid <b>Zoo.</b> <b>The</b> Jerez animals integrate the breeding program, the two Lisbon lynxes were formerly in the Portuguese breeding center but are no longer suited for the program (the female had multiple failed pregnancies and the male has a form of epilepsy), and the two Madrid lynxes were equally retired from the breeding program for not being suited for reproduction.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Indianapolis <b>Zoo</b> is {{organized}} around the concept of biomes. Biomes are areas of the planet with similar climate, plants, and animals.

5|$|A Fresh Start is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film {{is the story of}} Jim, a chauffeur, who is fired from his job for drunkenness. Jim becomes a tramp, but decides to reform after a little girl orders her butler to give him food. He encounters her again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo</b> and notices that two men are following the girl and her parents. Jim uncovers a plot to kidnap her and takes the place of their chauffeur. Jim then drives the kidnappers to the police station and secures a new position as the family's chauffeur. According to a trade review, the actual kidnapping scene and where Jim overpowers the villain's chauffeur is not actually depicted. The reviewer also stated the strength of the production is not in the plot, but in the staging and photography. The film was released on September 2, 1910, and it likely had a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Having {{lived in}} Queensland {{most of his}} life, Irwin was also a fan of rugby league. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower, and as an adult {{he was known to}} be a passionate Brisbane Broncos fan and was {{involved}} with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he asked if he could tackle the largest player, Shane Webcke. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the Queensland State of Origin squad before the 2006 series. Irwin also supported rugby union, being a fan of the national team, the Wallabies. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo.</b> A behind-the-scenes episode of The Crocodile Hunter showed Irwin and the crew finding a petrol station in a remote part of Namibia to watch the Wallabies defeat France in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.|$|E
5|$|One of the zoo's famous {{inhabitants}} {{during the}} post-war period was Voytek, a Syrian brown bear. Voytek {{had been sold}} {{to a group of}} Polish soldiers during the war. He learned to help the soldiers by carrying crates of ammunition, and became an unofficial mascot. In 1944 the Polish II Corps sailed to Italy to join the British 8th Army. Voytek had to be officially drafted into the Polish army in order to secure his passage on a British transport ship. In 1946 the II Corps were demobilised and settled in Scotland, at Winfield Camp near Hutton, Berwickshire. Voytek retired to Edinburgh Zoo in 1947 and lived there until his death in 1963. During his time in the army Voytek had developed a liking for cigarettes, and this may have contributed to his popularity as an attraction <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>zoo.</b>|$|E
