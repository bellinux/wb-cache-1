Conventional anaerobic ponding system is normally employed in palm oil mills to treat the effluent. To increase its efficiency, biopretreatment to remove the organic matter and oil & grease by thermotolerant polymer-producing fungi was investigated. The palm oil mill effluent (POME) was treated by the two thermotolerant polymer-producing fungi, Rhizopus sp. ST 4 and Rhizopus sp. ST 29, at 45 ºC under aseptic and septic conditions. Rhizopus sp.

40|$|During surgery, {{incision}} of {{the skin}} under <b>aseptic</b> <b>conditions</b> is performed. Despite the absence of noxious agents, an inflammatory response may be induced. We studied the local inflammatory response in human skin {{as a result of}} surgical intervention, under <b>aseptic</b> <b>conditions.</b> Elective standardized vascular surgery served as a model. A series of skin biopsies was taken from the wound edge at different time points after first incision. Biopsies, directly taken at first incision were considered to represent normal skin. Additional biopsies were taken at 30 min after the start of surgery and just before closure of the wound, maximally 270 min after surgery. Kinetics of recruitment of cells, expression of adhesion molecules and the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines was studied. Granulocytes were observed at first at 30 min after incision {{of the skin}} and their number increased in time. This granulocyte infiltration is paralleled by E-selectin expression on endothelial eels, which also was observed at first at 30 min after surgery with a further increase in number in time. Incision of the skin did not change P-selectin, ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1, TNF alpha, IL 1 alpha, IL 1 beta, IL 6 and IL 8 expression.
