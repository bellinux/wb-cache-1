25|$|INTERVIEWER: Suppose {{someone called}} {{you and said}} there was a kid, {{nineteen}} or twenty years old, who has been a very good boy, {{but all of a sudden}} this week he started walking around the neighborhood carrying a large cross. The neighbors are upset and the family's upset, and would you do something about it. How would you think <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a problem? Some kind of bizarre behavior like that.|$|E
500|$|Cofidis {{was one of}} {{the four}} {{wildcard}} entries to the Vuelta a España. After a disappointing Tour de France, Moncoutié decided to ride the Vuelta in hopes of capturing his fourth consecutive King of the Mountains jersey at the Spanish Grand Tour, which would be a new record. While he had entered 2011 thinking it would likely be his last season as a professional rider, Moncoutié changed his mind <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> well and said he would [...] "probably be part of the bunch in 2012." [...] Taaramäe was also named to the team for the Vuelta.|$|E
500|$|As {{the release}} of the new album approached, the band and its {{management}} found {{that they would have to}} navigate changes in the music industry, which Hurley described as [...] "a completely different place." [...] Facing declining record sales, the lack of a proper outlet for exhibition of music videos, and the economic crisis, Hurley commented that [...] "people are buying things they need to survive rather than records and concert tickets." [...] The group's 2007 album Infinity on High sold one million copies, which was considered a disappointment compared to From Under the Cork Trees sales of three million. Trohman attributed this to [...] "the same reason that nobody's records are selling that well: there's so much turmoil in the music industry, so much downsizing, and people are finding different ways to get their music more and more all the time. There's very little we can do <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> a band. All we can do is try to make great music and hope it connects with people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must try}} to find out <b>about</b> <b>that</b> whaler <b>as</b> soon as I go back to town," [...] said Barwell Dawson. [...] "Somebody ought to know {{something}} about her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{hope for}} the best. It is too late at any rate to think <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> and <b>as</b> {{it is to be}} done, I have come to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ruth sighed as if {{her spirit}} were {{slightly}} troubled. [...] "Really, child, you have quite raised my curiosity <b>about</b> <b>that</b> mystery <b>as</b> you call it. Why will you not confide in me?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Depp {{stated in}} a BBC radio {{interview}} on July 29, 2013 {{that he hopes}} {{to be involved with}} [...] "quieter things" [...] {{at some point in the}} near future, implying that he will retire from acting. Depp explained in further detail during the interview: [...] "I wouldn't say I'm dropping out any second, but I would say it's probably not too far away. When you add up the amount of dialogue that you say per year and you realise that you've said written words more than you've had a chance to say your own words, you start thinking <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> an insane option for a human being." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} omission is {{that although}} Clause 1 provides that federal judicial power shall extend to [...] "the laws of the United States," [...] it does not also provide that it shall extend {{to the laws of}} the several or individual states. [...] In turn, the Judiciary Act of 1789 and subsequent acts never granted the U.S. Supreme Court the power to review decisions of state supreme courts on pure issues of state law. [...] It is this silence which tacitly made state supreme courts the final expositors of the common law in their respective states. [...] They were free to diverge from English precedents and from each other on the vast majority of legal issues which had never been made part of federal law by the Constitution, and the U.S. Supreme Court could do nothing <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> it would ultimately concede in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938). [...] By way of contrast, other English-speaking federations like Australia and Canada never adopted the Erie doctrine. [...] That is, their highest courts have always possessed plenary power to impose a uniform nationwide common law upon all lower courts and never adopted the strong American distinction between federal and state common law.|$|E
2500|$|Kimiko and Miho are in {{the same}} diner, to which Ed has sent an attack robot (Kill-Bot) against Miho, since she has {{disrupted}} his attempts to destroy Ping. Miho is in the diner trying to contact Piro, Kimiko is talking with Erika. Dom is also there to talk with Kimiko. [...] After rescuing both herself and Kimiko from the Kill-Bot and chaos at the diner, the two talk about things. Miho talks to Piro on her phone, argues with him, and then Piro and Kimiko have a conversation <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> the two females are leaving the area. Dom follows and tries to coerce Kimiko into joining SEGA for protection from fans, but she refuses. Drained, she has Miho finish talking to Piro on the phone. [...] Piro then encounters a group who found Kimiko's cell phone and other belongings after she and Miho escaped the diner. The group wants to help Piro get together with Kimiko, partially due to feeling bad for trying to snap a picture up Kimiko's skirt. Piro and the group set out for a press conference Kimiko is going to for the voice acting project, Sight. Besides all of the other fans going to the event, a planned zombie outbreak occurs in the area. Miho, who helped Kimiko get ready for the event and accompanied her to it, later calls the zombies off for unexplained reasons through an unexplained mechanism.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come by all means, and welcome, Mr. Dillon!" [...] cried Roger. [...] "If you {{had that}} mine you speak about you must know <b>as</b> much <b>about</b> <b>that</b> {{district}} <b>as</b> Abe Blower--maybe more." ...|$|R
5000|$|Organizational {{information}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> person, such <b>as</b> the ID {{of their}} manager, their department or their location.|$|R
30|$|I {{think that}} the {{workshop}} came at right time. Before {{that we were not}} really openly talking <b>about</b> <b>that</b> [MHM] <b>as</b> partners…when you brought us together, then even in our WASH coordination meetings we started to discuss it. Previously it was not discussed.|$|R
60|$|Anne had her {{own opinion}} <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> she hastened into the house to write a note at Miss Lavendar's desk.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't say {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>As</b> you wish it, of course I'll speak to Gresham. Monk, I believe, has resigned already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} were going to say something," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Tipping, scathingly, [...] "and you might as well talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> anything else." ...|$|E
5000|$|Probably, Pasinetti -recognized as {{the heir}} of the Cambridge economists-, {{is the most}} {{suitable}} economist to talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> ambience, because, <b>as</b> he himself acknowledges: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow, I had Fergus McMahan going. Oh, {{the vocal}} {{is the true}} art--no doubt <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Handsome is <b>as</b> {{handsome}} palavers. <b>That's</b> the renovated proverb.|$|R
5000|$|... "People exist, and {{interact}} with the world around them. The artist himself/herself exists in Metamodernism, and comments on his/her world. One caveat - the artist is removed from, and he knows <b>about</b> <b>that</b> separation <b>as</b> he/she observes himself/herself observing people and the ordered/disordered socio/economic/political spacetimes they inhabit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. I fondly {{thought at}} first that you felt as I do <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> you were so mixed up in Christminster Anglicanism. And Mr. Phillotson--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{good can}} that do? Tom can't say {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> {{to how it}} should be done. He thinks a great deal about Sam Rubb; but it's more than I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, we kept quite silent <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> {{you made}} such a point of it; but it seemed ridiculous with him. But I shall be in a fright, now, every time you come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{this time}} Allen will {{have had to}} put the kiddies to bed," [...] she said. [...] "Christina, as you might have borne in mind, goes over to Branstock's every evening. Anyway, you'll drive across and see him <b>about</b> <b>that</b> team <b>as</b> soon as you can; come to supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "People don't {{think so}} much <b>about</b> <b>that</b> now-a-days <b>as</b> they used. If he liked it, and she too, {{who had a}} right to say anything? My idea is that a man with any spirit would have turned Lord Alston out of the house. What {{business}} had he to interfere?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't suppose I'm {{going to}} READ them, do you?" [...] said Jack, aggrievedly. [...] "Why don't {{you say what}} they're <b>about?</b> <b>That's</b> your {{business}} <b>as</b> editor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did hear}} {{something}} {{that sounded like}} a quarrel or a fray," [...] John Wilkes said, [...] "but there is nothing unusual <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>As</b> everything was soon quiet again, I gave no further thought to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will say}} nothing <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> I have no wish {{at all to}} set you against your cousin. I will bid you good-night now as you are close at home." [...] Then he turned round and left her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, let's {{hear about}} it," [...] said Lord John with a good-humoured smile. [...] "We {{may as well}} talk <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>as</b> {{anything}} else. If you think I've been too off-hand with the thing, or hurt its feelin's in any way, I'll apologize." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said I, [...] "I think it's {{about time}} for us to be moving along. I'm {{beginning}} to feel <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Corny family <b>as</b> you do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He will. Don't worry <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Well, <b>as</b> I was saying, I {{called at}} Belgrave Square, {{and found the}} house shut up. I couldn't get any answer to the bell, though I kept my thumb on it for minutes at a time. I think they must have gone abroad again." ...|$|R
50|$|In his defence, Klagges {{put it to}} {{the court}} that he had known nothing <b>about</b> all <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> he had only worked from a desk and he was deceived by his underlings as to the true extent of the Nazi terror that was being perpetrated.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly no one {{who knows}} nothing about the matter. There is nothing papa and I dislike much more than such foolish talk; and to tease your sister about it is even worse; but I will say no more <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> I believe it was chiefly Wilfred's doing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not {{remember}} that I agreed to anything of the sort," [...] she declared. [...] "I think {{it was you who}} laid down the law <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> <b>As</b> a matter of fact, I think that your silence about her is very unkind. I suppose you have seen her?" ...|$|E
60|$|Thus it came <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>as</b> {{the only}} {{suitable}} partie in Leyden, the Count Montalvo had {{sought out the}} well-favoured and well-endowed Jufvrouw Lysbeth van Hout to be his companion in the great sledge race, and taken so much trouble to ensure to himself a friendly reception at her house.|$|E
60|$|Nestor was on {{his feet}} almost as soon as I. The three of us huddled <b>about</b> <b>that</b> little box <b>as</b> if our lives {{depended}} upon the message it had for us.|$|R
6000|$|... “I don’t {{think there}} will be much {{difficulty}} <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> Tom, <b>as</b> every one of the houses scattered over the plain will have wells and fountains in their gardens. Thank goodness, they won’t miss any we take, and we could go every night and fetch water without exciting any suspicion that we had been there!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can't go on talking," [...] the {{botanist}} begins, {{and ducks}} aside {{just in time}} to save his eye from the ferule of a stupidly held umbrella. He is going to treat our little tiff <b>about</b> <b>that</b> lady <b>as</b> closed. He has the air of picking up our conversation again at some earlier point.|$|R
