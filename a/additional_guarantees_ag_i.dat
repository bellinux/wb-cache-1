40|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{properties of}} the <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> complexes of DNA have been studied potentiometrically and spectrophotometrically at ionic strength of 0. 1 M (NaC 10 [subscript 4]) and at pH's from 5. 6 to 8. 0. There {{are at least two}} different complexes which form at low silver ion concentrations. The strength of association of one complex (type I binding) is pH independent. The type I complexing reaction releases no protons from the DNA. A second complex (type II binding) is stronger at high pH. This complexing causes the release of approximately one proton per <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> bound. DNA which is rich in GC binds <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> more strongly than does AT rich DNA. However, at pH's between 5. 6 and 8. 0 more protons are released from AT-rich DNA's. It is proposed that the first complex (type I) involves only GC base pairs, with silver (I) adding to the sigma electrons of a ring nitrogen or interacting with the pi electrons. In the second complex (type II), <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> replaces an N- 1 (purine) to N- 3 (pyrimidine) hydrogen bond, thus displacing one proton. The complexing behavior of various polynucleotides, nucleotides and substituted purines was studied, and the DNA complexes are discussed in the light of these results. A cesium sulfate equilibrium density gradient ultracentrifugation technique has been developed in which buoyant density differences between different DNA's are generated by the specific formation of their <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> complexes. When <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> is bound to the extent of one silver ion per DNA base pair, the buoyant density of either native or denatured DNA increases by about. 17 g/cc. Competition experiments in which <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> was added to a mixture of two different DNA's resulted in specific binding of the <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> by one of the DNA species. At equilibrium in the ultracentrifuge two widely separated DNA bands were observed. The buoyant density difference between these bands corresponded to the difference in <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> binding by the two species of DNA. A survey was done of various useful preparative separations based on this technique. One such preparative separation has been accomplished, and the separated components have been characterized...|$|R

Competitive adsorption of <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> and Cu (II) from bimetallic solutions was studied using the newly synthesized tripolyphosphate crosslinked chitosan beads. Results indicated that alkalization before crosslinking helps to protect free-amine groups from crosslinking and hence increases the uptake capacity and selectively of the synthesized beads towards <b>Ag</b> (<b>I).</b> The maximum uptakes of <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> and Cu (II) were 82. 9 and 15. 5 mg/g respectively at room temperature with an initial concentration of each metal being 2. 0 mmol/L and the sorbent dosage of 1. 0 g L⁻¹. Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second order kinetic model provide better descriptions of adsorption isotherm and kinetics of metal ions on sorbent surfaces. Analyses from FT-IR and XPS confirmed that free amine, hydroxyl and P₃O₁₀⁵⁻ groups are involved in metal binding with amine and hydroxyl groups more selective to <b>Ag</b> (<b>I).</b> Then, continuous adsorption with the newly synthesized chitosan beads was simulated using the lumped kinetic model. According to the parameters obtained in the batch adsorption, the overall mass-transfer coefficient (Kf), and axial dispersion coefficient (DL) were determined using the empirical correlations. The value of Kf for <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> is {{in the range of}} 5. 028 × 10 ⁻⁵ s⁻ 1 to 8. 389 × 10 ⁻⁵ s⁻¹, the value of Kf for Cu (II) was in the range of 8. 000 × 10 ⁻⁵ s⁻¹ to 1. 283 × 10 ⁻⁴ s⁻¹; The range of axial dispersion coefficient for <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> and Cu (II) were both varying from 1. 806 × 10 ⁻⁴ cm²/s to 1. 778 × 10 ⁻⁴ cm²/s. Results from the breakthrough and elution profiles indicated that decreasing the flow rate, sample concentration and injection time, or increasing the bed length could enhance the separation of the two metal ions. Besides, it was found that concentration overload by increasing the sample concentration is more effective to improve the separation of two metal ions in fixed-bed column than volume overload by increasing the injection time.

The lack of unity in understanding the essence of <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of realization of rights and freedoms requires not only theoretical analysis of this legal category, but a consistent system of the legislation, and corresponding to the system of law enforcement practice. The legal establishment of the <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of realization of constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms, due solely to the will of the legislator of a constituent entitiy of the Russian Federation aimed at the concretization of constitutional rights and freedoms {{as well as of the}} security mechanisms (legal conditions, means) of the implementation of these rights. Features of development of the corresponding constituent entitiy of the Russian Federation should be taken into account. One of the main directions of improvement of legal regulation in this field is legislative recognition of <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of realization of constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms established by the constituent entities of the Russian Federation.

The object of this study was adsorptive properties of silica sulfonato hybrid of rice husk ash. The adsorptive property testing was begun with adsorbent mass variations. Adsorbent mass variations used were 10, 25, 50, and 100 mg. The effective mass obtained on mass variations of absorbent was used as the adsorbent mass on the time variations. The variations of the time used were 1, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes, and 21 hours. The effective mass and time contact gained on the absorbent mass and time contact variations were used as the adsorbent mass and contact time on pH variations. The variations of pH used ranged from 1 to 5 for metal ions of <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> and Cr (III). Silica sulfonato hybrid adsorptive properties were affected by the adsorbent mass and pH, while contact times did not influence HSS adsorptive properties towards metal ions of <b>Ag</b> (<b>I)</b> and Cr (III).
