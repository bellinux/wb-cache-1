500|$|Law {{professor}} and legal commentator Eugene Volokh commented in 2003 {{that regardless of}} the behavior of real frogs, the boiling frog story is useful as a metaphor, comparing it to the metaphor of an ostrich with its head in the sand. Economics Nobel laureate and New York Times op-ed writer Paul Krugman used the story as a metaphor in a July 2009 column, while pointing out that real frogs behave differently. Journalist James Fallows has been advocating since 2006 for people to stop retelling the story, describing it as a [...] "stupid canard" [...] and a [...] "myth". But following Krugman's column, he declared [...] "peace on the boiled frog front" [...] and said that using the story is fine as long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> out it's not literally true.|$|E

Acknowledge its {{existence}} at a collective level. To be a true witness to who we are as a people and to what has happened to us. That is the essential challenge for the Caribbean nations—who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> out, have been annihilated by history and yet who've managed to put themselves together in an amazing way. That's why I thought the book was somewhat hopeful at the end." ...|$|R

Your magic is but a small thing which seems great because so few can handle it. What miracle is it that makes the flower to grow, the child to be born, the Nile to rise, and the sun and stars to shine in heaven? What causes man to be half a beast and half a god and to grow downward to the beast or upward to the god--or both? What is faith and what is unbelief? Who made these things, through them to declare the purposes of life, of death, and of eternity? You shake your head, you do not know; how then can I know who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> out, am but foolish? Go get your answer from the lady Merapi's self, only mayhap you will find your questions countered." ...|$|E
5000|$|On April 19, 2007, Penn {{appeared}} on The Colbert Report {{and had a}} [...] "Meta-Free-Phor-All" [...] versus Stephen Colbert that was judged by Robert Pinsky. This stemmed from some of Penn's criticisms of Bush. His exact quote was [...] "We cower <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> your fingers telling us to support our troops. You and the smarmy pundits in your pocket- those who bathe in the moisture of your soiled and blood-soaked underwear- can take that noise and shove it." [...] He won the contest with 10,000,000 points to Colbert's 1.On December 7, 2007, Penn said he supported Ohio Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich for U.S. President in 2008, and criticized Bush's handling of the Iraq war. Penn questioned whether Bush's twin daughters supported the war in Iraq.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem which}} you raise {{with respect to}} the subject of the draft opinion in this case is a real one, but I am unsure of whether we should deal with it here. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> out, {{respondent}} here sought only damages and reinstatement, and therefore we are not directly presented with the question which would be raised if he had in addition sought a delayed Roth hearing by the employer. The precise disposition of his case, had he sought only that sort of a hearing and neither damages nor reinstatement, is to my mind a cloudy and difficult question; it may be the disposition you propose is right, but while I would be happy to reserve the question I would rather not decide it now...|$|E
40|$|We thank Dr. F. Conen for his {{positive}} {{comments and}} for his suggestions for extending the work to include potential number concentrations of agricultural soil dust IN active at warmer temperatures. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> out, because of very small IN number concentrations, {{it is difficult for}} the CFDC to obtain the number fraction of agricultural soil dust particles capable of nucleating ice at temperatures warmer than about – 18 °C. To investigate the ice nucleation properties of the soil dusts at warmer temperatures, your suggestion to collect particles into water followed by analyses using immersion freezing is a good one, and we have indeed tested this approach. This is still an ongoing study, although some preliminary results {{have been reported in the}} 19 th International Conference on Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosols (Hill et al., 2013). We will report the comprehensive results at warmer temperatures in a forthcoming paper (Hill et al., in preparation). In the revised manscript, we have added the following description: Page 9713, Line 17 : “Given the results of immersion freezing experiments showing that soils having higher contents of organic matter can serve as efficient IN even at temperatures warmer than about – 15 °C (Schnell and Vali, 1972; Conen et al., 2011; Hill et al., 2013...|$|E
40|$|<b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>point</b> {{out in your}} Editorial (Nature 460, 933; 2009) on the {{distribution}} of human cell lines, withholding scientific material from the broader research community contravenes the basic norms of science. We do not believe, however, that standard international consent guidelines for donors are the solution to this problem and suggest that these should instead be devised on a local scale in collaboration with ethics committees to facilitate tissue distribution. Far from research being “hindered by restrictions from donors” as you suggest, people are generally willing to donate tissue for research, and even to give open-ended consent to unspecified future applications. This willingness is underpinned by donors’ faith in medical research and in their right to protection and confidentiality; the assumption is that their tissue will be used only for ‘ethical’ research. But problems can arise, for example over whether consent covers the proposed usage (at present there are many different models of consent, ranging from specific to general) and when and how tissue should be discarded (K. Aalto-Setälä et al. PLoS Biol. 7, e 1000042; 2009). The answers may not always be obvious, and ethics committees (in collaboration with donors or their representatives) need {{to take into account the}} kind of tissue involved as well as the demographics and potential vulnerability of the donor or donor community, to judge the acceptability of the research proposal. veli...|$|E

If I could have gone to some distant place, I might have found relief in that, but the thing is not to be thought of, for the same reason.

50|$|It {{has been}} a very great benefit to me that we drifted into {{collaboration}} largely in its beginning <b>as</b> an accident-when <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> out my mistake over the webs of Drong's tail feather-and the mistake has proved to me well worth while. And here and now I must thank you very warmly for making my collaboration a condition of your undertaking the Mysore and Sunderbans surveys.|$|R

And as the moon has hidden herself, let us talk a little longer. I am quite ready to admit that I was wrong in what I said about the Greeks. They were, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have <b>pointed</b> out, a nation of art-critics. I acknowledge it, and I feel a little sorry for them. For the creative faculty {{is higher than the}} critical.

"It only remains," [...] {{continued}} Syme quite unperturbed, [...] "to adopt {{some other}} method {{of breaking the}} ice (if I may so express it) between myself and the man I wish to kill.

The plants will be in tassel in a few days, and the crop must turn out most beneficent--truly, truly--there is a providence in all things; for, at first, I was for putting the corn on yonder hill-side, and the potatoes here; but old Hiram was led by some invisible agency to insist on this field for the corn, and the hill-side for the potatoes--and, now, look, and see what crops are in promise!

50|$|The General tab {{consists}} of: Attacking Skills, Miscellaneous Skills, and Special Skills (which only apply {{if you are}} 4th job or sub class). Attacking {{skills are}} pretty straight forward. These are skills used to hit monsters, but some skills are passives that increase the attack power of your character <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> put skill <b>points</b> into it, meaning you don't have to press the skill to activate it. Miscellaneous skills are mostly buffs, support, and passive skills that increase the stat of your character. Special skills have the same idea except these don't require skill <b>points.</b> <b>You</b> can only get one skill from each row {{and to get a}} skill from all four rows requires your character to be at least level 190. The General tab {{is the only one that}} requires skill <b>points.</b> <b>You</b> get 1 skill point per level up unless you are a Sub Class, which gains 3 per level.|$|R

'I am but a woman, weak I may have been, wavering I may have been, but I took you for men! I chose you to dare, perhaps to perish, for a Cause. But now, triflers that you are, boys, mere boys, back with you to your silly games, back to the thoughtless throng. I have done.' ...|$|R

Even if you beat them off it could only be at a very great cost of life, and I certainly should not like you to undertake such an enterprise unless you had at least double the strength of men, which I could not spare you. By going {{in the guise of a}} vessel of war they would not care to meddle with you. They would know that there would be no chance of booty and a certainty of hard fighting, and of getting their own craft badly knocked about, so that it will be in all respects best to avoid a fight. They may in that case not connect you with us at all, but take you to be some freshly-arrived craft. You had best hoist the Stars and Stripes <b>as</b> <b>you</b> pass along the coast." ...|$|R

60|$|I take, then, {{this one}} {{institution}} as a test. As every normal man desires a woman, and children {{born of a}} woman, every normal man desires a house of his own to put them into. He does not merely want a roof above him and a chair below him; he wants an objective and visible kingdom; a fire at which he can cook what food he likes, a door he can open to what friends he chooses. This is the normal appetite of men; I do not say there are not exceptions. There may be saints above the need and philanthropists below it. Opalstein, now he is a duke, may have got used to more than this; {{and when he was}} a convict may have got used to less. But the normality of the thing is enormous. To give nearly everybody ordinary houses would please nearly everybody; that is what I assert without apology. Now in modern England (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> eagerly <b>point</b> out) {{it is very difficult to}} give nearly everybody houses. Quite so; I merely set up the desideratum; and ask the reader to leave it standing there while he turns with me to a consideration of what really happens in the social wars of our time.|$|R
