Frank Farrell and William S. Devery purchased the franchise, naming it the New York Highlanders. In 1913, the team changed its name to the Yankees. From 1921 to 1964, the Yankees were the most successful Major League franchise, winning 20 World Series titles and 29 AL pennants. This period included streaks of four consecutive championships from 1936 to 1939 and five straight titles from 1949 to 1953.|$|E

5|$|After {{being offered}} a trial with Universitatea Craiova by an agent, McBreen signed for the Romanian Divizia <b>A</b> <b>club</b> <b>in</b> July 2002 on a three-year contact. He made his debut in 3–1 win over Astra Ploiești on 17 August 2002, and scored {{only once in}} 13 {{appearances}} for a Craiova team that ranked seventh in the 2002–03 Divizia A table. However, the players' wages were continually paid late throughout the season and McBreen came close to a move to Norwegian Tippeligaen club Lillestrøm, only for Craiova to twice raise their asking price for him on transfer deadline day. He played more regularly the next season, making 20 appearances and scoring twice as Craiova finished fourth in the 2003–04 Divizia A table. He finally left Craiova {{during the summer of}} 2004 after the club's president Pavel Badea, a former teammate of McBreen's at the club, signed a letter releasing him from his contract. He took his case to FIFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport with the help of Professional Footballers Australia, and only received the money he was owed after the club was given a three-point deduction and was threatened with automatic relegation.|$|E
5|$|After unsuccessfully {{searching for}} <b>a</b> <b>club</b> <b>in</b> Europe, Haber {{returned}} to Canada, and subsequently joined the Vancouver Whitecaps on February 11, 2009. He claimed both the 'Newcomer of the Year' and 'Fan's Favourite' awards after a successful {{first season with}} the Whitecaps. The striker was one of seven USL First Division players to appear in every regular season match for his club that year, with Whitecaps goalkeeper Jay Nolly being another player {{to achieve the same}} feat during the 2009 season. Haber scored his first goal for the club on April 18, 2009, netting in a 2–1 away defeat to the Puerto Rico Islanders. The goal earned Haber a spot in the USL-1 Team of the Week for Week Two. In the Nutrilite Canadian Championship, Haber scored the winning goal in the Whitecaps' 2–0 away win over the Montreal Impact on May 20, scoring just 33 seconds into the match. Haber set the record for the quickest goal scored in a Nutrilite Canadian Championship match. He also scored a consolation goal in a 2–1 home defeat to the Montreal Impact on June 7. Two weeks later, Haber scored his fourth goal of the season in a 2–2 away draw with the Cleveland City Stars, scoring the first goal of the match.|$|E

5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what they would do in the future — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or <b>a</b> <b>club.</b> <b>In</b> March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E
5|$|Barry Took, who had {{produced}} {{a series of}} ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about working men's clubs, was partially responsible for the choice of location for the exterior shots. The programme which drew the highest ratings of the series focused on Burnlee Working Men's Club, <b>a</b> <b>club</b> <b>in</b> the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show. Took's idea was passed to James Gilbert and Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood, who {{was at that time}} filming Comedy Playhouse. Gilbert and Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the setting for the pilot of Last of the Summer Wine.|$|E
5|$|Byard {{played with}} bands from the Boston area, {{including}} {{for two years}} with violinist Ray Perry, who encouraged Byard to add tenor saxophone to his array of instruments. He then joined Earl Bostic's band as pianist in 1947 and they toured for around a year. Byard then formed a bebop band with Joe Gordon and Sam Rivers in Boston, before touring for a year with a stage show band. Back once more in Boston, he had a regular job for three years with Charlie Mariano in <b>a</b> <b>club</b> <b>in</b> nearby Lynn. They recorded together in 1953. Byard {{was a member of}} Herb Pomeroy's band as a tenor saxophonist from 1952 to 1955, and recorded with him in 1957. Byard also played solo piano in Boston in the early to mid-1950s and freelanced in that area later in the same decade. He joined Maynard Ferguson in 1959, and stayed until 1962. As one of Ferguson's players and arrangers, Byard found that his own preference for experimentation in time signatures, harmony and freer improvisation was restricted by the preferences of other band members.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{championship}} win, Palace {{started their}} second season as <b>a</b> <b>club</b> <b>in</b> the Southern League First Division, placing 19th {{at the end}} of the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating Rotherham County in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to Newcastle United in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another championship. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Crystal Palace scored through Horace Astley against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock 1–0 win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of Fulham and Brentford respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club Everton, currently flying high in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4–0 winners.|$|E
5|$|Hardy met {{his girlfriend}} Beth Britt in 1999, {{shortly after the}} Hardy Boyz had won the WWF Tag Team Championship for the first time. Hardy and his brother Matt went to <b>a</b> <b>club</b> <b>in</b> Southern Pines, North Carolina, where Hardy met her. On March 15, 2008, it was {{reported}} that Hardy's house had burned to the ground in a fire. Hardy and his girlfriend were not home at the time, but his dog, Jack, was killed in the fire. It is believed that the fire was started by faulty electrical wiring. In October 2008, Hardy was building a new home in the same area, which was expected to be completed by early 2009. In August 2010, Hardy announced that Britt was pregnant with the couple's first child, a daughter named Ruby Claire Hardy, who was born on October 19, 2010. The pair's second child, a daughter, Nera Quinn Hardy, was born on December 31, 2015. Hardy married Britt on March 9, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{a rematch}} of the Copa Libertadores final of 2004, Boca Juniors avenged that defeat as they beat Once Caldas 4–3 on aggregate. A year later, Boca Juniors faced São Paulo, both two-time {{winners of the}} competition, in order to {{determine}} who would become the first tricampeon. The Xeneizes won 4–1 on points and successfully defended the title, becoming the first side since Telê Santana's São Paulo to win consecutive Recopas. Internacional became the first Brazilian side to lift the trophy in nine years. The 2008 competition saw Boca Juniors win their fourth title to become joint leaders for most international titles won by <b>a</b> <b>club</b> <b>in</b> a last hurrah on the international scene. LDU Quito won their second international title as they thumped Internacional 6–0 on points and 4–0 on goal aggregate to win their first ever title. LDU Quito then successfully defended their title in 2010 against Estudiantes. They became the third team to successfully defend the title.|$|E
