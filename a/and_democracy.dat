5|$|After {{an initial}} victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander {{accepted}} {{the surrender of}} the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis; he then proceeded along the Ionian coast, granting autonomy <b>and</b> <b>democracy</b> to the cities. Miletus, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation, with Persian naval forces nearby. Further south, at Halicarnassus, in Caria, Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale siege, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain Memnon of Rhodes and the Persian satrap of Caria, Orontobates, to withdraw by sea. Alexander left the government of Caria {{to a member of}} the Hecatomnid dynasty, Ada, who adopted Alexander.|$|E

5|$|After the war Mazurkiewicz was persecuted by the Soviet-led {{communist}} {{authorities of}} the People's Republic of Poland, kept {{for two years}} in pre-trial jail, tortured and sentenced to life, {{despite the fact that he}} tried to cooperate with the new regime. He was rehabilitated after the end of the Stalinist period in 1956 and became active in the official veterans' organization Society of Fighters for Freedom <b>and</b> <b>Democracy</b> (ZBoWiD). He was eventually promoted to the rank of general of the Armed Forces of the People's Republic of Poland (LWP). He died shortly before the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|By March 1, 2005, over a {{year after}} the war ended, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) had {{disarmed}} and demobilized 103,018 people who claimed to have fought for former president Charles Taylor or the two rebel groups, Liberians United for Reconciliation <b>and</b> <b>Democracy</b> (LURD) or the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL). That year most former AFL elements were concentrated at Camp Schiefflin. The previous AFL personnel, including those of the Navy and Air Force, were slowly retired with pensions obtained by the MND and international partners from a number of international donors.|$|E
5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the belief systems {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism <b>and</b> <b>democracy.</b> During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E
50|$|Rummel {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{researchers}} on democratic peace theory, after Dean Babst. He found that in the period between 1816 and 2005 there were 205 wars between non-democracies, 166 wars between non-democracies <b>and</b> <b>democracies,</b> <b>and</b> no wars between democracies.|$|R

5|$|In 1997, Wilders {{was elected}} for the People's Party for Freedom <b>and</b> <b>Democracy</b> (VVD) to the {{municipal}} council of Utrecht, {{the fourth largest}} city of the Netherlands. He lived in Kanaleneiland, a suburb with cheap social housing and high apartment blocks, which has a relatively high number of immigrants. While a city councilor, Wilders was mugged in his own neighbourhood; some have speculated that this may have catalysed his political transformation. He was not rewarded for his time on the municipal council of Utrecht, for in the following elections he would score well {{below the national average}} in the University city.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{peace treaty}} was signed that {{integrated}} United Front for Democratic Change or FUC soldiers into the Chadian Army. The Movement for Justice <b>and</b> <b>Democracy</b> in Chad or MDJT also clashed with government forces in 2003 {{in an attempt to}} overthrow President Idriss Déby. In addition, there have been various conflicts with Khartoum's Janjaweed rebels in Eastern Chad who killed civilians by use of helicopter gunships. Presently, the Union of Resistance Forces or UFR are a rebel group that continues to battle with the government of Chad. In 2010, the UFR reportedly had a force estimating 6,000 men and 300 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, President Bush {{signed into}} law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, <b>and</b> <b>Democracy</b> Promotion Act, marking the first federal {{legislation}} to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor. In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was {{signed into law}} in September 2007. Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections, and the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.|$|E

5|$|In his Commentary on Isaiah (1529), Zwingli {{noted that}} there were three kinds of governments: monarchy, aristocracy, <b>and</b> <b>democracy.</b> He {{expressed}} his preference for aristocracy which is not surprising given his experience with the Zürich council. In the publication, rather than comparing the three forms of government, he gave a defence of aristocracy against a monarchy. He argued that a monarchy would invariably descend to tyranny. A monarchy had inherent weaknesses in that a good ruler could be easily replaced by a bad one or a single ruler could be easily corrupted. An aristocracy with more people involved did not have these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|The LPF formed {{part of a}} {{coalition}} government with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom <b>and</b> <b>Democracy</b> (VVD), but internal conflicts in the LPF led to the coalition's break-up and fresh elections after a few months. Following the 2003 election, the party was left in opposition. It {{became clear that the}} party was not viable without its original leader, and it went into decline until it was finally dissolved in 2008.|$|E

5|$|At {{a conference}} in 2011, Strache and the new leader of the French National Front, Marine Le Pen, {{announced}} deeper cooperation between their parties. Shortly thereafter, the FPÖ attempted {{to become a member}} of the Europe for Freedom <b>and</b> <b>Democracy</b> group, but was vetoed by some of its parties. The FPÖ's two MEPs are individual members of the establishing European Alliance for Freedom. After the 2014 European elections, the party joined the National Front, the Northern League, Vlaams Belang and the Czech Civic Conservative Party in forming the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom, and participated along with these parties, the Dutch Party for Freedom, the Alternative for Germany, the Polish Congress of the New Right and a former member of the UK Independence Party in the Europe of Nations and Freedom parliamentary group.|$|E
5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism <b>and</b> <b>democracy.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Mazurkiewicz wrote {{a letter}} to Stanisław Radkiewicz, head of the Ministry of Public Security, {{complaining}} of the continued persecution of former Home Army soldiers and he was arrested again. During a two-year pre-trial confinement, Mazurkiewicz was interrogated and tortured—he was beaten and his teeth and hair were forcibly pulled out. He was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in a show trial, in which the prosecutor submitted a false confession allegedly made by Mazurkiewicz and no defense witnesses were allowed to appear. He remained imprisoned until the amnesty of 1956. Eventually rehabilitated, he was active in organizations which sought to protect former veterans of anti-Nazi resistance and served as vice-president of the Society of Fighters for Freedom <b>and</b> <b>Democracy,</b> the Polish veterans association. In 1980, during a brief liberalization associated with the first Solidarity period he was promoted to the rank of General.|$|E
