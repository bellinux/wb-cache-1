5000|$|... 1. Authored {{the first}} <b>archival</b> <b>paper</b> (1981) to {{describe}} the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) flow visualization technique. The novelty lies {{in the ability to}} generate a very thin sheet of laser light as {{to be able to see}} one plane at a time, and the use of extremely small amounts of fluorescent dye as not to make the fluid’s interior opaque. Among the technique’s advantages are its high signal-to-noise ratio and its ability to dissect the flow field, as a CAT scan would to solid objects. LIF is now routinely used in numerous laboratories around the world, for both gas and liquid flows.|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in the 1960s, Arnold Arboretum propagator Al Fordham {{created a}} seed {{herbarium}} in the Dana Greenhouse. Collecting {{the seed of}} several hundred rare and unusual taxa, Fordham envisioned a unique resource for the identification and propagation of woody plants from around the world. Carrying forward Fordham’s vision, Arboretum greenhouse staff continued to collect seed, and today maintain a seed herbarium of more than 2,000 samples, {{almost a third of}} which are from accessioned plants in the living collection. The SHIP team installed an on-location archival image library, which holds digital seed herbarium images. Each folder is alphabetically maintained including prints of the actual color photographs of the digital electronic files. SHIP has taken care to produce photographs on <b>archival</b> <b>paper,</b> filed them into acid-free, gov-spec folders to withstand consistent observation, and developed a nondestructive way to observe and diagnose seed identity. [...] "On occasion, seed of rare and endangered species need immediate propagation, limiting our opportunities for studying physical characteristics. With digital imaging now an important protocol at the greenhouse, selected seed will go directly to the SHIP lab for documentation, preserving the integrity of the propagule in digital format. As such, even seed that requires immediate propagation will leave behind a visual record for future study"—Julie McIntosh Shapiro.|$|E
