5|$|After the war {{both the}} old and new Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets. Despite some attempts at demolition, the underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988â€“89. During reconstruction of that area of Berlin, the sections of the old bunker complex that were excavated were for the most part destroyed. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque with a schematic diagram was installed. Some corridors of the bunker still exist, but <b>are</b> <b>sealed</b> off from the public.|$|E
5000|$|As of 1998, however, {{women who}} have died may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> {{to more than one}} man. In 1998, the LDS Church created a new policy that a woman may also <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one man. A woman, however, may not <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one man while she is alive. She may only <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to {{subsequent}} partners after both she and her husband(s) have died. Thus, if a widow who <b>was</b> <b>sealed</b> to her first husband remarries, she may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> by proxy to all of her subsequent husband(s), but only after both she and the subsequent husbands have died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to the person in the afterlife, indicating that the purpose is to allow the woman to choose the right man to <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to.|$|R
50|$|Although the LDS Church has {{abandoned}} {{the practice of}} plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy. According to the church's sacred texts and pronouncements by its leaders and theologians, the church leaves {{open the possibility that}} it may one day re-institute the practice. It is still the practice of monogamous Mormon couples to <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to one another. However, in some circumstances, men and women may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple spouses. Most commonly, a man may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple wives: if his first wife dies, he may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to a second wife. A deceased woman may also <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to multiple men, but only through vicarious <b>sealing</b> if they <b>are</b> also deceased.|$|R

Hearing voices coming from it, however, Coyote opens the basket and the people, the world's first human beings, pour out of it in all directions.|$|E
5|$|Males attract mates by {{constructing}} specially-shaped tunnels {{in which}} they sing.

While posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can be made if the individual died in the months between the decision of the prize committee (typically in October) and the ceremony in December. Prior to 1974, posthumous awards were permitted if the recipient had died after being nominated.|$|E

50|$|According {{to church}} policy, after {{a man has}} died, he may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> by proxy {{to all of the}} women to whom he was legally married while he was alive.

5|$|Nomination {{forms are}} {{sent by the}} Nobel Committee to about 3,000 {{individuals}}, usually in September {{the year before the}} prizes are awarded. These individuals are generally prominent academics working in a relevant area. Regarding the Peace Prize, inquiries are also sent to governments, former Peace Prize laureates, and current or former members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The deadline for the return of the nomination forms is 31 January of the year of the award. The Nobel Committee nominates about 300 potential laureates from these forms and additional names. The nominees are not publicly named, nor are they told that they are being considered for the prize. All nomination records for a prize <b>are</b> <b>sealed</b> for 50 years from the awarding of the prize.|$|E
5|$|The {{determination}} of an individual's age by anthropologists {{depends on whether}} or not the individual was an adult or a child. The {{determination of}} the age of children, under the age of 21, is usually performed by examining the teeth. When teeth are not available, children can be aged based on which growth plates <b>are</b> <b>sealed.</b> The tibia plate seals around age 16 or 17 in girls and around 18 or 19 in boys. The clavicle is the last bone to complete growth and the plate is sealed around age 25. In addition, if a complete skeleton is available anthropologists can count the number of bones. While adults have 206 bones, the bones of a child have not yet fused resulting in a much higher number.|$|E
5|$|Every planet {{began its}} {{existence}} {{in an entirely}} fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid. The terrestrial planets <b>are</b> <b>sealed</b> within hard crusts, but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel, and mantles of silicates. Jupiter and Saturn {{are believed to have}} cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen. Uranus and Neptune, which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water, ammonia, methane and other ices. The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field.|$|E

He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic turret gun rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her face apart and bleeding profusely.|$|E

25|$|In the LDS Church today, {{both men}} and women may enter a {{celestial}} marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one woman. If his wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the celestial kingdom as a family with all to whom he <b>was</b> <b>sealed.</b> In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women to <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one man. A woman, however, may not <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to more than one man at a time while she is alive. She may only <b>be</b> <b>sealed</b> to subsequent partners after she has died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to the person in the afterlife. According to church teachings, the celestial marriage covenant, as with other covenants, requires the continued righteousness of the couple to remain in effect after this life. If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.|$|R
50|$|The {{union of}} a <b>sealed</b> couple <b>is</b> {{regarded}} as valid only if both individuals have kept their religious commitments and followed LDS teachings.
