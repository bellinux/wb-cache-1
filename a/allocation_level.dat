The objective of the current dissertation is to explore both the optimal allocation of tasks between human supervisor and computers and the optimal number of machines which a supervisor should control in an FMS. As a background to the proposed methodology, the relevant literature pertaining to FMS is reviewed with special emphasis on human-computer communication, multitask performance in FMS in relation to inverted-U theory, attention theory, and human decision capabilities. The hypotheses are proposed that there is an interaction effect between the number of machines and the task <b>allocation</b> <b>level</b> and that there exists an optimal level of number of machines for the operator to monitor. These hypotheses were tested in a statistically balanced experimental design using 30 subjects with three independent variables: number of machines (5 levels [...] 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 machines), task allocation (2 levels [...] high or low), and sequence of task presentation (2 levels). Physiological measures (EKG and respiratory rate) and two subjective stress questionnaires were used as indices of the arousal level. The results reveal that the Inverted-U function for response time as a function of machine level was not supported and the <b>allocation</b> <b>level</b> was significant for both performance and subjective stress criteria. These results suggest that in the supervision of FMS the task allocation to the supervisor is critical but that the size of the FMS system (4 to 20 machines), with the allocations studied, has no effect on either stress or performance of the operator in the FMS. ...|$|E

According to I and L, HQMC, the Marine Corps needs to re-evaluate current operational requirements for engineer construction equipment. Acquisition and force <b>allocation</b> <b>levels</b> for equipment have remained essentially at constant 1970 's, Cold War levels. Because acquisition and <b>allocation</b> <b>levels</b> haven't changed {{at the same}} rate as personnel, there is a perception that much of the existing equipment is unnecessary. Impacts for supporting too much equipment are decreased readiness, increased maintenance requirements, and increased O and M costs. The objective of our MBA project is to identify the correct quantity of construction equipment required to support the future needs of the USMC, focusing on unit training and Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) deployment cycles. This study will also evaluate the cost effectiveness of various alternatives for supplying the right amount and mix of CE to support contingencies via the civilian industrial base (lease/purchase decision factors, as well as domestic/international supplier issues). Our group will perform a review of USMC CE acquisition history to determine how the Marines have procured engineer equipment. Additionally, we will determine the annual volume of equipment that has been purchased or otherwise procured from industrial sources and the expected life cycle of existing equipment owned by the Marine Corps. With this information, we will assess the ability and willingness of suppliers worldwide to provide needed equipment for replacement of expired gear or in support of emergent contingencies.

40|$|In Australia, climate {{variability}} and {{the predicted}} impact {{of climate change}} help in making seasonal rainfall less predictable and seasonal irrigation supplies more uncertain, eroding agricultural production prospects and profitability. Water allocation forecasts have economic value to irrigators for making informed cropping decisions. Thisstudy estimated the economic value of improved irrigation allocation forecasts in the Coleambally irrigation area (CIA) in southeastern Australia using a non-linear programming model. The model uses production and profit functions to estimate yield and gross margins for various water allocation levels rather than using given crop yields and gross margins. The model also captures the tactical response of improved cropping decisions made by irrigators based on water allocation announcements throughout the irrigation season. Tactical responses include changing the winter crop combinations, abandoning irrigation for {{a percentage of the}} summer crops, temporary purchase or sale of water, and deficit irrigation. The estimated economic benefit of improved seasonal water allocation forecasts to the CIA irrigators ranges from AU$ 1. 33 ha− 1 to AU$ 9. 58 ha− 1 (AU$ 1 = US$ 0. 77). The economic analysis of water allocation forecasts shows that the potential total gross margin for the irrigators at the 100 % <b>allocation</b> <b>level</b> was AU$ 47. 6 m, assuming accurate forecast of the end-of-season allocations. A more realistic scenario generates a forecast value of AU$ 8. 9 million reduction in the gross margin (pessimistic water allocation outlook) and AU$ 1. 60 million in the forgone gross margin (optimistic water allocation outlook) for only 5 % variation in outlook above or below the actual <b>allocation</b> <b>level</b> of 60 %. This suggests that losses far exceed when water allocations are over-estimated by irrigators, as resources and inputs could be overly committed to execute the less-informed cropping plans. The knowledge benefits from forecasts are far greater {{at the lower end of}} an allocation due to relative water scarcity. However, for higher allocation levels (> 80 %), the knowledge benefits are negligible due to less water scarcity. Thus, investments in water allocation forecasts and related agrometeorological information could be useful tools for policy makers, farmers, agribusiness, and the insurance industry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{mitigation}} of intercell interference is an impor-tance {{issue for}} current and next-generation wireless cellular net-works where frequencies are aggressively reused and hierarchical cellular structures may heavily overlap. The paper examines {{the benefit of}} coordinating transmission strategies and resource allocation schemes across multiple base-stations for interfer-ence mitigation. Two different wireless cellular architectures are studied: a multicell network where base-stations coordinate in their transmission strategies, and a mixed macrocell and femtocell/picocell deployment with coordination among macro and femto/pico base-stations. For both scenarios, this paper proposes a heuristic joint proportionally fair scheduling, spatial multiplexing, and power spectrum adaptation algorithm that coordinates multiple base-stations with an objective of optimizing the overall network utility. The proposed scheme optimizes the user schedule, transmit and receive beamforming vectors, and transmit power spectra jointly, while taking into consideration both the intercell and intracell interference and the fairness among the users. System-level simulation results show that coor-dination at the transmission strategy and resource <b>allocation</b> <b>level</b> can already significantly improve the overall network throughput as compared to a conventional network design with fixed transmit power and per-cell zero-forcing beamforming.

To achieve their investment objectives, industry funds commonly apply the strategic asset allocation approach across seven diversified benchmarked asset classes. Fund managers regularly make {{adjustments to the}} strategic policy to reflect changes in investment markets. However, more recently, the volatile behaviour of the global financial markets has {{made it difficult for}} institutions to follow long-term strategies and polices. Consequently Australian fund managers are increasingly changing their asset allocation strategies to shorter term timeframe. In particular, adopting the dynamic asset allocation approach, which works on a medium term (3 + years) timeframe, is now viewed as a more effective strategy by fund managers. Covering a 17 year period, this research compares the performance of the industry fund strategic investment approach against two dynamic asset allocation models. In addition, the research investigates the role of property in these asset allocation strategies. The results show that the dynamic investment models provide better risk-adjusted return profile compared to the industry fund strategic investment approach with scope to increase the property <b>allocation</b> <b>level</b> from current 10 % to the 15 % - 28 % range...|$|E

Academic studies mainly {{focus on the}} performance of domestic equity portfolios of mutual or pension funds and attempt to measure abnormal performance following a return-based regression approach. Remarkably little is known empirically about the investment performance of international multiple-asset-class portfolios.

We conclude that advisers are not able to outperform our benchmarks before transaction and other related costs. Weak performance on the asset <b>allocation</b> <b>level</b> is mainly driven by significant underperformance in the equity market. However, as there is significant and persistent differential performance in the short run, especially in the bond market, choosing the right investment adviser is of decisive importance in achieving abnormal performance. Our results indicate that portfolio advisers are not able to realize superior performance through appropriate timing and selection and as a consequence do not add value to a passive strategy of benchmark investing. Moreover, most of them exhibit strong momentum investing suggesting that they shift their recommended portfolio in favor of assets with high past returns and away from assets with low past returns.
