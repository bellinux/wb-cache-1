The film grossed an additional $332,437,332 in the international box office for a worldwide total of $550,517,357, which not only ranked it in the top five highest-grossing films of 2005 worldwide, but also helped the film bring back more than two and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>times</b> its production budget.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{the fifth}} planet from the Sun and {{the largest in the}} Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>times</b> that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an {{apparent}} magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{can form}} {{multiply}} bonded chains, a property it shares with its lighter homolog, carbon. Its {{capacity to do}} so is much less because the Pb–Pb bond energy is over three and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>times</b> lower than that of the C–C bond. With itself lead can build metal–metal bonds of an order up to three. With carbon, lead forms organolead compounds similar to, but generally less stable than, typical organic compounds (due to the Pb–C bond being rather weak). This makes the organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide-ranging than that of tin. It predominantly forms organolead(IV) compounds, even when starting with inorganic lead(II) reactants; very few organolead(II) compounds are known. The most well-characterized exceptions are Pb2 and Pb(η5-C5H5)2.|$|E

5|$|Lead's per-particle {{abundance}} in the Solar System is 0.121 ppb (parts per billion). This figure is two and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>times</b> {{higher than that}} of platinum, eight times more than mercury, and seventeen times more than gold. The amount of lead in the universe is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms (all of which are unstable) gradually decay to lead. The abundance of lead in the Solar System since its formation 4.5 billion years ago has increased by about 0.75%. The solar system abundances table shows that lead, despite its relatively high atomic number, is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than 40.|$|E
5|$|The protoplasmodium, a microscopic, {{undifferentiated}} granular {{mass with}} a slime sheath, is transparent and colourless. A single sporangiophore (the fruiting structure) is produced from the semispherical protoplasmodium, which is approximately one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>times</b> {{the diameter of}} mature sporangia. It acquires dark spots as it matures and {{the centre of the}} protoplasm later becomes dark. Then, the transparent and milk-white protoplasmodium climbs along the stem to the top, where first the capillitium and peridium and finally the spores are produced. At room temperature, this process lasts roughly one day.|$|E
5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>times</b> larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-11d is an {{exoplanet}} {{discovered in}} the orbit of the sun-like star Kepler-11. It is named for the telescope that discovered it, a NASA spacecraft named Kepler {{that is designed to}} detect Earth-like planets by measuring small dips in the brightness of their host stars as the planets cross in front. This process, known as the transit method, was used to note the presence of six planets in orbit around Kepler-11, of which Kepler-11d is the third from its star. Kepler-11d orbits Kepler-11 well within the orbit of Mercury approximately every 23 days. The planet is approximately six times more massive than the Earth, and has a radius that is three and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>times</b> larger than that of Earth's. It is, however, far hotter than Earth is. Its low density, comparable to that of Saturn, suggests that Kepler-11d has a large hydrogen–helium atmosphere. Kepler-11d was announced with its five sister planets on February 2, 2011 after extensive follow-up studies.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} several {{electron}} transport inhibitors on {{the magnitude and}} kinetics of cytochrome,/"oxidation induced by flash illumination were studied in the a- and y-band regions. On the flash excitation {{only a fraction of}} cytochrome / present in the chloroplasts was oxidized with <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>time</b> of 0. 1 to 0. 3 msec and then reduced with <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>time</b> of 10 to 25 msec. Dibromothymoquinone (DBMIB) at concentrations which severely suppressed the reduction of cytochrome / approximately doubled the magnitude of cytochrome / oxi-dation caused by a flash, mainly by inducing an additional slow oxidation of cytochrome /with <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>time</b> longer than 1 msec. Enhancement of the cytochrome/oxidation was also observed in the presence of bathophenanthroline. Such enhanced oxidation in-duced by the two inhibitors was largely diminished with the addition of reduced 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol which accelerated cytochrome,/reduction. In contrast, the inhibition of cytochrome / reduction by 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) -l,I-dimethylurea (DCMU) was not associated with an increase in the magnitude of cytochrome/oxidation. However, addition of DBMIB to the DCMU-poisoned chloroplasts enhanced cytochrom...|$|R
