50|$|Senator Watson {{introduces}} {{a bill that}} would require Congressional <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> any <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> a cabinet member by the President. Eaton doesn't tell Dilman about it, but several Black congressmen have a meeting with Dilman to discuss their concerns. Dilman believes they are talking about a minority rights bill and pledges his support, until one of the congressmen corrects him. Dilman subsequently reprimands Eaton and a group of senior leaders, questioning why such an important bill is not being brought to his attention.|$|R
40|$|In a {{structured}} <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, a bankruptcy court approves case dismissal alongside a stakeholder agreement {{as to the}} manner in which the estate is to be dealt with once the case has been dismissed. Such orders are controversial in that they are not explicitly authorized through the U. S. Bankruptcy Code (“the Code”) and are especially controversial where the accompanying agreement seeks to distribute estate property in contravention of the priority scheme laid out in § 507 of the Code. Where the agreement violates this so-called waterfall payment method, bankruptcy courts are faced with difficult questions: Should structured dismissals be strictly governed by the Code’s priority regime? Should they ever be approved where they deviate from priorities? If so, what standard should a bankruptcy court apply in deciding whether deviation is proper? This Note explores a recent decision by the Third Circuit, In re Jevic Holding Corp., where the court affirmed a bankruptcy court’s <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> {{a structured}} <b>dismissal</b> that cut against priorities, relying heavily on principles of economic efficiency and stakeholder compromise in reaching its holding. This Note argues that, while priority deviation is sometimes proper, the standard applied by the Third Circuit for <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> priority-noncompliant structured <b>dismissals</b> does not go far enough to ensure that the procedural safeguards of Chapter 11 are upheld. This Note therefore proposes a multifactor analysis that would provide a more transparent system for <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> structured <b>dismissals</b> that do not comply with priorities...|$|R
