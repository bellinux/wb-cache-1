In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.|$|E

25|$|Psychosis {{is first}} and {{foremost}} a diagnosis of exclusion. So a new-onset episode of psychosis cannot be considered <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded, or ruled out. Many clinicians improperly perform, or entirely miss this step, introducing avoidable diagnostic error and misdiagnosis.|$|E

True muscle weakness is a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis.|$|E

25|$|Federico Fellini {{brought to}} the screen an exuberant imagery shaped by his {{encounter}} {{with the ideas of}} Jung, especially Jungian dream interpretation.

25|$|In {{boys and}} men, {{abnormal}} breast development is manifested as gynecomastia, {{the consequence of}} a biochemical imbalance between the normal levels of estrogen and testosterone in the male body. Around 70% of boys temporarily develop breast tissue during adolescence. The condition usually resolves by itself within two years. When male lactation occurs, it is considered <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disorder of the pituitary gland.|$|E
25|$|Jeffrey Victor {{says that}} in the United States the groups most likely to believe rumors of SRA are rural, poorly educated religiously {{conservative}} Protestant blue-collar families with an unquestioning belief in American values who feel significant anxieties over job loss, economic decline and family disintegration.

25|$|Sleep {{myoclonus}} {{occurs during}} the initial phases of sleep, especially {{at the moment of}} dropping off to sleep. Some forms appear to be stimulus-sensitive. Some people with sleep myoclonus are rarely troubled by it, or need treatment. If it is <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more complex and disturbing sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome, it may require medical treatment. Myoclonus can be associated with patients with Tourette syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the facial}} {{paralysis}} sets in, many people may mistake it as <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stroke; however, {{there are a}} few subtle differences. A stroke will usually cause a few additional symptoms, such as numbness or weakness in the arms and legs. And unlike Bell's palsy, a stroke will usually let patients control the upper part of their faces. A person with a stroke will usually have some wrinkling of their forehead.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue is {{generally}} considered a more long-term condition than sleepiness (somnolence). Although sleepiness can be a symptom of medical issues, it usually results from lack of restful sleep, {{or a lack of}} stimulation. Chronic fatigue, on the other hand, is <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greater medical problem in most cases. It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to complete tasks at normal performance. Both are often used interchangeably and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.' Oftentimes fatigue is described as an uncomfortable tiredness, whereas sleepiness is comfortable and inviting.|$|E

50|$|Poor {{decision}} making or engaging in negative behaviors {{that can lead}} to interaction with the juvenile justice system can often be <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underlying problem.

25|$|Psychosis {{as a sign}} of a {{psychiatric}} disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion. That is, a new-onset episode of psychosis is not considered <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known causes of psychosis are properly excluded. Medical and biological laboratory tests should exclude central nervous system diseases and injuries, diseases and injuries of other organs, psychoactive substances, and toxins as causes of symptoms of psychosis before any psychiatric illness can be diagnosed. In medical training, psychosis {{as a sign of}} illness is often compared to fever since both can have multiple causes that are not readily apparent.|$|E
25|$|The {{most obvious}} symptom of {{macropsia}} {{is the presence}} of exceptionally enlarged objects throughout the visual field. For example, a young girl might see her sister’s books as the same size as her sister. Stemming from this symptom, someone with macropsia may feel undersized in relation to his or her surrounding environment. Patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination, indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination. A buzzing sound in the ears has also been reported immediately before macropsia development. Some patients claim that symptoms may be eased if an attempt is made to physically touch the object which appears enormous in size. It is important to note, however, that patients typically remain lucid and alert throughout episodes, being able to recount specific details. A person with macropsia may have no psychiatric conditions. Symptoms caused chemically by drugs such as cannabis, magic mushrooms, or cocaine tend to dissipate after the chemical compound has been excreted from the body. Those who acquire macropsia as <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> virus usually experience complete recovery and restoration of normal vision.|$|E
