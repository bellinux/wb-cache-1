It was found that KOH and NaOH develop a similar narrow microporosity, independently of the coal rank, whereas only KOH generates supermicroporosity. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments, carried out with impregnated anthracite, show differences on the gas evolved during the activated carbon preparation using the two <b>activating</b> <b>agents.</b> Thus, whereas hydrogen profiles are quite similar for both <b>activated</b> <b>agents,</b> the CO and H 2 O profiles are different. It is remarkable the high amount of H 2 O evolved at the maximum treatment temperature for both <b>activating</b> <b>agents.</b> The results obtained allow concluding that the chemical activation is due to a combination of different process driving the development of material porosity.
