5|$|Although {{the fruit}} bodies of P.bembae are roughly {{similar to those}} in Xerocomus, species in this genus do not have the powdery veil {{characteristic}} of P.bembae. Two similar species in the same area include P.annulus and P.croceus, described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann, based on specimens collected in the Congo. Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, P.bembae differs from both in its larger cystidia, its cream-colored flesh with pale reddish-brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle (compared to white in P.annulus and P.croceus), its yellow mycelium (white in P.annulus and P.croceus), <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> ecology.|$|E

5|$|Normal {{dietary fat}} {{contains}} mostly long-chain triglycerides (LCT). Medium-chain triglycerides are more ketogenic than LCTs because they generate more ketones {{per unit of}} energy when metabolised. Their use allows for a diet with a lower proportion of fat and {{a greater proportion of}} protein and carbohydrate, leading to more food choices and larger portion sizes. The original MCT diet developed by Peter Huttenlocher in the 1970s derived 60% of its calories from MCT oil. Consuming that quantity of MCT oil caused abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and vomiting in some children. A figure of 45% is regarded as a balance between achieving good ketosis and minimising gastrointestinal complaints. The classical and modified MCT ketogenic diets are equally effective <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> tolerability are not statistically significant. The MCT diet is less popular in the United States; MCT oil is more expensive than other dietary fats and is not covered by insurance companies.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E
5|$|The gadfly petrels in {{the genus}} Pterodroma are seabirds of {{temperate}} and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance {{have caused the}} taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, Bugio in the Desertas Islands, and in the Cape Verde archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, P. mollis, but mitochondrial DNA analysis, <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour, showed that the northern birds are not closely related to P. mollis, and that the Bermuda petrel or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino's petrel on Madeira and Fea's petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC) in 2003.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} forms in North America {{that tend to}} intergrade with A.pantherina. In 2005, mycologist Rod Tulloss described Amanita aprica, a species that has been confused with A.gemmata {{several times in the}} past. According to mycologists Pierre Neville and Serge Poumarat, the Mediterranean species A.amici (synonymous with A.gemmata f. amici) is similar in appearance to A.gemmata but is larger. According to Tulloss however, their measurements of the cap and stem dimensions of A.amici fell within the range expected for A.gemmata, and for this reason, the two taxa should be considered conspecific. Neville and Poumarat suggest that the name A.gemmata still persists for Mediterranean collections because of its frequent historical misapplication to the native Italian species A.gioiosa, which had not been described as a distinct species until 2004. A.orientigemmata, a mushroom ranging from Japan to China, is a lookalike, but has clamps, unlike A.gemmata. Other differences between the two species include the slightly smaller spores of A.orientigemmata, <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the microstructure of the cap warts.|$|E
5|$|Though {{allowing}} such {{a variety}} of rhythms would lead to innumerable patterns, generally one could categorize these rhythmic modes on the basis on various criteria such {{as the number of}} beats in a recurring musical phrase, differences in the melodic and rhythmic groups with the musical phrase, differences in the rhythmic emphasis, <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the opening formulas and cadential patterns. For the Maguindanao, three to five typical genres can be distinguished: Duyug, Sinulog, Tidtu, Binalig and Tagonggo. The Maranao on the other hand have only three typical genres—Kapromayas/Romayas, Kapagonor/Onor, and Katitik Pandai/Kapaginandang.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{red deer}} and elk were {{considered}} to be one species, Cervus elaphus. However, mitochondrial DNA studies, conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red deer and elk subspecies as well as other species of the Cervus deer family, strongly indicate that elk, or wapiti, should be a distinct species, namely Cervus canadensis. The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the C. elaphus species designation; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to Thorold's deer and even sika deer than they are to the red deer. Though elk and red deer can produce fertile offspring in captivity, geographic isolation between the species in the wild <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> mating behaviors indicate that reproduction between them outside a controlled environment would be unlikely. However, the two species have freely inter-bred in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park, where the cross-bred animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area.|$|E

5|$|While the {{brothers}} played together for Fitzroy {{on a regular}} basis, they only played first-class cricket together occasionally, mainly {{due to a lack}} of form <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> age. Merv debuted for Victoria before the war, and Neil joined him in 1946-47. Ray followed in subsequent season, and the trio played in two matches together for their state. However, there were no occasions after this when more than two played together in the same match and such occurrences became more sporadic after this as Merv was dropped, while Neil was often away playing for Australia. Mick made his debut in 1948-49, but left Victoria at the end of the season after being unable to hold his position in the team, while Ray often struggled to gain regular selection except when Neil and the other Test players were representing Australia. Ray had a strong end to the 1952-53 season and was selected for all the matches in the following two seasons alongside Neil, but was then dropped.|$|E
5|$|With the {{subtropical}} ridge to the northeast, the nascent system moved northwestward initially. Despite persistent shear dislocating the convection, the JMA upgraded {{the system to}} a tropical storm at 12:00UTC on July2, naming it Linfa. The storm slowly intensified, amplified by good outflow {{to the south and}} the presence of warm water temperatures. On July3, Linfa's track briefly shifted to the southwest, by which time the convective structure had evolved into a central dense overcast. There was uncertainty in the storm's future as it approached the Philippines. This was due to potential interaction with Typhoon Chan-hom to the northeast, <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> storm models whether an approaching trough would turn Linfa to the east or the west.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the ancient world, at least, plants have been {{classified}} in two ways. On the one hand there is the detached academic, philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves: this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities <b>and</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> structure and function. Then there is the practical, utilitarian or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use. Cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture, horticulture and forestry as regulated by the Cultivated Plant Code. This Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature, it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce. Those cultigens given names governed by the Cultivated Plant Code fulfill three criteria: they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations (except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name); it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation.|$|E
