30|$|Pride is a {{fundamental}} human emotion involving a complex self-evaluative process (Tracy <b>and</b> <b>Robins</b> 2004). Different from other “purely” basic emotions, such as the universally admired emotion of love or the universally reviled emotion of jealousy (Williams and DeSteno 2009), pride is comprised of two distinct facets. To this extent, Tangney (1990) referred to “alpha” pride as pride in self and “beta” pride as pride in behavior. Furthermore, Tracy <b>and</b> <b>Robins</b> (2004) distinguished between authentic pride and hubristic pride: authentic pride is evoked by accomplishment from successful behavior and positively related to genuine self-esteem and prosocial traits, whereas hubristic pride is more towards self-aggrandizement and positively related to narcissism (Tracy et al. 2014). Additionally, the two facets of pride differ {{from each other in}} cognitive antecedents (Tracy <b>and</b> <b>Robins</b> 2007 b). Authentic pride is triggered more by unstable, specific, and controllable attributions, such as solid results due to hard work, whereas hubristic pride is more likely to occur from stable, global, and uncontrollable causes, such as feelings of superiority from “who I am” (Tracy <b>and</b> <b>Robins</b> 2007 b). As this study focuses on designing for positive pride, hubristic pride is excluded in the scope of this paper.|$|R
