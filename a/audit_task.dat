Because of its immense importance in both developed and developing countries, many recent studies noticed the need to enhance corporate governance in developing countries. Considering the case of Lebanon where corporate governance is not legally enforced, companies tend to neglect the importance of maintaining quality corporate governance. Several recent studies suggested the importance of existing interactions among the major components of corporate governance in any corporation and internal audits. This thesis seeks to explore the effects of corporate governance components’ on internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks</b> in medium-Large corporations in the Lebanese financial sector. The results showed that corporate governance components affect internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks.</b> When the components are considered separately, top management and audit committee are found to have significant influences on the internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks</b> whereas internal <b>audit</b> <b>tasks</b> are less influenced by external auditors and board of directors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether expert knowledge developed for one <b>audit</b> <b>task</b> can be transferred to a different <b>audit</b> <b>task.</b> Knowledge transfer refers to the situation in which knowledge developed for one task will aid decision making performance in another task (Singley 2 ̆ 6 Anderson 1989). Transfer of knowledge occurs to the extent that common elements exist in the tasks (Singley 2 ̆ 6 Anderson 1985). This dissertation provides an analysis of the going concern judgment and the loan credit review judgment. An auditor is required to assess the financial viability of an individual firm in both tasks. The existence of this common element suggests that certain loan credit review knowledge may transfer to the going concern judgment. ^ The results of an experimental task administered to 60 in-charge accountants indicate that financial service auditors with loan credit review experience are more accurate than manufacturing auditors without loan credit review experience in their evaluations of 2 ̆ 2 substantial doubt 2 ̆ 2 made for the two firms in the novel industry context. For the two firms in the manufacturing industry context, there was no statistical difference between the accuracy of financial service auditors and manufacturing auditors. Moreover, the four evaluations of 2 ̆ 2 substantial doubt 2 ̆ 2 were completed by financial service auditors in significantly less time. Overall, these results suggest that certain loan credit review knowledge transfers to aid going concern decision making performance. ^ The results have both theoretical and practical implications. From a theoretical perspective, the results show that certain types of knowledge can be transferred across tasks within auditing. In so doing, this study is the first to identify such transfer within auditing (Davis 2 ̆ 6 Solomon 1989; Bedard 2 ̆ 6 Chi 1993). From a practical perspective, the results reveal one way that an audit firm can improve the utilization of its existing firm knowledge. There may be other situations where knowledge developed for one <b>audit</b> <b>task</b> will transfer and aid judgment performance in another <b>audit</b> <b>task.</b> Thus, these results may provide the impetus for future knowledge transfer investigations. ...|$|E

This survey, propose a new scheme called a novel privacy-preserving mechanism which supports public auditing on shared data stored in the cloud. In particular, this scheme takes advantage of ring signatures to compute verification metadata. The ring signature scheme is needed to audit the correctness of shared data. With this mechanism, {{the identity of the}} signer on each block in shared data is kept secret or private from public verifiers. Public verifiers are one who are able to efficiently verify shared data integrity without retrieving the entire file. In addition, this mechanism is able to perform multiple <b>auditing</b> <b>tasks</b> simultaneously instead of single <b>auditing</b> <b>task.</b> This survey shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our mechanism when auditing shared data integrity.

40|$|Auditors {{of public}} {{accounting}} firms frequently {{deal with the}} tasks oriented to the audit judgment decision makings.

The purpose of this study is to examine whether the information system used by the auditors of public accounting firms in the form of Group Support Systems (GSS), Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS) or other electronic information technology software could increase auditors’ performance in their audit tasks. With the respondent of practicing auditors from the Big 4 public accounting firms in Indonesia, and by using structural equation model (SEM) analysis, we found evidence that the usage of Electronic Information System Technology (EIST) has significantly positive impact on <b>audit</b> <b>task</b> performance.

Besides, technology enabled auditing and IT oriented audit procedures have become crucial when performing <b>audit</b> <b>task</b> in an electronic environment. Technology-enabled auditing {{is a process of}} examination using audit technology in assuring the electronic data being managed properly and reliable in assisting auditors to form an audit opinion. Although, many initiatives being implemented to improve technology usage but audit technology usage among the auditors are still low and auditors are not attaining sufficient progress in the use of technology. This implies that technology enabled audit performance may not lead to the expected outcomes in achieving the effective, efficient and quality <b>audit</b> <b>task.</b> Furthermore, it also indicates that the current strategies and policies may not effectively support the technology implementation.

30|$|Task {{performance}} {{has been defined}} as work-related to three essential components of any task, namely product of the task, required acts necessary to perform the task, and information cues on which a person can base the judgment about the execution of the task. Stajkovic and Luthans (1998) indicated that self-efficacy is positively and strongly related to work-related performance. The relationship between self-efficacy and work-related performance is moderated by task complexity and locus of performance. Complex <b>auditing</b> <b>tasks</b> typically represent multifaceted construct with different implications for behavioral, information processing, and cognitive facilities of the task performer. Bandura (1986) pointed out that highly complex tasks require different skills necessary for their successful execution by placing greater demands on required knowledge, cognitive ability, memory capacity, behavioral facility, information processing, persistence, and physical effort. Bierstaker and Wright (2001) found that both ability and experience are determinants of performance on an ill-structured analytical review task and an ill-structured internal control <b>auditing</b> <b>task.</b> Ill-structured problems are routinely encountered in auditing. In order to solve an ill-structured problem, a problem solver must draw on experience, knowledge, and cognitive abilities. Therefore, professional development is a learning process that can promote personal growth, improve auditing skills, revolutionize working procedures, and increase auditing report quality.|$|R
