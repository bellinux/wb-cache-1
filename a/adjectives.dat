5|$|<b>Adjectives</b> {{modify a}} noun by {{providing}} {{additional information about}} their referents. In English, <b>adjectives</b> come before the nouns they modify and after determiners. In Modern English, <b>adjectives</b> are not inflected, {{and they do not}} agree in form with the noun they modify, as <b>adjectives</b> in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases the slender boy, and many slender girls, the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adjectives,</b> demonstratives and numerals {{follow the}} noun they modify. Adverbs {{likewise}} follow the verb. Morphologically, <b>adjectives</b> and adverbs are not distinguished, with many words often serving either function. <b>Adjectives</b> are also employed as verbs as Khmer sentences rarely use a copula.|$|E
5|$|Attributive <b>Adjectives</b> {{after the}} noun they modify, and inflect for number and gender. <b>Adjectives</b> may also occur alone, {{in which case}} they become an NP. Practically all <b>adjectives</b> also have a verbal form used for predicative purposes, which behaves just like a normal verb.|$|E

5|$|Some <b>adjectives</b> are inflected for {{degree of}} comparison, with the {{positive}} degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: a small boy, {{the boy is}} smaller than the girl, that boy is the smallest. Some <b>adjectives</b> have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other <b>adjectives</b> have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy. There is some variation among speakers regarding which <b>adjectives</b> use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common {{at the expense of}} the inflected form.|$|E
5|$|Statives are a {{class of}} predicative words expressing a quality or state, whose {{syntactic}} properties fall in between those of verbs and <b>adjectives</b> in Indo-European languages. Like verbs, statives can sometimes be inflected for person but normally lack inflections for tense, aspect and other purely verbal categories. Statives can be <b>adjectives,</b> positionals or numerals.|$|E
5|$|In Mayan languages, {{words are}} usually viewed as {{belonging}} to one of four classes: verbs, statives, <b>adjectives,</b> and nouns.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} effects of post-exposure verbal description and imaging on subsequent face recognition. In Experiment 1 subjects viewed a sequence of 6 target photographs, and after each, groups of subjects performed one of four tasks. Two were target-directed description tasks, an <b>adjective</b> checklist or an <b>adjective</b> generate task. Other subjects were instructed to image the target face or they performed an irrelevant/distractor task. In the subsequent recognition test subjects looked for the targets in a sequence of 140 facial photographs. The {{results indicated that the}} <b>adjective</b> checklist task produced lower recognition performance compared to the <b>adjective</b> generate task. The imaging task produced the highest recognition performance but was not significantly different from the <b>adjective</b> generate task. The irrelevant/distractor task did not significantly differ from the other tasks. Experiment 2 used different <b>adjective</b> checklist and <b>adjective</b> generate forms, and added an <b>adjective</b> rate task. Orthogonal to the post-exposure manipulation was the presence vs. absence of imaging instructions. Like Experiment 1, the results indicated that the <b>adjective</b> generate condition produced higher recognition performance than the <b>adjective</b> checklist condition. The <b>adjective</b> rate task was intermediate but did not differ from the other two description tasks. Imaging instructions did not produce a main effect, but it did interact with post-exposure task. The <b>adjective</b> checklist and <b>adjective</b> rate tasks produced lower recognition when imaging instructions were given compared to when they were not given. However, the <b>adjective</b> generate task produced better recognition with imaging instructions than without. The highest quality descriptions were produced by the <b>adjective</b> generate condition. In addition, the quality of the <b>adjective</b> generate and <b>adjective</b> rate descriptions related to subsequent recognition but the <b>adjective</b> checklist condition did not. The recognition decrements shown by the <b>adjective</b> checklist task are explained primarily in terms of confusion by irrelevant face cues. If verbal descriptions are requested from eyewitnesses, a descriptor generation task is preferred over a descriptor checklist because it does not degrade subsequent recognition, it produces the best quality descriptions, and description quality is diagnostic of subsequent recognition performance...|$|R
5000|$|An <b>adjective</b> acts as {{the head}} of an <b>adjective</b> phrase or {{adjectival}} phrase (AP). In the simplest case, an <b>adjective</b> phrase consists solely of the adjective; more complex <b>adjective</b> phrases may contain one or more adverbs modifying the <b>adjective</b> ("very strong"), or one or more complements (such as [...] "worth several dollars", [...] "full of toys", or [...] "eager to please"). In English, attributive <b>adjective</b> phrases that include complements typically follow the noun that they qualify ("an evildoer devoid of redeeming qualities").|$|R

5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about {{the manner in which}} it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from <b>adjectives</b> with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used <b>adjectives</b> have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.|$|E

5|$|The {{grammar of}} Quenya is agglutinative and mostly suffixing, i.e. {{different}} word particles {{are joined by}} appending them. It has basic word classes of verbs, nouns and pronouns/determiners, <b>adjectives</b> and prepositions. Nouns are inflected for case and number. Verbs are inflected for tense and aspect, and for agreement with subject and object. In early Quenya, <b>adjectives</b> agree with the noun they modify in case and number, but not in later Quenya, where this agreement disappears. The basic word order is subject–verb–object. Unless otherwise noted, samples in this section refer to Late Quenya as conceived by Tolkien after 1951.|$|E

5|$|Nouns {{can form}} noun phrases (NPs) {{where they are}} the {{syntactic}} head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or <b>adjectives.</b> Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as <b>adjectives</b> (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President.|$|E
5|$|Senufo {{languages}} have {{a typical}} Niger–Congo noun class (or gender) system. Suffixes on nouns mark membership {{of one of}} the five noun genders. Pronouns, <b>adjectives</b> and copulas reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to. Although none of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it can be inferred from a brief word list given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adjectives</b> are inflected in two declensions—{{indefinite}} and definite—and {{they must}} match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created {{by adding a}} suffix (-t or -a) to the common form of the adjective, e.g., en grön stol (a green chair), ett grönt hus (a green house), and gröna stolar ("green chairs"). The definite form of an adjective {{is identical to the}} indefinite plural form, e.g., den gröna stolen ("the green chair"), det gröna huset ("the green house"), and de gröna stolarna ("the green chairs").|$|E

5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial phrases and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). <b>Adjectives</b> precede the noun they modify.|$|E
5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, <b>adjectives,</b> adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E
5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from <b>adjectives.</b> These form one word class {{that is called}} nominals. Wagiman nominals take case suffixes (see below) that denote their grammatical or semantic role in the sentence. The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive, and the semantic cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), ablative (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case can be either grammatical or semantic, depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb.|$|E

5|$|Old English is very {{different}} from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns, <b>adjectives,</b> pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb endings (I have, he has), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{word order}} is subject–object–verb, like Latin and Japanese. Like other Niger–Congo languages, {{it has a}} noun class system, with nouns {{classified}} according to five different classes, which also affects pronouns, <b>adjectives</b> and copulas. The phonology features {{a distinction between the}} length of vowels and whether they are oral or nasal (as in French or Portuguese). There are also three distinct tones, a feature shared with the other Senufo languages. Nafaanra grammar features both tense and aspect which are marked with particles. Numbers are mainly formed by adding cardinal numbers to the number 5 and by multiplying the numbers 10, 20 and 100.|$|E
5|$|The {{meaning of}} a reconstructed root is {{conventionally}} that of a verb; the terms root and verbal root are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from {{a limited number of}} so-called root nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in verbal inflection through well-established morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their meanings are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in the meanings of reflexes in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and <b>adjectives</b> are derived from verbal roots via suffixes and ablaut.|$|E
