5|$|A Private act, {{passed in}} September 1881, allowed the {{construction}} of more private horse tramways and additional acts were passed authorising more line construction and services by more companies.

The trams ran at an average speed of , usually two horses pulling each tram from <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> four to ten.|$|E
5|$|A further {{complication}} is that {{a certain}} proportion of the Allied manpower was needed to man the fleet, which amounted to at least 110 triremes, and thus approximately 22,000 men.

5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E

The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
