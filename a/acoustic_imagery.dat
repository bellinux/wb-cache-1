40|$|The {{characterization}} of high frequency, shallow water acoustic backscatter and reverberation {{is important because}} acoustic systems are used in many scientific, commercial, and military applications. The approach taken is to use data collected by the Toroidal Volume Search Sonar (TVSS), a 68 kHz multibeam sonar capable of 360 deg imaging in a vertical plane perpendicular to its direction of travel. With this unique capability, <b>acoustic</b> backscatter <b>imagery</b> of the seafloor, sea surface, and horizontal and vertical planes in the volume is constructed from data obtained in 200 m deep waters in the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico when the TVSS was towed 78 m below the surface, 735 m astern of a towship. The processed imagery provides a quasi-synoptic {{characterization of}} the spatial and temporal structure of boundary and volume acoustic backscatter and reverberation. Diffraction, element patterns, and high sidelobe levels are shown {{to be the most}} serious problems affecting cylindrical arrays such as the TVSS, and an amplitude shading method is presented for reducing the peak sidelobe levels of irregular-line and non-coplanar arrays. Errors in the towfish's attitude and motion sensor, and irregularities in the TVSS's transmitted beampattern produce artifacts in the TVSS-derived bathymetry and seafloor <b>acoustic</b> backscatter <b>imagery.</b> Correction strategies for these problems are described, which are unique in that they use environmental information extracted from both ocean boundaries. Sea surface and volume <b>acoustic</b> backscatter <b>imagery</b> is used to explore and characterize the structure of near-surface bubble clouds, schooling fish, and zooplankton.

Frequent earthquakes and the constant current shearing generate widespread sediment deformation and instability of contourite deposits. Secondary channels can form by retrogression following an initial failure. At their mouth, sediment accumulates in the form of small sandy contourite lobes. These observations suggest that the Gulf of Cadiz system shares many similarities with channel-levee complexes formed by turbidity current activity.

Channels occur on the continental shelf but are presently disconnected from the deeper network of channels and valleys. Slumps are localized in steep slope areas. They are caused by oversteepening and overloading, sometimes probably associated with earthquake activity. Slumps transform sharply into turbidity currents, depositing turbidites on the floor of deep valleys.

30|$|During {{the last}} 20 years, many speckle filters for SAR images were {{developed}} and documented. Speckle noise {{is a common}} phenomenon in all coherent imaging systems like laser, <b>acoustic,</b> and SAR <b>imagery.</b> The source of this noise is attributed to random interference between the coherent returns issued from the numerous scatterers present on a surface, {{on the scale of}} a wavelength of the incident radar. Speckle noise gives the SAR image a grainy appearance and prevents target recognition and texture analysis efficiently. Obviously, speckle filtering turns out to be an important preprocessing step for some detection or classification optimization. Because speckle noise has the characteristics of a random multiplicative, thus traditional filtering will not remove it easily. In practice, the most widely used filters such as Lee (Enhanced Lee), Kuan and Frost filters are based on a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) criterion. Thus, in this section, we briefly describe the representative MMSE method, that is, Lee filter and background of level set.|$|R

The findings however, have been inconclusive in: (a) its application to classroom settings; (b) its usefulness for older or experienced learners; and (c) its effectiveness {{for a longer period of}} time. These three inconclusive results indicate a missing link between everyday teaching practice and this theory-driven method. The main aim of the present study is to fill this gap by investigating whether the keyword method could be successfully applied to an extant university Japanese language classroom for a period of one semester (halfyear). The research questions are: (1) Does the use of the keyword method improve vocabulary test scores?; (2) Do tertiary students take up the keyword method for their vocabulary learning? The data collected were from (a) two questionnaires and (b) the average scores of five vocabulary tests while the procedures used for the statistical analysis are: (a) the Rasch concurrent equating process; and (b) Hierarchical Linear Model. Application of the technique to the classroom context of university students was found to be a predictor for the productive mode of Japanese words with a 0. 1 significance level. This level was judged to be beneficial for the method to be introduced in language classrooms. Half of the treatment group and a quarter of the delayed- treatment group students used the method.

Registration of imagery obtained from this sensors is of great interest since it constitutes a key step in several applications like the generation of acoustic mosaics or the extraction of vehicle motion estimates from sonar imagery, specially on poor visibility conditions. However, the characteristics of these sonar images, such as low signal-to-noise ratio, low resolution and intensity alterations due to viewpoint changes pose {{a challenge to the}} traditional registration techniques applied on optical images. In this paper, the performance of popular registration methods commonly used in photomosaicing are evaluated on real sonar data, including feature-based methods and an area-based approach. Experiments are carried out on different environments, from man-made structured scenarios to more natural and featureless areas, and under challenging conditions such as viewpoint changes and the presence of different sonar-specific artifacts.

Using remotely-sensed (satellite <b>imagery,</b> <b>acoustic,</b> Lidar, etc.) classification maps, we investigate the spatial patterns of coral bioherms, biostromes, and non-frameworks in different environmental and biogeographic settings. Relationships between classes encoding different facies within a scene show that coral landscapes possess a high-order and embedded Markov property, i. e. neighborhood relations are highly probabilistic despite smaller components being fractal, expressing random processes. This information allows the use of graph theory to quantitatively express spatial and genetic relationships of facies. Digraphs, and the resulting adjacency and reachability matrices, differ between biostromal and biohermal frameworks. So what? A better understanding of spatial patterns will allow a quantification of reef frameworks and associated facies by a single or few indices rather than many words, and enhance interpretation of incomplete (i. e. core) records, which will also allow better reconstruction of the entire sedimentary environment from such incomplete records with implications for the identification of potential reservoirs in reefal frameworks or other, spatially similarly operating systems...|$|R

Habitat types ranged in reflected signal backscatter intensity: very dark, dark, light, very light. Additionally, apparent morphological features were associated with each (e. g. very dark = lens-shaped; light = sand waves). Sediments were characterised at each site by conducting granulometric analyses of samples collected using a van Veen grab. Both the darker ‘habitat types’ were found to be gravels and both lighter types were fine sands. There was a strong pattern in fish assemblage structure in relation to habitat type, and distinct assemblages were seen between ‘gravel’ and ‘fine sand’ habitats. Species richness was higher in gravel than in sand habitats. Additionally, 6 species were only recorded in the very dark lens habitat. However, there were no apparent differences in assemblage patterns between the 2 fine sand habitats.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The North Water Polynya (NOW) {{is an area}} {{of ocean}} between Greenland and Ellesmere Island that does not freeze {{completely}} during the winter months. The mechanism that maintains the polynya during the Arctic winter and early spring is not precisely known, but the presence of open water is a critical factor in allowing oceanic heat to escape into the atmosphere. The northerly location of the NOW permitted the collection of an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) image every 101 minutes for seven consecutive orbits. The unique, short time span imagery allowed thermal features of the NOW to be mapped over a tidal cycle. The combination of AVHRR <b>imagery,</b> <b>Acoustic</b> Doppler Current Profiler data, and the Composite Arctic Sea Surface Temperature Algorithm show the dynamic nature of the NOW over a tidal cycle. Both the amount and configuration of open water can change dramatically over a 12 -hour period in response to tidal fluctuations. The evidence suggests that the amount of open water in the NOW during March and April is related to the velocity of the current, which in turn is influenced by the tidal cycle. The open water caused by the tide-induced movement of ice then allows oceanic heat to escape into the environment. During March and April, the considerable temperature difference between the ocean and the atmosphere at their interface results in a high incidence of ice fog near leads and open water in the NOW. The amount of ice fog observed on the satellite imagery fluctuates with the tidal cycle, suggesting that open water within the NOW is influenced by the tide in the short term...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experimental results}} from a live-fire data collect designed to demonstrate the ability of IR and acoustic sensing systems to detect and map high-volume gunfire events from tactical UAVs. The data collect supports an exploratory study of the FightSight concept in which an autonomous UAV-based sensor exploitation and decision support capability is being proposed to provide dynamic situational awareness for large-scale battalion-level firefights in cluttered urban environments. FightSight integrates IR <b>imagery,</b> <b>acoustic</b> data, and 3 D scene context data with prior time information in a multi-level, multi-step probabilistic-based fusion process to reliably locate and map the array of urban firing events and firepower movements and trends associated with the evolving urban battlefield situation. Described here are sensor results from live-fire experiments involving simultaneous firing of multiple sub/super-sonic weapons (2 -AK 47, 2 -M 16, 1 Beretta, 1 Mortar, 1 rocket) with high optical and acoustic clutter at ranges up to 400 m. Sensor-shooter-target configurations and clutter were designed to simulate UAV sensing conditions for a high-intensity firefight in an urban environment. Sensor systems evaluated were an IR bullet tracking system by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and an acoustic gunshot detection system by Planning Systems, Inc. (PSI). The results demonstrate convincingly the ability for the LLNL and PSI sensor systems to accurately detect, separate, and localize multiple shooters and the associated shot directions during a high-intensity firefight (77 rounds in 5 sec) in a high acoustic and optical clutter environment with no false alarms. Preliminary fusion processing was also examined that demonstrated an ability to distinguish co-located shooters (shooter density), range to < 0. 5 m accuracy at 400 m, and weapon type...|$|R
40|$|Prioritising {{biodiversity}} conservation requires {{knowledge of}} where biodiversity occurs. Such knowledge, however, is often lacking. New technologies for collecting biological and physical data coupled with advances in modelling techniques could help address these gaps and facilitate improved management outcomes. Here {{we examined the}} utility of environmental data, obtained using different methods, for developing models of both uni- and multivariate biodiversity metrics. We tested which biodiversity metrics could be predicted best and evaluated the performance of predictor variables generated from three types of habitat data: <b>acoustic</b> multibeam sonar <b>imagery,</b> predicted habitat classification, and direct observer habitat classification. We used boosted regression trees (BRT) to model metrics of fish species richness, abundance and biomass, and multivariate regression trees (MRT) to model biomass and abundance of fish functional groups. We compared model performance using different sets of predictors and estimated the relative influence of individual predictors. Models of total species richness and total abundance performed best; those developed for endemic species performed worst. Abundance models performed substantially better than corresponding biomass models. In general, BRT and MRTs developed using predicted habitat classifications performed less well than those using multibeam data. The most influential individual predictor was the abiotic categorical variable from direct observer habitat classification and models that incorporated predictors from direct observer habitat classification consistently outperformed those that did not. Our results show that while remotely sensed data can offer considerable utility for predictive modeling, the addition of direct observer habitat classification data can substantially improve model performance. Thus it appears that there are aspects of marine habitats that are important for modeling metrics of fish biodiversity that are not fully captured by remotely sensed data. As such, the use of remotely sensed data to model biodiversity represents a compromise between model performance and data availability...|$|R
