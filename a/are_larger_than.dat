25|$|If {{a number}} is the {{successor}} of another number, {{then the first}} number is said to <b>be</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the other number. If a number <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> another number, and if the other number <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> a third number, then the first number <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the third number. Example: five <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> four, and four <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> three, therefore five <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> three. But six <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> five, therefore six <b>is</b> also <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> three.

5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, {{sweet potatoes and}} parsnips. Camas pocket gophers <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> other gophers, so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them. Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail, since the gophers will sometimes wall off {{a segment of the}} burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees.|$|E

Households <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> average, consistent with a younger population, with an average of 2.51 people per household, compared to the national average of 2.36. Approximately 25% are single person households, compared to 30% nationally; the majority (almost 85%) of Middlewich's housing stock is owner-occupied.|$|E
5|$|Before courtship, male spiders spin a small web and {{ejaculate}} on to it, {{and then}} store the semen in reservoirs on his pedipalps, which <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> those of females. Phaeacius spins a flimsy silken, horizontal or vertical platform, {{about twice the}} spider's length in diameter, to moult and lay eggs, but not at other times. After the moult, Phaeacius leaves the discarded exuvia hanging from the platform. A female's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity {{on the surface of}} a log.|$|E

5|$|Few of the {{original}} windows survive in the tower, but those that remain <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> {{in some of the}} other older peles, suggesting it may have been built with defence less in mind than in some earlier pele towers. The originals have mainly been replaced by 17th- and 18th-century versions. The original roof would have resembled that at nearby Yanwath Hall, but was replaced at a later date with the current hipped-roof design, probably during the late 16th or 17th centuries. The current roof was further restored in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the {{territorial}} behaviour of caecilians, but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges. These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> males, {{this is not the}} case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the planets}} in the Solar System have {{secondary}} systems of their own, being orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons (two of which, Titan and Ganymede, <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> the planet Mercury), and, {{in the case of}} the four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent.|$|E

5|$|On occasion, {{groups of}} {{unrelated}} juveniles are observed. River otters living in groups hunt and travel together, {{use the same}} dens, resting sites, and latrines, and perform allogrooming. In freshwater systems, groups occur most often in autumn and during early winter. From mid-winter through the breeding season, adult females move and den alone. River otters are not territorial, but individual otters of different groups portray mutual avoidance. Home ranges of males <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> those of females, and both sexes exhibit intra- and intersexual overlap of their domains.|$|E
5|$|Other similar mycenas {{that grow}} in {{clusters}} on wood include M.maculata and M.galericulata. The fruit bodies of M.maculata often develop red stains as they mature, but this characteristic is inconsistent and cannot be reliably used for identification. Its spores <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> that of M.overholtsii, measuring 7–10 by 4–6µm. M.galericulata {{is very similar}} in appearance to M.maculata, but does not undergo reddish staining; its spores are 8–12 by 5.5–9µm. Another similar species is M.semivestipes, which can be distinguished by its bleach-like odor, an eastern North American distribution, fruiting season during summer and autumn, and small spores measuring 4–5 by 2.5–3µm.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{subspecies}} {{have been}} named but the largely contiguous populations show clinal variation and intergrade with each other.

Race cathoecus is found in Thailand, Hong Kong and China. This race has a much smaller rictal spot and the wings are dark with a greenish gloss. In southern Siam a race thai is resident, but overlaps with wintering cathoecus. Race javanus is found on the islands of Java and Bali. Race harterti found in Formosa has the tail length less than the wing.|$|E
