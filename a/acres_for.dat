5|$|Thousands of {{settlers}} {{were attracted}} to the Dakota Territory in the 1870s and 1880s for its cheap land, and the population began to rise. Many established small family farms, but some investors bought thousands of <b>acres</b> <b>for</b> bonanza farms, where they supervised the cultivation and harvesting of wheat as a commodity crop. The city grew quickly after {{the arrival of the}} Great Northern Railway in 1880 and the Northern Pacific Railway in 1887. In 1883, the University of North Dakota was established, six years before North Dakota was admitted as an independent state born from the Dakota Territory.|$|E

The new workshops were to be served by the Hutt Industrial Line, which would also provide rail access to other industrial developments in the area.|$|R
50|$|Local {{authorities}} {{first proposed}} {{to locate the}} lighthouse further north on Foulweather Bluff. When the Point No Point location was agreed upon, {{the owners of the}} land were reluctant to sell.

50|$|In 2006, the Town of Port Washington {{developed}} a detailed plan {{to allow for}} increased development in Knellsville. The town designated 109 <b>acre</b> <b>for</b> industrial facilities, 30 <b>acre</b> <b>for</b> office buildings, and 44 <b>acre</b> <b>for</b> commercial buildings. Due to this plan, Knellsville is unique among unincorporated communities in that the town in which it lies has given it a defined border.|$|R
50|$|In 1829 Otmoor was {{inclosed}} {{and some}} of its land was added to the parish of Beckley, including 262 <b>acre</b> <b>for</b> Horton and 200 <b>acre</b> <b>for</b> Studley. In 1831 the parish of Beckley itself was inclosed.|$|R

25|$|In 1664 {{the land}} {{came under the}} control of the English when New Netherland was ceded to The Crown. After the American Revolutionary War, the lands passed to the people of New York State. Needing money to {{discharge}} war debts, the new government sold nearly all the original public acreage about 7 million <b>acres</b> <b>for</b> pennies an acre. Lumbermen were welcomed to the interior, with few restraints, resulting in massive deforestation.|$|E
25|$|Bryant Park, {{located in}} {{downtown}} Lake Worth, has a 1920s-era bandshell {{which is used}} for festivals and other events.

50|$|Another {{issue was}} {{the amount of}} land needed. The lands {{authorized}} to be acquired consisted of 15000 <b>acre</b> <b>for</b> the dam and reservoir area, 13000 <b>acre</b> <b>for</b> the public access and recreation area, and 2000 <b>acre</b> <b>for</b> the wildlife mitigation area for a total acreage of 30000 acre at $20,000,000.00 (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1974).

25|$|Long-staple cotton {{had been}} invented in Cairo in the 1820s, {{becoming}} {{a staple of}} the Egyptian economy in the 19th and 20th Centuries. Cotton production used 2.1 million <b>acres</b> <b>for</b> cultivation after the Second World War and by the 1980s represented the second largest export in Egypt, after crude oil. Cotton production in Egypt nevertheless declined after its post-WWII peak as arable land was converted to cereal or clover production, and previous importers including India achieved cotton self-sufficiency.|$|E
25|$|The work paid well, and {{attracted}} many navvies to the area. Land-owners were compensated NOK 50–200 per hectare (2.5 <b>acres)</b> <b>for</b> cultivated land, and NOK 10 per hectare for forest. Many local farmers made good money offering transport of cargo for the construction, {{as well as}} renting out annexes for navvies; others made money as traders. As with all such construction areas, many legal and illegal pubs and brothels were established. After construction was completed, some moved on, while others settled in the area; many of these received jobs with the railway company.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} firms {{involved}} is the Egyptian private equity firm Citadel Capital, which has leased 259,500 <b>acres</b> <b>for</b> farming. This plantation has provided little local employment, being mostly run by Zimbabweans. A Ugandan conglomerate called the Madhvani Group has also entered into a preliminary agreement {{with the government of}} South Soudan to revitalize a government-owned sugar plantation and processing facility in Mangala Payam. This plantation would cover 10,000 ha of prime riverfront property along the Nile, about 70 kilometers north of Juba. According to the paramount chief in Mangala, the community has not been involved in any of the investment negotiations.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{financial assistance}} from the UK, {{the first phase of}} Zimbabwe's land reform programme was widely regarded as unsuccessful. Zimbabwe was only able to acquire 3 million hectares (7.41 million <b>acres)</b> <b>for</b> black resettlement, well short of its intended target of 8 million hectares (19.77 million acres). This land was redistributed to about 50,000 households. Many former supporters of the nationalist movements felt that the promises of Nkomo and Mugabe with regards to the land had not been truly fulfilled. This sentiment was especially acute in Matabeleland, where the legacy of the Southern Rhodesian Land Apportionment Act was more disadvantageous to black Zimbabweans than other parts of the country.|$|E
25|$|In December 1921, {{with the}} help of an uncle and with a loan from two parents of girls at the school, Willis bought The Cloisters, Cold Ash, Berkshire, with sixty <b>acres,</b> <b>for</b> £11,976. The Cloisters had been {{designed}} by the architect James MacLaren Ross and was built during the First World War for a religious order called 'The School of Silence', but the order had been unable to keep up the payments on its mortgage. Willis was able to move her school there just four months after the purchase, in April 1922. For the Summer term of 1922, the school had eighty-three girls, and by 1925 there were 118. Downe House had arrived as a leading girls' school.|$|E
25|$|Since Trinidad was {{considered}} underpopulated, Roume de St. Laurent, a Frenchman living in Grenada, {{was able to}} obtain a Cédula de Población from the Spanish king Charles III on 4 November 1783. A Cédula de Población had previously been granted in 1776 by the king, but had not shown results, and therefore the new Cédula was more generous. It granted free land and tax exemption for 10 years to Roman Catholic foreign settlers {{who were willing to}} swear allegiance to the King of Spain. The land grant was 30 fanegas (13 hectares/32 <b>acres)</b> <b>for</b> each free man, woman and child and half of that for each slave that they brought with them.|$|E

25|$|In 1894, a Land Commission was {{appointed}} {{to deal with the}} settlement of Africans on the land. The Commission recommended that two large territories be set aside for native occupation, the Shangani and Gwaai Reserves in Matabeleland, of about 2,486,000 acres. Before the arrival of the Europeans, Africans had held nearly 100,000,000 acres in what became Southern Rhodesia. The Land Commission's plan showed such poor judgment, and the bases of allocation were so ill-considered, that the attempt to confine the native population within these two areas was never really practicable. Failure to make suitable provision for African lands may {{have been one of the}} prime causes of the Matabele and Mashona rebellions of 1896. Following these rebellions, BSAC was required to assign sufficient land to Southern Rhodesian Africans for their agricultural and pastoral requirements, including access to sufficient water. Native Reserves were set up under this directive, which by 1902 had an estimated indigenous population of 530,000. Although later modifications were made, the basic pattern of land allocation persisted until independence. The European district officers who responsible for defining the reserves were advised to allow between 9 and 15 acres of arable land for each family, and adequate pasture, but they had little geographic knowledge of the country and no maps. In 1910, a Native Affairs Committee of Enquiry was set up, which made very few changes. The Committee's land apportionment was 19 million <b>acres</b> <b>for</b> Europeans and 21.4 million <b>acres</b> <b>for</b> Native Reserves with an African population of about 700,000. A further 51.6 million acres was unassigned, but available for future alienation to Europeans.|$|E
25|$|Camp Patiya is a 30-acre {{camping and}} day use camp about seven {{miles west of}} Boulder, Colorado. Camp Patiya started by the Camp Fire Girls. The Camp Fire Council {{purchased}} the original twenty <b>acres</b> <b>for</b> the camp in 1960 and began holding group and family camps shortly thereafter. All the buildings on site were constructed between 1963 and 1981. In 1977, an additional ten acres of land was donated, bringing the camp to its present size. Camp Fire continued to hold group camping year round and Day Camps in the summers. In the 1980s, membership in Camp Fire declined. In 1987, {{it was determined that}} the goals for operating the camp could best be met by transferring the ownership to Longs Peak Council, Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
25|$|The two-and-one-half <b>acres</b> <b>for</b> {{the park}} was {{approved}} for that use and donated by the Donnells in 1847. The park is one block square, bordered by Lombard, Stricker, Gilmor, and Hollins streets. The landscape of Union Square – with its walkways, pavilion, fountain, and wrought iron lamps – recalls Victorian Era Baltimore. Architect John F. Hoss designed the iron Greek-style pavilion with fluted columns in 1850 – it covers a natural spring that was once accessible by steps and, at one time, supplied water to the B Railroad. The source of the name “Union Square” is uncertain but probably reflects the patriotic sentiment of this time before the Civil War. Fog scenes of the Square, lights agleam over wet pavements and barren limbs, were often featured in local landscape artistry.|$|E
