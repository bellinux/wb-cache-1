40|$|This {{research}} is {{an analysis of}} <b>absolute</b> <b>densities</b> throughout the mesosphere (45 km to 90 km). Although much research has gone into the study of temperatures and their variations occurring in our atmosphere, little {{has been done to}} research the densities and their variations. Due to the remoteness of the middle atmosphere there is a high degree of difficulty in making observations in the mesosphere. There are currently three major types of ground-based instruments used to sense the mesosphere remotely. They are atmospheric radars, LIDARs and optical spectrometers. As far as measuring density in the mesosphere LIDAR is the most efficient. A Rayleigh-scatter LIDAR operated at the Atmospheric LIDAR Observatory (ALO; 41. 7 ° N, 111. 8 ° W), as part of CASS (Center for Atmosphere and Space Studies), on the campus of Utah State University (USU) has collected extensive data between 1993 and 2004. This LIDAR is used to measure relative densities (which can be used to derive temperatures) throughout the mesosphere. An analysis is made with the <b>absolute</b> <b>densities</b> from the atmosphere reanalysis model ERA- 20 C (the European Reanalysis 20 th century model.) by using the model densities at 45 km to calibrate the LIDAR observations made at USU. Thereby, converting the relative densities measured by the USU LIDAR into measurements of <b>absolute</b> <b>densities.</b> These densities are used to examine the density structure of the mesosphere, how it varies with altitude and time, possible atmospheric anomalies, along with annual or semiannual atmospheric variations. Monthly averages are used to compare density variations related to altitude and season. By normalizing the relative densities from the Rayleigh LIDAR observations to the <b>absolute</b> <b>densities</b> from the reanalysis models, these differences can be observed and analyzed to better characterize the neutral atmosphere and learn how it varies during the year...|$|R

50|$|The {{reason a}} {{consumer}} may switch from eating one resource, to eating another, {{is because it}} may increase an individual's foraging efficiency and therefore its inclusive fitness. It {{has been argued that}} frequency-dependent predation is predicted from optimal foraging theory. In particular the contingency model predicts that in some circumstances the most profitable resource should be eaten {{at the expense of the}} less profitable resources, and that this decision is based on the <b>absolute</b> <b>density</b> of the most profitable type of resource. However frequency-dependent predation can occur even when the <b>absolute</b> <b>density</b> of the most profitable resource remains constant. These ultimate mechanisms help to demonstrate how prey switching and apostatic selection fit into overarching ecological theory. In addition there are proximate mechanisms which may account for why an individual preferentially feeds on the most abundant type of prey.|$|E

40|$|Since {{typically}} {{there are}} many predators feeding on most herbivores in natural communities, understanding multiple predator effects is critical for both community and applied ecology. Experiments of multiple predator effects on prey populations are extremely demanding, {{as the number of}} treatments and the amount of labour associated with these experiments increases exponentially with the number of species in question. Therefore, researchers tend to vary only presence/absence of the species and use only one (supposedly realistic) combination of their numbers in experiments. However, nonlinearities in density dependence, functional responses, interactions between natural enemies etc. are typical for such systems, and nonlinear models of population dynamics generally predict qualitatively different results, if initial <b>absolute</b> <b>densities</b> of the species studied differ, even if their relative densities are maintained. Therefore, testing combinations of natural enemies without varying their densities may not be sufficient. Here we test this prediction experimentally. We show that the population dynamics of a system consisting of 2 natural enemies (aphid predator Adalia bipunctata (L.), and aphid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani Viereck) and their shared prey (peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulzer) are strongly affected by the <b>absolute</b> initial <b>densities</b> of the species in question.
