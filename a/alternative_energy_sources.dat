5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower speed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> <b>sources.</b> These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent.

40|$|Recently {{published}} life-cycle assessments (LCAs) on {{recycling and}} incineration with energy recovery of paper packaging materials {{are used as}} examples {{in order to discuss}} the usefulness of LCAs. The type of information that can typically be produced by an LCA is described. The reproducibility of LCAs is evaluated and reasons for possible discrepancies between LCAs are discussed. An attempt is also made to make conclusions on advantages to the environment of recycling versus incineration of paper packaging materials, and discuss lessons learned that can be applied to other materials. In all seven studies, including 12 cases and 27 scenarios, total energy use is consistently lower when paper packaging materials are recycled rather than incinerated. Other, differing results {{can be explained by the}} assumptions made concerning the <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> used instead of the energy from incineration when paper is recycled instead of incinerated (called ‘the <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> source’). If fossil fuels are the <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source,</b> incinerated paper replaces fossil fuels, and emissions of CO 2 can be decreased. If, on the other hand solid waste (which in other cases would have been landfilled), or biofuels are the <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source,</b> fossil fuels will not be replaced. In these cases, increased recycling will in general lead to decreased emissions of greenhouse gases. It is suggested that the <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> <b>source</b> for the near future is usually solid waste.
