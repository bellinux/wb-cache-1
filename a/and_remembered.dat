5|$|As an {{important}} public figure, Reitz was honoured <b>and</b> <b>remembered</b> in different ways.

In 1894 one also named a village after his second wife, Cornelia. A ship named after him, the President Reitz, sank off Port Elizabeth in 1947. The Jubilee Diamond, found in the Free State village of Jagersfontein in 1895 was originally named the Reitz Diamond, but renamed in honour of the sixtieth anniversary of the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1897.|$|E

As stated {{at the back of}} the first volume, Maeda first conceived Hibiki's Magic as a short story he wrote as a student, and the story contains an unspecified theme that he has carried through a lot of stories since. In 2003, he wanted to collaborate with Izumi, one of his favorite artists, <b>and</b> <b>remembered</b> his earlier concept that would become Hibiki's Magic. After Izumi drew some early character designs for Hibiki, Maeda wanted to continue the story and start a manga with Izumi as the artist.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{has been}} noted <b>and</b> <b>remembered</b> in many film and {{television}} productions. Before he became widely known as an astronaut, the film Air Cadet (1951) starring Richard Long and Rock Hudson briefly featured Grissom early in the movie as a U.S. Air Force candidate for flight school at Randolph Field, San Antonio, Texas. Grissom was depicted by Fred Ward in the film The Right Stuff (1983) and (very briefly) in the film Apollo 13 (1995) by Steve Bernie. He was portrayed in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon (1998) by Mark Rolston. Actor Kevin McCorkle played Grissom in the third-season finale of the NBC television show American Dreams. Bryan Cranston played Grissom as a nervous variety-show guest in the film That Thing You Do! Actor Joel Johnstone portrays Gus Grissom in the 2015 ABC TV series The Astronaut Wives Club.|$|E
5|$|Ilā married Budha {{and spent}} an entire month {{with him and}} consummated the marriage. However, Ilā woke one morning as Sudyumna <b>and</b> <b>remembered</b> nothing about the past month. Budha told Ila that his retinue {{had been killed in}} a rain of stones and {{convinced}} Ila to stay with him for a year. During each month she spent as a woman, Ilā had good time with Budha. During each month as a man, Ila turned to pious ways and performed austerities under the guidance of Budha. In the ninth month, Ilā gave birth to Pururavas, who grew to become the first king of the Lunar dynasty. Then, as per the advice of Budha and Ila's father Kardama, Ila pleased Shiva with a horse sacrifice and Shiva restored Ila's masculinity permanently.|$|E

5|$|Publisher Jamie Byng of Canongate Books {{solicited}} author Margaret Atwood {{to write}} a novella re-telling a classic myth of her choice. Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages {{as part of an}} international project called the Canongate Myth Series. Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project. From her home in Toronto, the 64-year-old author made attempts at writing the Norse creation myth and a Native American story but struggled. After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract, Atwood began thinking about the Odyssey. She had first read it as a teenager <b>and</b> <b>remembered</b> finding the imagery of Penelope's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing. Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly topic and that she could help address it with this project.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{functional}} neuroimaging {{evidence suggests}} a bottleneck between learning new information <b>and</b> <b>remembering</b> old information. In two behavioral experiments and one functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that learning <b>and</b> <b>remembering</b> compete when both processes happen within {{a brief period of}} time. In the first behavioral experiment, participants intentionally remembered old words displayed in the foreground, while incidentally learning new scenes displayed in the background. In line with a memory competition, we found that remembering old information was associated with impaired learning of new information. We replicated this finding in a subsequent fMRI experiment, which showed that this behavioral effect was coupled with a suppression of learningrelated activity in visual and medial temporal areas. Moreover, the fMRI experiment provided evidence that left midventrolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in resolving the memory competition, possibly by facilitating rapid switching between learning <b>and</b> <b>remembering.</b> Critically, a follow-up behavioral experiment in which the background scenes were replaced with a visual target detection task provided indications that the competition between learning <b>and</b> <b>remembering</b> was not merely due to attention. This study not only provides novel insight into our capacity to learn <b>and</b> <b>remember,</b> but also clarifies the neural mechanisms underlying flexible behavior...|$|R
