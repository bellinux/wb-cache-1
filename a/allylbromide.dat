40|$|Selectively {{functionalized}} polyolefine {{surfaces are}} essential for many applications in adhesion, chemistry, medicine and biotechnology. To provide polymer surfaces with special functionalities {{it is necessary to}} treat them with according precursors in plasma. In this work polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were exposed to bromine containing (bromoform, <b>allylbromide,</b> tert-butylbromide) plasmas. Surpisingly, the bromination appeared as high selective and formed high dense C-Br groups at the polyolefin surface. Halogen containing plasmas like tetrafluormethane, fluoroform, chloroform, bromoform and diiodinemethane were compared with regard to their selectivity, yield as well as ionisation potential and electron temperature of the corresponding plasma. It was also analysed if the halogens are bonded as C-X or C-CXn-fragments onto the surface. Moreover, the post-plasma oxidation stability was also investigated. Subsequently the brominated polyolefine surfaces were allowed to react with different organic compounds. The aim was to demonstrate the universality of the C-Br group for attaching of any OH and NH 2 functional group containing molecule. Terminal alcohol, glycols and amines are used. Especially, flexibilizing spacers within the metal-polymer interface of different length, stiffness and functionality were introduced. Besides grafting of spacers it was also shown {{that it is possible to}} change the functionality of the surface. Concentrated or liquid ammonia should produce primary amino groups through a simple substitution. Hydroxyl groups were formed by hydrolsis using potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide in different solvents. The different grafted polypropylene surfaces were brought into vacuum and were metalized with copper or aluminium.

The substitutional lability of 1, 5 -COD in [Rh(1, 5 -COD) (Q) ] versus mono- and di-organophosphine ligands was also investigated. In all cases 1, 5 -COD has been displaced.

Low temperatures (- 50 oC) favour attack at CB leading to kinetic formation of 6, 8 -bicycles containing non-classical C-carbanion enolates (5). Higher temperatures (10 oC to ambient) and electron deficient R 2 favour retro σ-bond C-C cleavage regenerating 4 which subsequently closes on CA providing 6, 6 -bicyclic alkoxides (6). Computational modelling (CBS-QB 3) indicates both pathways are viable and of similar energies. Reaction of 6 with H+ affords 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalen- 1 -ols, or under dehydrating conditions, 2 -aryl- 1 -alkynylnaphthlenes. Enolates 5 react in situ with: H 2 O, D 2 O, I 2, <b>allylbromide,</b> S 2 Me 2, CO 2 and lead to the expected C-E derivatives (E = H, D, I, allyl, SMe, CO 2 H) in 49 - 64 % yield directly from intermediate 5.

40|$|Phenol {{is one of}} {{petrochemical}} products which is cheap and easy to obtain. This research {{was done with the}} intention of convert phenols to valuable products which have higher economic value for example phenol transformation to calix[4]arene. Active site of calixarenes which have important role to the adsorption, extraction, and complexation are the presence of hydroxyl groups located in a line to form cyclic structure and the existence of molecule cavity forming like vase or cup shapes. With regard to calixarenes, it have proved that this compound can be used for heavy metal cationic adsorption. In the form of polymerization, the cyclic hydroxyl groups and calix[4]arenes cavity are arranged in a series forming a tunnel like structure. Based on this phenomenon, this research was carried out to synthesize calix[4]arene polymers having two allyl groups. Due to the existence of the two allyl groups, cross link reaction between calix[4]arene was taken place. This makes the molecules immobile and it can be predicted that the adsorption process for heavy metal cationic will be higher. In the first year, the synthesis of poly(di-allylcalix[4]arene) from phenol were performed in experimental series as follows: (1) Alkylation of phenol using p-tbutylchloride and AlCl 3 to p-t-butylphenol, (2) Cyclotetramerization of p-tbutylphenol with NaOH and paraformaldehyde to p-butylcalix[4]arene, (3) Debutylation of p-butylcalix[4]arene using AlCl 3 and phenol to tetrahydroxycalix[4]arene, (4) Allylation reaction using <b>allylbromide</b> to allyloxydihydroxycalix[4]arene, (5) Claisen rearrangement reaction, (6) Cationic polymerization to diallylcalix[4]arenes. The second year, the poly-diallylcalix[4]arenes were applicated as an adsorbent of heavy metal cations (Pb(II) and Cr(III)). Adsorbent used in adsorption process were three adsorbent, there are 25, 26, 27, 26 -tetrahydroxycalix[4]arene (M), poly- 25 - 27 -diallyloxy- 26, 28 - dihidroxy[4]arene (PD) and poly- 5, 7 -diallyl- 25, 26, 27, 28 -tetrahidoxycalix[4]arene (PCD). Adsorption was carried out towards Pb(II) and Cr(III) ions in batch system. Several variables including pH, contact time and initial concentration of metal ions were determined. The optimum pH of adsorption of metal ions Pb (II) was pH 5. 0 for the three adsorbents, while the adsorption of metal ions Cr (III) at pH 5. 5 for adsorbent M and PCD, and those for adsorbent PD was pH 5. 0. In addition, the optimum contact time of Pb (II) ion adsorption was 180 minutes for the adsorbent M, while those for the adsorbent PD and PCD were 135 minutes. The optimum contact time of Cr (III) ion adsorption were 180 minutes for the adsorbent M and PD, while those the adsorbent PCD was 135 minutes. The adsorption kinetics of Pb(II) and Cr(III) ions using three adsorbent (M, PD and PCD) followed a pseudo 2 nd order kinetics model. Furthermore, The adsorption isotherm of Pb(II) ions using three adsorbent tends to follow the Langmuir isotherm, whereas the adsorption of Cr (III) using three adsorbent tends to follow the Freundlich isotherm. The adsorption capacity of Pb(II) metal ions using M,PD and PCD were 115. 03, 102. 19 and 125. 82 μmole/g, with adsorption energy of 27. 69, 28. 74 and 28. 12 KJ / mole, respectively.
