The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his father would have none of it.|$|E

5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as <b>a</b> <b>loner</b> {{and not a}} person who was quick to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{received}} a developmental {{contract with the}} WWF in 1997. On Remembrance Day 1997 in Cornwall, Ontario, he (under his real name) faced Christian Cage at a Shotgun taping, a match included on WWE Home Video's 2008 retrospective, Edge: A Decade of Decadence. Upon completing his training, Copeland made his WWF television debut on the June 22, 1998 episode of Raw as Edge, <b>a</b> <b>loner</b> character who entered the arena through the crowd for his matches. This had been preceded by weeks of vignettes for the character, which included him aimlessly walking around the city streets and assaulting innocent pedestrians. Copeland took the name Edge from an Albany radio station.|$|E

50|$|His {{image is}} that of <b>an</b> <b>loner,</b> living {{on the fringe of}} society, {{struggling}} for survival at start. His work is deeply tied to the small town atmosphere of Košice and its people, whose macrocosm can be seen in most of his works. In formal terms his work reflects secessionist expressionism and symbolism of Konštantín Kövári-Kačmárik and the Hungarian symbolism of Károly Férenczy and József Rippl-Rónai.|$|R

5|$|It {{has never}} been fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have been}} acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being <b>a</b> <b>loner</b> with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E
5|$|The second Playford was {{something}} of <b>a</b> <b>loner,</b> but {{at the age of}} 15 he developed a relationship with a girl five years his senior with whom he fathered a child. In order to avoid the social stigma of the situation, and on the advice of his parents, Playford enlisted in the British Army in 1810. While three years under the acceptable age, Playford's height (6ft 2 in) enabled him to pass as eighteen. He spent 24 years {{in the service of the}} Life Guards, fighting all over Europe in Portugal, Spain and France, including the Battle of Waterloo at the age of 20.|$|E
5|$|Wacław Jędrzejewicz, in Piłsudski: A Life for Poland, {{describes}} Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making. He collected {{all available}} pertinent information, then {{took his time}} weighing it before arriving at a final decision. Piłsudski drove himself hard, working all day and all night. He maintained a spartan lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant. Though Piłsudski was popular {{with much of the}} Polish public, his reputation as <b>a</b> <b>loner</b> (the result of many years' underground work), as a man who distrusted almost everyone, led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Murphy was <b>a</b> <b>loner</b> with {{mood swings}} and an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted {{in and out of}} the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his oldest sister Corinne and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.|$|E
5|$|Intelligent, passionate, and {{the moral}} center of the family, Lisa Simpson, at eight years old, is the second child of Homer and Marge, younger sister of Bart, and older sister of Maggie. Lisa's high intellect and liberal {{political}} stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age, therefore she {{is a bit of}} <b>a</b> <b>loner</b> and social outcast. Lisa is a vegetarian, a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and a Buddhist. Lisa enjoys many hobbies, including reading and playing the baritone saxophone. Lisa's character develops many times {{over the course of the}} show: she becomes a vegetarian in season 7 and converts to Buddhism in season 13. A strong liberal, Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes and stands with the Tibetan independence movement. She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons– including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books– and inspired a line of merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Matejko {{was fascinated}} by Stańczyk from the times of his youth, and portrayed him in several of his works (most notably, besides the {{painting}} discussed here, in Consecration of King Sigismund's Bell, 1874 and Prussian Homage, 1882). Working on this painting, Matejko was also inspired by the book Król zamczyska by Seweryn Goszczyński, whose main character– <b>a</b> <b>loner,</b> living in the castle's ruins, trying to reconcile past and present, and himself inspired by Stańczyk– likely influenced this painting. Completed in 1862, when Matejko was twenty four years old, {{it is one of}} his most famous works and the one that launched him to fame. It is seen as a key painting for the understanding of Matejko's style and intentions in his art. Matejko used his own face for Stańczyk, and with this work, began a series of paintings analyzing and interpreting the history of Poland through the figure of Stańczyk.|$|E

50|$|Another {{casualty}} of censorship was John Smith and Sean Phillips's Straitgate. Its main character {{was intended to}} be <b>a</b> self-obsessed young <b>loner</b> who suffers from delusions and ends up going on a killing spree, but it was toned down until he became little more than <b>a</b> self-obsessed young <b>loner.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hammond {{struck his}} contemporaries as a sad figure, <b>a</b> <b>loner</b> with few friends in cricket. He rarely {{encouraged}} young players or gave out praise. He liked {{to mix with}} middle-class people, spending money he did not really have, leading to accusations of snobbery. Team-mates regarded him as moody, private and uncommunicative. Often silent {{in the company of}} others, he could be arrogant and unfriendly. Charlie Barnett and Charles Dacre, two of his Gloucestershire team-mates, came almost to hate him. Dacre often played in a reckless way of which Hammond disapproved; Hammond, in turn, may have been jealous of him. Hammond once tried hard to injure Dacre by bowling fast at him while he was wicketkeeper. Barnett began as a close friend but fell out over Hammond's treatment of his first wife and later his refusal to play in Barnett's benefit match. Other players who were involved in disputes with Hammond included Denis Compton, whose cavalier approach Hammond disliked, and Learie Constantine, who believed Hammond insulted him in the West Indies in 1925, although the two later made peace. Hammond's ultimate rivalry was with Bradman, who overshadowed him throughout his career, and with whom he developed an increasing obsession. It was not enough for Hammond to be the second-best batsman in the world, and he disliked the constant comparisons made between them in Bradman's favour. He felt not only that he had to do well, but also that he had to score more than Bradman.|$|E

25|$|Bittaker was {{released}} from the California Men's Colony on October 15, 1978; he returned to Los Angeles and found work as a skilled machinist.

50|$|Hammond {{takes you}} through a {{personal}} look into a human story through the Go-Go music culture, {{the people who}} inspired him, the ones who enabled him, the ones who tried to control him, the ones who changed him, the one’s who gave him opportunities, {{and the ones who}} tried to take them away. Take Me Out To The Go-Go is a whole story: <b>a</b> <b>loner’s</b> story, <b>a</b> musician’s story, an actor’s story, a writer’s story, a recovery story, a love story, a success story, a failure story, a visionary story, and a re-construction story.|$|R

Though not diagnosed, he also considers himself to be on the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. He spoke about his experiences as an autistic person in his keynote address at the 19th Annual Minnesota Autism Conference in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Russell {{was never}} seen {{as much of}} a team player, a {{perception}} reinforced by his being <b>a</b> <b>loner</b> off the field, his painting, and his protective attitude to his family life. None of his Gloucestershire team-mates were ever invited to his home, and he claimed if they ever asked he would be more than willing if they agreed to be blindfolded; the builders who constructed the extension to it were subjected to the same treatment.|$|E
