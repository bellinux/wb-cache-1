In it, Jackson complains about the handcuffs and is politely told by an officer how he can relieve the discomfort. He is heard to be whistling, and he asks for the air conditioning to be turned on (it was). Police allege these tapes prove that Jackson's claims are false; Jackson, along with his family, claim that what is being shown is merely a biased portion of what actually occurred. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer ordered an independent investigation into Jackson's complaints. After interviewing 163 witnesses, the complaints were rejected in August 2004.|$|E

40|$|This follows {{an earlier}} study of the same data set, which, through its findings, {{presented}} new questions that are investigated in this study. Both studies used a prospective controlled design, wherein women receiving genetic counseling for breast cancer risk were randomized into two groups. Subjects receiving <b>an</b> <b>audiotaped</b> recording of their genetic consultation (tape group) were compared to subjects who also had a genetic consultation but did not receive <b>an</b> <b>audiotaped</b> recording of it (no-tape group). Participants were drawn from attendees at the genetic clinics of two London hospitals and included 115 women with {{a family history of}} breast cancer. Cancer worry and psychological distress were assessed before genetic consultation (baseline), and at one- and six-month follow-ups by post. Objective risk was estimated by the geneticist during the consultation, and subjective risk was assessed at one month follow-up. The goals of the current study were to investigate relationships between cancer worry, psychological distress, and recall of genetic risk for breast cancer in a sample of women receiving genetic counseling for breast cancer risk, and to investigate the role sociodemographic variables on cancer worry, psychological distress, or risk recall for these women. Results for this sample of women with a family history of breast cancer found that there were consistent relationships between cancer worry, psychological distress, objective risk, and subjective risk before and after genetic consultation. This suggests that women=s psychological responses are appropriate to their level of cancer risk. There were no differences found between the tape and no-tape groups for objective or subjective risk, or for nearness of recall accuracy or degree of under-/over-estimation. Provision of <b>an</b> <b>audiotaped</b> recording of the genetic consultation did not appear to enhance recall of risk information. The role of sociodemographic variables on the psychological and risk variables assessed in this study was very minor. Age was mildly correlated with cancer worry, and employment was predictive of cancer worry only at baseline...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{appropriate}} questioning techniques is {{an important}} part of mathematics teaching and assessment. This study examined the questioning strategies used by 48 preservice teachers during one-on-one diagnostic mathematics interviews with children. Each participant conducted <b>an</b> <b>audiotaped</b> interview with one child, followed by an analysis and reflection of the interview. Data we reanalyzed to develop general categories of questions used by the preservice teachers. These categories included: 1) check listing, 2) instructing rather than assessing, and 3) probing and follow-up questions. The analyses and reflections completed by preservice teachers indicated that using the diagnostic interview format allowed them to recognize and reflect on effective questioning techniques. Through an examination of these categories of questions, we offer suggestions for teaching the skill of mathematics questioning in preservice teacher education courses...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To examine {{associations}} between menstrual cycle phase, negative mood, sexual risk recog-nition deficits (assessed via an analogue risk vignette), and in vivo emotion dysregulation. Partici-pants: Participants were 714 college women recruited between February 2007 and December 2009. Methods: Participants {{were randomly assigned}} to a negative or neutral mood induction and in-structed to identify sexual risk during <b>an</b> <b>audiotaped</b> sexual coercion vignette. Participants reported menstrual cycle information, in vivo emotional nonacceptance, and attention during the vignette. Results: In the negative mood condition, ovulation was associated with longer risk recognition laten-cies relative to the luteal and follicular phases of the menstrual cycle. Increased in vivo emotional nonacceptance and decreased attention to the vignette mediated {{associations between}} ovulation and risk recognition deficits in the negative mood condition. Conclusions: Sexual assault risk reduction programs could provide psychoeducation regarding negative mood during ovulation and empha-size emotional acceptance and attention to external stimuli when distressed...|$|R
