40|$|As new equipment, {{the channel}} wheel fresh <b>air</b> <b>ventilator</b> has become {{increasingly}} popular in recent years. However, when such equipment is operated under low ambient temperature in the freezing area in winter, the formation of frost on the outdoor waste air surface becomes problematic, leading to the degradation of the channel wheel fresh air ventilator's performance or even the shutdown of equipment. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have a detailed investigation on the operational characteristics of the channel wheel fresh <b>air</b> <b>ventilator</b> under frosting in order to guide its application. This paper first reports on the development of a detailed model for the channel wheel heat exchanger, which is the core part of the channel wheel fresh <b>air</b> <b>ventilator</b> under frosting conditions. The model developed, first seen in open literature, consists of a frosting sub-model and a channel wheel heat exchanger sub-model. This is followed by reporting an evaluation of the operational characteristics of a frosted channel wheel heat exchanger under different ambient conditions using the model developed. These include frost formation {{on the surface of the}} channel wheel heat exchanger, and impacts on the operational performance of the channel wheel fresh <b>air</b> <b>ventilator.</b> Furthermore, the interval of defrosting is obtained, which provides the basis for the adoption of effective defrosting measures, and thus increasing the channel wheel fresh air ventilator's energy efficiency and operating reliability...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: No clear {{recommendation}} exists concerning humidification during non-invasive ventilation (NIV) {{and high}} flow CPAP, and few hygrometric data are available. METHODS: We measured hygrometry during NIV delivered to healthy subjects with different humidification strategies: heated humidifier (HH), heat and moisture exchanger, (HME) or no humidification (NoH). For each strategy, a turbine and an ICU ventilator were used with different FiO(2) settings, {{with and without}} leaks. During CPAP, two different HH and NoH were tested. Inspired gases hygrometry was measured, and comfort was assessed. On a bench, we also assessed the impact of ambient <b>air</b> temperature, <b>ventilator</b> temperature and minute ventilation on HH performances (with NIV settings). RESULTS: During NIV, with NoH, gas humidity was very low when an ICU ventilator was used (5 mgH(2) O/l), but equivalent to ambient air hygrometry with a turbine ventilator at minimal FiO(2) (13 mgH(2) O/l). HME and HH had comparable performances (25 - 30 mgH(2) O/l), but HME's effectiveness was reduced with leaks (15 mgH(2) O/l). HH performances were reduced by elevated ambient <b>air</b> and <b>ventilator</b> output temperatures. During CPAP, dry gases (5 mgH(2) O/l) were less tolerated than humidified gases. Gases humidified at 15 or 30 mgH(2) O/l were equally tolerated. CONCLUSION: This study provides data {{on the level of}} humidity delivered with different humidification strategies during NIV and CPAP. HH and HME provide gas with the highest water content.

30|$|From LSCs’ perspective, {{there are}} three major {{categories}} of the food supply chain according to temperature control and monitoring: room temperature food, cold food, and frozen food. Each type of food has different requirements in the food supply chain. Room temperature food includes water, biscuits, rice and flour in addition to foods that respond slowly to temperature changes. The temperature for these foods must be maintained at 18  °C. Cold food includes vegetables and fruit and other items that are highly responsive to temperature changes. The temperature for such foods must be maintained at 0  °C to + 7  °C. Frozen food includes meat and fish in addition to foods that respond slowly to temperature changes. The temperature for such foods must be maintained at − 18  °C. In the transportation of frozen food, the fresh <b>air</b> <b>ventilators</b> must always be closed and the humidity indicator {{should be in the}} OFF position. Temperature is an important parameter in food safety and quality (Montanari, 2008; Ovca and Jevsnik, 2009). During the logistics process, any change in time-distance or temperature may create spoilage or loss of flavour. Thus, temperature needs to be continuously and carefully controlled and monitored at each stage of the food supply chain with adequate control systems, correct placement of temperature sensors and efficient insulation. All perishable products are required to be delivered by a refrigerated loading dock to minimise the increase in product temperature during loading and unloading and to avoid the entrance of moist or warm ambient air.|$|R

We tested the hypothesis that inlet chamber temperature, influenced by ambient <b>air</b> and <b>ventilator</b> output temperatures, may affect humidifier performance, as assessed by hygrometry. Hygrometry was measured with three different humidifiers under several conditions, varying ambient air temperatures (high, 28 - 30 degrees C; and normal, 22 - 24 degrees C), ventilators with different gas temperatures, and two VE levels. Clinical measurements were performed to confirm bench measurements. Humidifier performance was strongly correlated with inlet chamber temperature in both the bench (p < 0. 0001, r 2 = 0. 93) and the clinical study. With unfavorable conditions, absolute humidity of inspired gas was much lower than recommended (approximately 20 mg H 2 O/L). Performance was improved by specific settings or new compensatory algorithms. Hygrometry could be evaluated from condensation on the wall chamber only when ambient air temperature was normal but not with high air temperature. An increase in inlet chamber temperature induced by high ambient temperature markedly reduces the performance of heated-wire humidifiers, leading to a risk of endotracheal tube occlusion. Such systems should be avoided in these conditions unless automatic compensation algorithms are used...|$|R

Detecting airborne viruses in these patients is technically challenging as the concentration of viruses in the inspired/expired air is usually very low; a substantially large volume of air per sample is required for detection.

The ventilator filters have a large volume of inspired/expired air circulating through them each day, thus making them an ideal medium for sampling airborne viruses. Here, we report the findings of a feasibility study using ventilator filters to detect airborne viruses in mechanically ventilated patients admitted to an intensive care unit.|$|R

The source of these infections is unknown. Methods Retrospective study of all Canadian {{soldiers who were}} injured in Afghanistan and who required mechanical ventilation from January 1 2006 to September 1 2006. Patients who developed A. baumannii ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) were identified. All A. baumannii isolates were retrieved for study patients and compared with A. baumannii isolates from environmental sources from the Kandahar military hospital using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results During the study period, six Canadian Forces (CF) soldiers were injured in Afghanistan, required mechanical ventilation and were repatriated to Canadian hospitals. Four of these patients developed A. baumannii VAP. A. baumannii was also isolated from one environmental source in Kandahar – a <b>ventilator</b> <b>air</b> intake filter.

DESIGN: In vitro, laboratory study. SETTING: Research laboratory of a university hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Using albuterol as a marker, six jet nebulizers (Microneb NA 420, Sidestream, Acorn II, Cirrus, Upmist, Micro Mist) were tested in four nebulization modes in a bench model mimicking the ventilatory pattern of a 10 -kg infant (Galileo ventilator, Hamilton Medical). The amounts of albuterol deposited on the inspiratory filters {{at the end of the}} endotracheal tube were determined, as well as the pressure, flow profiles, and particle size distribution of the jet nebulizers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pooling the data of the six jet nebulizer brands (n = 30) indicated that intermittent nebulization during the expiratory phase was more efficient (6. 5 +/- 2. 5 % of the initial dose, p <. 001) than intermittent nebulization during the inspiratory phase (1. 9 +/- 1. 2 %) and continuous nebulization with <b>air</b> from the <b>ventilator</b> (4. 0 +/- 1. 5 %) or from an external source (4. 2 +/- 1. 4 %).

Their prevalence in hospital environment especially in wards having immunocompromised patients may pose {{a risk to}} this group of susceptible population as they may cause disease themselves or may carry pathogens inside them. No study from India has performed such surveillance. Objective: To evaluate extent of FLA contamination in water sources of bone marrow transplant (BMT) intensive care unit (ICU), transplant ICU, haemodialysis unit and high dependency unit in a tertiary care hospital in India. Materials and Methods: A total of hundred samples including fifty each of tap water samples and swabs from mouth of taps used for drinking, bathing and hand washing purposes in these units were collected according to standard procedure. Samples were inoculated onto non-nutrient agar plates at room temperature followed by morphological confirmation. Molecular identification including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing was performed in culture positive samples. Results: Four tap water samples and ten swab samples showed growth of trophozoites and cyst formation. Morphologically, four amoebae resembled Acanthamoeba spp. which was further confirmed by PCR and sequencing showed them to be of T 3 and T 4 genotypes. Conclusion: The presence of these FLA in hospital water sources emphasises the urgent need of implementing effective preventive measures. Further studies are required to estimate the true prevalence of FLA in Indian hospitals by taking larger number of samples...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{mortality and}} morbidity at {{discharge from the}} hospital of a large population-based cohort of infants who were born at < 26 weeks' gestation. Methods. Perinatal data were collected on extremely preterm infants who were alive {{at the onset of}} labor and born between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2000, in all 19 Belgian perinatal centers. Results. A total of 525 infants were recorded. Life-supporting care was provided to 322 liveborn infants, 303 of whom were admitted for intensive care. The overall survival rate of liveborn infants was 54 %. Of the infants who were alive at the age of 7 days, 82 % survived to discharge. Vaginal delivery, shorter gestation, <b>air</b> leak, longer <b>ventilator</b> dependence, and higher initial oxygen need all were independently associated with death; gender, plurality, and surfactant therapy were not. Among the 175 survivors, 63 % had 1 or more of the 3 major adverse outcome variables at the time of discharge (serious neuromorbidity, chronic lung disease at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age, or treated retinopathy of prematurity). The chance of survival free from serious neonatal morbidity at the time of hospital discharge was < 15 % (21 of 158) for the admitted infants with a gestation < 26 weeks. Conclusions. If for the time being prolongation of pregnancy is unsuccessful, then outcome perspectives should be discussed and treatment options including nonintervention explicitly be made available to parents of infants of < 26 weeks' gestation within the limits of medical feasibility and appropriateness.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the changes of lying time and other behaviour manifestations of dairy cows during usage of different cooling systems of animals. Alternative hypothesis was presumption, that the lying time of cows in lying cubicles with applied two different cooling systems are indifferent. The sprinkling system was used to animal cooling in group S in summer time. In group SV was disposable sprinkling system and diagonally rotated ventilators. Activities and the rest of animals were evaluated in 10 minute intervals using a camera system for 24 hours. Data obtained was tested by nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA and multiple comparison test for detecting of significant differences in the behaviors between groups of cows. There was found positive effect of animal enhanced cooling using sprinkling system with increased <b>air</b> movement by <b>ventilators.</b> It reflected in significant prolongation of whole lying time and shortening of time, when animals were standing. It resulted from final values of investigated behaviour manifestations of dairy cattle within 24 hour period that animals in group SV with sprinklers and ventilators lay in stalls longer than in group S with sprinklers, but without ventilators (10. 76 h*d- 1 *cow- 1 vs. 7. 71 h*d- 1 *cow- 1, P 0. 001). The total time spent by lying in stalls and in alley represented in group SV 11. 31 h*d- 1 *cow- 1, and in group S 10. 22 h*d- 1 *cow- 1. Animals, from group S without ventilators, which were less cooled, were significantly more lying down in alleys (2. 52 h*d- 1 *cow- 1 vs. 0. 56 h*d- 1 *cow- 1, P 0. 001) ...|$|R
