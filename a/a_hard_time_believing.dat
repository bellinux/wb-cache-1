5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E

Usually interviewed by Mercer's character J.B.

25|$|Judith finally convinces Godolphin {{to bring}} her to Yzordderrex {{with the threat of}} leaving him. They head to the retreat where they {{originally}} met, but as Godolphin starts their transference to the second dominion, Dowd comes and interferes and ends up going through to Yzordderrex with Judith instead of Godolphin. They arrive in the house of Peccable, a merchant friend of Godolphin's. Arriving in Yzordderrex, Gentle, Pie and Huzzah encounter an entourage containing the Autarch's Queen, Quaisoir, and Gentle is shocked to find out that her appearance is identical to that of Judith's. With the rebellions in Yzordderrex getting out of control, she flees and Gentle becomes convinced that he has to head to the palace to find out if it's really her. Judith meanwhile has another out of body experience where she witnesses Quaisoir after a fight with the Autarch, who is upset with her becoming enamored with religion, and Father Athanasius, the leader of the 'Dearther' group of rebels (and the man who wed Gentle and Pie at the Cradle). Gentle, Pie and Huzzah arrive at the Eurhetemec Kesperate(district) that Pie is from and find it mostly deserted except for four people, who have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> that they're not the enemy. Pie tells Gentle and Huzzah to meet him later at a cafe they were eating at. Although Huzzah and Gentle return there, with the chaos going on they leave and encounter a group that includes a Nullianac that kidnaps Huzzah. Gentle chases after them and eventually defeats the Nullianac, but not before it kills Huzzah.|$|E

40|$|This short study aims to {{consider}} how educators might help students to develop metacognitive skills in their writing. Many studies demonstrate that metacognitive skills – in other words, {{the ability to think}} about thinking – are strongly correlated with academic success. Yet often, such studies understand metacognition reductively, as a student’s general awareness of the overall quality of their work, as reflected by a grade. How can educators help students to develop metacognitive awareness of their writing process in their own terms, by paying attention to the singularities and subtleties of their thought, and their creative process as writers? A structured interview of rst year Goldsmiths BA (Hons) Fine Art students aimed to identify what factors impacted how, and whether, students were able to develop student-centered metacognitive parameters to understand their writing processes. The interview revealed how excellent writers make the essay material their own, trust their instincts as to what is important, and consciously enter into dialogue with other thinkers as they engage in the writing process. It also revealed that students’ self-assessment of their strengths and weaknesses in academic writing was coloured by their self-perception as classed subjects. In other words, students who may have had <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> that they belonged in higher education, perhaps due to their self-perceived class position, tended to underestimate their writing abilities; and this had the potential to hinder their writing experience. These findings support an approach to teaching metacognitive writing skills that emphasizes how a student might understand their writing process according to the experience of immersing oneself in – and contributing to – a rich dialogue of ideas and debates that extends beyond their own thinking...|$|R
500|$|On 29 September the new {{flag was}} {{published}} in the People's Daily, so the design could be copied by other local authorities. The flag was officially unveiled in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on 1 October 1949, the formal announcement of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. The first flag flown over Tiananmen Square was sewn together by Zhao Wenrei (...) , a seamstress who finished the task around 1 pm on 30 September. Zeng had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> that his design was picked, due to the missing hammer and sickle from the giant star.

Usher peaked at number twenty-five on the Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart and {{was accompanied by}} three singles: [...] "Can U Get wit It", [...] "Think of You", and [...] "The Many Ways". The album has sold over 500,000 copies, to date. The album received backlash because Usher was singing about sex which the public had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> {{coming out of a}} 14-year-old's mouth. Again the LaFace had their reservations about signing Usher because the album wasn't as successful as they anticipated. At this time Jonetta Patton, Usher's mother took control of his career and put him in more talent shows the summer of 1995 building Usher a larger fan base and ultimately putting more confidence in L.A. Reid.|$|E

40|$|Personally, I {{have had}} <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> intellectually <b>believing</b> {{that there is}} a God. I have had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> {{understanding}} religion or philosophy as somehow approaching the true reality of the universe, somehow getting it right, finding objective truth. It seems to me that any claim about how things are is inherently colored by our human methods, desires, dreams, fears, etc. I understand God less as a metaphysical possibly-existent entity, and more as an embodiment of those dreams, desires, and fears, as a psychological barometer. And so I agree with Nietzsche, contra Plato and Kant, that any hope of actual transcendence of our human contingency and practice, to even point towards the thing-in-itself as part of a separate suprahuman realm, seems flawed. However, I've found this less of a reason to abandon the striving, and more of a reason to examine it, and respect it. I've found this more of a reason to examine the rational behind the very endeavor. After all, as we emphasize a pragmatic focus on human practice, {{it seems to me we}} must't disregard this human practice, the very desire for transcendence of that practice...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{most of the}} {{criticism}} from LDS church members in support of Nibley centered around Beck's allegations of sexual abuse, {{a substantial portion of}} the book involves a discussion of the LDS Church and its policies. BYU professor Robert L. Millet criticized Beck's portrayals of Nibley as [...] "nonsense," [...] "ludicrous," [...] and [...] "paranoia," [...] saying that she [...] "seems to be a magnet for improbable happenings" [...] and [...] "equates weird anomalies in Mormon culture with the norm." [...] Kent P. Jackson describes her description of Mormon culture as [...] "outlandish", saying [...] "Beck’s depictions of the church and BYU are so far removed from reality that it is clear that from the start she ruled out BYU faculty, other academics, and informed Latter-day Saints as potential readers. There was obviously no attempt made to establish credibility with those groups. ... this book was written for those who like stories about people victimized by powerful men and powerful institutions. Yet those who really know what she has written about will have <b>a</b> very <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> <b>believing</b> anything in the book." [...] He proceeds to list a number of claims Beck made in the book which he asserts can be verified as false with readily available public information. Dan Wotherspoon, editor of the independent Mormon magazine Sunstone, similarly states [...] "She says a lot of things in there that anyone who lives in Utah will just know is wrong." ...|$|R

He does not tell any of his new found friends about his background because he is afraid they will not accept him. In a flashback, it is shown that his Runaways teammates were all killed by Ultron and that Victor had stored digital versions of them in his memory banks, but these files seem to be corrupted since they seem to telling him that he needs to become more machine and less human. The Ultron Sentinels find the hideout and start killing some of the kids that Victor had saved. Victor decides to fight the Ultron Sentinels while determining that if this is the end, he will go down fighting.|$|R
