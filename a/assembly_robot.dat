40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} {{the assembly of}} a three dimensional (3 D) structure {{by a team of}} heterogeneous robots capable of online sensing and error correction during the assembly process. The automated assembly problem is posed as a general 3 D tiling problem where the assembly components/tiles consist of various shapes and sizes. For a desired 3 D structure, we first compute the partition of the assembly strategy into Nc sub-components that can be executed in parallel by a team of Nc <b>assembly</b> <b>robots.</b> To enable online error detection and correction during the <b>assembly</b> pro-cess, mobile <b>robots</b> equipped with visual depth sensors are tasked to scan, identify, and track the state of the structure. The objective is to enable online detection of missing assembly components and reassignment of these components to the team of <b>assembly</b> <b>robots.</b> We present the development of the planning, sensing, and con-trol strategies employed and report on the experimental validation of these strategies using our multi-robot testbed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to minimize the expected present worth of the production costs incurred over the opera-tional life of a robotic assembly system that is integrated with an Automatic Storage/Retrieval System (AS/RS).

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} a {{distributed}} mobile robot platform to deliver parts around a model construction site. The platform's robots, specialized into delivery <b>robots</b> and <b>assembly</b> <b>robots,</b> use a distributed coverage algorithm {{to determine where}} parts should be delivered. The robots consist of a mobility platform (iRobot iCreate), a manipulation platform (Crustcrawler arm), and an IR communication system to enable recognition and grasping of parts. To control the robot hardware, we implemented software in Java. The delivery robots use IR communication to find parts at a supply station. After communicating over UDP multicast with <b>assembly</b> station <b>robots,</b> the delivery robots deliver parts to the <b>assembly</b> <b>robots</b> based on their coverage control algorithm. To evaluate the algorithm, we constructed a hardware system of 4 robots, connected to a VICON motion capture system for localization. We discuss the results of successful hardware and software testing of {{the system as a}} method of delivering parts around a construction site, and we discuss future plans to use the platform to assemble parts once delivered. by Adrienne Bolger.

40|$|Purpose – Automated robotic {{assembly}} on {{a moving}} workpiece, {{referred to as}} assembly in motion, demands that an <b>assembly</b> <b>robot</b> is synchronised in all degrees of freedom to the moving workpiece, on which assembly parts are installed. Currently, this requirement cannot be met {{due to the lack}} of robust estimation of 3 D positions and the trajectory of the moving workpiece. The purpose of this paper is to develop a camera system that measures the 3 D trajectory of the moving workpiece for robotic assembly in motion. Design/methodology/approach – For the trajectory estimation, an assembly robot-guided, monocular camera system is developed. The motion trajectory of a workpiece is estimated, as the trajectory is considered as a linear combination of trajectory bases, such as discrete cosine transform bases. Findings – The developed camera system for trajectory estimation is tested within the robotic assembly of a cylinder block in motion. The experimental results show that the proposed method is able to reconstruct arbitrary trajectories of an assembly point on a workpiece moving in 3 D space. Research limitations/implications – With the developed technology, a point trajectory can be recovered offline only after all measurement images are acquired. For practical assembly tasks in real production, this method should be extended to determine the trajectory online during the motion of a workpiece. Practical implications – For practical, robotic assembly in motion, such as assembling tires, wheels and windscreens on conveyed vehicle bodies, the developed technology can be used for positioning a moving workpiece, which is in the distant field of an <b>assembly</b> <b>robot.</b> Originality/value – Besides laser trackers, indoor global positioning systems and stereo cameras, this paper provides a solution of trajectory estimation by using a monocular camera system...|$|E
