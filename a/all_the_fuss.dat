5|$|Bodyline {{continued}} to be bowled occasionally in the 1933 English season—most notably by Nottinghamshire, who had Carr, Voce and Larwood in their team. This gave the English crowds their first chance to see what <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> was about. Ken Farnes, the Cambridge University fast bowler, also bowled it in the University Match, hitting a few Oxford batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E

500|$|When {{the news}} of Selena's death broke, some Americans asked who she was {{and said she was}} [...] "not that important", {{suggesting}} Latinos [...] "get over it". Author and Texas Monthly magazine contributor Joe Nick Patoski said Anglo-Americans and Mexican-Americans were divided in their reactions to Selena's death. Patoski said that Anglo-Americans [...] "didn't understand what <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> was about". This was echoed in the Corpus Christi Caller Times, where they found racial divisions in the reactions to Selena's death. Educators who had observed the reactions said, [...] "the emergence of an icon in a minority culture can be both bewildering and threatening to Anglos". Melicent Rothschild said some Americans often do not understand [...] "the cultural role models of groups who have felt discriminated against". Following Selena's death, cultural confrontations were reported. some vocally opposed any memorials to the singer, feeling they would be costed to taxpayers. Others complained to newspapers about the media interest in Selena's death. Many media outlets received negative comments from people around the country. some were baffled that the Rossler massacre, which occurred around the same time of Selena's death, did not generate the same amount of media exposure. Mayor Mary Rhodes said many of the people complaining about the media exposure Selena was receiving had never heard of her.|$|E

The game was particularly praised for retaining the popular RTS gameplay from StarCraft, while introducing new features and improved storytelling. GamesRadar felt that [...] "in many ways, StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty feels like StarCraft 2.0 – and that’s a good thing", stating that it [...] "delivers on all fronts". NZGamer.com said {{the game was}} [...] "the best RTS game released in years {{and one of the}} best games on PC". In relation to its story, GameTrailers stated, [...] "If there's anything immediately apparent from Wings of Liberty's story, it's that the series' narrative structure has evolved well beyond the original's sparse between-sortie intermissions," [...] calling it [...] "an epic and entertainingly told yarn", while Eurogamer criticized the dialogue as being [...] "flat" [...] and the characters as being [...] "either clichéd, banal or both". Giant Bomb echoed this view while also noting the Hyperion portion between missions, finding it to have [...] "more depth of character, more believable pathos, more surprise twists—than I honestly expected out of the story". IGN however noted that [...] "no doubt franchise fans will eat it up, but newcomers may be wondering what <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> is about while going through the early missions that lack the kind of urgency you would hope when the fate of civilization is in peril." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{past couple}} of decades have {{witnessed}} a remarkable burst of philosophical energy and talent devoted to virtue ethical approaches to Confucianism, including several books, articles, and even high-profile workshops and conferences that make connections between Confucianism and either virtue ethics as such or moral philosophers widely regarded as virtue ethicists. Those who do not work in the combination of Chinese philosophy and ethics may wonder what <b>all</b> of <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> is about. Others may be {{more familiar with the}} issues but have doubts about the fruitfulness of this line of inquiry. It is therefore worth asking whether a constructive engagement between Confucianism and virtue ethics is worth turning into a significant, multi-generational research agenda. Most answers to this question will fall somewhere between two poles. At one end is the view that the line of inquiry has run its course, if ever there were a course to run in the first place; at the opposite end is the view that were only just getting started. And then there is a wide range of more moderate views falling between these two positions. Far from having exhausted the potential of virtue ethical approaches to Confucianism, I think we are standing on a philosophical gold mine that weve only just begun to tap. In what follows I would like to explain briefly why I take this to be the case...|$|R

500|$|Thunderball was {{generally}} well {{received by the}} critics; Francis Iles, writing in The Guardian wrote that it [...] "is a good, tough, straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines." [...] Referring to the negative publicity that surrounded Dr. No—in particular the article by Paul Johnson in the New Statesman entitled, [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism"—Iles was left [...] "wondering what <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> is about", noting that [...] "there is no more sadism nor sex than is expected of {{the author of this}} kind of thriller". Peter Duval Smith, writing in Financial Times, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming's work against negative criticism, also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review: [...] "one should not make a cult of Fleming's novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing." [...] Duval Smith thought that Thunderball was [...] "an exciting story is skilfully told", with [...] "a romantic sub-plot... and the denouement involves great events" [...] He also considered it [...] "the best written since Diamonds Are Forever, four books back. It has pace and humour and style. The violence is not so unrelenting as usual: an improvement, I think." [...] He also expressed concern for the central character, saying [...] "I was glad to see him [...] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up. He was having bad hangovers on half-a-bottle of whisky a day, which I don't call a lot, unless he wasn't eating properly." ...|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuss</b> is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E

That doesn't make it the best, though: it doesn't take risks - not by Albarn’s standards, anyway - and in the most literal sense it's not all that exciting. But if its prettiness is conventional, if it gives us what we expect, then you know, you’ll listen to this a damn sight more than the Rocket Juice & the Moon album. Damon Albarn is at his best exploring pastures new, but that doesn't make this wordy wise stocktake of a record any less of a pleasure." [...] He also praised the album's track [...] "You and Me" [...] saying: [...] "Much {{has been made of}} how personal the record is, but there's nothing searing as Blur's rawest moments - the abiding sensation is one of intense intimacy. Shuffling seven-minute centrepiece [...] "You and Me" [...] contains a sleepy allusion to his past heroin use ("Tin foil and a lighter, the ship across"), but really it's just an honest allusion from a man done with being coy - it's not a song 'about' heroin like [...] "Beetlebum" [...] was, and for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> media <b>fuss</b> <b>the</b> line has generated, nobody actually listening to the song is likely to be shocked." ...|$|R
