5|$|The reactivities of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. This {{is the result of}} a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and <b>atomisation</b> energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The <b>atomisation</b> energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the <b>atomisation</b> and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} techniques for <b>atomisation</b> of molten metals, {{many of which are}} derived from the powder metallurgy industry and have been extensively reviewed elsewhere. There are two major <b>atomisation</b> techniques used in spray forming: centrifugal <b>atomisation</b> for the manufacture of near net shape rings and gas <b>atomisation</b> for the manufacture of billets, tube and strip.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of melt break up and <b>atomisation</b> have been extensively researched, showing that <b>atomisation</b> typically consists of 3 steps: (1) primary break {{up of the}} melt stream; (2) molten droplets and ligaments undergo secondary disintegration; (3) particles cool and solidify. Theoretical analysis of the <b>atomisation</b> process to predict droplet size has yielded models providing only moderate agreement with experimental data.|$|E
50|$|Centrifugal <b>atomisation</b> {{involves}} pouring {{molten metal}} at relatively low flow rates (0.1- 2 kg/min) onto a spinning plate, dish or disc, whereby the rotation speed {{is sufficient to}} create high centrifugal forces at the periphery and overcome surface tension and viscous forces so the melt is fragmented into droplets. Droplet diameters produced by centrifugal <b>atomisation</b> are dependent primarily on the rotation speed, (up to 20,000 rpm) and are typically in the range 20-1000 µm with cooling rates of the order 104 Ks−1. Centrifugal <b>atomisation</b> is generally conducted under an inert atmosphere of Ar or N2 to prevent oxidation of the fine droplets or can be operated under vacuum.|$|E

50|$|The {{enthalpy}} of atomization (also <b>atomisation</b> in British spelling) is the enthalpy {{change that}} accompanies the total separation of all atoms in a chemical substance (either a chemical element or a chemical compound).

50|$|Despite {{this history}} of a close {{relationship}} between art and anarchism some anarchist, writers, such as Peter Kropotkin and Herbert Read have argued that in an anarchist society {{the role of the}} artist would disappear completely as all human activity would become in itself artistic.

50|$|When cheaper {{crude oil}} became available, the {{locomotives}} were again modified {{to allow them}} to burn this heavier product.

As the crisis passed, the oil burning locomotives were withdrawn as they were still four times more expensive to run than the coal-fired ones.
