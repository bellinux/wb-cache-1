25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (HP) turbine rotor inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size. They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty <b>air</b> <b>passage</b> where the blades and vanes had once been. Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN). The increase in core size and overall pressure ratio raised the core flow, decreasing the bypass ratio to 4.26.|$|E
2500|$|The CF6-80 {{series are}} {{high-bypass}} turbofan engines with a thrust range of 48,000 to 75,000lb (214 to 334kN). [...] Although the HP compressor still has 14 stages, GE did {{take the opportunity}} to tidy-up the design, by removing the empty <b>air</b> <b>passage</b> at compressor exit.|$|E
40|$|A power {{generating}} station having a generator driven by solar heat assisted ambient wind is described. A first plurality of radially extendng <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> direct ambient wind to a radial flow wind turbine disposed in a centrally located opening in a substantially disc-shaped structure. A solar radiation collecting surface having black bodies is disposed above the fist plurality of <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> and {{in communication with}} a second plurality of radial <b>air</b> <b>passages.</b> A cover plate enclosing the second plurality of radial <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> is transparent so as to permit solar radiation to effectively reach the black bodies. The second plurality of <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> direct ambient wind and thermal updrafts generated by the black bodies to an axial flow turbine. The rotating shaft of the turbines drive the generator. The solar and wind drien power generating system operates in electrical cogeneration mode with a fuel powered prime mover...|$|R
30|$|The {{condition}} of exclusive oral breathing is rare; alternation between OB and NB {{is much more}} common. The boundary between the <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> for OB and NB is small, and sometimes, even though the nasal <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> are of normal size, nasal breathing is replaced by oral [3, 16].|$|R

2500|$|A {{horse collar}} is oval rather than {{circular}} {{and it is}} by design not very flexible. It is a padded appliance that conforms well {{to the shape of}} the horse's body. It is constructed so that at all points of contact with the body of the horse it avoids the <b>air</b> <b>passage.</b> By protecting the airway of the horse it became possible for the animal to use its full force to pull a [...] load.|$|E
2500|$|The laws on migrant {{smuggling}} ban helping migrants to pass any national border if the migrants are without a visa or other permission to enter. This has caused many airlines {{to check for}} visas and refuse passage to migrants without visas, including through international flights inside the Schengen Area. After being refused <b>air</b> <b>passage,</b> many migrants then attempt to travel overland to their destination country. According to a study carried out for the European Parliament, [...] "penalties for carriers, who assume some of the control duties of the European police services, either block asylum-seekers far from Europe's borders or force them to pay more and take greater risks to travel illegally".|$|E
60|$|It was {{the sight}} of these gratings, {{and the thought of}} the dismal cells below, which had {{increased}} the aversion which Malchus had felt as a boy to enter the bloodstained temple, little as he had dreamed that the day would come when he himself would be lying a prisoner in one of them. He knew that it was useless for him to attempt by shouting to inform his friends in the city of his presence there. The narrowness of the <b>air</b> <b>passage</b> and the closeness of the grating above deadened and confused the voice, unless to a person standing immediately above the opening, and as the visitors to the temple carefully avoided the vicinity of the gratings, it would be but a waste of breath to attempt to call their attention.|$|E
50|$|The upwards wiping of {{the nose}} and {{nostrils}} allows for running mucus to be wiped off quickly and easily. Also, as the nostrils are being pushed up the <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> through the nose become temporarily propped open. This is especially beneficial if the <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> are swollen and the nostrils are itchy due to irritations such as allergic rhinitis.|$|R

50|$|The cassotto design {{requires}} a sophisticated treble mechanism where each key must {{open and close}} <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> not only for reeds mounted at the traditional angle, but also for <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> at a relative 45Â° angle (for the cassotto reeds). To do this properly, each rod and pad must be positioned precisely in relation to its perpendicular counterpart. Because of the considerable extra time required for the cassotto's construction and adjustment, cassotto accordions cost considerably more than similar non-cassotto models.|$|R

25|$|EIPH {{occurs when}} blood enters the <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> of a horse's lung, due to {{fractured}} capillaries. A variety of causes have been proposed, but EIPH {{is most likely}} a multi-factorial condition, involving airway, vascular, inflammatory, blood, cardiac, locomotory, and remodelling components.|$|R
40|$|A {{tracheal}} or bronchial rupture is {{a severe}} lesion which is frequently overlooked {{during the initial}} post-traumatic period. The best results {{in the treatment of}} such ruptures are obtained by the earliest possible restoration of the continuity of the <b>air</b> <b>passages.</b> Early reconstruction, however, depends on early diagnosis. The diagnosis is established with certainty by means of bronchoscopy. The symptom of `deep cervical emphysema' is presented as an aid in selecting, from the many accident victims with chest injuries, those who should be submitted to bronchoscopy for immediate identification of any rupture of the major <b>air</b> <b>passages.</b> This deep cervical emphysema is readily recognizable on an antero-posterior radiograph of the cervical region and upper mediastinum...|$|R

50|$|The tunnel has no blast relief ducts, due to {{its lack}} of curves and {{relatively}} short length, allowing good <b>air</b> <b>passage.</b> Regular niches were cut into the wall to allow maintenance on the permanent way during running hours. Finally, both portals were capped with stone and it covers a total length of 882 yards.|$|E

50|$|Many VAF sensors have an air-fuel {{adjustment}} screw, {{which opens}} or closes a small <b>air</b> <b>passage</b> {{on the side}} of the VAF sensor. This screw controls the air-fuel mixture by letting a metered amount of air flow past the air flap, thereby leaning or richening the mixture. By turning the screw clockwise the mixture is enriched and counterclockwise the mixture is leaned.|$|E
50|$|A laminal {{consonant}} is a phone {{produced by}} obstructing the <b>air</b> <b>passage</b> with {{the blade of}} the tongue, the flat top front surface just behind {{the tip of the}} tongue on the top. It contrasts with an apical consonant, produced by creating an obstruction with the tongue apex (tongue tip) only. The distinction applies only to coronal consonants, which use the front of the tongue.|$|E
