After intense negotiations in late July 2004, WTO members reached what {{has become known as}} the (sometimes called the July Package), which provides broad guidelines for completing the Doha round negotiations. The agreement contains a 4-page declaration, with four annexes (A–D) covering agriculture, non-agricultural market <b>access,</b> <b>services,</b> and trade facilitation, respectively. In addition, the agreement acknowledges the activities of other negotiating groups (such as those on rules, dispute settlement, and intellectual property) and exhorts them to fulfill their Doha round negotiating objectives. The agreement also abandoned the 1 January 2005 deadline for the negotiations and set December 2005 as the date for the 6th ministerial to be held in Hong Kong.|$|E

In {{its most recent}} survey of {{available}} parking spaces on campus, the Cal Poly University Police reported 2,892 general purpose parking spaces, 3,492 dorm resident spaces, and 8,648 total spaces. In its facilities Master Plan, the university admits that while more parking spots will be added, the actual ratio of parking to students will decrease since enrollment {{is expected to increase}} sharply. To resolve the disparity, the Master Plan calls on the university to reduce the demand for individual vehicle parking. As part of that plan, the university has constructed additional dorms and has tried to make campus life more desirable.

25|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{research}} linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. Most of the studies in this area are large prospective studies that follow people over time, and while there may be a correlation between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and <b>access</b> <b>services</b> when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.|$|E

40|$|A cap on {{the price}} of interstate <b>access</b> <b>service</b> was {{implemented}} by the Federal Communications Commission in 1991 to provide local exchange carriers (LECs) with an incentive to improve their productive efficiency. A question has arisen as to whether a deterioration in service quality for interstate <b>access</b> <b>service</b> has been an unintended consequence of this {{cap on the}} price. The analysis in this article uses several different measures of service quality, including the average installation interval, the percentage of commitments met, total trouble reports, and the average repair interval for both switched <b>access</b> <b>service</b> and special <b>access</b> <b>service,</b> to investigate empirically whether there has been a decline in service quality between 1991 and 2000. The results are conclusive. Overall, service quality has fallen. To rectify the situation, a proposal is offered to adjust the price cap index to penalize LECs who fail to provide an acceptable level of aggregate service quality. ...|$|R
