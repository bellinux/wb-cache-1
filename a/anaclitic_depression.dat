His investigation focused on infants who had experienced abrupt, long-term separation from the familiar caregiver, as, for instance, when the mother was sent to prison. These studies and conclusions were thus different from the investigations of institutional rearing. Spitz adopted the term <b>anaclitic</b> <b>depression</b> to describe the child's reaction of grief, anger, and apathy to partial emotional deprivation (the loss of a loved object) and proposed that when the love object is returned to the child within three to five months, recovery is prompt but after five months, they will show the symptoms of increasingly serious deterioration. He called this reaction to total deprivation [...] "hospitalism". He {{was also one of the}} first to undertake direct observation of infants.

50|$|Hospitalism (or <b>anaclitic</b> <b>depression</b> in its {{sublethal}} form) was {{a pediatric}} diagnosis {{used in the}} 1930s to describe infants who wasted away while in hospital. The symptoms could include retarded physical development, and disruption of perceptual-motor skills and language. It is now understood that this wasting disease was mostly caused {{by a lack of}} social contact between the infant and its caregivers. Infants in poorer hospitals were less subject to this disease since those hospitals could not afford incubators which meant that the hospital staff regularly held the infants.|$|E

This requires an assessment of self and other representations. Malignant self-regard (MSR) {{is a way of}} assessing the level of functioning of those with a masochistic, self-defeating, depressive, or vulnerably narcissistic personality. In Study 1, 840 undergraduates were assessed for MSR, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, <b>anaclitic</b> and introjective <b>depression,</b> and interpersonal problems. MSR, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and <b>anaclitic</b> and introjective <b>depression</b> were correlated with multiple dimensions of interpersonal problems, and MSR predicted the most variance in interpersonal scales measuring social inhibition, nonassertion, over-accommodation, and excessive self-sacrifice. MSR, <b>anaclitic,</b> and introjective <b>depression</b> predicted unique variance in six of the eight domains of interpersonal problems assessed. In Study 2, 68 undergraduates were provided positive or negative feedback. Consistent with theory, MSR predicted unique variance in state anxiety but not state anger. Results support the validity of the MSR construct...|$|R
40|$|Major Depression is {{a common}} and complex {{disorder}} that {{is often difficult to}} treat. Mentalization, facilitated by secure attachment, has been found to serve as a protective function against Borderline Personality Disorder. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether mentalization has the same protective function against depression and to analyze the connection between mentalization and self-rated attachment. Furthermore, the relation between Anxious/Avoidant attachment patterns and the anaclitic/introjective sub-types of depression were examined. Twenty participants with Major Depressive Disorder were interviewed with the Depression Specific Reflective Function Interview (DSRF) and SCID-I. They also completed the self-report questionnaires Experiences in Close Relationships (ECR), Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ) and Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The results revealed a relation between high mentalization ability as measured by DSRF and low levels of depression and between an anxious attachment pattern and introjective depression. Moreover, low scores on DSRF combined with high levels of anaclitic and introjective symptoms accounted for 65 % of observer rated depression severity. The results suggest that depression treatment might benefit from focusing on increasing the mentalizing ability and reducing anxious attachment patterns and from an awareness of the symptoms characterized by both the introjective and <b>anaclitic</b> sub-types of <b>depression...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The two-configurations model {{developed}} by Blatt and colleagues offers a comprehensive conceptual and empirical {{framework for understanding}} depression. This model suggests that depressed patients struggle, at different developmental levels, with issues related to dependency (anaclitic issues) or self-definition (introjective issues), {{or a combination of}} both. Aims: This paper reports three studies on the development and preliminary validation of the Anaclitic-Introjective Depression Assessment, an observer-rated assessment tool of impairments in relatedness and self-definition in clinical depression based on the item pool of the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure. Method: Study 1 describes the development of the measure using expert consensus rating and Q-methodology. Studies 2 and 3 report the assessment of its psychometric properties, preliminary reliability, and validity in a sample of 128 patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. Results: Four naturally occurring clusters of depressed patients were identified using Q-factor analysis, which, overall, showed meaningful and theoretically expected relationships with anaclitic/introjective prototypes as formulated by experts, as well as with clinical, social, occupational, global, and relational functioning. Conclusion: Taken together, findings reported in this paper provide preliminary evidence for {{the reliability and validity of}} the Anaclitic-Introjective Depression Assessment, an observer-rated measure that allows the detection of important nuanced differentiations between and within <b>anaclitic</b> and introjective <b>depression...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between somatic complaints and depression in a non-clinical adolescent population. Depressive symptoms and experiences were explored. Subjects were 434 ninth through twelfth graders from a Westchester School District. These students {{were part of a}} larger study of adolescent depression conducted in Spring, 1989. Somatic complaints were measured using the Achenback Youth Self Report (YSR) Somatic Complaint Scale. To provide greater dimensionality, groupings of selected somatic items from the broader study packet were also used. Depressive symptoms and behaviors were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC) and the Achenbach YSR Depressed Scale. Depressive experiences were measured using two scales of the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ); the Dependency Scale, which has been theoretically linked to <b>anaclitic</b> <b>depression</b> and the Self-criticism Scale, which has been theoretically linked to introjective depression. There were two central theoretical hypotheses. The first was that subjects who have more somatic complaints are more depressed. The second was that <b>anaclitic</b> <b>depression</b> is characterized by more somatic complaints than introjective depression. Blatt (1974) has described <b>anaclitic</b> <b>depression</b> as primarily oral in nature and as characterized by feelings of dependence, helplessness, weakness and depletion. Introjective depression was described as at a higher developmental level and as characterized by self-criticism and feelings of worthlessness, guilt and a sense of having {{failed to live up to}} standards. <b>Anaclitic</b> <b>depression</b> has been theoretically linked to somatic complaints and the dependency scale has been positively correlated with somatic phenomena. Blatt does not view introjective depression as related to somatic complaints and the self-criticism scale has not been shown to be correlated with this variable. ^ Results of this study showed that all measures of depression, including the self-criticism scale of the DEQ, were significantly correlated with somatic complaints. When subjects were classified into nondepressed, moderately depressed and severely depressed groups using CES-DC cutoff scores, it was found that those subjects in the more depressed categories had significantly higher scores on somatic complaint items. When subjects were classified into nondepressed, anaclitic, introjective and mixed depression groups by applying a median split to the dependency and self-criticism DEQ scales, significant differences in somatic complaint scores were found. Post hoc analyses indicated that subjects in the anaclitic group had significantly higher somatic complaint scores than those in the introjective group. ^ A significant main effect for gender was obtained with higher scores for females on somatic complaint, depression and DEQ dependency measures. No gender x depressive category interactions were found, indicating that the effect of depressive category on amount of somatic complaints was similar for males and females. Theoretical and practical implications for the treatment, diagnosis and referral of depressed adolescents presenting with somatic complaints are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Children in {{our society}} pass through a {{prolonged}} period of dependency during which they are taught the complex technological and social skills necessary for successful adult functioning. The child 2 ̆ 7 s experiences during this period can have profound effects {{on the development of}} his potential for meaningful interpersonal relationships, competency, and creativity. The child 2 ̆ 7 s dependence needs are the complement of the caretaker 2 ̆ 7 s nurturance. When nurturance fails or is inconsistent, societal loss merges with individual tragedy. Yet nurturance does occasionally fail. Some of those charged with the care of children abdicate their responsibilities, and do not provide the physical and/or emotional necessities for the child 2 ̆ 7 s normal development. Such children often suffer <b>anaclitic</b> <b>depression,</b> failure to thrive, marasmus, psychogenic retardation, etc. Other caretakers harm the child through acts of commission, inflicting non-accidental traumatic physical injury.

50|$|Blatt {{began to}} develop his two {{configurations}} model of depression and, later, more broadly, of personality functioning, during his psychoanalytic training, when he noticed that two of his psychoanalytic control cases shared the same diagnosis, depression, but were very different {{with regard to their}} outward behavior and their predominant motivations or psychodynamics. The first patient was preoccupied with issues of interpersonal relatedness; she felt unloved and feared being abandoned. Her behavioral style could be characterized as dependent. The second patient had profound feelings of guilt and worthlessness despite a history of significant professional accomplishment. He was deeply self-critical. Blatt labeled these two types of <b>depression</b> <b>anaclitic</b> and introjective, respectively. The term anaclitic refers to the basic need to lean upon others and to form interpersonal bonds and relationships with them. The term introjective refers to the excessive harshness of superego introjects in individuals with self-critical depression. At about the same time, Blatt, with a graduate student Joseph D’Afflitti, developed the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ), a self-report measure that assesses the daily life experiences, rather than the overt symptomatology, of depressed people. Analysis of the DEQ revealed three factors, the first two matching Blatt's theoretical understanding of anaclitic and introjective dimensions in depression. A third factor representing competency, strength, and belief in oneself, was termed efficacy. The DEQ has been used extensively not only to study aspects of clinical depression but also to explore nonclinical depressive experiences.|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). The {{empirical}} and theoretical literature suggest that several proposed personality disorders (PDs) - Masochistic/Self-Defeating, Depressive, and Vulnerably Narcissistic - may be related through a common self-representation know as Malignant Self-Regard (MSR). To assess this construct, the MSR Questionnaire (MSRQ) was developed. Though its initial psychometric properties were very strong, the present study extended these findings by examining {{the relationship of the}} MSRQ with measures of other PDs and depressive subtypes, and by establishing four-week and eight-week test-retest reliability in two samples (Ns = 840, 911) of undergraduate students. The MSRQ was internally consistent and temporally stable over four and eight weeks. It was positively correlated with measures of introjective and <b>anaclitic</b> <b>depression,</b> measures of Self-Defeating, Depressive, and Vulnerably Narcissistic personalities (rs ranging between 0. 60 and 0. 82), and other select PDs. After controlling for depressive symptoms and self-esteem, the highest remaining partial correlations were with Vulnerably Narcissistic, Self-Defeating, Depressive, and Avoidant personalities. A factor analysis of the MSRQ with measures of other PDs yielded a two-factor solution, with MSR loading most strongly on one factor, along with Vulnerably Narcissistic, Avoidant, Depressive, and Self-Defeating personalities. It is concluded that MSR is a psychometrically supported construct that might have good clinical utility in explaining personality pathology that has historically been difficult to assess...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} to {{removal of the}} mother was studied in 4 group-living pigtail monkey infants. All showed distress, with 3 progressing {{to a state of}} deep depression similar to the <b>anaclitic</b> <b>depression</b> of human infants following separation, as described by Spitz. The only infant not showing deep depression was the offspring of the dominant female. The stages of reaction are seen as successive efforts at adaptation based on available response systems, evolved for their selective advantage or developed ontogenetically, especially through dominancehierarchical regulatory influences. In this regard the reactions have apparent survival value, in part through their communicative significance. Monkey infants have a greater chance of survival without a mother figure than humans because of their greater locomotor ability, which appeared to initiate recovery from the depressed state. The data support Engel's theory of two primitive biological response systems for handling distress, each with a mediating neural organization. 1 / OR HICHEK ORGANISMS who begin life velopment depends upon continuous with a long period in which independent parental care.

40|$|The {{frequency}} of self-aggressive behavior emitted by partial social isolate and socialized rhesus monkeys was compared under baseline living conditions and a continuous reinforcement-extinction schedule of lever pressing. It {{was found that}} under baseline conditions, male isolates showed higher levels of selfaggressive behavior than did the female isolates. Further, frustration produced by extinction of the lever-pressing response produced a significant but transitory intensification of self-aggressive behavior. A theoretical interpretation of this relationship is briefly discussed. The behavior of the child who inflicts serious and sometimes fatal injury to himself has long perplexed psychologists. However, observation of these self-aggressive behaviors has resulted in more theory than experimental data. The etiology of self-aggressive behavior is ascribed to such diverse causes as the surfacing of a death wish (Ferenczi, 1955), severe <b>anaclitic</b> <b>depression</b> (Spitz, 1946), and contingencies of social reinforcement (Ferster, 1961). Though {{there is evidence to}} support the latter formulation (Bachman, 1972), insufficient experimental data are available to analyze the phenomenon adequately. The situation is further {{complicated by the fact that}} a causal analysis of these behaviors in human children is severely restricted due to ethical considerations. For this reason an appropriate animal model for the development of these behaviors is of importance. Researchers working with nonhuman primates have frequently reported self-aggressive behavior in their subjects. For example, Tinkelpaugh (1928) observed an adult male rhesus monkey that repeatedly directed intense biting and ripping behaviors toward his arms, legs, and scrotum. Yerkes and Yerkes (1929) reported that caged chimpanzees often scratched themselves at frequencies and intensities sufficient to produce open wounds. More recently, however, a number of investigators have enumerated environmental variable...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} assessed relations between personality factors and eating disordered attitudes and behaviours. Specifically, the study evaluated {{the degree of}} association between varying levels of eating disorders and the dimensions of Autonomy and Sociotropy, two personality traits suggested by past research to be linked with both depression and eating disorders. Autonomy measures a heightened focus on issues of self-definition and self-worth, whereas Sociotropy measures excessive investment in maintaining interpersonal relationships. This study utilized these measures, along with a projective test to evaluate a psychodynamic model of eating disorders. The model postulates that eating disturbances arise from an underlying <b>anaclitic</b> <b>depression</b> that is defended against by exaggerated autonomy strivings (i. e., overcontrol of food and/or weight). Unconscious dependency needs were hypothesized to have not only a direct relationship to eating problems but also an indirect relationship to eating problems mediated by autonomy concerns (e. g., perfectionism, self-criticism, high need for control). The study also evaluated whether eating-disordered and control samples could be differentiated {{on the basis of}} these personality dimensions. Finally, the study examined the relationship of Autonomy and Sociotropy to other personality traits commonly believed to have etiological significance in the development of eating disorders (e. g., Ineffectiveness, Interoceptive Awareness). To evaluate the hypotheses, 267 female undergraduates and 44 women meeting DSM-IV criteria for eating disorders completed self-report measures of Autonomy and Sociotropy (Personal Style Inventory), the Rorschach Oral Dependency Scale, the Beek Depression Inventory and several measures of eating disturbance, including the Eating Attitudes Test, Eating Disorder Inventory, and the Bulimia Test. Results indicated that eating disordered and nonclinical groups could be distinguished reliably from one another on the basis of Autonomy, Sociotropy, and Oral Dependency measures. The results of a logistic regression analysis indicated that a total of 85...|$|E
