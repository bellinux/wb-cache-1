25|$|Vanir {{was one of}} the Devil King's generals who ends {{up taking}} over the {{management}} of Wiz's magic shop. He is the devil of foresight and one of the dukes of hell, with the ability to read everything <b>about</b> <b>anybody,</b> but he cannot read anything about people that are as powerful as he is (the Devil King's generals and other dukes), people stronger than him (Aqua and other gods), and people who are a little weaker than him; these people have their readings clouded and incomplete. An exception to this is Kazuma, whose cunning nature makes him hard to read. He also has very powerful combat skills that he refuses to use on humans.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] with Timbaland, who {{produced}} the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy {{because of the}} song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is <b>about</b> <b>anybody.</b> I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth'".|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{did not say}} {{anything}} very pleasant <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> or about anything. They were not very anxious to be pleasant; but that I did not mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have said}} nothing <b>about</b> <b>anybody's</b> fault, Robert. I merely {{mentioned}} a fact. Will {{you let me}} know whether I shall bid him stay away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{he likes}} to have a nobleman's name in his mouth," [...] said Geraghty. [...] "I think it's the hoighth of bad manners talking <b>about</b> <b>anybody's</b> friends unless you happen to know them yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{say nothing}} <b>about</b> <b>anybody's</b> fault; but this I do say, {{that it was}} a very great misfortune. I fought all that battle with your sister Priscilla, and I don't mean to fight it again, my dear. If Hugh marries the young lady, I hope she will be more happy than her sister. There can be no harm in saying that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what {{a selfish}} fellow you are, too!" [...] said Jeff; [...] "not one word in all you propose to do <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> except yourself--no mention even of Rosebud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, dear me, I {{never see}} such a surprise. We warn't looking for YOU at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> coming but him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> else, but Ontario Moggs {{is going to}} stand. I do so hope he'll get in. They say he speaks quite beautiful. Did you ever hear him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Whatever Becky's private plan {{might be}} by which Dobbin's true love {{was to be}} crowned with success, the little woman thought that the secret might keep, and indeed, being by no means so much {{interested}} <b>about</b> <b>anybody's</b> welfare as <b>about</b> her own, she had {{a great number of}} things pertaining to herself to consider, and which concerned her a great deal more than Major Dobbin's happiness in this life.|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--I don't {{want you}} to shoot arrows. You might act the part of host without shooting. Can't you walk <b>about</b> with <b>anybody</b> except Lady Rosina De Courcy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Johnny Chuck {{nodded his}} head thoughtfully. [...] "Yes," [...] said he, [...] "I am, even if I don't look it. This is a funny world, isn't it? You can't always tell by a person's looks who he may be related to. Now that I've found out that Sooty isn't related to you and is related to Hummer, I'll never dare guess again <b>about</b> <b>anybody's</b> relatives. I always {{supposed}} Twitter the Martin to be a relative of yours, but now that I've learned that Sooty isn't, I suspect that Twitter isn't either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{take her}} away! I wouldn't care <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> else or anything. If the world didn't approve, I'd {{make a little}} world of my own {{and put her in}} it. You're quite strong enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{all in the}} wrong, dear. He {{would have}} been a good husband if I had cared about him. I never cared <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> but you. It wasn't Westerfield who tempted me to say Yes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Like poison. What's {{the use of}} 'em? They never mean a {{word that}} they say,--and they don't say so many words either. They're never more than half awake, and don't care the least <b>about</b> <b>anybody.</b> I hate London.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go ashore!" [...] screamed Mrs. Cliff. [...] "What are {{you talking}} <b>about?</b> If <b>anybody</b> stays on this yacht, I do! I wouldn't think {{of such a thing}} as going ashore!" ...|$|R
60|$|Gangs {{of these}} marauders, we are told, {{penetrated}} into the New-Netherland settlements, and threw whole villages into consternation by their unparalleled volubility, and their intolerable inquisitiveness--two evil habits hitherto unknown in those parts, or only {{known to be}} abhorred; for our ancestors were noted as being men of truly Spartan taciturnity, and who neither knew nor cared aught <b>about</b> <b>anybody's</b> concerns but their own. Many enormities were committed on the highways, where several unoffending burghers were brought to a stand, and tortured with questions and guesses, which outrages occasioned as much vexation and heart-burning as does the modern right of search on the high seas.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I assure you,' replies Brewer, looking <b>about</b> for <b>anybody</b> else {{to address}} his answer to, {{and giving the}} {{preference}} to Lightwood; 'I assure you, the things were going for a song. Handsome things enough, but fetching nothing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Me!" [...] {{said the}} captain, purpling. [...] "I don’t talk about her. You don’t hear {{me talk about}} her. I’m not always talking <b>about</b> <b>anybody.</b> I might just have {{mentioned}} her name when talking about Truefitt’s troubles; that’s all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here, again, we ask: {{how did the}} {{contaminated}} Books of the Iliad escape the stain of [Greek: peri], with the genitive, after verbs meaning to speak or know? What phrase do they use in the Iliad for speaking or asking <b>about</b> <b>anybody?</b> [Footnote (exact placing uncertain): Monro, Homeric Grammar. See Index, under Iliad, p. 339.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much of that he showed," [...] said Allen, [...] "just knowing {{nothing at}} all <b>about</b> <b>anybody!</b> No! If it were not so utterly ridiculous I should think {{he had come to}} make an offer to Babie:" [...] and as his sister flew out of the room, [...] "You don't mean that he has, mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That ain't {{got nothing}} to do with it. The thing for us to do is just to do our DUTY, and not worry <b>about</b> whether <b>anybody</b> SEES us do it or not. Hain't you got no {{principle}} at all?" ...|$|R
60|$|Peter {{resolved}} to stay {{all night with}} us, too, not troubling himself <b>about</b> <b>anybody's</b> permission. When we went to bed it was settling down for a stormy night, and the rain was streaming wetly on the roof, as if the world, like Sara Ray, were weeping because its end was so near. Nobody forgot or hurried over his prayers that night. We would dearly have loved to leave the candle burning, but Aunt Janet's decree regarding this was as inexorable as any of Mede and Persia. Out the candle must go; and we lay there, quaking, with the wild rain streaming down on the roof above us, and {{the voices of the}} storm wailing through the writhing spruce trees.|$|R
60|$|Reddy {{looked about}} him hurriedly and anxiously. There wasn't {{a sign of}} <b>anybody</b> <b>about,</b> or that <b>anybody</b> had been there. Reddy's anger began to give place to wonder and then to {{something}} very like fear. How could anybody have taken that fat hen and left no trace? And how could a fat hen with a broken neck disappear of its own accord? It gave Reddy a creepy feeling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of nothing," [...] Louise {{declared}} suddenly. [...] "Go, by all means, John. I am {{simply a}} little idiot when I give {{way for a}} moment to such poisonous thoughts. Lady Hilda can say what she likes <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> or anything. It really doesn't matter at all whether you go to Bourne End or not." ...|$|E
60|$|I tell you, I {{was glad}} to see them. In spite of all my {{reasoning}} that it made no difference <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> coming to see me off, it did make a good deal of difference. It was a lonely sort of business starting off in that way--especially after seeing Rectus's father and mother come down to the boat with him.|$|E
60|$|It isn't often Sammy Jay worries <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> but himself. Truth to tell, he doesn't {{worry about}} himself very often. You see, Sammy is smart, {{and he knows}} he is smart. Under that pointed cap of his {{are some of the}} cleverest wits in all the Green Forest. Sammy seldom worries about himself because he feels quite {{able to take care of}} himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of being your heir. I don't care a straw <b>about</b> being <b>anybody's</b> heir. What you have given freely, I have taken freely. As for my father, if you felt so harshly towards him, why did you let him incur this debt?" ...|$|R
40|$|There {{is nothing}} so {{practical}} {{as a good}} theory. " "Don't worry <b>about</b> what <b>anybody</b> {{else is going to}} do … The best way to predict the future is to invent it. Really smart people with reasonable funding can do just about anything that doesn't violate too many of Newton's Laws!"...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I should think, cap'n, that Miss Eustacia {{had about}} as much in her head that comes from books as <b>anybody</b> <b>about</b> here?" ...|$|R
60|$|However {{this may}} be, back Will {{came in a}} very cool and {{collected}} state, and appearing not to trouble himself much <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> except old John Podgers, who, having been sent for, {{was sitting in the}} Town Hall crying slowly, and dozing between whiles. Having embraced his uncle and assured him of his safety, Will mounted on a table and told his story to the crowd.|$|E
6000|$|The new-comer {{raised his}} hat {{slightly}} to Cecil Mitford, and spoke at {{once in the}} grave gentle voice of an educated and cultivated mulatto. [...] "You wanted some antiquarian information about the island, sir; some facts about some one who died before the Port Royal earthquake? You have luckily stumbled across the right man to help you; for I think if anything can be recovered <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> in Jamaica, I can aid you in recovering it. Whose grave {{did you want to}} see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, I don't want {{to accuse}} him. Don't bristle up; only I am sorry, both {{for my own}} little plan of having you for my very own, and because I fear there is trouble in store for you. It can't be palatable." [...] Here Eleonora shook her head, and her worn, wearied look went to the good-natured heart. [...] "Dear child, you have gone through a great deal. You shan't be worried or fretted <b>about</b> <b>anybody</b> or {{anything}} at Revelrig." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hell!" [...] muttered Jimmy feelingly. [...] "I don't {{know what}} Whiskers wants with me, {{but he never}} wants to see <b>anybody</b> <b>about</b> {{anything}} pleasant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you mustn't {{blame me}} if you find them tedious. As a matter of fact, I haven't said much <b>about</b> them to <b>anybody</b> yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{just this}} to say. It won't hurt you {{to lose a}} horse or two, and that's <b>about</b> all <b>anybody</b> has ever taken out of you, while it's quite likely you'll be worse off if you make trouble about it. In fact, taking it all around, you can't afford {{to get rid of}} me." ...|$|R
