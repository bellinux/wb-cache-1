5|$|Many <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> {{the media}} {{suggested}} that Malaysia Airlines {{would need to}} rebrand and repair its image and/or require government assistance to return to profitability. The loss of Flight 17 in July greatly exacerbated Malaysia Airline's financial problems. The combined effect on consumer confidence {{of the loss of}} Flight 370 and Flight 17; and the airline's poor financial performance; led Khazanah Nasional—the majority shareholder (69.37 percent) and a Malaysian state-run investment arm—to announce on 8 August its plan to purchase the remainder of the airline, thereby renationalising it.|$|E

5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the system was determined not by how long a sensor would last in the field, but by the adequacy of coverage by a particular string of sensors. For instance, a well placed string with several failed sensors was more effective than a fully functional string placed in the wrong location. The electronic data was, however, {{only as good as}} the human <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> operators at the ISC. The knack of timely sensor activation depended on careful study of device locations and the patterns of PAVN logistical behavior.|$|E

Seven games into the season he said that McCoy would have his vote {{at that point in}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting these works {{was one of}} familiarity. He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.|$|E
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA key pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private key if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection. Due to the extremely large key size it uses, <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> those affected by the Trojan considered CryptoLocker extremely difficult to repair. Even after the deadline passed, the private key could still be obtained using an online tool, but the price would increase to 10 BTC—which cost approximately US$2300 as of November 2013.|$|E

5|$|In August 2011, the Glazers were {{believed}} to have approached Credit Suisse {{in preparation for a}} $1billion (approx. £600million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than £2billion. However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{season was}} perhaps the most {{historically}} relevant of Federer's career as he completed a career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title and won a men's record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, surpassing Pete Sampras's mark of fourteen. The 2009 Wimbledon final was also historic for being the longest Grand Slam final in terms of games played with Federer prevailing 16–14 in the fifth set. Upon breaking the Grand Slam tournament record, Federer was hailed by some <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> many tennis greats as the greatest player in tennis history. Federer finished the season as the year end World No.1 for the fifth time in his career.|$|E
5|$|Following {{through on}} the CEO's opinion that the company needed a {{consistent}} marketing plan and management team to succeed, the company began its moves by replacing its chairman and CEO Jerry W. Levin with its own choice of executives, Barry J. Gibbons, {{chairman and managing director}} of Grand Metropolitan Retailing, Ltd., as chief executive and Ian A. Martin, Grand Met's top executive in the United States, as chairman. The moves came to no surprise to Wall Street <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> franchisees, as they were expected due to reservations about Levin after his appointment by the outgoing management at Pillsbury. Grand Met's first major restructuring move was the dismantling of Burger Kings 50-year-old purchasing and distribution arm, Distron. Unhappy with the distribution group, the company originally thought to dispose of the division after the purchase but instead decided to reorganize it into two separate groups, one for procurement (Burger King Purchasing or BKP) and another for distribution (Burger King Distribution Services or BKDS). With the restructuring, the company eliminated many positions and ended up laying off over a hundred staff members as a consequence.|$|E

5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior <b>analysts,</b> <b>and</b> a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many questions they had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E
5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by <b>analysts</b> <b>and</b> customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became more aware of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E
