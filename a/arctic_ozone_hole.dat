40|$|Chemical ozone {{destruction}} occurs over both polar regions in local winter–spring. In the Antarctic, essentially complete removal of lower-stratospheric ozone currently {{results in an}} <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> every year, whereas in the <b>Arctic,</b> <b>ozone</b> loss is highly variable and has until now been much more limited. Here we demonstrate that chemical {{ozone destruction}} over the Arctic in early 2011 was—for {{the first time in}} the observational record—comparable to that in the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole.</b> Unusually long-lasting cold conditions in the Arctic lower stratosphere led to persistent enhancement in ozone-destroying forms of chlorine and to unprecedented ozone loss, which exceeded 80 per cent over 18 – 20 kilometres altitude.

40|$|An {{unprecedented}} {{stratospheric ozone}} loss {{has been reported in}} the Arctic from all ground-based, sondes and satellites observations during the winter 2010 - 11. It was attributed to unusually long-lasting cold conditions allowing Polar Stratospheric Clouds to form until at least mid-March. Chlorine activation and ozone loss amplitudes are found comparable to that in the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole,</b> but the warmer conditions, the lesser reduction of nitric acid, and the absence of dehydration, indicate that <b>Arctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>holes</b> are possible even with temperature much milder than those in the Antarctic (Manney et al., 2011, Arnone et al, 2011). Here the ozone loss in and out vortex is evaluated by the "passive" method by comparison between total ozone measured at height SAOZ stations and that simulated by the REPROBUS Chemistry Transport Model (CTM) ignoring chemistry. Most unprecedented feature is the loss rate of 0. 5 - 0. 6 % per day after February 20, similar to that observed in the Antarctic but never seen before in the Arctic. The explanation, demonstrated by the simultaneous NO 2 SAOZ measurements, is the late renoxification of the vortex after the photolysis of HNO 3 starting on March 20 only, later than all other years in the Arctic, particularly in 1997, the year of the longer lasting cold vortex. This implies strong denoxification (heterogeneous conversion of N 2 O 5 in HNO 3) and at least partial denitrification by sedimentation of NAT particles, that is temperature far below that of NAT formation in the early winter as reported. In summary, it is shown that the unprecedented loss amplitude in the winter 2011 was due to a cold vortex until mid-March, but also to extremely cold temperatures below TICE, in the mid stratosphere in January. Shown in the presentation will be the evolution of the ozone loss and the NO 2 column in and out vortex during the 2010 - 2011 winter, the contribution of gas phase chemistry, the relationship with sunlit VPSC, and comparisons with previous years, particularly those of largest losses...|$|R
40|$|Chlorine- and bromine-containing ozone-depleting {{substances}} (ODSs) {{are controlled by}} the 1987 Montreal Protocol. In consequence, atmospheric equivalent chlorine peaked in 1993 and has been declining slowly since then. Consistent with this, models project a gradual {{increase in stratospheric ozone}} with the Antarctic ozone hole expected to disappear by [sim] 2050. However, we show that by 2013 the Montreal Protocol had already achieved significant benefits for the ozone layer. Using a 3 D atmospheric chemistry transport model, we demonstrate that much larger ozone depletion than observed has been avoided by the protocol, with beneficial impacts on surface ultraviolet. A deep <b>Arctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole,</b> with column values < 120 DU, would have occurred given meteorological conditions in 2011.

40|$|Simulations of stratospheric {{geoengineering}} {{with black}} carbon (BC) aerosols using a general circulation model with fixed sea surface temperatures {{show that the}} climate effects strongly depend on aerosol size and altitude of injection. 1 Tg BC/a injected into the lower stratosphere would cause little surface cooling for large radii but {{a large amount of}} surface cooling for small radii and stratospheric warming of over 60 C. With the exception of small particles, increasing the altitude of injection increases surface cooling and stratospheric warming. Stratospheric warming causes global ozone loss by up to 50 % in the small radius case. The Antarctic shows less ozone loss due to reduction of polar stratospheric clouds, but strong circumpolar winds would enhance the <b>Arctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole.</b> Using diesel fuel to produce the aerosols is likely prohibitively expensive and infeasible.

40|$|Satellite {{observations}} and model calculations show 5 to 10 % local column ozone loss in some tropical and mid latitude locations, following El Chichon and Mount Pinatubo eruptions. The rapid deepening of the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> {{in the early}} 1980 s has also been partially attributed to chemistry on volcanic aerosols {{from a number of}} large eruptions. Here the effects of volcanoes on Arctic polar processes are explored. Large polar stratospheric cloud particles that cause denitrification cannot form in a volcanically perturbed environment. Denitrification can increase <b>Arctic</b> <b>ozone</b> loss by up to 30 % in a future colder climate. However, we show that enhanced chemical processing on volcanic aerosols can increase <b>Arctic</b> <b>ozone</b> loss in a cold year by about 60 % independent of denitrification. A coupled chemistry-microphysics model is used to show that widespread distribution of volcanic aerosols in 2000 could have caused severe springtime ozone depletion in the Arctic stratosphere.

40|$|Not {{long after}} the {{discovery}} of the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole,</b> it was established that halogen compounds, supplied to the atmosphere mainly by anthropogenic activities, are the primary driver of polar ozone loss. We will briefly review the chemical mechanisms that cause polar ozone loss and the early evidence showing the key role played by anthropogenic halogens. Recently, stratospheric halogen loading has leveled off, due to adherence to the Montreal Protocol and its amendments that has essentially banned CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) and other halocarbons. We will describe recent reports of the first stage of recovery of the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> (e. g., a statistically significant slowing of the downward trend), associated with the leveling off of stratospheric halogens.

40|$|The large {{burden of}} sulfate {{aerosols}} {{injected into the}} stratosphere by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 cooled Earth and enhanced the destruction of polar ozone in the subsequent few years. The continuous injection of sulfur into the stratosphere has been suggested as a "geoengineering" scheme to counteract global warming. We use an empirical relationship between ozone depletion and chlorine activation to estimate how this approach might influence polar ozone. An injection of sulfur large enough to compensate for surface warming caused by the doubling of atmospheric CO 2 would strongly increase the extent of <b>Arctic</b> <b>ozone</b> depletion during the present century for cold winters and would cause a considerable delay, between 30 and 70 years, in the expected recovery of the Antarctic <b>ozone</b> <b>hole...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Arctic {{stratosphere}} {{throughout the}} late winter and early spring of 2011 {{was characterized by}} an unusually severe ozone loss, resulting {{in what has been}} described as an <b>ozone</b> <b>hole.</b> The 2011 <b>ozone</b> loss was made possible by unusually cold temperatures throughout the Arctic stratosphere. Here we consider the issue of what constitutes suitable environmental conditions for the formation and maintenance of a polar <b>ozone</b> <b>hole.</b> Our discussion focuses on the importance of the stratospheric wind field and, in particular, the importance of a high latitude zonal jet, which serves as a meridional transport barrier both prior to <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> formation and during the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> maintenance phase.
