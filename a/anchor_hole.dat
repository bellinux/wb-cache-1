40|$|Fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) anchors {{made from}} rolled or bundled fibres, which {{are known as}} FRP anchors amongst other names, are an {{emerging}} form of anchorage for application to externally bonded FRP strengthening systems. Little is however known of the fundamental behaviour of these anchors. This paper in turn reports the results of experiments on FRP anchors under pure tension (pullout) loading. A {{detailed description of the}} anchor construction procedure is firstly presented followed by anchor tensile strength test results. Pullout test results of FRP anchors embedded into uncracked concrete blocks are then reported with particular attention focused on the failure mechanisms, failure loads, bond strength and load- displacement and load-strain responses for varying <b>anchor</b> <b>hole</b> diameter, embedment depth and anchor fibre content.

40|$|Intra-osseous {{fixation}} of transplanted flexor tendons {{has been}} used widely in clinical practice, but the anchoring process has not been elucidated well. In the present study, tendon fixation was observed histologically in chickens whose flexors are similar anatomically to human tendon. Right deep flexors of the third digits were cut at the insertion, and then reanchored to the distal phalanx by a pull-out method. Sixteen young chickens (2 - 3 months after hatcing) {{were used for the}} study and sacrificed 4 days to 12 weeks after the procedure. Histological changes at the re-anchored area were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy. A control study confirmed that deep flexor tendons of young chickens directly anchor to the bone tissue, where fine fibrils are dispersed in the bone matrix. Deep flexors re-anchored to the distal phalanx showed a healing process between the tendon and bone. Granulation tissue surrounding the tendon pulled through the <b>anchor</b> <b>hole</b> matured as newly formed connective tissue which connected the tendon and bone, and simultaneously ossification appeared from the bone marrow side. The point of insertion of the re-anchored tendon was made of three layers, consisting of tendon, fibrocartilage and bone, 8 weeks after the operation, similar to the normal anchorage. Ossification seemed to proceed with small granules, about 0. 2 μ in size, which may correspond to matrix vesicles. It was indicated that firm fixation between tendon and bone is achieved at about 4 weeks when Sharpey's fibers appear histologically...|$|E
40|$|The {{alterations}} in blood flow after {{rotator cuff repair}} remain unclear. Visualization of vascular patterns could clarify basic and clinical investigations. Purpose: To assess longitudinal blood flow inside the repaired cuff and the surrounding tissue after rotator cuff repair, using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Fifteen patients (7 men, 8 women, mean age 65. 0 ± 9. 8 years) consented to their participation. The patients underwent an ultrasound scan before and 1, 2, and 3 months after surgery. Enhanced ultrasound images were recorded for 1 min after intravenous injection of contrast reagent. Four regions of interest inside the cuff, and 2 regions in the <b>anchor</b> <b>hole</b> and subacromial bursa were superimposed on the obtained images. Calculated areas under the time-intensity curves were expressed in acoustic units (AU). Results: We found area-dependent differences in patterns of alteration and magnitude of blood flow inside the repaired cuff and peritendinous tissues. Vascularity in the articular distal and bursal distal region of the repaired cuff at 1 month postoperatively increased significantly compared with that at the preoperative baseline (76 vs. 5 AU, P =. 0037, 92 vs. 7 AU, P =. 043). The vascularity peaked at 1 month after surgery in the bursal area within the cuff, but at 2 months in the articular area. The vascularity in the articular proximal region of the repaired cuff was significantly lower than that in the bursal proximal (P =. 0046), bursal distal (P =. 0183), and articular distal regions (P =. 0163) 1 month after surgery. Conclusions: Enhancement patterns in intratendinous tissue increased at 1 or 2 months postoperatively and decreased at 3 months. We found area-dependent differences in enhancement patterns inside the repaired cuff and peritendinous tissue. Clinical Relevance: Visualization of vascularization using contrast-enhanced ultrasound could help in deciding on appropriate repair technique or on the form of postoperative rehabilitation following rotator cuff repair...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of the subchondral bone plate of the acetabulum when preparing the pelvis for a cemented acetabular cup during total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been investigated using finite element analysis. The effect of retaining or removing the subchondral bone plate {{and the use of}} <b>anchoring</b> <b>holes</b> are compared. Loading was applied via both hip joint contact force and the activity of up to 22 muscles at five stages through the load bearing phase of the gait cycle. Removing the subchondral bone plate leads to decreased stresses in the cancellous bone and slightly increased stresses in the cortical shell superior to the acetabulum. The differences between the two cases are small, nevertheless there are indications that removal of the subchondral bone plate reduces the stresses. Increasing the cement penetration depth leads to a slightly more rigid structure, due to cement penetrating the cancellous bone. Adding <b>anchoring</b> <b>holes</b> moves the position of the highest cancellous bone strains from the bone-cement interface into the cancellous bone. Thus removal of the subchondral bone plate should lead to an increased potential for cement penetration into the cancellous bone which should be beneficial for cup fixation and thus improve long term implant survival...|$|R

40|$|During total hip arthroplasty, the {{intraoperative}} cementation {{pressure was}} measured {{inside one of}} the acetabular anchorage holes. Patients were randomized to pressurization of cement with either a conventional pressurizer or a sequential method including individual pressurization of each anchorage hole. The pressure was correlated to the cement penetration measured on digital radiographs. The early peak pressures were higher for the sequential method, resulting in a significantly better penetration of 2. 8 mm compared with 0. 7 mm with the conventional pressurizer. We found a strong correlation between early peak cementation pressures and cement penetration into the cancellous bone of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>holes,</b> indicating a cause-effect relationship at this early stage. The highest peak pressures were achieved during the later CLIP insertion, but these pressures did not correlate with the cement penetration. We conclude that conventional methods for cement pressurization in the acetabulum may not be optimal. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

The introduction of laser forcing, via laser induced thermocapillary forces to anchored droplets, enables the selective extraction of particular droplets from an array. We also demonstrate that such anchor arrays can be filled with multiple, in our case two, droplets each and that if such droplets have different chemical contents, the application of a laser at their interface triggers their merging and a chemical reaction to take place. Finally by adding guiding rails within the microfluidic structure we can selectively fill large scale arrays with monodisperse droplets with significant control over their contents.

Second-generation techniques involved making multiple <b>anchor</b> <b>holes,</b> a double-cementing method on the acetabular side and an intramedullary plug, and retrograde filling with a cement gun on the femoral side in 57 hips.

40|$|To improve cement {{penetration}} {{into the}} cancellous bone of the acetabulum in hip arthroplasty, sequential cementation of each <b>anchoring</b> <b>hole</b> may be feasible. Since this procedure creates laminations in the cement, we have determined {{the conditions under}} which such laminations affect the strength of the cement. Cement bars made at 2, 3 or 4 minutes after the start of cement mixing and with either dry laminations or laminations including blood or saline were tested for tensile strength. Solid unlaminated bars were used as references. Dry and saline laminations made up to 4 minutes after the start of cement mixing did not reduce the strength of the cement. However, there was a time-dependent decrease in cement strength if blood was entrapped in the interface. In such cases, there was a decrease in strength for laminations made at 4 minutes, at 3 minutes this was less pronounced and at 2 minutes no weakening at all was noted. Our findings indicate that a sequential cementation procedure is permissible as regards cement strength, provided it is performed with 2 - 3 minutes after the start of cement mixing. If the cement area is kept free from blood, the time may be prolonged up to 4 minutes, without the risk of weakening the cement strength...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIntroductionPeriacetabular cement {{extrusion}} during {{total hip arthroplasty}} is {{a frequent}} adverse event. This study sought to determine the contributing factors and any functional consequences {{of this type of}} extrusion, which has been insufficiently studied in the literature. HypothesisWe hypothesized that the occurrence of periacetabular cement extrusion could be the cause of an alteration in the functional result and/or intrapelvic complications. Patients and methodsWe retrospectively analyzed a series of 269 total hip prostheses consecutively implanted through a posterolateral approach using a second-generation technique with high-viscosity cement over a period of 1 year (186 standard cemented cups [69 %] and 83 retentive cemented cups [31 %]). The series comprised 110 males and 159 females aged a mean 69. 3 ± 16. 8 years (range, 35 – 96 years). The indication for arthroplasty was primary osteoarthritis in 135 cases (50. 4 %), necrosis of the femoral head in 56 cases (20. 8 %), fracture of the femoral neck in 71 cases (26. 5 %), and seven cases of inflammatory arthritis. We radiographically assessed the frequency of periacetabular cement extrusion and then sought to determine the contributing factors as well as any eventual functional consequences based on the Modified Harris Hip Score, the existence of hip pain, and signs of pelvic dysfunction. ResultsPeriacetabular cement extrusion was found in 68 patients (25 %) and was more frequent in women. No other contributing factor was identified, notably the indication for arthroplasty, the operator's experience level, or the type of cemented cup. Extrusion was not accompanied by a change in the Harris function score nor an increased frequency of urinary or pelvic disorders. DiscussionPeriacetabular cement extrusion is frequent but its consequences are rare (mechanical, vascular, neurological, urological, or visceral). Preventing their occurrence with well-adapted technique is warranted (avoidance of perforating <b>anchoring</b> <b>holes,</b> control of cement penetration). Given the rarity of the consequences, ablation of any extrusion diagnosed intraoperatively should be cautiously pondered upon to prevent any potential iatrogenic incident for a doubtful gain. In cases of local pain persistence, the usual causes of hip pain should be ruled out before attributing the source of functional discomfort to extrusion and envisioning its removal.

Structures of the power waterway are located in the minimum faulted tectonic block composed mainly of clastolavas of basalt porphyrites and lava breccias formed by clastolavas and lavaclastites. The distinguishing features of construction the MH complicating the process are the following: distinctive characteristics of the design (large chamber excavation located nearby—machine and transformer halls), complicated engineering-geological conditions (shear-risk dikes steeply dipping towards excavations and tectonic fractures of order—V), employment of explosion mass up to 2000  kg and intensive mining operations resulting in a rapid exposure of large areas of the MH walls favoring an embrittle-blocky de-stressing of the rock mass. The most unfavorable combinations of the above mentioned factors is observed in the inter-chamber pillar (ICP) between the machine and transformer halls (TH). At the initial stage the MH construction was accompanied by an intensive large-block inrush of rocks occurring on dipping surfaces of the V-order fractures. In this situation the underground opening construction need the monitoring of the stability of the MH walls especially at the ICP sector. In the first stage of construction numerous ultrasonic survey in the <b>anchor</b> drill <b>holes</b> as well as seismic refraction and tomography in the walls were performed.
