500|$|According to Caballero, SpongeBob was {{the most}} {{challenging}} character to translate to stop motion. It was so [...] "...just because of {{the sheer number of}} parts that needed to be made. We wanted to retain as much of that squashy-stretchy goofiness as possible, so he had dozens of replacement parts, like arms, noses, even various sizes of cheeks and freckles. Of course, as the main character, you really want to make sure he will charm the audience, which brings a special kind of pressure." [...] Walsh said, [...] "The {{most important thing is to}} capture the spirit of the character, not necessarily a literal copy of the 2D. Puppets have their own kind of energy <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> careful about what to include and what to leave out." [...] On the other hand, Patchy the Pirate became the easiest character to make [...] "because he has the most humanoid proportions." ...|$|E

500|$|Martin Singer, an {{attorney}} representing Cosby, {{made a statement}} in which he asserted Dickinson was not being truthful in her account. After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of Entertainment Tonight to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe {{in order to support}} her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I have to speak up <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to go in and just be brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward." [...] She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: [...] "The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm sitting here today. And I don't care about what Cosby or networks or anybody says, you will hear me." ...|$|E

Journalist Alan Bjerga of McClatchy Newspapers reported in August 2006, [...] "Wayne Saewyc, a Wikipedia spokesman, said debates on controversial topics can become incredibly time-consuming and sometimes maddening. In the entry covering Scientology, for example, contributors argued for nine months over whether the Scientologist method of childbirth should be called 'silent birth' or 'quiet birth. In an October 2006 article about Wikipedia, Paul Vallely of The Independent commented that, [...] "Some pages {{seem to have been}} taken over by fanatics and special interest groups (try the Scientology [...] page)." [...] Wikipedia user and Scientology critic David Gerard commented to The Daily Telegraph in October 2006 about the state of Scientology articles on the site, saying [...] "he believes the Wikipedia entry is the most balanced and informative account to be found anywhere on the web." [...] Gerard commented on [...] "NPOV" [...] (neutral point of view) in the topic, [...] "This {{is a good example of}} why NPOV is one of the most revolutionary things about Wikipedia. On the web you'll find a lot of Church of Scientology sites, and a lot of critics' sites, which are generally very bitter. On Wikipedia you have to be neutral, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to reference your facts." ...|$|E

Berry suggested that when Wicksy first arrived, he was [...] "sort of the boy next door [...] But then they changed it. Dirty Den had left the show [...] and they chose Wicksy as the new romantic lead. I resisted that change as I never really saw Wicksy like that <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistent with these characters." ...|$|E

Creativity is everywhere. ... The initial idea for a job comes to me literally just like that sometimes, and if that first idea is good then you are on the right track. It's not a sign of creativity to have 65 ideas for one problem, that's just a waste of energy. I also don't think you need to go anywhere particular to be creative; people just use that as an excuse. But I do think a lot of creativity depends on your relationships with other people, your personal relationships, your partner or whatever. Your personal happiness or unhappiness comes out in your work, it's a reflection of your emotional state and you can't separate the two." ...|$|E
