5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E
5|$|Dunderdale was the Progressive Conservative Candidate in the {{district}} of Fortune-Hermitage in the 1993 provincial election. Dunderdale ran against Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while she knew she would not win the election she felt she had to send premier Clyde Wells a message <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he was treating municipalities. In the 1995 Progressive Conservative leadership election Dunderdale served as co-chair of Lynn Verge's successful campaign.|$|E

U.S. commanders broadcast radio messages and dropped leaflets demanding the senior North Korean commanders be held responsible for the atrocity. The North Korean commanders, concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> their soldiers were treating prisoners of war, laid out stricter guidelines for handling enemy captives. Memorials were later constructed on Hill 303 by troops at nearby Camp Carroll, to honor the victims of the massacre.|$|E

5|$|Despite its shorter term {{political}} benefits, the South Vietnamese {{government also}} had complaints <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the Americans {{set up the}} CIP. Diem and Nhu claimed that the paperwork involved in the applications for imports made the process was too slow and hindered {{the development of an}} emerging economy where the market situation changed rapidly. In particular, any investment in capital goods by importers that cost more than USD500,000 needed a formal American review before approval. Nhu also publicly criticized the review policy on several occasions, citing several private infrastructure investments that were blocked by American administrators. Nhu and Diem felt that the regulations that the Americans put {{on the use of the}} piaster fund obtained from Vietnamese importers were stifling their ability to accelerate development, especially as the planning and approval reviews took a long time.|$|E
5|$|In 1258, Henry faced {{a revolt}} among the English barons. Anger had grown <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the King's {{officials}} were raising funds, {{the influence of}} the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King. The Welsh were still in open revolt, and now allied themselves with Scotland. Henry was also critically short of money; although he still had some reserves of gold and silver, they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures, including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy. Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes. To compound the situation, the harvests in England failed. Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1258, King Henry III of England faced {{a revolt}} among the English barons. Anger had grown <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the King's {{officials}} were raising funds, {{the influence of}} his Poitevin relatives at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King. Within Henry's court {{there was a strong}} feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems. On 30 April, Hugh Bigod marched into Westminster {{in the middle of the}} King's parliament, backed by his co-conspirators, including Simon de Montfort, the Earl of Leicester, and carried out a coup d'état. Henry, fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned, agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen, half chosen by the King and half by the barons.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-2000s, Great Southern's {{business}} was growing rapidly, with sales and market capitalisation increasing {{at more than}} 100 per cent per annum. However, in its 2005 Annual Report, the company disclosed that it was subsidising the returns to its 1994 forestry scheme by approximately A$3 million, and that it expected to have to similarly subsidise the 1995 and 1996 schemes by up to A$12 million in future years. Board Chairman Peter Patrikeos and non-executive director Jeffry Mews both expressed concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which Great Southern was funding shortfalls on the sales of timber products, with the issue leading directly to Mews' resignation. Although the company continued to sell over A$800 million of MIS products in the two financial years after incurring losses on its early offerings, it was not meeting sales targets, and its share price was falling.|$|E
5|$|Lewis' {{presence}} on the Street infuriates Gail, who still holds a grudge {{for the way he}} treated Audrey. Gail hopes Lewis may have left for good when he attends court on charges of fraud. However, Lewis charms the judge with a speech <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he let Audrey down, and he is sentenced to community service. The animosity between Gail and Lewis, reaches a peak at The Bisto; and as Audrey defends Lewis, a food critic from the Weatherfield Gazette walks in. A show spokesperson told Inside Soap's Katy Moon that Lewis turns on the charm and quickly wins the reviewer over. Audrey's grandson Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), who owns The Bistro, realises Lewis' communication skills could be good for his business and he employs Lewis for a trial period at the restaurant.|$|E
5|$|After a stay of six weeks, Hogg had {{to return}} to the conveyancer's office in York, and the Shelleys decided to {{accompany}} him back to his home in that city. In October 1811 Percy left for London to mediate in a dispute between his father and his uncle. Harriet remained with Hogg, who soon made further unsuccessful romantic advances towards her. Harriet's mother soon learned that Hogg and her daughter were living together, and sent Harriet's sister to stay with them. Harriet complained to Percy Shelley on his return <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Hogg had treated her; Percy was offended, but nevertheless remained on friendly terms with Hogg. Troubled by the distress felt by his housemates, Percy Shelley suddenly decided to leave York with Harriet and her sister. Hogg subsequently sent him a series of angry letters in which he complained about how he had been treated. In his replies Shelley maintained that he still valued free love, but had left to calm Harriet. Hogg and Shelley subsequently exchanged many emotional letters {{over the course of the}} following two months, but then ceased communicating for a year.|$|E
