40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} and to profile alcohol-related <b>attendances</b> to emergency rooms (ERs) of 11 hospitals of various medical specialties covering a large urban population, to assess risk factors associated with short-stay cases, repeat <b>attendances</b> and higher degree of alcohol consumption and to estimate their impact on the alcohol-related burden at ERs. Methods: A 6 -months study was carried out to obtain clinical and administrative data on single and multiple <b>attendances</b> at ERs in 11 governmental acute hospitals in a large city in Germany. All alcohol-related <b>attendances</b> at ERs of study hospitals were eligible. A broad definition of alcohol-related <b>attendances</b> independently from alcohol diagnosis and various demographic, clinical and administrative measures were used. Odds ratios for the associations of these measures with duration of stay, repeat <b>attendances</b> and higher degrees of alcohol consumption were derived from multivariate binomial and multinomial logistic regression models.

40|$|There are no {{reported}} {{studies on}} the effects of ambient air pollution on emergency department (ED) <b>attendances</b> in Sydney, Australia. This study aimed to determine associations between ambient air pollutants and ED <b>attendances</b> for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in those aged 65 + years. We constructed daily time series of hospital ED <b>attendances,</b> air pollutants and meteorological factors for the Sydney metropolitan area from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2001. We used generalised linear models to determine associations between daily air pollution and daily ED <b>attendances</b> and controlled for the effects of long-term trends, seasonality, weather and other potential confounders. Increased ED <b>attendances</b> for all CVD, cardiac disease and ischaemic heart disease were seen with 24 -h particulate pollution, 1 -h NO 2, 8 -h CO and 24 -h SO 2. Air pollutants were associated with decreased ED <b>attendances</b> for stroke. The effects of air pollutants on CVD, cardiac disease and stroke <b>attendances</b> were generally greater in the cool period compared to the warm period. The single-pollutant effects of CO, O 3, NO 2 and SO 2 were essentially unchanged in two-pollutant models. Although air pollution levels in Sydney are relatively low compared to similar cities, we have demonstrated associations between ambient air pollutants and ED <b>attendances</b> for CVD in people aged 65 + years. Our study adds to the growing evidence for the effects of ambient air pollution on CVD outcomes even at relatively low ambient concentrations...|$|R

Methods: Data for analysis was the counts of daily patient <b>attendances</b> at the ED of an acute care regional general hospital from July 2005 to Mar 2008.
