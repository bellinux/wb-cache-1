40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to achieve efficient scalability in audio coders, and demonstrate its performance using the MPEG- 4 <b>Advanced</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Coder</b> (<b>AAC).</b> In conventional scalable coding, the enhancement-layer performs straightforward re-quantization of the base-layer reconstruction error. This coding scheme implicitly discards useful information from the base-layer, and does not truly minimize a perceptually meaningful distortion criterion such as the noise-mask ratio. We reformulate the problem of scalable coding within a companding framework, and show that re-quantization in the compander's compressed domain achieves, in the asymptotic sense, optimal scalability. Based on this observation, we develop a scalable AAC coder which performs enhancement-layer quantization while exploiting all the information available at that layer. Simulation results of a two-layer scalable coder on the standard test database of 44. 1 kHz sampled audio show that the proposed approach yields substantial savings in bit rate for a given reproduction quality...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, an {{improvement}} of the quantization optimization algorithm for the MPEG <b>Advanced</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Coder</b> (<b>AAC)</b> is presented. This algorithm, given a bit-rate constraint, minimizes the perceived distortion generated by the signal compression. The distortion {{can be related to}} the quantization error level over frequency sub-bands through an auditory model. Thus, optimizing the quantification requires knowledge of the rate-distortion function for each sub-band. When this function can be modeled in a simple way, the algorithm can take a one-loop recursive structure. However, in the MPEG AAC, the rate-distortion function is hard to characterize, since AAC makes use of non-linear quantizers and variable length entropy coders. As a result, the standard algorithm makes use of two nested loops with a local decoder, in order to measure the error level rather than predicting its value. We first describe a partial sub-band modeling of the rate-distortion function of interest in the MPEG AAC. Then, using a statistical approach, we find a relationship between the error level and the so-called quantization ``scale-factor'' and propose a new algorithm that is basically similar to a classical one loop ``bit allocation'' process. Finally, we describe the complete algorithm and show that it is more efficient than the standard one...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Using the MPEG- 4 <b>Advanced</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Coder</b> (<b>AAC)</b> {{music as}} an example of {{streaming}} applications, we investigate the improvement of error performance for the streaming service by link-adaptation and power-control techniques in an Enhanced General Packet Radio Services (EGPRS) cellular network. A low packet error rate and variability are essential in providing short error-burst length so that error concealment techniques can be effectively applied to music packets. In this paper, we study the effects of a combined link adaptation and power control scheme (referred to as the error-based schme) for achieving a target error rate and reducing error variability. By simulation, we compare the error performance of the error-based scheme at both the EGPRS block and AAC frame level with another adaptation algorithm (referred to as the throughput-based scheme) with a goal of maximizing overall network throughput. It is found that when offered with similar traffic load, the former scheme can provide noticeable improvement of music quality over the throughput-based scheme. To achieve similar AAC frame error rate, our results also show that the error-based scheme can increase the link throughput over the throughput-based scheme by 66. 7 % in one of our examples. These results reveal that by aiming at required error targets and thus reducing error variability, the error-based scheme for link adaptation and power control are helpful in improving quality and capacity for streaming applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} selecting a set of parameter values from a given parameter space, in order to perform rate-distortion optimization {{in the context of}} audio compression. Due to interdependencies between parameters, separate optimization of parameter values is inherently suboptimal, yet a straightforward brute-force joint search involves prohibitive computational complexity. This work proposes a new method for joint rate-distortion optimization, while accounting for interparameter dependencies. The optimal solution is achieved, at significantly reduced complexity as compared to a brute-force search, by employing a Viterbi search over a trellis. Two objective distortion metrics are specifically considered: the average, and the maximum noise-to-mask ratio. Subjective (AB/MOS) and objective (average/maximum noise-to-mask ratio) tests demonstrate considerable gains at low bit rates of 16 kbps per channel for a 44. 1 -kHz sampled audio signal using the proposed approach.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a new model-based {{algorithm}} for optimizing the MPEG-Advanced <b>Audio</b> <b>Coder</b> (<b>AAC)</b> in MS-stereo mode is presented. This {{algorithm is}} an extension to stereo signals of prior work on a statistical model of quantization noise. Traditionally, MS-stereo coding approaches replace the Left (L) and Right (R) channels by the Middle (M) and Sides (S) channels, each channel being independently processed, almost like a monophonic signal. In contrast, our method proposes a global approach for coding both channels in the same process. A model for the quantization error allows us to tune the quantizers on channels M and S {{with respect to a}} distortion constraint on the reconstructed channels L and R as they will appear in the decoder. This approach leads to a more efficient perceptual noise-shaping and avoids using complex psychoacoustic models built on the M and S channels. Furthermore, it provides a straightforward scheme to choose between LR and MS modes in each subband for each frame. Subjective listening tests prove that the coding efficiency at a medium bitrate (96 kbits/s for both channels) is significantly better with our algorithm than with the standard algorithm, without increase of complexity...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we derive an {{asymptotically}} optimal multi-layer {{coding scheme}} for entropy-coded scalar quantizers (S 0) that minimizes the weighted mean-squared error (WMSE). The optimal entropy-coded S 0 is non-uniform {{in the case}} of WMSE. The conventional multi-layer coder quantizes the base-layer reconstruction error at the enhancement-layer, and is sub-optimal for the WMSE criterion. We consider the cornpander representation of the quantizer, and propose to implement scalability in the compressed domain. We show that such a multi-layer coding system achieves the operational rate-distortion bound given by the non-scalable entropy-coded S 0, at the limit of high resolution. Simulation results for a synthetic memoryless Laplace source with/-law companding are presented for various values of layer rates.

Streaming data applications like AAC music differ from conversational voice in that they permit a larger transmission delay and delay jitter than the former. In addition, AAC music can tolerate a higher frame error rate than voice by using error concealment techniques at the receiver. This creates the opportunity to transmit AAC music over data-optimized, high-throughput and nominally high-error rate, wireless networks, by using appropriate performance enhancing techniques.

In [12], WLP was shown to outperform conventional LP in terms of resolving adjacent peaks in the signal spectrum, however, no gain in spectral flatness of the LP residual was obtained. We will review the SLP and WLP models, as well as three other LP models {{that appear to be}} suited for tonal audio signals, and show how all of these models are capable of solving the frequency distribution issue described above. More specifically, we will also consider high-order all-pole models [22], constrained pole-zero models [24, 25, 31 – 37], and pitch prediction models. Pitch prediction (PLP), also known as long-term prediction, was originally proposed for speech modeling and coding, and was more recently applied to audio signal modeling {{in the context of the}} MPEG- 4 <b>advanced</b> <b>audio</b> <b>coder</b> (AAC)[*][*][38, 39]. High-order (HOLP) and pole-zero (PZLP) linear prediction models have not been applied to audio modeling before, however, some speech analysis techniques rely on a PZLP model [40 – 42]. All considered approaches result in stable LP models, and some outperform the WLP model both in terms of conventional measures, such as frequency estimation error and residual spectral flatness [43, Chapter 6], and in terms of perceptually motivated measures, such as interpeak dip depth (IDD) [12]. Moreover, many of these alternative models perform even better when cascaded with a conventional LP model. The LP models described in this paper were evaluated and compared experimentally for a synthetic audio signal in [44]. This work is extended here by also performing a mathematical analysis of the different LP models, and describing additional simulation results for synthetic signals and true monophonic and polyphonic audio signals.|$|R
