40|$|Background: We {{live in an}} {{age when}} {{education}} is being internationalized. This can confront students with ‘cultural hegemony’ that can result from the unequal distribution of power and privilege in global society. The name that is given to awareness of social inequality is ‘critical consciousness’. Cross-cultural dialogue provides an opportunity for learners to develop critical consciousness to counter cultural hegemony. The purpose of this research was to understand how learners engage with cross-cultural dialogue, so we can help them do so more effectively in the future. Method: The setting for this research was an online discussion in an international health professions educator fellowship program. We introduced scenarios with cultural references to study the reaction of participants to cultural conversation cues. We used an inductive thematic analysis to explore power and hegemony issues. Results: Participants reflected that personally {{they were more likely to}} take part in cross-cultural discussions if they recognized the context discussed or had prior exposure to educational settings with cultural diversity. They identified barriers as lack of skills in facilitating cross-cultural discussions and fear of offending others. They suggested deliberately introducing cultural issues throughout the curriculum.

In Ireland, {{as in many other}} countries (UNICEF 2008) the education and care divide (Bennet 2003) still operates. Pay, status and conditions for staff in the pre-school sector are inferior to those in the education sector, with most Early Years Care and Education (ECCE) practitioners having qualifications well below the graduate-level training that is standard in primary schools. In addition, there are a substantial number who have no formal qualifications. This has an impact on the professional identity of those working in the ECCE sector, where often they are perceived by parents and others as ‘glorified babysitters’. This paper examines the impact of a professional development programme on practitioners’ sense of themselves as early years professionals. Participants brought to the programme their professional identity, which was influenced by their 'individual dispositions and emotions, day-to-day lives and relationships, training and education' (McGillivray 2008, 246).

One of the needs refers to all learners (Gr R- 12) who need to acquire the necessary social skills to enable them to work effectively with others as members of a team, group, organization and community. These skills refer inter alia to: learning to work with others, listening to others, giving attention, <b>asking</b> <b>clarifying</b> <b>questions,</b> learning how to evaluate, and to praise others, handling conflict, reflecting on group work and allowing all group members to participate. The most obvious place to deal purposefully with the development of social skills is the classroom.

This article reports on the findings obtained from a combined quantitative and qualitative study that set out to determine the levels of social competence achieved by a group of Grade 2 learners, and the possible association of a cooperative teaching and learning intervention programme for enhancing the social skills of these learners.

40|$|Reading {{comprehension}} {{is essential}} for student success {{both in and out}} of school. My philosophy in education involves preparing students for success in and out of school. It is my belief that students who are able to take control of their own learning will have a higher opportunity to achieve this success. Instruction in self-regulated reading strategies is a method for achieving both of these elements of education. Research regarding direct instruction of self-regulated practices suggest that proper implementation of these practices have cognitive benefits in increasing reading comprehension. Models of self-regulation indicate that development of self-regulation is a cyclic process that includes: 1) Self-evaluation and monitoring, 2) Goal Setting and Strategic Planning, 3) Strategy implementation and monitoring, and 4) Strategic outcome monitoring. I used this model to implement goal setting as the catalyst for instruction in self-regulated reading comprehension strategies to a group of second grade readers who were struggling with reading comprehension. My goal was twofold: 1) To provide students with a skill that could hopefully be beneficial for years to come 2) To potentially provide other educators with information documenting benefits for implementing these strategies into their own classrooms. I began by teaching students the reading comprehension strategies of asking questions about text, making predictions and <b>asking</b> <b>clarifying</b> <b>questions</b> while reading. After students had practice using these strategies, I used goal setting to introduce self-regulated reading comprehension strategies into my instruction. Students made goals and monitored their progress as well as their use of these strategies on a weekly basis.

All students that participated in the study showed an increase in motivation and participation during reading instruction.

The ability to learn from past errors is crucial for companies working in a project-based environment, such as the {{construction industry}}. This thesis explores how factors relating to the organization and management of craftsmen can contribute to learning and innovation in construction companies. A qualitative interview study in two selected construction projects in a construction company in Oslo was carried out. Interviews with informants and participant observation were done in the preparatory phase. Subsequently, in-depth interviews with six carpenters were conducted. Additionally, a thorough literature review has been important {{for the development of}} the research question and analysis of the data. The data analysis indicates that observational learning is a useful method of explaining how individual learning happens in construction work. Verbal communication and the ability to <b>ask</b> <b>clarifying</b> <b>questions</b> is also important for learning new skills and for avoiding errors in the building process. Organizational learning theory indicates that codification of knowledge is important for cumulative learning and innovation in project-based organizations. My findings point to that the use of codified knowledge might be difficult to implement at floor level, as learning often happens informally, and knowledge is often tacit. The results of this study indicate that piece work arrangements may be an efficient method of increasing motivation and critical reflection. Maintaining a high level of skills throughout work teams may also increase intrinsic motivation. It is suggested that the association of these factors is investigated in future studies...|$|E

This problem is challenging because human language is filled with ambiguity, and furthermore, due to limitations in sensing, the robot’s perception of its environment might be much more limited than that of its human partner. To enable a robot to recover from a failure to understand a natural language utterance, this paper describes an information-theoretic strategy for <b>asking</b> targeted <b>clarifying</b> <b>questions</b> and using information from the answer to disambiguate the language. To identify good questions, we derive anestimate of therobot’s uncertaintyaboutthemappingbetween specific phrases in the language and aspects of the external world.

After receiving an answer, the robot fuses information from the command, the question, and the answer in a joint probabilistic graphical model in the G 3 framework. When using answers to questions, we show the robot is able to infer mappings between parts of the language and concrete object groundings in the external world with higher accuracy than by using information from the command alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by effectively selecting which questions to ask, the robot is able to achieve significant performance gains while asking many fewer questions than baseline metrics.

30|$|We {{acknowledge}} that learning often happens through complex interactions {{embedded in a}} sociomaterial environment. Some work has even specifically sought to understand embodiment of disciplinary knowledge in social settings (e.g., Alibali & Nathan, 2012) as well as advocate distributed embodiment in supporting students’ understanding of complex systems dynamics (e.g., Lindgren & Johnson-Glenberg, 2013). While there is strength in understanding embodiment as it arises in social contexts, {{there are a few}} unavoidable confounds such an approach encounters when trying to better understand embodiment as a cognitive phenomenon and its role in learning. Consider a dyad working together toward understanding the concept of the water cycle. In the process, these individuals produce a rich exchange of dialogue as well as various behaviors such as posture shifts, gestures, and inscriptions to explain how water moves from reservoirs, into the atmosphere, and then back down through precipitation. Let us say that one student is explaining how “water evaporates to become clouds (hand moves up, palm open).” This student's partner <b>asks</b> a <b>clarifying</b> <b>question</b> about evaporation and performs a similar gesture. Does the second student gesture because they are simulating evaporation in a way analogous to the first student? Or, on the other hand, does this gesture now serve as a shared representation to facilitate communication? While such externalizations may provide insight into evolving spatial thinking, {{it is not clear whether}} the observed utterances result from the internal simulations that would have also been observed from each individual uniquely. Rather it is likely that the functional role of instances of language, gesture, and inscription shift fluidly for these learners as they move between individual reflection, self-explanation, attending to their interlocutor, and working to construct inferences in their dyad. Gesture, in particular, which provides insight into the non-linguistic imagistic aspects of speech, is highly susceptible to social settings: the threshold above which someone may gesture is influenced by implicit mores of the interaction (McNeill, 1992).|$|R
