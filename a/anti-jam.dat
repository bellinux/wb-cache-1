40|$|Abstract. During {{the course}} of {{studying}} how to improve and optimize the <b>anti-jamming</b> ability of the satellite navigation and positioning system, the satellite channel was faced with many types of jamming signals. It is difficult to adopt one kind of jamming suppression technology to effectively suppress all kinds of jamming. In order to solve these problems, a new <b>anti-jamming</b> architecture for satellite navigation and positioning system is proposed. That is adopting the jamming cognitive method combined with the time-frequency domain jamming type recognition, power analysis and jamming DOA estimation. Also, the <b>anti-jamming</b> architecture design of the satellite navigation and positioning system is given based on the jamming cognition. Theoretical analysis and simulation {{results show that the}} <b>anti-jamming</b> architecture can detect the different jamming signals according to different jamming types, simplify the jamming suppression algorithm, grade and classify to suppress jamming signals...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Jamming {{has long}} been a problem in {{wireless}} communications. Recently, adaptive jamming and <b>anti-jamming</b> techniques have been proposed which aim to use feedback to better perform their task. For an <b>anti-jamming</b> receiver this means detecting jamming and adapting its protocol appropriately. For a jammer this means using feedback from the legitimate system to design a high-impact, low-power, hard-to-detect attack. In this work we introduce a toolbox to allow users to tests the performance of adaptive jamming and <b>anti-jamming</b> on the USRP 2 radio platform. These test provide an important function by letting developers understand how well new protocols work against evolving jamming technologies...|$|R

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of jamming-resistant {{communication}} in scenarios in which the communicating parties do not share secret keys. This includes scenarios where the communicating parties are not known in advance or where not all parties can be trusted (e. g., jamming-resistant key establishment or <b>anti-jamming</b> broadcast to a large set of unknown receivers). In these cases, the deployment of shared secret keys is unrealistic, and therefore this problem cannot be solved using existing <b>anti-jamming</b> solutions like FHSS and DSSS that depend on pre-shared keys. Recently, a solution to this problem has been proposed that introduces Uncoordinated Frequency Hopping (UFH), a new spread-spectrum <b>anti-jamming</b> technique that does not rely on secret keys. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of UFH-based communication: we identify optimal strategies for the UFH frequency channel selection and we propose a set of new UFHbased <b>anti-jamming</b> schemes that, compared to the original UFH proposal, reduce the communication latency up to one-half (i. e., increase UFH communication throughput up to two times) ...|$|R
