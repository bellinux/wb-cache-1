5|$|The ghetto was {{liquidated}} between 22 and 24 September 1943. Three thousand {{six hundred}} residents went to labor camps (including 2,000 sent to labor camps in Vilnius); 5,000 {{women and children}} went to Majdanek, where they were gassed to death; and a few hundred elderly and sick were sent to Ponary <b>and</b> <b>shot.</b> <b>The</b> few Jews who remained in Vilnius were shot just before the Soviet Army arrived. A few FPO members escaped to the nearby forests.|$|E
5|$|Another account {{recalled}} how Marseille once ignored {{an order to}} turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>the</b> attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical of his actions, receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole Fähnrich in the Geschwader. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the glory in the air.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the start}} of the second half in extra time, Galatasaray's first {{opportunity}} came, when Şükür attempted a shot from a Popescu cross, but the ball hit the side netting. After seven minutes, Kanu beat a defender, dribbled into the Galatasaray area <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>the</b> ball twice, only to be denied twice by Taffarel. In the dying minutes both teams continued to create decisive chances – Galatasaray's Popescu was given a free–kick, after Şükür was brought down by Keown. However, the ball flew straight into Seaman's arms. Arsenal's Sylvinho put in a cross into the Galatasaray area to Henry, but ball was cleared away. The final whistle was blown and the match moved into a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|One night {{towards the}} end of 1942, Gröning and his comrades in their SS barracks on the {{outskirts}} of Birkenau were awakened by an alarm. They were told that a number of Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught <b>and</b> <b>shot.</b> <b>The</b> SS men told Gröning and his comrades that they could go home but they decided to hang around {{in the shadows of the}} woods.|$|E
5|$|President's Park, {{better known}} as Lafayette Square, may have its own {{spectral}} resident. Philip Barton Key II {{was the son of}} Francis Scott Key and the nephew of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. In the spring of 1858, Key began having an affair with Teresa Bagioli Sickles, the wife of his friend Daniel Sickles. On February 26, 1859, Sickles learned of the affair. The following day, he saw Key in Lafayette Square signalling to his wife. Sickles rushed out into the park, drew a pistol, <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>the</b> unarmed Key three times while the other man pleaded for his life. Key was taken into the nearby Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House and died moments later. Key's spirit, eyewitnesses and authors claim, now haunts Lafayette Square and can be seen on dark nights near the spot where he was shot.|$|E

5|$|This was Manchester United's 18th Charity Shield {{appearance}} to Arsenal's 14th. Manchester United began the game more strongly, but Arsenal {{took the lead}} when Marc Overmars scored 11 minutes before half-time. They extended their lead in the second half, as Overmars and Nicolas Anelka found Christopher Wreh, who put the ball into an empty net at the second attempt. In the 72nd minute, Arsenal scored a third goal, when Anelka got around Jaap Stam in the penalty box <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>the</b> ball past goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.|$|E
5|$|When his men {{finally took}} the hill, 15 Germans {{had been killed}} and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star. He was awarded a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant on 14 October, which elevated him to platoon leader. While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October, the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group. Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper; he returned fire <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>the</b> sniper between the eyes. At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence, the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and {{kept him out of}} combat until January. Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal began {{dominating}} in {{the second}} half, and increased their lead after 57 minutes. From the left wing, Overmars used his pace to {{get the better of}} Gary Neville and passed the ball to Anelka, who turned and passed to an unmarked Christopher Wreh. Schmeichel blocked the Liberian's initial shot with his feet, but he was unable to stop the second attempt or Wreh's acrobatic celebration. Despite the setback, United continued to press Arsenal; defender Martin Keown almost put the ball into his own goal from Ryan Giggs's corner. Both teams made mass substitutions in the final third of the game, notably Teddy Sheringham and Luís Boa Morte coming on for Cole – who rarely threatened – and Petit, respectively. Arsenal scored their third in the 72nd minute – Parlour's pass found Anelka, who got around Stam <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>the</b> ball past Schmeichel from a narrow angle, inside the goalkeeper's near post. Near the end, Sheringham wasted a goal-scoring opportunity, shooting wide.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{in their}} usual home strip of red shirts and white shorts {{kicked off the}} match and {{immediately}} won a corner, which was dealt with by Westerveld. A run by Heskey six minutes later resulted in the player taking a tumble under Gilles Grimandi's challenge, but his appeals for a penalty were ignored by referee Dunn. Arsenal began to dominate play, with Vieira {{at the heart of}} their best moves. The midfielder won a challenge with Heskey in the 17th minute and sent the ball in the direction of Fredrik Ljungberg, who in turn passed it to Henry. The Frenchman went around Westerveld <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>the</b> ball goalwards, which was cleared off the line by Stéphane Henchoz. Television replays later showed the ball hitting Henchoz's arm before going wide; although Henry appealed for a penalty, it was turned down as the incident was missed by both the referee and his assistant. Owen came close to scoring in the 20th minute, but for his shot to be blocked by Martin Keown. Arsenal continued to find the best openings, but struggled to split open the Liverpool defence. A long range effort by Grimandi was easily saved by Westerveld as the final approached the half-hour mark, and a duel between Wiltord and Jamie Carragher on the right side resulted in a Liverpool corner. Two minutes before the interval Henry was penalised for drifting into an offside position, having collected a long pass.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>the</b> predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so often that it became part of his popular image.|$|E
5|$|Early on 31 August, the 2/12th Infantry Battalion {{began moving}} towards KB Mission, with 'D' Company {{leading the way}} and {{struggling}} through muddy conditions along the track, which {{had been turned into}} a quagmire due to the heavy rain and equally heavy traffic. After passing through the 61st Infantry Battalion's position, at around 9:00am they began their counterattack along the north coast of Milne Bay. As the Australians went they were harassed by snipers and ambush parties. They also encountered several Japanese soldiers who tried to lure the Australians in close for attack by pretending to be dead. In response, some Australians systematically bayoneted <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>the</b> bodies of Japanese soldiers. At noon, the 9th Infantry Battalion, a Militia unit from the 7th Infantry Brigade, dispatched two companies to occupy some of the ground that the 2/12th had regained around No. 3 Airstrip and the mission.|$|E

5|$|Inverness {{played in}} a 4–4–2 {{formation}} whilst Alloa played a 3–4–3 arrangement. After ten minutes, Alloa missed a goal scoring opportunity when Martin Cameron's shot went above the cross-bar after a pass from Gary Clark and three minutes later Mark Wilson's shot forced a save from Inverness goalkeeper Les Fridge. Alloa scored the first goal {{of the game in}} the 19th minute with a 12-yard shot from Gary Clark when Inverness failed to clear the ball from a corner kick. Shortly after, Alloa went close to doubling their lead when Fridge was forced to make another save. Alloa dominated the match for most of the first half-hour but Inverness equalised the score at 1–1 on 28 minutes when Alloa goalkeeper Mark Cairns deflected the ball into the path of striker Barry Wilson after making his first save of the game from a shot by Davide Xausa. Three minutes later, Alloa midfielder Mark Wilson ran clear down the right wing <b>and</b> <b>shot</b> <b>the</b> ball past goalkeeper Fridge to restore Alloa's lead to 2–1 before half-time.|$|E
