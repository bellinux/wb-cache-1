A day later, Hornsby was fired as manager and released as a player by the Browns, who were in last place {{at the time of}} his release. His release was partly due to an incident with Browns owner Donald Barnes. On July15, Hornsby won $35,000 ($ today) from betting on a horse race.

500|$|Most of {{the above}} rules are straightforward, but some {{judgment}} is required by the official scorer when a baserunner advances due to a defensive lapse and later scores. In this situation, the official scorer must decide {{what would have happened}} if the runner had not advanced. This is often <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>decision,</b> but it can occasionally be difficult. In one difficult example with a runner on first and two outs, the batter hits a single but a defensive error allows an advance by the lead runner from second to third, and a soft run-scoring single is hit followed by an out. In that situation, the offense [...] "should" [...] have had runners on first and second with 2 outs when the run-scoring single was hit. Since the next batter was put out, the official scorer must decide based on the hit, the speed of the baserunner, and the positioning of the defense whether the runner would have been able to score from second in the reconstruction of the inning without the error.|$|E

Amalric acknowledged taking the role was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>decision</b> because, [...] "It's impossible to say to your kids that 'I could have been in a Bond film but I refused.'" [...] Amalric wanted to wear make-up for the role, but Forster explained that he wanted Greene not to look grotesque, but to symbolise the hidden evils in society.

[...] He later claimed this was not criticism of either politician, but rather an example of how a politician relies on performance instead of a genuine policy to win power. [...] "Sarkozy, is just a better actor than [...] Ségolène Royal—that's all," [...] he explained. Amalric and Forster reconceived the character, who was supposed to have a [...] "special skill" [...] in the script, to someone who uses pure animal instinct when fighting Bond in the climax.

500|$|Kane Hodder {{took over}} the role in The New Blood, and played Jason {{in the next four}} films. He {{previously}} worked alongside director John Carl Buechler on a film called Prison. Based on his experience working with Hodder, Buechler petitioned Frank Mancuso Jr. to hire him, but Mancuso was apprehensive about Hodder's limited size. Knowing he planned to use full body prosthetics, Buechler scheduled a test screening, the first in Friday the 13th history for the character, and Mancuso immediately gave Hodder approval upon seeing him. It is Buechler's contention that Hodder gave Jason his first true personality, based on the emotions, specifically the rage, that Hodder would emit while acting the part. According to Hodder, he wanted to [...] "get in touch with Jason's thirst for revenge" [...] and try to better understand his motivation to kill. After viewing the previous films, Hodder decided that he would approach Jason as a more [...] "quick and agile" [...] individual than he had been portrayed in the previous sequels. John Carl Buechler felt that Kane had [...] "natural affinity for the role"—so much that Kane's appearance, when wearing the mask, would often terrify the cast, the crew, and in one incident a lone stranger that he came across on his walk back to his trailer. Initially Frank Mancuso Jr. and Barbara Sachs planned to use a Canadian stuntperson for Jason Takes Manhattan. Hodder acted as his own voice, calling and requesting that he be allowed to reprise the role; the ultimate decision was left to director Rob Hedden, who intended to use Hodder, because he felt Hodder knew the lore of the series. With Sean Cunningham's return as producer for Jason Goes to Hell, Hodder felt his chances of reprising the role were even better: Hodder had worked as Cunningham's stunt coordinator for years. Regardless, Adam Marcus, the director for Jason Goes to Hell, always intended to hire Hodder for the role. Jason X would mark Hodder's last performance as Jason, to date. Todd Farmer, who wrote the screenplay for Jason X, knew Hodder would play Jason from the beginning. Jim Isaac was a fan of Hodder's work on the previous films, so hiring him was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E
