40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Several {{valuable}} and popular mixed mode partition theories are assessed against experimental {{results for the}} prediction of delamination toughness of fiber-reinforced laminated composites. It is shown that Wang <b>and</b> <b>Harvey’s</b> classical partition theory [1 - 6] gives the most accurate predictions; Davidson et al. ’s non-singular field partition theory [7, 8] also gives accurate predictions; but the Wang <b>and</b> <b>Harvey’s</b> shear deformable partition theory [1 - 6] and the singular-field partition theory [7 - 10] gives poor predictions. It is concluded that the Wang <b>and</b> <b>Harvey’s</b> classical partition theory [1 - 6] governs macroscopic interface fractures...|$|R
5|$|Harvey {{returned}} to politics after the 1929 {{stock market crash}} {{and the beginning of}} the Great Depression. He decided to run for the presidency. He formed the Liberty Party and held their national convention at Monte Ne. It was the only presidential convention ever held in Arkansas. Harvey prepared with railroad excursion rates, media facilities, upgraded roads, and food concessions, anticipating 10,000 delegates. He tented the amphitheater, set up seating, and installed an amplifier system to reach the thousands to be seated outside. Delegates were only eligible to attend if they certified they had read and agreed with the principles of Harvey's newest book The Book, which dealt with the harmful effects of usury by the government. In the end only 786 delegates attended, <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> was the only candidate the delegates could agree on. They nominated Andrae Nordskog of Los Angeles for vice president. The Liberty Party ended up merging with the Jobless Party, <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> ran for president as an independent; however, he is usually incorrectly credited as being their candidate in that election. Regardless, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election, <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> only drew 800 votes.|$|E
5|$|The 1961–62 {{was purely}} domestic, <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> played {{a full season}} in the Sheffield Shield as New South Wales won their ninth {{consecutive}} title. However, Harvey was not prominent in the team's success and scored only 425 runs at 26.56 with two fifties for the season.|$|E
5|$|The Tests aside, Harvey {{continued}} to score {{regularly in the}} other games, and ended with 759 first-class runs at 50.60, with two centuries and five fifties. The team under Craig <b>and</b> <b>Harvey,</b> labelled the worst to leave Australian shores, went home 3–0 victors in the five Test series.|$|E

5|$|The {{tourists}} {{elected to}} bat and {{after losing the}} openers early, Hassett top scored with 151, his third consecutive century. He was supported by Bradman (143) <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> (110), whose quick scoring enabled the Australians to declare with a large total. Hassett shared partnerships in excess of 150 with both Bradman <b>and</b> <b>Harvey.</b> Harvey's century took only 90 minutes and Loxton hit 67 in 75 minutes on the second day. The second and third days were continually interrupted by rain, and Compton made 82 in the showers. Bradman gave his regular bowlers a light workload and Brown took 4/16 in 4.1 overs to finish off the tail, {{the only time he}} bowled in first-class matches on the entire tour. There was no time left for the second innings.|$|E

5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1945–46. Harvey played in a trial match for state selection. Playing for the Rest of Victoria against the first-choice state team, he made 82 and 25. This {{was not enough to}} convince the state selectors <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> did not get a recall to the Victorian team {{until the end of the}} season when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He responded by striking a career-best 163 to help his team to an innings win.|$|E
5|$|At 4/189 Loxton {{came in to}} join Harvey, who {{continued}} to attack the bowling, unperturbed by Miller's demise. Ken Cranston came on to bowl <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for consecutive boundaries. Yardley then moved a man from fine leg to where the hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to the fielder's former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} line-up for the Second Test at Lord's. Brown managed only 24 and 32 {{in the middle}} order as Australia won by 409 runs. Including the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, he had totalled 123 runs at 24.60 in his five innings in the middle-order. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who was noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that although Brown had made an unbeaten double century on his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Loxton <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> had better claims to selection.|$|E

5|$|During the 1949–50 tour of South Africa, Harvey met {{his first}} wife Iris Greenish. At the time, Greenish was only 16 years old <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> 21, and their {{relationship}} {{became the subject of}} controversy when her father told the media that he would object to the couple's engagement until his daughter turned 18. They married four years later at Holy Trinity Church in East Melbourne and had three children, two sons and a daughter.|$|E
5|$|First-class cricket {{had been}} {{cancelled}} during World War II and resumed in 1945–46. At {{the start of}} the season, Harvey was selected for a trial match. The Victorian state team played against the Rest of Victoria, <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> represented the latter. However, he made a duck in his only innings and was not selected for the senior state side during the season.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was then}} rewarded with {{selection}} in a testimonial match for retiring Australian captain Lindsay Hassett. Typically, such matches involved {{the best players}} in Australia divided into two teams, <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> played for Arthur Morris's XI against Hassett's outfit. Harvey scored 69 and 17 as his team completed a 121-run win. He also bowled three overs in total, but was unsuccessful, conceding 27 runs as the opposition batsmen attacked him. Harvey then made 50 and 19 in a drawn match again Queensland.|$|E

5|$|Harvey's {{performances}} were rewarded with selection for an Australian XI in a tour match against the England cricket {{team at the}} start of the 1954–55 season. However, the match was curtailed by rain <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> was not able to exhibit his talents on a sticky wicket highly difficult for batting. Listed at No. 4, Harvey came in after the dismissal of his brother and made seven in his only innings. As a result, Ray was not chosen for the Test team alongside his brother during the season.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} score a century in ten Tests and almost three years, the season saw Harvey at his {{productive}} best as South Africa, whom he had scored four centuries against three years earlier, toured Australia. On a slow pitch difficult for stroke play, <b>and</b> <b>Harvey</b> scored 109 and 52 in Brisbane where Australia grounded out {{a victory in the}} First Test.
