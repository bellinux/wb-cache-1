5|$|Chickadees and titmice {{are mainly}} small stocky {{woodland}} species with short stout bills. Some have crests. They are <b>adaptable</b> birds, with a mixed diet including seeds and insects.|$|E
5|$|Medium {{to large}} seabirds with grey, {{white and black}} plumage, webbed feet and strong bills. Many are {{opportunistic}} and <b>adaptable</b> feeders. There are about 56 species worldwide, 16 {{of which have been}} recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|The Paridae {{are mainly}} small stocky {{woodland}} species with short stout bills. Some have crests. They are <b>adaptable</b> birds, with a mixed diet including seeds and insects.|$|E
5|$|The Paridae {{are mainly}} small stocky {{woodland}} species with short stout bills. Some have crests. They are <b>adaptable</b> birds, with a mixed diet including seeds and insects. Four {{species have been}} recorded in New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|The crows {{and their}} {{relatives}} are fairly large birds with strong bills and are usually intelligent and <b>adaptable.</b> There are about 119 species worldwide, eight {{of which have been}} recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Tits {{are mainly}} small, stocky, {{woodland}} species with short stout bills. They are <b>adaptable</b> birds, with a mixed diet including seeds and insects. There are about 59 species worldwide, five breeding in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Although Shetlands {{are small}} and slow-growing {{compared}} to commercial breeds, they are hardy, thrifty, easy lambers, <b>adaptable</b> and long-lived. The Shetland breed has survived for centuries in difficult conditions and on a poor diet, but they thrive in better conditions. Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, so they are easier to care for than many modern breeds.|$|E
5|$|Brahmousin cattle are {{a hybrid}} {{purebred}} breed of Brahman and Limousin first {{created in the}} USA in the late 1970s. The goal was to blend {{the best of the}} Limousin and Brahman traits to create a breed that has reproductive efficiency, mothering ability, good muscling and growth traits, and is <b>adaptable</b> to varying environmental conditions. Brahmousin are now bred in the USA, Indonesia, El Salvador and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers {{are active}} and sporting. Cavaliers are {{successful}} in conformation shows, obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures. The breed is <b>adaptable</b> in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on the couch or taking long walks.|$|E
5|$|Fast pace {{of life in}} Viet Nam {{during the}} decades of {{integration}} and development witnesses {{the changes in the}} traditional ao dai. This {{does not mean that the}} traditional ao dai is disappearing from Vietnamese life. Yet, it is becoming more <b>adaptable</b> to these modern days.|$|E
5|$|Their {{reproduction}} is both rapid and profuse. The {{combination of a}} high mutation rate and a horizontal gene transfer ability makes them highly <b>adaptable,</b> and able to survive in new environments, including outer space. They form {{an essential part of}} the planetary ecosystem. However, some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms.|$|E
5|$|After {{the flight}} test {{demonstration}} and {{validation of the}} prototypes, on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the USAF Donald Rice announced the YF-22 as {{the winner of the}} ATF competition. The YF-23 design was considered stealthier and faster, while the YF-22 was more maneuverable. The aviation press speculated that the YF-22 was also more <b>adaptable</b> to the U.S. Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992, the Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E
5|$|Alloxylon flammeum is {{a canopy}} or {{emergent}} tree of the Mabi rainforest community of north Queensland. Its terminal tubular flowers {{indicate that the}} species is pollinated by birds. Readily <b>adaptable</b> to cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra moisture and fertilisers low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally as vulnerable under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and logging.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly <b>adaptable</b> diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved <b>adaptable</b> to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{sketches}} were derived almost exclusively from the books, whose multimedia approach, consisting of short anecdotes interspersed with cartoons, diaries, newspaper articles and recipes, proved easily <b>adaptable</b> {{to the screen}} either as raw material or creative inspiration. In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E
5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. This is a more spreading plant to 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm high by 6cm across. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. It {{appears to be more}} <b>adaptable</b> to points north than other dwarf forms – growing reliably in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very floriferous, with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences at any one time.|$|E
5|$|Habitat loss has {{occurred}} through commercial harvesting of the sago, or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds. The rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of bark and hunt it with dogs. The only described nest {{was in an}} area well-used by local villagers, and the rail may be more <b>adaptable</b> to habitat changes than had been thought. There were also several sightings in northeast Halmahera in 2008 and 2011, extending {{the area in which}} this bird has been seen in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Michael Burns (born 6 February 1969) is an English {{first-class}} list cricket umpire {{and former}} first-class cricketer who played county cricket for Warwickshire and Somerset in a first-class career which spanned from 1992 until 2005. He also played Minor Counties cricket for Cumberland and Cornwall. An <b>adaptable</b> cricketer, he appeared for Cumberland and Warwickshire as a wicket-keeper, {{but when he}} moved to Somerset he developed into an aggressive batsman who bowled at medium-pace when needed.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{continue}} a pattern present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist upland species: Murray cod are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist upland species. The pattern is slightly blurred in the cod species because, being <b>adaptable</b> and successful fish, Murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats, while the now endangered trout cod stray (or did stray, before their decline) well down the upland/lowland transition zone, {{which can be}} extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the basic pattern of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present.|$|E
5|$|N. nigricollis usually inhabits savanna and {{semi-desert}} {{regions of}} Africa. However, {{they can be}} found at altitudes up to , as well as in tropical and subtropical regions of central Africa in moist savanna and cleared former forest regions, particularly near rivers and streams. <b>Adaptable</b> snakes, Naja n.nigricollis occurs in southeastern Nigeria where their habitat has been transformed from rainforest to man-made farmlands, plantations, suburban areas, and a few fragmented forests. This species of cobra has found advantages in the drastic changes which have taken place in Nigeria's rainforests. A study by herpetologist Luca Luiselli suggests this snake now forages in much drier microhabitats.|$|E
5|$|Of {{most vital}} {{importance}} to marshes are invertebrate animals, {{the foundation of}} food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations. Mosquitos, born in water, are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and <b>adaptable</b> to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{economic}} foundations of Byzantium was trade, fostered by the maritime character of the Empire. Textiles must have been {{by far the most}} important item of export; silks were certainly imported into Egypt, and appeared also in Bulgaria, and the West. The state strictly controlled both the internal and the international trade, and retained the monopoly of issuing coinage, maintaining a durable and flexible monetary system <b>adaptable</b> to trade needs.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is a tandem two-seat, twin-engine, all-weather, {{long-range}} supersonic jet interceptor and fighter-bomber {{originally developed}} for the United States Navy by McDonnell Aircraft. It first entered service in 1960 with the U.S. Navy. Proving highly <b>adaptable,</b> it was also adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force, and by the mid-1960s had become {{a major part of}} their air wings.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris {{is found}} in {{continuous}} canopy tropical rainforests. It is <b>adaptable</b> and will also live in other types of habitat. It {{is found in}} Indonesia, on the islands of Sumatra, Batam and Galang in the Riau Archipelago, and Pulau Tebingtinggi and Great Natuna (Bunguran) in the Natuna Islands; in Malaysia on the Malay Peninsula and Pulau Tioman; in the southern peninsular of Thailand; and Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat is an <b>adaptable</b> animal. It prefers woodlands—deciduous, coniferous, or mixed—but {{unlike the}} other Lynx species, it does not depend {{exclusively}} on the deep forest. It ranges from the humid swamps of Florida to desert lands of Texas or rugged mountain areas. It makes its home near agricultural areas, if rocky ledges, swamps, or forested tracts are present; its spotted coat serves as camouflage. The population of the bobcat depends primarily on the population of its prey; other principal factors {{in the selection of}} habitat type include protection from severe weather, availability of resting and den sites, dense cover for hunting and escape, and freedom from disturbance.|$|E
5|$|The golden {{everlasting}} {{has proven}} very <b>adaptable</b> to cultivation. It was propagated and developed in Germany in the 1850s, and annual cultivars {{in a host}} of colour forms from white to bronze to purple flowers became available. Many of these are still sold in mixed seed packs. In Australia, many cultivars are perennial shrubs, which have become popular garden plants. Sturdier, long-stemmed forms are used commercially in the cut flower industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} is quite <b>adaptable</b> {{to living in}} captivity, and is common in zoos worldwide. By 1992, more than 300 births had {{occurred}} in captivity, and more than 300 individuals lived in 85 institutions worldwide. By 2001, 182 individuals were in North American zoos alone. As of 2006, the international studbook listed more than 800 individuals in zoos and parks around the world. Of these, 511 individuals of subspecies A. f. fulgens were kept in 173 institutions and 306 individuals of subspecies A. f. styani were kept in 81 institutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in {{eucalyptus}} woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly {{parts of the}} country, these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most <b>adaptable</b> to aviculture, although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.|$|E
5|$|The two {{contractor}} teams submitted evaluation {{results with}} their proposals in December 1990, and on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice {{announced that the}} YF-22 was the winner. The Air Force selected the YF119 engine to power the F-22 production version. The Lockheed and Pratt & Whitney designs were rated higher on technical aspects, were considered lower risks, and were considered to have more effective program management. It has been speculated in the aviation press that the YF-22 was also seen as more <b>adaptable</b> to the Navy's NATF, but by 1992 the U.S. Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E
5|$|Their nocturnal {{approach}} to the breeding sites means that Zino's petrels avoid the attentions of gulls or diurnal raptors, and the only owl on the island, the barn owl, is a rodent hunter. Other than bats, there are no native land mammals on Madeira, although {{there are a number}} of introduced species, two of which will take birds or chicks. These are brown rats and feral domestic cats. Even the high mountain nest sites of the Zino's petrel are not safe from these <b>adaptable</b> predators, ten adults being killed by cats in 1990. Feather lice found on Zino's petrels include Trabeculus schillingi, Saemundssonia species and an unnamed species of Halipeurus.|$|E
5|$|Throughout their range, {{they live}} in forest and in forest edge habitat, similar to other deer species. In mountainous regions, they often dwell at higher {{elevations}} in summer, migrating down slope for winter. The highly <b>adaptable</b> elk also inhabit semi-deserts in North America, such as the Great Basin. Manchurian and Alashan wapiti are primarily forest dwellers and their smaller antler size is a likely adaptation to a forest environment.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Britain, the Spitfire {{superseded}} the Hurricane {{to become}} the backbone of RAF Fighter Command, and saw action in the European, Mediterranean, Pacific, and South-East Asian theatres. Much loved by its pilots, the Spitfire served in several roles, including interceptor, photo-reconnaissance, fighter-bomber and trainer, and it continued to serve in these roles until the 1950s. The Seafire was a carrier-based adaptation of the Spitfire which served in the Fleet Air Arm from 1942 through to the mid-1950s. Although the original airframe {{was designed to be}} powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine producing 1,030hp (768kW), it was strong enough and <b>adaptable</b> enough to use increasingly powerful Merlins and, in later marks, Rolls-Royce Griffon engines producing up to 2,340hp (1,745kW). As a consequence of this, the Spitfire's performance and capabilities improved over the course of its service life.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and <b>adaptable</b> (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown {{successfully}} in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used. Yellowing of new leaves may indicate chlorosis from iron deficiency and can be remedied with iron chelate or iron sulphate. Its flowers attract birds to gardens. A large tree grows in the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. It is thought that there are more plants in cultivation than there are in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Artistic design, {{including}} {{character and}} monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from Final Fantasy through Final FantasyVI. Amano also handled title logo designs {{for all of}} the main series and the image illustrations from Final FantasyVII onward. Tetsuya Nomura was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura's designs were more <b>adaptable</b> to 3D graphics. He worked with the series from Final FantasyVII through Final FantasyX; for Final FantasyIX, however, character designs were handled by Shukō Murase, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa. Nomura is also the character designer of the Kingdom Hearts series, Compilation of Final FantasyVII, and Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy. Other designers include Nobuyoshi Mihara and Akihiko Yoshida. Mihara was the character designer for Final FantasyXI, and Yoshida served as character designer for Final Fantasy Tactics, the Square-produced Vagrant Story, and Final FantasyXII.|$|E
5|$|As an adult, {{the house}} sparrow mostly feeds on {{the seeds of}} grains and weeds, but it is {{opportunistic}} and <b>adaptable,</b> and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar robbing kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.|$|E
