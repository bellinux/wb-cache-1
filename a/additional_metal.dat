5|$|Further {{purification}} {{is done by}} {{a chemical}} transport reaction developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer. In a closed vessel, the metal reacts with iodine at temperatures above 500°C forming metal(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of nearly 2000°C the reverse reaction happens and the iodine and metal are set free. The metal forms a solid coating on the tungsten filament and the iodine can react with <b>additional</b> <b>metal</b> resulting in a steady turnover.|$|E
25|$|Post-synthetic {{modification}} of MOFs opens up possibilities {{that might not}} be achieved by conventional synthesis. Of potential relevance to hydrogen storage are MOFs with exposed metal sites. Such sites have been generated by post-synthetic coordination of <b>additional</b> <b>metal</b> ions to sites on the bridging ligands, and addition and removal of metal atoms to the metal site.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack consists of strips of either metal or plastic that mold to one's back {{to provide a}} good fit, sometimes with <b>additional</b> <b>metal</b> stays to reinforce the frame. Usually a complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The close fitting of the back section to the wearer's back allows the pack to be closely attached to the body, and gives a predictable movement of the load. The {{internal frame}} backpack was invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, the founder of Lowepro.|$|E

25|$|Because the Mona Lisas poplar support expands and {{contracts}} {{with changes in}} humidity, the picture has experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the Mona Lisa was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces. This flexible frame, which is used {{in addition to the}} decorative frame described below, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further. In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after {{it was found that the}} beechwood had been infested with insects. In 2004–05, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an <b>additional</b> <b>metal</b> crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp.|$|E
25|$|High {{hydrogen}} adsorption enthalpy is also important. Theoretical {{studies have}} shown that 22-25kJ/mol interactions are ideal for hydrogen storage at room temperature, as they are strong enough to adsorb H2, but weak enough to allow for quick desorption. The interaction between hydrogen and uncharged organic linkers is not this strong, and so a considerable amount of work has gone in synthesis of MOFs with exposed metal sites, to which hydrogen adsorbs with an enthalpy of 5-10kJ/mol. Synthetically, this may be achieved by using ligands whose geometries prevent the metal from being fully coordinated, by removing volatile metal-bound solvent molecules over the course of synthesis, and by post-synthetic impregnation with <b>additional</b> <b>metal</b> cations. (C5H5)V(CO)3(H2) and Mo(CO)5(H2) are great examples of increased binding energy due to open metal coordination sites; however, their high metal-hydrogen bond dissociation energies result in a tremendous release of heat upon loading with hydrogen, which is not favorable for fuel cells. MOFs, therefore, should avoid orbital interactions that lead to such strong metal-hydrogen bonds and employ simple charge-induced dipole interactions, as demonstrated in Mn32.|$|E
25|$|Damage {{intensity}} {{varied from}} EF1 to EF2 in intensity as the tornado entered Wilcox County and passed {{near the town}} of Rochelle. Off Double Run Road and CR 41, a small farm building was completely destroyed. Two residences had their windows broken, and a metal building structure was severely damaged, with several anchored metal trusses ripped from the concrete foundation; this resulted in total collapse of the building. <b>Additional</b> <b>metal</b> barns and outbuildings nearby were severely damaged. Along Crawford Dairy Road, several large wooden electrical transmission towers were snapped. Farther northeast, a semi-truck trailer was flipped, flattened, and pushed across the road. Another metal building structure had its southeast corner completely destroyed, and it had a few 2ft (0.61m) deep concrete support beams ripped out of the ground. A small home sustained minor roof and siding damage, and several single to double-wide mobile homes were completely destroyed, with debris thrown up to 100yd (91m) downstream. Damage to some of the manufactured homes was consistent with a high-end EF2 tornado. The storm crossed Highway 280, destroying several small wooden sheds and fences, and downing numerous trees before finally lifting along Kingfisher Road west of Abbeville at 4:27p.m. EST (21:27UTC).|$|E

50|$|Biphasic {{neutralization}} {{water treatment}} is a two-step process. Phase I raises the pH of the outflow {{to the point}} that iron precipitates out of solution as ferric hydroxide and arsenic co-precipitates with the ferric hydroxide. This sludge is then removed and disposed of at an appropriate hazardous waste facility. In Phase II the pH of the effluent is raised again and <b>additional</b> <b>metals</b> precipitate. Much of this sludge is non-hazardous and is stored at Leviathan. The remaining wastewater can then be discharged into Leviathan Creek.|$|R
25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack {{is a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an {{internal frame}} composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with <b>additional</b> <b>metal</b> stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than external frame packs. The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including webbing loops and straps for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack. Internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.|$|E

Unlike gold coins, gold rounds have no <b>additional</b> <b>metals</b> added to them for durability purposes and do not have to be made by a government mint, which allows the gold rounds to have a lower overhead price as compared to gold coins.
