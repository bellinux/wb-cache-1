40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the shelf-life of rotary and solar tunnel dried SIS products under different packaging and storage conditions. Organoleptically dried products were found in good condition after a storage period of 60 days in <b>ambient</b> and <b>chilled</b> conditions. The moisture content, TVB-N value and bacterial load slightly increased during 60 days of storage in <b>ambient</b> and <b>chilled</b> conditions. The changes in moisture content and bacterial load were faster in ambient temperature than in chilled storage condition whereas changes in TVB-N value was higher in chilled condition than in ambient temperature. The initial moisture content was in the range of 13. 71 % to 22. 84 %. After 60 days of storage in <b>ambient</b> and <b>chilled</b> condition the moisture content of dried products was in the range of 15. 09 % to 25. 11 % and 14. 49 % to 25. 01 %, respectively.

2500|$|Throughout 1989, Paterson, Cauty, Drummond and Martin Glover {{developed}} the musical genre of ambient house {{through the use}} of a diverse array of samples and recordings. [...] The culmination of Cauty and Paterson's musical work came towards the end of the year when The Orb recorded a session for John Peel on BBC Radio 1. [...] The track, then known as [...] "Loving You", was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays, nature sounds, and Minnie Riperton's [...] "Lovin' You". The Orb changed the title to [...] "A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld". [...] In 1990, Cauty and Drummond held a chillout party at Trancentral, a recording of Patersons DJing was made with a view to releasing it as an LP but the mix contained many uncleared samples and other records and was unusable. Later that year Cauty and Drummond went to the isle of Jura, Scotland to record a techno record called Gate. Instead they created a long form ambient film called Waiting (1990). During the same year Cauty and Drummond went into the studio and made the <b>ambient</b> LP <b>Chill</b> Out. The Grove Dictionary suggests Chill Out to be the first ambient house album. When offered an album deal by Big Life, The Orb found themselves at a crossroads. [...] Cauty preferred that albums by The Orb were released on his KLF Communications label, whereas Paterson wanted to ensure The Orb did not become an offshoot of The KLF. Due to these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name The Orb. Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the recordings in progress and released the album as Space on KLF Communications.|$|R
40|$|An {{axisymmetric}} {{finite element}} model was developed {{that takes into account}} the heat, mass, and momentum transfer that occurs in upright corrugated steel storage structures due to conduction, diffusion, and natural convection. Periods of aeration, dry matter loss distribution, and maize weevil density in corn were estimated. Heat and mass balances were used to calculate the temperature and relative humidity in the headspace and plenum assuming permeable grain surfaces. Two seasons of pilot bin experiments validated the model. The average standard error between the experimental and predicted temperatures was 2. 4 °C (1. 8 to 3. 1 °C range) and the moisture content was 1. 0 percentage point. Non-aerated, automatic ambient aeration, and automatic chilled aeration were evaluated in the replicated pilot bins as alternative methods to control insect development during summer storage. <b>Ambient</b> and <b>chilled</b> aeration reduced development of red flour beetles and maize weevils by 34 % and 70 % over non-aerated storage, respectively. Two locations were investigated (Indianapolis, IN and Minneapolis, MN) to demonstrate the application of the model to control insects in conventionally sized steel bins that were cooled during the fall and winter. The non-aerated and ambient aerated strategies behaved similarly until late summer when the maize weevil density increased dramatically in the non-aerated bins. Chilled aeration controlled maize weevil density at its initial population, but at an energy consumption of fourteen to sixteen times greater than ambient aeration. The simulation results indicated that automatic aeration increased the average bin temperature relative to non-aerated storage, which negated most of the benefits observed in the pilot bins. An optimal scenario includes ambient aeration during the fall, winter, and early spring with non-aerated storage during the summer. Moisture “migration” in the traditional sense did not occur in a cooled grain mass stored into the summer. Instead a more realistic theory of moisture exchange between the grain mass and headspace and plenum was developed. Permeability had a major influence on the magnitude of moisture accumulation. Moisture accumulation occurred primarily due to natural convection currents that entered and exited the headspace, which can be minimized by proper ventilation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} thermal {{recovery}} of the NIF amplifiers has taken on increased emphasis as program goals move toward increasing the shot rate to once every four hours. This paper addresses the technical issues associated with achieving thermal recovery in the NIF amplifiers. We identify two temperature related thermal recovery quantities: (1) {{the difference between the}} average slab temperature and the temperature of other surfaces in the amplifier cavity, and (2) the temperature difference in the slab over the aperture. The first quantity relates to optical disturbances in the gas column in the system, while the second quantity is associated with optical aberrations in the laser media itself. Calculations and experiments are used to quantify recovery criteria, and develop cooling approaches. The cooling approaches discussed are (1) active cooling of the flashlamps with <b>ambient</b> gas and <b>chilled</b> gas, and (2) active cooling of the slab edge cladding. Calculations indicate that the NIF baseline cooling approach of 20 cfm per lamp ambient temperature gas flow in both the central and side flashlamp cassettes is capable of meeting thermal recovery requirements for an 8 hour shot period, while to achieve a 4 hour shot period requires use of chilled gas and edge cladding cooling. In addition, the effect of changing the amplifier cavity and beamtube fill gas from nitrogen to helium is addressed, showing that a factor of 8 reduction in the sensitivity to thermal disturbances is possible. 6 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryCarlos Campabadal TeranThe use {{of grain}} {{aeration}} {{as a tool}} to minimize post-harvest losses requires lower ambient temperature (≤ 20 °C) and relative humidity (≤ 70 %) conditions than what is usually available during the summer season in temperate climates and throughout the year in some tropical climate regions. Warm and moist conditions contribute to pest problems and increase dependence on chemical control for pest reduction as part of grain management strategies. The grain chilling technology is a non-chemical alternative to cool grain stored under high risk climatic conditions. For this research project, the grain chilling technology was tested in a 1, 350 -ton low moisture content wheat silo during the 2015 and 2016 summer harvests in Kansas. The grain temperature was lowered from a maximum of 39 °C to a minimum of 17 °C in less than 250 hours. The results showed that chilled grain maintained at temperatures under 20 °C reduced the development rate of insect pests compared to grain stored at temperatures over 25 °C and cooled with ambient aeration. However, the cost of grain chilling was calculated to be between 0. 26 and 0. 32 $/t higher than using ambient aeration. Through computer simulation it was possible to evaluate the performance of the grain chiller against four different ambient aeration strategies for paddy rice stored under the tropical climatic conditions of the North Pacific coast of Costa Rica. After six months of storage, the minimum grain temperature achieved through ambient aeration was 30. 8 °C using an aeration strategy based on a grain-ambient temperature differential greater than 10 °C. Grain chilling lowered the average grain temperature from 35 °C to below 15 °C in 117 hours and the maximum average temperature it registered after six months of storage was 15. 5 °C. The economic evaluation of the simulated <b>ambient</b> aeration and <b>chilling</b> strategy determined that the operational costs of grain chilling were between 2 and 4 $/t lower than ambient aeration plus fumigation. However, the initial cost of the grain chiller made the net present cost (NPC) of the chilling strategy between 0. 22 and 0. 85 $/t higher than the cost of ambient aeration plus fumigation over a 10 -year analysis. Several potential financial options were analyzed to make the grain chiller more economically feasible for a rice miller in Costa Rica. It was concluded that the grain chilling technology can reduce grain temperatures below 20 °C in {{a relatively short period of}} time, which helps control insect populations and maintain grain quality during summer storage in temperate climates and in tropical climates. Utilizing grain chilling reduced operational costs between 78 % and 88 % when compared to using chemical control of pests. Additionally, it was determined that an initial cost of $ 74, 700 for the grain chiller would require a 16 % discount or at least 10, 641 t to be chilled annually to make this technology viable for the Costa Rican rice milling industry. Leasing the grain chiller (ten equal payments of $ 10, 926) or adding a premium sell price of 1 $/t to chilled rice would make this technology feasible compared to the traditional grain management strategies utilized in Costa Rica...|$|R
