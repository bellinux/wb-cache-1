25|$|In November 2000, William Gibbons {{did some}} {{preliminary}} research in Cameroon {{for a future}} expedition. He was accompanied by David Wetzel, and videographer Elena Dugan. While visiting {{with a group of}} pygmies, they were informed about an animal called Ngoubou, a horned creature. The pygmies asserted it was not a regular rhinoceros, as it had more than one horn (six horns on the frill in one eyewitness account), and that the father of one of the senior members of the community had killed one with a spear <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The locals have noted a firm dwindle in the population of these animals lately, and that they are hard to find. Gibbons identified the animal with a Styracosaurus, but, in addition to being extinct, these are only known to have inhabited North America.|$|E

The {{approximate}} location of the cemetery in which he was buried was recorded in Seder Hadoros, but over time the location of the cemetery was forgotten. <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> a Sorbonne professor discovered an ancient map depicting the site of the cemetery, which now lay under an open square in the city of Troyes. After this discovery, French Jews erected a large monument {{in the center of the}} square—a large, black and white globe featuring the three Hebrew letters of רשי artfully arranged counterclockwise in negative space, evoking the style of Hebrew microcalligraphy. The granite base of the monument is engraved: Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki — Commentator and Guide.|$|E

2500|$|The {{energy that}} {{propelled}} the San Joaquin Soil to being formally designated the [...] "Official State Soil" [...] -- {{was that of}} Alex Lehman, who saw an opportunity to provide his Madera, California Martin Luther King, Jr. Middle School students with a meaningful endeavor which allowed an integrated curriculum approach. [...] Mr. Lehman solicited {{the assistance of a}} State Senator, the Honorable Dick Monteith, as well as the Professional Soil Scientists Association of California (PSSAC). The concept to designate the San Joaquin Soil as the official soil of California began <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> when Gordon Huntington, and several other PSSAC members suggested that designating an official State Soil would be a worthwhile goal of the association, which conducted research and prepared supporting documentation. Mr. Lehman and his students approached Senator Monteith with PSSAC's documentation, including appropriate maps and soil description. [...] The students had also done their own research on other states already having an official state soil. [...] Senator Monteith was impressed and agreed to assist with the class's project.|$|E

60|$|The {{sense of}} empty space and gloom had, however, no effect upon the two elderly men who sat with a cigar box and {{decanter}} {{in front of}} them, engaged in quiet, confidential talk. Challoner was white-haired, straight, and spare, with aquiline features and piercing eyes; Greythorpe broad-shouldered and big, with a heavy-jawed, thoughtful face.

6000|$|I may add that, {{beyond all}} these {{different}} classes of persons who may profit by the study of Biology, there is yet one other. I remember, <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> that a gentleman who was a vehement opponent of Mr. Darwin's views and had written some terrible articles against them, applied to me {{to know what was}} the best way in which he could acquaint himself with the strongest arguments in favour of evolution. I wrote back, in all good faith and simplicity, recommending him to go through a course of comparative anatomy and physiology, and then to study development. I am sorry to say he was very much displeased, as people often are with good advice. Notwithstanding this discouraging result, I venture, as a parting word, to repeat the suggestion, and to say to all the more or less acute lay and clerical [...] "paper-philosophers" [...] [7] who venture into the regions of biological controversy--Get a little sound, thorough, practical, elementary instruction in biology.|$|E
6000|$|The notes {{presented}} in this volume were gathered, as will easily be perceived, <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and on an expectation not at that time answered by the event, and were then published in the United States. The expectation had been that they should accompany a series of drawings, and they themselves were altogether governed by the pictorial spirit. They made, and they make in appearing now, after a considerable interval {{and for the first}} time, in England, no pretension to any other; they are impressions, immediate, easy, and consciously limited; if the written word may ever play the part of brush or pencil, they are sketches on [...] "drawing-paper" [...] and nothing more. From the moment the principle of selection and expression, with a tourist, is not the delight of the eyes and the play of fancy, it should be an energy in every way much larger; there is no happy mean, in other words, I hold, between the sense and the quest of the picture, and the surrender to it, and the sense and the quest of the constitution, the inner springs of the subject--springs and connections social, economic, historic.|$|E
