500|$|Ishii was {{inspired}} to write a film with an international cast after watching a South Korean dramatization of the war. He wanted the film to be an [...] "entertaining action film", but also said he was [...] "very interested in depicting MacArthur {{as a human being}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> world to know how miserable the war was for the Korean people." ...|$|E
500|$|Grande came up {{with the}} idea of the music video and {{contacted}} Max Landis, known for his 2012 film Chronicle. In an interview, Grande explained: [...] "It's very unique, it's very different, I called Max [...] up and I said 'hey I want to do something that ends exactly like this' and I described the ending shot to him and then I said I also want it to be (a) one take … <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> ending shot to look like this, And I described those two things to him and he’s like, 'wow, that's ambitious and it’s brave and it’s different, but let's try it". A day later, Grande discussed the video's concept and said that it was [...] "the coolest concept ever and he killed it and it's very different. I'm very nervous about it because it's so unique and weird and I feel like brave and different, but it’s exciting".|$|E
500|$|The Cosby Show {{is famous}} for rarely {{discussing}} political or controversial topics; it spends significantly more time openly addressing Clair's role as [...] "a woman who 'has it all'", maintaining a successful career while raising a family, than it does the race of its characters. The series seldom shies away from discussing gender equality. Despite never referring to herself as feminist within the show, Clair proudly embodies several feminist themes and beliefs, remaining, according to The Daily Dots Nico Lang, [...] "an outspoken advocate for equality in her household, fighting sexism while setting an example for her daughters." [...] From the sitcom's earliest stages, Cosby had always intended for Clair to reflect the ever-changing work and family dynamic, explaining, [...] "If this was 1964 ... my wife could do the cooking and I could be {{the guy on the}} sofa who just says, ‘Let your mother handle this.’ But today a lot of things have changed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> show to reflect those changes." [...] According to Rotten Tomatoes' Alex Vo, Clair represents [...] "the rapidly changing gender and household roles from the 1980s and onward." [...] MeTV agreed that Clair is [...] "the '80s response to the '50s housewife." [...] Although feminism was hardly a new concept to sitcoms by the time The Cosby Show premiered, feminist television characters remained scare during the early 1980s. The Huffington Posts Dr. Mlsee Harris observed that, during this time, [...] "The stereotypical role of the black woman on television ... had been that of a financially struggling, single woman with dysfunctional relationships, trying to get her life together with no distinct direction", stereotypes Clair worked to defy. Sarah Galo of Mic observed that Clair demonstrates that motherhood and having a career are not [...] "separate entities".|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Brown {{was fined}} £200 in Blackpool for assaulting a fan who had sworn at him. Of the incident, Brown said, [...] "I have {{traditional}} values <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> man to stop swearing {{in front of}} women and children who were on the pier." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{picture on}} the cover is me on Piccadilly Circus (Times Square of London) too excited, too many things, Bright Lights Big City kinda thing, and me eager to consume. So my musical heart was {{scattered}} at <b>the</b> time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> album to show that." [...] —Björk, Stereogum, 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Child's Play {{director}} Tom Holland {{explained that}} Chucky draws heavily from the My Buddy dolls: [...] "I originally called him Buddy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> couldn’t use {{it because of}} the ‘My Buddy’ doll. I went out, I got a ‘My Buddy’ doll, I got a Raggedy Ann, a Raggedy Andy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got one of those life-size baby infants. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> still have it out back. They are the creepiest things in the world. <b>And</b> what <b>I</b> told designer Kevin Yagher was, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> Buddy, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> Raggedy Andy coloring - those button overalls, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> freckles <b>and</b> all that. <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> meanest-looking son of a expletive Raggedy Ann and Andy doll that you could create, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it with <b>the</b> creepiness of that infant doll." ...|$|R
500|$|Bookends {{contains}} many of Paul Simon's major themes, including [...] "youth, alienation, life, love, disillusionment, relationships, old age, and mortality". Simon's work on Bookends is loosely autobiographical, designed {{to function as}} both a personal and artistic statement. Simon, [...] "feeling especially auteurist in the Dylan style of the day", had planned out the album's concept before he began writing, telling Garfunkel [...] "I'm going to start writing a whole side of an album—a cycle of songs. I want the early ones to be about youth and the last song to be about old age, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> feel of each song to fit." [...] Bookends, originally released primarily as a vinyl LP, opens and closes side one of the disc with the [...] "Bookends Theme", a brief acoustic piece (once compared to English rock band the Moody Blues) that evokes [...] "a time of innocence". [...] "Save the Life of My Child" [...] is a dramatic story involving drugs, violence and a mother and child relationship. According to James Bennighof, the song [...] "deals with individual crises in crowded urban settings, along with references to larger societal forces {{and at least a}} hint of some transcendent perspective". The song crossfades into [...] "America", which follows two young lovers—"an apparently impromptu romantic traveling alliance"—as they board a Greyhound bus [...] "to look for America". It is a protest song that [...] "creates a cinematic vista that tells of the singer's search for a literal and physical America that seems to have disappeared, along with the country's beauty and ideals". [...] "Overs" [...] includes themes regarding the disintegration of love and marriage. [...] "Old Friends" [...] paints a portrait of two old men reminiscing on the years of their youth. The two men [...] "sit on a park bench like bookends", and ponder how strange it feels to be nearing their lifetime. The song is joined with the [...] "Bookends Theme", this time with vocal accompaniment from the duo. The piece closes the entire suite with the [...] "resigned admonition" [...] to [...] "Preserve your memories / They're all that's left you".|$|E
2500|$|An area of {{questioning}} involved {{the book of}} Genesis, including questions such as if Eve was actually created from Adam's rib, where did Cain get his wife, {{and how many people}} lived in Ancient Egypt. Darrow used these examples to suggest that the stories of the Bible could not be scientific and should not be used in teaching science with Darrow telling Bryan, [...] "You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does not believe in your fool religion." [...] Bryan's declaration in response was, [...] "The reason I am answering is not {{for the benefit of the}} superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Oslo, New York City, New Jersey, Chicago and London. Davies stated: [...] "This project came about almost by accident, with some tracks I had to appreciate {{the style of the}} other artists, otherwise it would have sounded unbalanced. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> album to work as an entire listening experience but each track had a life of its own".|$|R
5000|$|... 2011 {{also saw}} Fregoso and Valdés {{relocate}} to Berlin, Germany, followed {{a year later}} by Carlisle. According to Fregoso, the move {{was inspired by a}} desire for reinvention. Berlin’s storied musical history also played a huge role: says Fregoso, [...] "I wanted to understand why so much great music had come out of Germany <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>The</b> Blood Arm {{to be a part of}} that tradition." ...|$|R
5000|$|Director Lucrecia Martel {{has said}} in media {{interviews}} that the story is based on [...] "memories of her own family." [...] She has also said, [...] "I {{know what kind of}} film I've made. Not a very easy one! For me, it's not a realistic film. It's something strange, a little weird. It's the kind of film where you can't tell what's going to happen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> audience to be very uncomfortable from the beginning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} for a sleigh ride to-morrow," [...] {{announced}} Phil. [...] "I've hired a big sleigh from Oakdale, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> whole bunch to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{have some}} lunch somewhere," [...] he said. [...] "I can only spend about two shillings, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> best I can get for the money. I wonder whether you could direct me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{to marry}} you, and take you some place where I know you'll be safe from such creatures as Crabtree and Sobber and Larkspur-- <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> right to look after your mother, too." ...|$|E
5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> video to have that energy, as well.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{about time}} for our {{evergreen}} trade, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>the</b> trees to stay a minute in the ground after {{the middle of the}} month." ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking about Secretary's {{tone and}} atmosphere, Danger says [...] "With this S&M material, {{we could go}} into a dark place... Steve <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> total opposite: {{that the nature of}} this {{relationship}} freed characters to be their natural selves." [...] Because of this atmosphere, Danger says [...] "Everybody kept saying, 'When are we going back to the office?' It was funny, because the rooms weren't any smaller in the house, and it wasn't any more difficult to shoot. It was because you wanted to be in that space." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There'll {{be trouble}} {{if you let}} your lumber loose on me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> skip soon," [...] said the other. [...] "A {{stranger}} asked for you {{a few minutes ago}} and I sent him up the hill." ...|$|E
6000|$|Morris's face {{took on a}} hue {{of dirty}} grey. [...] "Well, I don't care; I have the less reserve to keep," [...] he cried. [...] "That man cashed my bill; it's a theft, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> money back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dust and ashes!" [...] So you creak it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> {{heart to}} scold. Dear dead women, with such hair, too--what's become {{of all the}} gold Used to hang and brush their bosoms? I feel chilly and grown old.|$|E
6000|$|... "That settles it, Ralph," [...] he said. [...] "The deal {{ought to}} show a good result, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> house. Now that I have got it, it's {{time for me to}} ask you a {{question}} which would have to be answered presently in any case. I was waiting to see how things would go, out of fairness to her, but as we have bound ourselves hard and fast to Fairmead for several years at least, I'm going to ask you a great thing. Will you give me Aline?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Will, we can't {{leave this}} {{magnificent}} buffalo behind," [...] pleaded his brother. [...] "Darry <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>want</b> <b>the</b> skin, <b>and</b> we'll <b>want</b> to mount <b>the</b> head and horns, eh, Darry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there be}} any man willing to fight for honour," [...] replied MacGillis Chattanach, [...] "the price will be enough; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> not <b>the</b> service of a fellow who draws his sword for gold alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O no, there's {{no hurry}} for that. We know well enough how the case stands--quite {{well enough to}} talk in general terms about it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure}} to be put upon young Springrove before he goes away from home again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it {{fun to be}} in Paris once more?" [...] she continued. [...] "I want a real rickety little voiture <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> man to have a white hat, if possible, and I want {{to drive}} down into Paris over those cobbles." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Soames, without {{lifting his}} eyes, began: [...] "I've had this letter from Bosinney. You {{see what he}} says; I thought I'd let you know. I've spent {{a lot more than}} I {{intended}} on this house, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> position to be clear." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Jonathan Dakss Stone explained the album cover's concept, stating [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> flag to truly represent people of all colors. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> color black {{because it is the}} absence of color. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> color white because it is the combination of all colors. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that is always there, looking right at you. Betsy Ross did the best she could with what she had. I thought I could do better." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{is similar}} for Adi Granov: [...] "My first {{official}} {{introduction to the}} character occurred a year prior to Extremis. ... Upon reading the script, I realized how realistic Warren's approach was to the story. ... When illustrating <b>the</b> book <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> my art to mirror the realism in Warren's writing ... I felt that Warren wrote a story that's a sort of techno-thriller action story <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> art to reflect this. ... I saw Iron Man as not just a superhero in a suit; rather he is a pilot or weapon. To me, the Iron Man armor is more akin to a jet fighter {{than it is to}} an outfit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dust and ashes!" [...] So you creak it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> {{heart to}} scold. [...] Dear dead women, with such hair, too--what's become {{of all the}} gold [...] Used to hang and brush their bosoms? I feel chilly and grown [...] 45 [...] old.|$|E
