5|$|On November 1, 2008, Fey {{once again}} portrayed Palin, {{this time in}} a sketch {{featuring}} the real John McCain, the last of numerous sketches featuring the Arizona Senator. In the sketch, McCain poked fun <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> and his campaign, as well as Barack Obama's purchase of airtime on several major networks earlier in the week. In the sketch, McCain and Palin can only afford to buy airtime on QVC, a home-shopping channel. McCain's wife, Cindy, also made an appearance in the sketch as herself.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sing {{engineers}} his and Bones {{escape from}} confinement, and Sum is impressed, offering them {{membership in the}} Gang if they can kill a person. Sing and Bone attempt to kill the Landlady, but their plan backfires, and Sing barely escapes from the Landlady's wrath. Seeking safety in a traffic pulpit, Sing is surprised as his body rapidly heals from the injuries sustained in the escape, the pain causing him to strike {{the sides of the}} pulpit with extreme force, covering the surface in indentations. Later, he attempts to mug an ice cream vendor, who {{turns out to be the}} mute girl; she offers him a lollipop but he knocks it away, humiliated <b>at</b> <b>himself.</b> After sending Bone away, blaming his failure on Bone, Sing is bought before Sum. Sum wants Sing to use his escape skills to free a legendary fighter, the Beast, from a mental asylum to use against Pig Sty Alley, offering Sing membership in the Gang for doing so. Upon being released, the Beast appears to be a middle-aged, slovenly, and flippant man, but is quickly shown to be a formidable and ruthless fighter.|$|E

25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image as he looked <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> in the mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E

Kramer persuades Jerry to give him his old leather jacket as he will no longer be using it.|$|E

However one Cerambyx beetle was up to 3 inches (7.5cm) long, with antennae up to 5 inches (12.5cm) in length. He is amused <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> for finding his simple hut comfortable, once {{he has made a}} rough table and is in his rattan chair, with a mosquito net and [...] "large Scotch plaid" [...] to form a [...] "little sleeping apartment". He gets 17 new (at least for the Moluccas) species of bird including a new Pitta bird.|$|E

Epstein later became heavily involved in the 1960s drug scene. During the four months when the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper was being recorded, Epstein spent his time on holiday, or at the Priory Clinic in Putney, where he tried unsuccessfully to curb his drug use. He left the Priory to attend the Sgt. Pepper launch party at his house on 24Chapel Street, but returned to the Priory immediately after.|$|E
500|$|Michael Caine as Jasper Palmer, Theo's {{dealer and}} friend. Caine based Jasper on his {{experiences}} with friend John Lennonthe {{first time he}} had portrayed a character who would pass wind or smoke cannabis. Cuarón explains, [...] "Once he had the clothes and so on and stepped {{in front of the mirror}} to look <b>at</b> <b>himself,</b> his body language started changing. Michael loved it. He believed he was this guy". [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune notices an apparent homage to Schwartz in Orson Welles' film noir, Touch of Evil (1958). Jasper calls Theo [...] "amigo"—just as Schwartz referred to Ramon Miguel Vargas. Jasper's cartoons, seen in his house, were provided by Steve Bell.|$|E
500|$|Rhys {{tries to}} make things up to Elaine by taking her to the {{hospital}} to meet his colleagues, but when she questions his motives for [...] "going public" [...] and admitting who she is, Rhys has to look <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> and his attitude towards her. In a May 2012 interview with Inside Soap's Jason Herbison, Barber said he liked the fact that Rhys' mother had been introduced and that he had the chance to learn more about his character's background. He expressed his wish of having Rhys' father introduced in the future, saying [...] "Rhys doesn't have a good relationship with him, as his dad abandoned the family when he was younger. It would certainly create a lot of interesting dilemmas".|$|E

500|$|In 2004, One by One won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, {{while one}} year earlier at the 45th Grammy Awards [...] "All My Life" [...] {{was chosen as}} Best Hard Rock Performance. While the band had a {{positive}} opinion about the record following release, as Grohl said the songs were [...] "the best we've ever written", he {{and the rest of}} the Foo Fighters eventually grew distasteful about the results. Grohl stated that he was frustrated <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> for rushing on the album: [...] "four of the songs were good, and the other seven I've never played again in my life." [...] Hawkins said that [...] "if you think about things too much, they kinda get sterile, as we found out there", and Shiflett declared that [...] "there are great songs , and then there are... parts of great songs".|$|E
500|$|In {{her book}} Stephen Hawking: a biography, Kristen Larsen wrote that Hawking almost missed his {{recording}} session, as his wheelchair broke down {{two days before}} his flight to Los Angeles, where the recording took place. In {{order to make the}} necessary repairs, Hawking's graduate assistant Chris Burgoyne, aided by a technician, worked a 36‑hour shift. Hawking was 40 minutes late when he arrived in Los Angeles. When he met the Simpsons staff, he apologized, saying [...] "Sorry for being late." [...] According to Selman, Hawking was very humble regarding the episode's jokes about him, and stated that he [...] "took a lot of shots" [...] <b>at</b> <b>himself.</b> The only note that Hawking gave regarding the script was {{that he did not want}} to be portrayed as drunk in the episode's last scene, in which he is discussing astronomy with Homer in Moe's tavern.|$|E
500|$|Obama {{later said}} he got [...] "my rear end handed to me" [...] in his loss to Rush and {{acknowledged}} his own hubris. However, many analysts believe that Obama's loss helped him to learn from his mistakes, which enabled him to run more successful campaigns in 2004 and 2008. [...] Obama {{was seen as a}} stiff policy wonk, and he used the experience to hone his ability to connect with voters. [...] According to Chicago City Council member Toni Preckwinkle, an early Obama supporter, Obama [...] "took a hard look <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> after that campaign and became a much better campaigner, more at ease on the campaign trail." [...] He put more effort into his campaign, hiring David Axelrod as his chief political strategist. Also, Obama increased his focus on the Illinois Senate, improving his legislative accomplishments.|$|E

500|$|As the Mirror Ball Man, Bono {{dressed in}} a shining silver lamé suit with {{matching}} shoes and cowboy hat. The character was meant to parody greedy American televangelists, showmen, and car salesman, and was inspired by Phil Ochs' Elvis persona from his 1970 tour. Bono said that he represented [...] "a kind of showman America. He had the confidence and charm {{to pick up a}} mirror and look <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> and give the glass a big kiss. He loved cash and in his mind success was God's blessing. If he's made money, he can't have made any mistakes." [...] As the character, Bono spoke with an exaggerated Southern American accent. Mirror Ball Man appeared during the show's encore and made nightly prank calls, often to the White House. Bono portrayed this alter ego on the first three legs of the tour, but replaced him with MacPhisto for the 1993 legs.|$|E
500|$|Grant often poked fun <b>at</b> <b>himself</b> with {{statements}} such as, [...] "Everyone {{wants to be}} Cary Grant—even I want to be Cary Grant", and in ad-lib lines—such as in the film His Girl Friday (1940), saying, [...] "Listen, the last man who {{said that to me}} was Archie Leach, just a week before he cut his throat." [...] In Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), a gravestone is seen bearing the name Archie Leach. According to a famous story now believed to be fictional, after seeing a telegram from a magazine editor to his agent asking, [...] "How old Cary Grant?", Grant reportedly responded, [...] "Old Cary Grant fine. How you?" [...] Despite his strong comedic qualities, Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was also very effective in playing darker roles, with a mysterious, dangerous quality, remarking that [...] "there is a frightening side to Cary that no one can quite put their finger on". Wansell notes that this darker, mysterious side extended to his personal life, which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image.|$|E
500|$|Wenger's first {{match was}} a 2–0 away victory over Blackburn Rovers on 12 October 1996, however, he did suggest [...] "one or two changes" [...] to Rice in Arsenal's UEFA Cup defeat to Borussia Mönchengladbach on 25 September, nine {{days prior to}} taking charge of the club. The {{interference}} upset club captain Tony Adams, who on {{his first meeting with}} the manager expressed his disappointment: [...] "I said to him that he had put our entire season in jeopardy by doing what he had done." [...] Wenger chose to take the criticism on board upon arrival, and made an effort listening to Adams' assessment of the club. This particular approach of management resonated with the other players, who were sceptical of his ideas at first. The English players often set up pranks on Wenger to relieve hostility and nicknamed him [...] "Inspector Clouseau", due to his clumsy nature. Adams said his sense of humour helped build team spirit: [...] "Not only does Wenger love a good laugh, but he can laugh <b>at</b> <b>himself.</b> He is this gangly wise man".|$|E
