40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 Salmon oil is an {{abundant}} source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Finding more lucrative markets for this unpurified fish oil requires well designed purification steps to reduce impurities such as {{free fatty acids}} (FFA), oxidative components, moisture, minerals, and trace metals. The temperature dependency of the rate constants for lipid oxidation and rheological properties of unpurified oil were measured and modeled using the Arrhenius equation. Performances of chitosan and/or <b>activated</b> <b>earth</b> as adsorbents were investigated to remove impurities from the oil. <b>Activated</b> <b>earth</b> was found more effective in adsorbing primary oxidation products than chitosan. Neither chitosan nor <b>activated</b> <b>earth</b> was effective in reducing FFA from the unpurified oil. Oils purified using <b>activated</b> <b>earth</b> adsorption, neutralization process, and/or combined neutralization and <b>activated</b> <b>earth</b> adsorption processes were characterized for peroxide value (PV), FFA, color, minerals, tocopherols, insoluble impurities, thermal properties, and viscosity. The neutralization process reduced FFA in the unpurified oil but PV increased. The combined method was more effective in reducing impurities than each individual process. The research {{findings from this study}} will provide a good model for purifying oil produced from salmon byproducts...|$|E

In the best process condition for each dye, equilibrium studies {{were carried out}} at different temperatures (from 298 to 328 K) and Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich models were fitted with experimental data.

40|$|Bentonite {{bleaching}} {{earth is}} utilized for purifying used motor oil through a recovery process {{in order to}} improve the quality and stability of the final product. Indeed, spent bleaching earth is generated due to adsorbing oil impurities. Polluted spent bleaching earth contains 20 - 40 % (w/w) oil and is flammable. Its disposal without pre-treatment leads to loss of oil along with environmental impacts. Accordingly, similar studies have been conducted since 1979 until now. This research was a laboratory study on reactive dye adsorption. Cleaning bleaching clay, thermal remediation and acid washing activation methods were utilized. Response surface methodology was used to design the experiments and determine the optimal parameters in order to run the dye adsorption process. The main experimental parameters have been concluded as temperature (200 - 800 °C), acid solution concentration (0. 1 - 3 M), dye solution concentration (1 - 35 ppm), and ratio of <b>activated</b> <b>earth</b> to dye solution (0. 1 - 2 %, w/w). Results revealed that dye adsorption process along with oil removal at a temperature of 650 °C, acid solution concentration of 0. 83 M, dye solution concentration of 11. 75 ppm and ratio of <b>activated</b> <b>earth</b> to dye solution of 1. 52 % (w/w) results in an adsorption efficiency of 68. 57 %. This removal efficiency is a bit higher than activated virgin bleaching earth and much higher than virgin bleaching earth, which has adsorption capacities of 66. 75 % and 51. 56 %, respectively. Considering this recycling process, the purified material is quite acceptable technically, environmentally and economically...|$|E
40|$|The {{selective}} {{removal of}} several impurities from {{a solution of}} crude olive residue oil in n-hexane (miscella) using batch adsorption by different materials, used separately or in sequence, was investigated. The following adsorbents were tested: <b>activated</b> diatomaceous <b>earths,</b> powdered <b>activated</b> carbon and synthetic neutral resins ("Amberlite XAD- 4, XAD- 7, XAD- 16). The adsorption efficiency of every group of compounds depended on the adsorbent and the ratio (amount of adsorbent/amount of oil) used. The <b>activated</b> <b>earths</b> and carbon were very much more effective in the adsorption of the compounds from the miscella than the resins. Results were similar for every resin tested. An effective removal of green pigments (chlorophylls and pheophytins) and carotenoids was achieved with every adsorbent tested. With respect to the adsorption of conjugated hydro-peroxides (HP), a removal of 50 - 60 % was attained with <b>activated</b> carbon and <b>earths,</b> {{in contrast to a}} 20 % removal by the resins. For the final oxidation products (FOP), a 60 % removal was observed with powdered carbon, 20 - 30 % with earths and 20 % with resins. A removal of 20 % of free fatty acids (FFA) by <b>activated</b> <b>earths</b> or powdered carbon and 40 % by the resins was observed. When the adsorbents were used in sequence (carbon or earths followed by XAD- 7 resin), the resin was able to adsorb the remaining FFA, HP and FOP...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the use of}} blends of {{activated}} powdered {{carbon and}} <b>activated</b> <b>earths</b> for the selective removal of several impurities (pigments, free fatty acids and oxidation products) directly from the solution of crude olive residue oil in n-hexane (miscella) was investigated. The optimization of batch adsorption process {{was carried out in}} a 30 % oil miscella (the usual miscella concentration) via the Response Surface Methodology as a function of both the amount of total adsorbent (TA) and the percentage of <b>activated</b> <b>earths</b> (E) used in these blends with carbon. Both the adsorption of pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) and hydroperoxides was significantly affect-ed by TA and E (linear and/or quadratic terms). In addition, an interaction effect (TA x E) was observed on the reduction of the residual content of these compounds. However, for final oxidation products (FOP), no interaction effect (TA x E) was observed and only the linear terms of TA and E showed to be significant on the response. Tridimensional response surfaces, described by second order polynomials, were fitted to the experimental data points concerning the residual content of pigments and initial oxidation products in miscella. The adsorption of FOP was fitted to a flat surface. In organic solution, the selective batch adsorption to the blends of <b>activated</b> <b>earths</b> and carbon occurs in the following order: chlorophylls carotenoids hydroperoxides final oxidation products. In fact, the minimum values observed for residual contents of chlorophylls, carotenoids, hydroperoxides and final oxidation products, were, respectively, about 5, 11, 25 and 41 %. The addition of mixtures of carbon with earths directly to the miscella showed to be more efficient than carbon or earths alone, similar to the observation in a solvent free classical bleaching...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of waste management {{legislation in the}} 1990 's has placed great importance on the sustainability of waste disposal/treatment options. Landfill of wastes is increasingly seen {{as a last resort}} and reduction, re-use and recovery of wastes is encouraged. The wastes investigated in this study (caustic tar and sewage sludges) are often disposed of by non-sustainable methods. In addition production of sewage sludge will have doubled by 2005 and disposal options are increasingly limited. Alternative treatment options are required for both these waste types that offer re-use potential. In this study the carbonisation and activation of these wastes has been demonstrated to be an effective means of treatment that also produces adsorbents that can be safely and usefully applied to treatment of aqueous waste streams. Previous studies have examined the production of clay-carbon adsorbents from spent bleaching earth and limited studies have been conducted on producing adsorbents from sewage sludges. However, the majority of these have limited investigations to production of oils from sludge and no previous studies of caustic tar carbonisation have been conducted. Treatment of caustic tar involved neutralisation with HCl and absorption of the organic content of the waste by Fullers or Acid <b>Activated</b> <b>Earth.</b> The clay-waste mix was subsequently carbonised (375 °C for 2 hours) and activated using an optimised ZnClj activation procedure (600 °C for 1 hour). Activated carbons were produced from sewage sludges using carbonisation (500 °C for 2 hours), CO^ activation (700 °C for I hour) and ZnCl^ activation (450 °C for 2 hours and 600 °C for 1 hour). The adsorbents produced had well developed porosity and large surface areas (up to 225 mVg for caustic tar derived carbons and up to 995 mVg for sewage sludge based carbons) and were adsorptive of a range of organic pollutants common in effluents. ZnC^ activated, un-digested sewage sludges proved to be the most effective adsorbents. COj activated sewage sludges and caustic tar derived carbons had similar adsorption capacities for the organic pollutants studied. Leaching tests demonstrated that metals present in the adsorbents other than the ZnClj activated carbons were not readily leachable and would not prevent re-use of the carbons in the treatment of aqueous effluents.

40|$|In the {{majority}} of citrus juices, bitterness is mainly ascribed {{to the presence of}} limonoids (triterpenes) and flavanone glycosides (flavonoids), namely limonin and naringin. In this study, the selective removal of limonin and naringin from citrus juice by batch adsorption to different materials was investigated. Since the removal of reducing sugars, pigments and vitamin C may also occur, the eventual adsorption of these compounds was also investigated. The following adsorbents were tested: <b>activated</b> diatomaceous <b>earths,</b> granulated <b>activated</b> carbon and synthetic neutral resins (Amberlite XAD- 4, XAD- 7 and XAD- 16). Both Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models showed a good fit to the adsorption of limonin to the resins used. Concerning naringin adsorption, a good fit of these models was only observed when the XAD- 7 resin was used. Sigmoidal profiles were obtained for the adsorption of limonin to granular activated carbon. Unfavourable isotherms were also observed for limonin and naringin adsorption to <b>activated</b> <b>earths.</b> These isotherm adsorption profiles can be explained by a multilayer adsorption phenomenon. The highest adsorption efficiency for the bitter compounds was observed when synthetic neutral resin, Amberlite XAD- 7 was used. The separation factor limonin/naringin varied from 16 (with earths) to 57 (with XAD- 7 resin). The adsorption of sugars and pigments to the resins was low. No adsorption of vitamin C was detected for any of the adsorbents tested. The estimated affinity and separation factors show that the neutral resins tested are adequate for the selective removal of limonin from orange juices. The estimated values of free energy of adsorption, lower than - 13. 3 U mol(- 1) K- 1, indicate that a physiosorption process occurred...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this work, the {{adsorption}} of carotenes {{and phosphorus}} from crude palm oil onto acid <b>activated</b> bleaching <b>earth</b> was investigated under bleaching conditions, i. e. high temperature (90, 105 and 115 °C) and low pressure (less than 50 mbar). Bleaching earth {{was added to}} palm oil {{in a range of}} 0. 5 – 3. 0 wt%. Results presented in this work suggest that adsorption of β-carotene increases with temperature, while phosphorus adsorption was less affected. Both the pseudo-first-order and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model describe efficiently the β-carotene experimental data. Intra-particle diffusion is involved in β-carotene adsorption mechanism, although it is not the sole rate limiting step in the adsorption onto acid <b>activated</b> bleaching <b>earth.</b> Phosphorus adsorption was too fast resulting in a lack of kinetic data. The equilibrium data were described better by Langmuir and Freundlich models, for β-carotene and phosphorus, respectively. A multi-component Freundlich type isotherm was tested. Its competition coefficients were too low, and it assumed the same form as the monocomponent Freundlich. A thermodynamic study demonstrated that β-carotene and phosphorus adsorption is spontaneous, endothermic and an entropy-driven process. Isosteric heat values suggest that the interactions between adsorbate and adsorbent are heterogeneous...|$|R
