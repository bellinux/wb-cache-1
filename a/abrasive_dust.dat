At the same time, polar organic substance with long carbon chain can suppress wheel loading phenomenon. The main reason of the jam by alkane is the nonpolar oil film surface possesses the strong attraction to <b>abrasive</b> <b>dust</b> of Si 3 N 4, which will lead to jam in the grinding process.

Using Al 2 O 3 power and pure Mo power as raw materials, the Molybdenum powders mixed with Al 2 O 3 particles were prepared using planetary ball mill. And then the Mo-based composites with 3 - 10 vol. % Alumina were prepared by compaction and sintering at 1840 °C. The morphology of the Molybdenum powder and microstructure of the composites were analyzed by SEM and XRD. The micro-hardness, density and wear property of composites were researched. The results show that the microstructure of composites is composed of α-Al 2 O 3 particles and Molybdenum matrix. With the increase of Alumina content, the microhardness of Molybdenum matrix increases, and the density first increases and then decreases. The friction coefficient of composite is scarcely affected by the alumina content. While the wear resistance of the composites rises with the increase of Alumina content. The wear failure is caused by abrasive wear characterized by obvious plow furrow and <b>abrasive</b> <b>dust</b> on the worn surface...|$|E

40|$|Research was {{performed}} on the friction, wear and efficiency of plastic gears made of modern engineering polymers and their composites both in a clean environment (adhesive sliding surfaces) and in an environment contaminated with solid particles and <b>dust</b> (<b>abrasive),</b> with no lubrication at all. The purpose is to give a general view about the results of abrasive wear tests including seven soil types as abrasive media. At the first stage of the research silicious sand was applied between the meshing gears and the wear of plastic and steel gears was evaluated and analyzed from the point of different material properties (elongation at break, hardness, yield stress, modulus of elasticity) and its combinations. The different correlations between the experienced wear and material features are also introduced. At the second stage of the project the abrasive sand was replaced with different physical soil types. The abrasive wear of gears is plotted in the function of soil types. The results highlight on the considerable role of physical soil types on abrasive wear resistance and the conclusions contain the detailed wear resistance. The results offer a new tribology database for the operation and maintenance of agricultural machines with the opportunity of a better material selection according to the dominant soil type. This can finally result longer lifetime and higher reliability of wearing plastic/steel parts...|$|R
40|$|The {{first steps}} for In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) on target bodies {{such as the}} Moon, Mars and Near Earth Asteroids (NEA), and even comets, involve the same {{sequence}} of steps as in the terrestrial mining of resources. First exploration including prospecting must occur, and then the resource must be acquired through excavation methods if it is of value. Subsequently a load, haul and dump sequence of events occurs, followed by processing of the resource in an ISRU plant, to produce useful commodities. While these technologies and related supporting operations are mature in terrestrial applications, they will be different in space since the environment and indigenous materials are different than on Earth. In addition, the equipment must be highly automated, since {{for the majority of}} the production cycle time, there will be no humans present to assist or intervene. This space mining equipment must withstand a harsh environment which includes vacuum, radical temperature swing cycles, highly <b>abrasive</b> lofted <b>dust,</b> electrostatic effects, van der Waals forces effects, galactic cosmic radiation, solar particle events, high thermal gradients when spanning sunlight terminators, steep slopes into craters / lava tubes and cryogenic temperatures as low as 40 K in permanently shadowed regions. In addition the equipment must be tele-operated from Earth or a local base where the crew is sheltered. If the tele-operation occurs from Earth then significant communications latency effects mandate the use of autonomous control systems in the mining equipment. While this is an extremely challenging engineering design scenario, it is also an opportunity, since the technologies developed in this endeavor could be used in the next generations of terrestrial mining equipment, in order to mine deeper, safer, more economical and with a higher degree of flexibility. New space technologies could precipitate new mining solutions here on Earth.

40|$|Springs of {{vibrating}} screens {{are prone to}} fatigue induced failure because they operate in a heavy duty environment, with <b>abrasive</b> <b>dust</b> and under heavy cyclic loads. If a spring breaks, the stiffness at supporting positions changes, and therefore the amplitude of motion and the static and dynamic angular inclination of deck motion also change. This change in the amplitude and in the inclination of motion produces a reduction in separation efficiency. Available models are useful to determine motion under nominal operating conditions when angular displacement is not significant. However in practice there is significant angular motion during startup, during shutdown, or under off-design operating conditions. In this article, a two-dimensional three-degree-of-freedom nonlinear model that considers significant angular motion and damping is developed. The proposed model allows the prediction of vibrating screen behavior {{when there is a}} reduction in spring stiffness. Making use of this model for an actual vibrating screen in operation in industry has permitted determining a limit for spring’s failure before separation efficiency is affected.

40|$|Planetary {{exploration}} missions pose unique {{problems for}} astronauts seeking to coordinate and control exploration vehicles. These include {{working in an}} environment filled with <b>abrasive</b> <b>dust</b> (e. g., regolith compositions), a desire to have effective hands-free communication, {{and a desire to}} have effective analog control of robotic platforms or end effectors. Requirements to operate in pressurized suits are particularly problematic due to the increased bulk and stiffness of gloves. As a result, researchers are considering alternative methods to perform fine movement control, for example capitalizing on higher-order voice actuation commands to perform control tasks. This paper presents current research at NASA s Neuro Engineering Laboratory that explores one method-direct bioelectric interpretation-for handling some of these problems. In this type of control system, electromyographic (EMG) signals are used both to facilitate understanding of acoustic speech in pressure-regulated suits 2 nd to provide smooth analog control of a robotic platform, all without requiring fine-gained hand movement. This is accomplished through the use of non-invasive silver silver-chloride electrodes located on the forearm, throat, and lower chin, positioned so as to receive electrical activity originating from the muscles during contraction. For direct analog platform control, a small Personal Exploration Rover (PER) built by Carnegie Mellon University Robotics is controlled using forearm contraction duration and magnitudes, measured using several EMG channels. Signal processing is used to translate these signals into directional platform rotation rates and translational velocities. higher order commands were generated by differential contraction patterns called "clench codes. ...|$|E
5000|$|Once the {{interior}} scaffolding was installed, a thorough evaluative survey of {{the interior}} coatings was executed. The acknowledged presumption of most involved in the restoration was that all coatings would {{be removed from the}} interior metals, that repairs would be made, that metals would be recoated, and the interior would be adequately weatherproofed. The preexisting interior coatings on both the secondary wrought iron framework and the wrought iron central pylon would be removed along with the multiple layers of coal tar and paint that had been applied to the internal copper sheathing. A New York Times article from February 8, 1984, mentioned that the interior copper which was at that time painted [...] "government green" [...] would be cleaned to resemble the salmon color of a new penny. That outermost [...] "government green" [...] layer was a vinyl paint applied in 1975. Because certain sections that had corroded were hidden beneath the layers of coatings, no attempt was made to salvage any of the seven layers of paint, (consisting of a base coat of red lead primer plus six additional coats) and the two layers of bituminous paint (a coal tar coating) that had been used as a water sealant in the statues interior around 1911. The three available coating removal methods tested, developed (or not) and implemented (or not) were: thermal coating removal, abrasive coating removal and chemical coating removal. The methods contemplated for the removal of the coatings on the interior copper differed from that of the other interior metals. For the preparation of the wrought iron parts of the statue, an abrasive removal method also known as dry sandblasting was implemented in order to prevent against flash rusting, The low <b>dusting</b> <b>abrasive</b> material used in the dry sandblasting technique was aluminum oxide.|$|R
40|$|While {{manufacturing}} {{a number}} of important tubular products stringent requirements have been imposed on quality of their inner surfaces. The well-known methods for inner surface treatment of pipes include sandblasting, chemical cleaning with acid reagents (oxalic, formic, sulfamic, orthophosphoric acids) and electrochemical polishing. Disadvantages of the chemical method are cleaning-up irregularities, high metal removal, limited number of reagent application, complicated selection of reagent chemical composition and concentration, complicated and environmentally harmful recycling of waste chemicals, high cost of reagents. Low productivity at a high cost, as well as hazardous impact on personnel due to high dispersion of <b>abrasive</b> <b>dust</b> are considered as disadvantages of sandblasting. Electrochemical polishing is characterized by the following disadvantages: low processing productivity because supply of high currents is rather difficult due to electrolyte scattering capacity away from the main electrode action zone, limited length of the cavity to be treated due to heating of flexible current leads at operating current densities, application of expensive aggressive electrolytes and high costs of their recycling. A new method for polishing and cleaning of inner surfaces of tubular products based on electrolyte-plasma treatment has been developed. In comparison with the existing methods the proposed methods ensures quality processing with high intensity while applying non-toxic, environmentally friendly and cheap electrolytes. The paper presents results of investigations on technological specific features of electrolyte-plasma treatment for inner surfaces of tubular products: influence of slotted nozzle width, electrolyte flow and rate on stability of gas-vapor blanket, current density and productivity. Results of the research have made it possible to determine modes that provide stability and high productivity in the process of electrolyte-plasma treatment of inner surfaces of tubular products. </p...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis presents research carried out {{as part of a}} project undertaken in fulfilment {{of the requirements}} of Loughborough University for the award of Philosophical Doctorate. The main focus of this research is to investigate and develop an appropriate level of automation to the existing manual finishing operations of small metallic components to achieve required surface quality and to remove superficial defects. In the manufacturing industries, polishing processes {{play a vital role in}} the development of high precision products, to give a desired surface finish, remove defects, break sharp edges, extend the working life cycle, and meet mechanical specification. The polishing operation is generally done at the final stage of the manufacturing process and can represent up to a third of the production time. Despite the growth automated technology in industry, polishing processes are still mainly carried out manually, due to the complexity and constraints of the process. Manual polishing involves a highly qualified worker polishing the workpiece by hand. These processes are very labour intensive, highly skill dependent, costly, error-prone, environmentally hazardous due to <b>abrasive</b> <b>dust,</b> and - in some cases - inefficient with long process times. In addition, the quality of the finishing is dependent on the training, experience, fatigue, physical ability, and expertise of the operator. Therefore, industries are seeking alternative solutions to be implemented within their current processes. These solutions are mainly aimed at replacing the human operator to improve the health and safety of their workforce and improve their competitiveness. Some automated solutions have already been proposed to assist or replace manual polishing processes. These solutions provide limited capabilities for specific processes or components, and a lack of flexibility and dexterity. One of the reasons for their lack of success is identified as neglecting the study and implementing the manual operations. This research initially hypothesised that for an effective development, an automated polishing system should be designed based on the manual polishing operations. Therefore, a successful implementation of an automated polishing system requires a thorough understanding of the polishing process and their operational parameters. This study began by collaborating with an industrial polishing company. The research was focused on polishing complex small components, similar to the parts typically used in the aerospace industry. The high level business processes of the polishing company were capture through several visits to the site. The low level operational parameters and the understanding of the manual operations were also captured through development of a devices that was used by the expert operators. A number of sensors were embedded to the device to facilitate recording the manual operations. For instance, the device captured the force applied by the operator (avg. 10 N) and the cycle time (e. g. 1 pass every 5 sec.). The capture data was then interpreted to manual techniques and polishing approaches that were used in developing a proof-of-concept Integrated Robotic Polishing System (IRPS). The IRPS was tested successfully through several laboratory based experiments by expert operators. The experiment results proved the capability of the proposed system in polishing a variety of part profiles, without pre-existing geometrical information about the parts. One of the main contributions made by this research is to propose a novel approach for automated polishing operations. The development of an integrated robotic polishing system, based on the research findings, uses a set of smart sensors and a force-position-by-increment control algorithm, and transpose the way that skilled workers carry out polishing processes...|$|E
