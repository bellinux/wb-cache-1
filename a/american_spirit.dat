5|$|In 2009, Raycom Media (owner of Honolulu-based NBC and MyNetworkTV affiliates, KHNL and KFVE) {{announced}} it would take over the operations of local CBS affiliate KGMB (then owned by MCG Capital Corporation), giving it control {{of three of the}} television stations in Hawaii. The deal was a complex arrangement which involved trading the non-license assets of KFVE (such as its call sign, programming, and network affiliation) for those of KGMB (effectively placing the station under Raycom ownership, but using KFVE's license, signal, and virtual channel 5), and taking over KFVE (which moved to the channel 9 license owned by MCG Capital) under a shared services agreement. Due to its nature, the swap was not a transaction that would require the intervention of the FCC, aside from the changing of call signs. The three stations were then folded into a shared news operation branded as Hawaii News Now. An estimated 68 positions from a total of 198 from the three stations would be eliminated as part of the agreement. On November 20, 2013, MCG Capital filed to sell KFVE to the aforementioned <b>American</b> <b>Spirit</b> Media.|$|E

25|$|The {{strip of}} land along the eastern seacoast was settled {{primarily}} by English colonists in the 17th century along with much smaller numbers of Dutch and Swedes.

25|$|Even {{with the}} wealth of perspectives, {{including}} the commander's, it is difficult if not impossible to tell exactly what occurred. It is clear, however, that the crew felt alienated by their commander, who {{might well have been}} motivated by his pride. Jones believed his intentions were honorable, and his actions were strategically essential to the Revolution. Regardless of any controversy surrounding the mission, Ranger's capture of Drake was one of the Continental Navy's few significant military victories during the Revolution, and was of immense symbolic importance, demonstrating as it did that the Royal Navy was far from invincible. By overcoming such odds, Ranger's victory became an important symbol of the <b>American</b> <b>spirit</b> and served as an inspiration for the permanent establishment of the United States Navy after the revolution.|$|E

500|$|By the {{declaration}} of the American Revolution, with George Washington as its military leader, a number of dietary changes had already occurred in America. Coffee was quickly becoming the normal hot drink of the colonies and a taste for whiskey had been acquired among {{many of those who}} could produce it. In fact, in 1774, the first corn was grown in Kentucky specifically for production of American Bourbon whiskey. This step may have established this <b>American</b> <b>spirit</b> in American culture, just as the country was going to war with England. [...] In addition to whiskey coming into favor, a shift began in the consumption of cider over beer. Colonists opted to grow less barley as it was easier to ferment apple cider than to brew beer. Another reason for this change would have been the lack of imported hops needed to brew beer.|$|E
500|$|For {{more than}} a century, the logo of the New York Herald-Tribune, and its later successor, the International Herald Tribune, {{featured}} a hand-drawn [...] "dingbat" [...] between the words Herald and Tribune, which first originated {{as part of the}} front page logotype of the Tribune on April 10, 1866. The [...] "dingbat" [...] was replaced with an all-text header beginning with the issue of May 21, 2008, to give a [...] "more contemporary and concise presentation that is consistent with our digital platforms." [...] The drawing included a clock in the center, set to 6:12p.m., and two figures on either side of it, a toga-clad thinker facing leftward and a young child holding an American flag marching rightward. An eagle spreading its wings was perched atop the clock. The dingbat served as an allegorical device to depict antiquity on the left and the progressive <b>American</b> <b>spirit</b> on the right. The significance of the clock's time remains a mystery.|$|E
500|$|Whaam! {{was one of}} the key works {{exhibited}} in a major Lichtenstein retrospective in 2012â€“2013 that was designed, according to Li-mei Hoang, to demonstrate [...] "the importance of Lichtenstein's influence, his engagement with art history and his enduring legacy as an artist". In his review of the Lichtenstein Retrospective at the Tate Modern, Adrian Searle of The Guardianâ€”who was generally unenthusiastic about Lichtenstein's workâ€”credited the work's title with accurately describing its graphic content: [...] "Whaam! goes the painting, as the rocket hits, and the enemy fighter explodes in a livid, comic-book roar." [...] Daily Telegraph critic Alastair Smart wrote a disparaging review in which he acknowledged Lichtenstein's reputation as a leading figure in [...] "Pop Art's cheeky assault on the swaggering, self-important Abstract Expressionists", whose works Smart said Whaam! mimicked by its huge scale. Smart said the work was neither a positive commentary on the fighting <b>American</b> <b>spirit</b> nor a critique, but was notable for marking [...] "Lichtenstein's incendiary impact on the US art scene".|$|E
