50|$|<b>Aceglutamide</b> (INN, JAN) (brand name Neuramina), or <b>aceglutamide</b> {{aluminum}} (JAN, USAN) (brand name Glumal), {{also known}} as acetylglutamine, is a psychostimulant, nootropic, and antiulcer agent that is marketed in Spain and Japan. It is an acetylated form of the amino acid L-glutamine, the precursor of glutamate {{in the body and}} brain. <b>Aceglutamide</b> functions as a prodrug to glutamine with improved potency and stability. <b>Aceglutamide</b> is used as a psychostimulant and nootropic, while <b>aceglutamide</b> aluminum is used in the treatment of ulcers. <b>Aceglutamide</b> can also be used as a liquid-stable source of glutamine to prevent damage from protein energy malnutrition. The drug has shown neuroprotective effects in an animal model of cerebral ischemia.|$|E
40|$|Background: Safflower extract and <b>aceglutamide</b> (SA) {{has been}} used {{clinically}} {{for the treatment of}} cerebrovascular diseases such as cerebral embolism, hemorrhage, and mental deterioration. This study aimed to investigate the effect and mechanism of SA injection in the recovery of peripheral innervations of diabetic mice. Methods: The C 57 BL/ 6 male mice were divided into four groups: normal control group (n = 44), diabetic group (n = 44), diabetic + SA group (diabetic mice treated with SA injection, n = 44), and diabetic + SA + vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1 -BL group (diabetic mice treated with SA injection and VEGFR 1 blocking antibody n = 24). The streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice model and injured peripheral nerve mice model were built. The mice with injured peripheral nerves were intraperitonealy administered with SA injection for successive 21 days. The corneal sensitivity, number of corneal nerve fibers, and contents of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -B and various neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in corneal tissue of four groups were observed. Results: The diabetic group showed decreased number of corneal nerve fibers, compared with the control group (P = 0. 002). And compared with the diabetic group, the diabetic + SA group showed {{a significant increase in the}} number of nerve fibers (P = 0. 024) and the contents of VEGF-B, NGF, and GDNF in the cornea (all P < 0. 05). However, when the diabetic mice were treated with the blocking antibodies specialized for VEGF-B receptor, the neutralization of VEGFR- 1 completely abolished the increased expression of NGF and GDNF stimulated by SA injection. Conclusions: SA injection could reduce the nerve injury caused by diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and its protective effect might be associated with the promotion of the expressions of VEGF-B, NGF, and GDNF...|$|E
