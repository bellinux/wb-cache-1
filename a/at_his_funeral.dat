5|$|According to Maple's account, in {{the last}} few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>funeral</b> there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E

Some 1,400people mourned Dr. Crane <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>funeral,</b> more than double the size of his congregation.

He next lived with his brother William, a lawyer, in Port Jervis for several years.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the state}} of anarchy being {{experienced}} by the city, Belgrano's death was largely unnoticed. The only newspaper of the time to note his death was El Despertador Teofilantrópico, written by Francisco de Paula Castañeda, and there was no government representation <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>funeral.</b> Former students of his educative institutions would arrive in the following days with obsequies, when the news started to be known. The following year the political context was less chaotic and Bernardino Rivadavia, who was minister by then, organised a massive state funeral.|$|E

During the cortège preceding the funeral in Springfield, Old Bob was caparisoned in a black mourning blanket trimmed with silver fringe and tassels. Henry Brown, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and friend of the Lincoln family, led Old Bob, whose spot in the procession was immediately behind the hearse {{and in front of}} the carriage carrying Robert Todd Lincoln. It has been said that Robert Lincoln and Old Bob were the only members of Lincoln's family present <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>funeral.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of his wife Jenny in December 1881, Marx {{developed}} a catarrh that kept him in ill health for the last 15 months of his life. It eventually brought on the bronchitis and pleurisy that killed him in London on 14 March 1883 (age 64), dying a stateless person. Family and friends in London buried his body in Highgate Cemetery (East), Highgate, London on 17 March 1883 in an area reserved for agnostics and atheists (George Eliot's grave is nearby). There were between nine and eleven mourners <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>funeral.</b>|$|E

5|$|Mateiu Caragiale {{died two}} years later in Bucharest, at the age 51, after {{suffering}} a stroke. Despite his explicit wish and opposition from his widow, speeches were held <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>funeral</b> ceremony, including ones by Alexandru Rosetti and Adrian Maniu. Rosetti and Eugen Lovinescu later recounted an unusual incident sparked by the event: Iancu Vulturescu, a friend of Caragiale's and frequenter of Casa Capșa, looked intensely upon the dead body as he was paying his respects; later in the evening, he committed suicide in a hotel room.|$|E
5|$|Newton died in {{his sleep}} in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727) and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton. After his death, Newton's hair was examined and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.|$|E

5|$|Tyler's {{death was}} the only one in presidential history not to be officially {{recognized}} in Washington, because of his allegiance to the Confederacy. He had requested a simple burial, but Confederate President Jefferson Davis devised a grand, politically pointed funeral, painting Tyler as a hero to the new nation. Accordingly, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>funeral,</b> the coffin of the tenth president of the United States was draped with a Confederate flag; he remains the only U.S. president ever laid to rest under a foreign flag.|$|E
