5|$|As {{the rate}} of cooling is {{increased}} the carbon will have less time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center <b>austenite</b> and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from <b>austenite</b> to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Ferrite (α-iron) is {{a fairly}} soft metal that can {{dissolve}} only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910°C). <b>Austenite</b> (γ-iron) is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146°C). This form of iron {{is used in the}} type of stainless steel used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.|$|E
5|$|Other {{materials}} are often {{added to the}} iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. Nickel and manganese in steel add to its tensile strength and make the <b>austenite</b> form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and vanadium also increases hardness while making it less prone to metal fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of <b>austenite</b> at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the <b>austenite</b> undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type of strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E
5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC <b>austenite</b> structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the <b>austenite</b> is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the <b>austenite</b> grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the cooling process is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E
5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} <b>austenite</b> phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the <b>austenite</b> in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does <b>austenite,</b> so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
25|$|At this stage, {{it is only}} {{slightly}} curved or may have no curve at all. The katanas gentle curvature is attained by a process of differential hardening or differential quenching: the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry, which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker, but generally composed of clay, water and any or none of ash, grinding stone powder, or rust. This process is called tsuchioki. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then quenched in water (few sword makers use oil to quench the blade). The slurry causes only the blade's edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro-structures in the steel. When steel with a carbon content of 0.7% is heated beyond 750°C, it enters the <b>austenite</b> phase. When <b>austenite</b> is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water, the structure changes into martensite, {{which is a very}} hard form of steel. When <b>austenite</b> is allowed to cool slowly, its structure changes into a mixture of ferrite and pearlite which is softer than martensite. This process also creates the distinct line down the sides of the blade called the hamon, which is made distinct by polishing. Each hamon and each smith's style of hamon is distinct.|$|E
500|$|Even in {{a narrow}} range of {{concentrations}} of mixtures of carbon and iron that make a steel, {{a number of different}} metallurgical structures, with very different properties can form. Understanding such properties is essential to making quality steel. At room temperature, the most stable form of pure iron is the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure called alpha iron or α-iron. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon, no more than 0.005% at [...] and 0.021 wt% at [...] The inclusion of carbon in alpha iron is called ferrite. At 910°C pure iron transforms into a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, called gamma iron or γ-iron. The inclusion of carbon in gamma iron is called <b>austenite.</b> The more open FCC structure of <b>austenite</b> can dissolve considerably more carbon, as much as 2.1% (38 times that of ferrite) carbon at , which reflects the upper carbon content of steel, beyond which is cast iron. When carbon moves out of solution with iron it forms a very hard, but brittle material called cementite (Fe3C).|$|E
500|$|After Williams {{completed}} several {{drafts of}} the screenplay, the company hired Kevin Hood {{to aid in}} further script development. Bernstein believed that Hood's past work contained [...] "a romantic sensibility... There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth which I thought was important for Jane." [...] Hood was attracted to the film because he believed [...] "the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice." [...] Calling Austen a [...] "genius" [...] and [...] "one of the top two or three prose writers of all time", Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy [...] "was absolutely essential in shaping her work." [...] Hood acknowledged however that Becoming Jane is [...] "based on the facts as they are known {{and the majority of}} characters did exist, as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film. Some have been fictionalised, weaving together what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters, creating a rich <b>Austenite</b> landscape." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{molten iron}} cools past its {{freezing}} point of 1538°C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, {{which has a}} body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure. As it cools further to 1394°C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, or <b>austenite.</b> At 912°C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope, or ferrite. Finally, at 770°C (the Curie point, Tc) iron's magnetic ordering changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, {{but there is a}} change in [...] "domain structure", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation; however, the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about 10micrometres across. This happens because the two unpaired electrons on each iron atom are in the dz2 and dx2 − y2 orbitals, which do not point directly at the nearest neighbors in the body-centered cubic lattice and therefore do not participate in metallic bonding; thus, they can interact magnetically with each other so that their spins align.|$|E

2500|$|For {{cast iron}} the {{equivalent}} carbon content (CE) concept {{is used to}} understand how alloying elements will affect the heat treatment and casting behavior. It {{is used as a}} predictor of strength in cast irons because it gives an approximate balance of <b>austenite</b> and graphite in final structure. The following formulas are used to determine the CE in cast irons: ...|$|E
5000|$|For a {{eutectoid}} steel (0.78% C), between 6 and 10% of <b>austenite,</b> called retained <b>austenite,</b> will remain. The percentage of retained <b>austenite</b> increases from insignificant {{for less than}} 0.6% C steel, to 13% retained <b>austenite</b> at 0.95% C and 30-47% retained <b>austenite</b> for a 1.4% carbon steels. A very rapid quench is essential to create martensite.|$|E
50|$|Although {{quenching}} steel {{causes the}} <b>austenite</b> to transform into martensite, {{all of the}} <b>austenite</b> usually does not transform. Some <b>austenite</b> crystals will remain unchanged even after quenching below the martensite finish (Mf) temperature. Further transformation of the <b>austenite</b> into martensite can be induced by slowly cooling the metal to extremely low temperatures. Cold treating generally consists of cooling the steel to around -115 ˚F (-81 ˚C), but does not eliminate all of the <b>austenite.</b> Cryogenic treating usually consists of cooling to much lower temperatures, often {{in the range of}} -315 ˚F (-192 ˚C), to transform most of the <b>austenite</b> into martensite.|$|E
50|$|TRIP steel has a {{microstructure}} {{consisting of}} retained <b>austenite</b> in a ferrite matrix. Apart from retained <b>austenite</b> it also contains hard phases like bainite and martensite. The higher silicon and carbon content of TRIP steels results in significant volume fractions of retained <b>austenite</b> {{in the final}} microstructure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{martensitic}} reaction begins during cooling {{when the}} <b>austenite</b> reaches the martensite start temperature (Ms) and the parent <b>austenite</b> becomes mechanically unstable. As {{the sample is}} quenched, an increasingly {{large percentage of the}} <b>austenite</b> transforms to martensite until the lower transformation temperature Mf is reached, at which time the transformation is completed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Austenite,</b> {{also known}} as gamma-phase iron (γ-Fe), is a metallic, {{non-magnetic}} allotrope of iron or a solid solution of iron, with an alloying element. In plain-carbon steel, <b>austenite</b> exists above the critical eutectoid temperature of 1000 K (727°C); other alloys of steel have different eutectoid temperatures. The <b>austenite</b> allotrope exists at room temperature in stainless steel. It is named after Sir William Chandler Roberts-Austen (1843-1902).|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} carbon determines the strain level at which the {{retained}} <b>austenite</b> begins to transform to martensite. At lower carbon levels, the retained <b>austenite</b> begins to transform almost immediately upon deformation, increasing the work hardening rate and formability during the stamping process. At higher carbon contents, the retained <b>austenite</b> is more stable and begins to transform only at strain levels beyond those produced during forming.|$|E
50|$|Heating {{white cast}} iron above 727 C causes the {{formation}} of <b>austenite</b> in crystals of primary cementite. This austenisation of white iron occurs in primary cementite at the interphase boundary with ferrite. When the grains of <b>austenite</b> form in cementite, they occur as lamellar clusters oriented along the cementite crystal layer surface. <b>Austenite</b> is formed by diffusion of carbon atoms from cementite into ferrite.|$|E
50|$|Early {{research}} on bainite found {{that at a}} given temperature only a certain volume fraction of the <b>austenite</b> would transform to bainite with the remainder decomposing to pearlite after an extended delay. This was the case {{despite the fact that}} a complete <b>austenite</b> to pearlite transformation could be achieved at higher temperatures where the <b>austenite</b> was more stable. The fraction of bainite that could form increased as the temperature decreased. This was ultimately explained by accounting for the fact that when the bainitic ferrite formed the supersaturated carbon would be expelled to the surrounding <b>austenite</b> thus thermodynamically stabilising it against further transformation.|$|E
50|$|Austempering is a {{hardening}} {{process that is}} used on iron-based metals to promote better mechanical properties. The metal is heated into the <b>austenite</b> region of the iron-cementite phase diagram and then quenched in a salt bath or other heat extraction medium that is between temperatures of 300 - 375 C. The metal is annealed in this temperature range until the <b>austenite</b> turns to bainite or ausferrite (bainitic ferrite + high-carbon <b>austenite).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of aluminium to Fe-high Mn TWIP steels {{is because it}} increases SFE significantly and therefore stabilizes the <b>austenite</b> against phase transformations which can occurs in the Fe-Mn alloys during deformation. Furthermore, it strengthens the <b>austenite</b> by solid-solution hardening.|$|E
5000|$|At high temperatures, nitinol assumes an interpenetrating simple cubic {{structure}} {{referred to}} as <b>austenite</b> (also known as the parent phase). At low temperatures, nitinol spontaneously transforms to a more complicated monoclinic crystal structure known as martensite (daughter phase). [...] There are four transition temperatures associated to the austenite-to-martensite and martensite-to-austenite transformations. Starting from full <b>austenite,</b> martensite begins to form as the alloy is cooled to the so-called martensite start temperature, or Ms, and the temperature at which the transformation is complete is called the martensite finish temperature, or Mf. When the alloy is fully martensite and is subjected to heating, <b>austenite</b> starts to form at the <b>austenite</b> start temperature, As, and finishes at the <b>austenite</b> finish temperature, Af.The cooling/heating cycle shows thermal hysteresis. The hysteresis width depends on the precise nitinol composition and processing. Its typical value is a temperature range spanning about 20-50 K (20-50 °C; 36-90 °F) {{but it can be}} reduced or amplified by alloying and processing.|$|E
50|$|The {{transition}} from the martensite phase to the <b>austenite</b> phase is only dependent on temperature and stress, not time, as most phase changes are, {{as there is no}} diffusion involved. Similarly, the <b>austenite</b> structure receives its name from steel alloys of a similar structure. It is the reversible diffusionless transition between these two phases that results in special properties. While martensite can be formed from <b>austenite</b> by rapidly cooling carbon-steel, this process is not reversible, so steel does not have shape-memory properties.|$|E
50|$|In many {{magnetic}} ferrous alloys, the Curie point, {{the temperature}} at which magnetic materials cease to behave magnetically, occurs at {{nearly the same}} temperature as the <b>austenite</b> transformation. This behavior is attributed to the paramagnetic nature of <b>austenite,</b> while both martensite and ferrite are strongly ferromagnetic.|$|E

50|$|The R-phase to <b>austenite</b> {{transformation}} (A-R) is reversible, with a {{very small}} hysteresis (typically 2-5 degrees C). It also exhibits a very small shape memory effect, and within a very narrow temperature range, superelasticity. The R-phase transformation (from <b>austenite)</b> occurs between 20 and 40 degrees C in most binary nitinol alloys.|$|E
50|$|By {{changing}} the temperature for austenitization, the austempering process can yield different and desired microstructures. A higher austenitization temperature {{can produce a}} higher carbon content in <b>austenite,</b> whereas a lower temperature produces a more uniform distribution of austempered structure. The carbon content in <b>austenite</b> {{as a function of}} austempering time has been established.|$|E
50|$|Austenitization {{means to}} heat the iron, iron-based metal, or steel to a {{temperature}} at which it changes crystal structure from ferrite to <b>austenite.</b> The more open structure of the <b>austenite</b> is then able to absorb carbon from the iron-carbides in carbon steel. An incomplete initial austenitization can leave undissolved carbides in the matrix.|$|E
5000|$|Tempering {{involves}} a three-step {{process in which}} unstable martensite decomposes into ferrite and unstable carbides, and finally into stable cementite, forming various stages of a microstructure called tempered martensite. The martensite typically consists of laths (strips) or plates, sometimes appearing acicular (needle-like) or lenticular (lens-shaped). Depending on the carbon content, it also contains {{a certain amount of}} [...] "retained austenite." [...] Retained <b>austenite</b> are crystals which are unable to transform into martensite, even after quenching below the martensite finish (Mf) temperature. An increase in alloying agents or carbon content causes an increase in retained <b>austenite.</b> <b>Austenite</b> has much higher stacking-fault energy than martensite or pearlite, lowering the wear resistance and increasing the chances of galling, although some or most of the retained <b>austenite</b> can be transformed into martensite by cold and cryogenic treatments prior to tempering.|$|E
5000|$|In the iron-carbon system (i.e. plain-carbon steels {{and cast}} irons) it {{is a common}} {{constituent}} because ferrite can contain at most 0.02wt% of uncombined carbon. Therefore, in carbon steels and cast irons that are slowly cooled, a portion of the carbon {{is in the form of}} cementite. [...] Cementite forms directly from the melt in the case of white cast iron. In carbon steel, cementite precipitates from <b>austenite</b> as <b>austenite</b> transforms to ferrite on slow cooling, or from martensite during tempering. An intimate mixture with ferrite, the other product of <b>austenite,</b> forms a lamellar structure called pearlite.|$|E

50|$|A Gamma loop is a loop about alloys of steel. When adding {{additives}} to iron, {{a stable}} zone of <b>austenite</b> may increase or decrease. Some additives decrease the <b>Austenite</b> stable zone. In this case, the phase boundary becomes a loop.
