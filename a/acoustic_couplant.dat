40|$|The phases in {{magnetic}} materials {{can be studied}} ultrasonically. Magnetic phase transition points can be determined from discontinuities in ultrasonic velocity {{as a function of}} temperature. Conventionally this is done using piezoelectric transducers (normally quartz) pulsed with a tone burst generator. Very accurate velocity measurements are required as the change in velocity is typically 1 part in 104 [1].

40|$|The use of {{non-contact}} ultrasonic {{techniques can}} have distinct advantages over conventional contact methods, allowing more rapid and practical scanning without suffering from variations introduced by an <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplant.</b> Non-contact ultrasonic testing {{can also be}} used for inspecting components on a production line. The system described here uses separate ultrasonic generation and detection techniques. Longitudinal waves are generated in a sample by means of a pulsed laser, and waves scattered from defects within the sample are used to identify the presence and location of simulated surface breaking cracks and side drilled holes. The longitudinal waves are detected using an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) on the same side as the ultrasonic generation point, located coaxial to the generation laser beam...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasound {{studies of}} single {{crystals}} of Er, Tm and alloys of Er-Tm {{were carried out}} {{as a function of}} temperature (4. 2 - 300 K) and applied magnetic field (0 - 5 T). The elastic constants of these materials were measured and anomalies in the elastic constants were observed. The ultrasound data were compared with reported results from other material characterisation techniques and the magnetic phases and transition temperatures of the materials were then identified. The effects of the application of magnetic field on the magnetic ordering of the materials were studied using the ultrasound method. In Er-Tm there was evidence of applied field (a-axis field and c-axis field) induced ordering in the cycloid phase and c-axis applied magnetic field of > 3 T resulted in the ferrimagnetic to ferromagnetic transition in Tm. A commercial ultrasound measurement system was modified and adapted for use in this work. The modified system enables the ultrasonic velocity and attenuation to be measured as a function of: (a) temperature, (b) applied magnetic field and (c) frequency. The present system was enhanced to work with less efficient ultrasonic transducers such as quartz and electromagnetic acoustic (EMAT) transducers. This work looked at the design and feasibility of using EMATs to generate ultrasound in single crystals of the rare earth metals and alloys. EMATs generating (a) in-plane radially polarised shear waves and (b) longitudinal waves were made and shown to work on these materials. The use of EMATs meant that ultrasound measurements could be conducted in the non-contact regime, i. e. no <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplant</b> is required between the sample and transducer. EMATs are particularly useful in this work where the sample and transducer are subjected to repeated temperature cycles over a wide temperature range (4. 2 to 300 K) and <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplant</b> can fracture. The EMAT acoustic coupling efficiency in these samples were studied as a function of temperature and applied magnetic field. Large increases in the EMAT acoustic coupling efficiency (combination of generation and detection efficiencies) often occur close to the magnetic phase transition temperatures of the samples.

40|$|Measurements of {{ultrasonic}} {{shear wave}} velocity {{as a function of}} temperature and applied magnetic field have been performed on single crystals of Er and Er 91. 6 %Tm 8. 4 %. Electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs) are used to generate and detect the in-plane radially polarized shear wave. The shear wave is propagated down the c axis of the hexagonal close packed single crystal samples. The EMAT acoustic coupling efficiency has been observed to increase close to the magnetic phase transition temperatures, showing the dominance of the magnetoelastic interactions over the applied-field-dependent Lorentz force mechanism in these samples. Measurement of the EMAT acoustic coupling efficiency is identified as a promising technique for identifying magnetic phase transitions.

40|$|Failure {{mechanism}} of power semiconductors is captured {{as a movie}} image under power stress to the device in non-destructive way. The new technique is realized by combining a high speed Scanning Acoustic Tomography (SAT/SAM) and electrical power supply circuit for applying the power stress to the device. Water as <b>acoustic</b> wave <b>couplant</b> in SAT system, {{which has been a}} major disadvantage of the system, is utilized as coolant for stressed power to the device. Major barriers to accomplish this system are a severe noise due to a local convection with the heat and a formation of tiny bubbles on the observation surface. These problems are solved by introducing water jet along the scanning interface. This technique enables “real-time” failure analysis. 23 rd European Symposium on Reliability of Electron Devices,.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Pulsed Ultrasound Velocimetry {{combined}} with Pressure Difference (PUV+PD) measurement is a non-invasive in-line rheometric technique {{which is used}} to analyse the complex flow properties of industrial fluids for quality control purposes. Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) and Technical Research Institute of Sweden (SP) have developed and patented a new PUV+PD based system, called Flow-Viz™. Despite this advancement, the system and ultrasound sensor technology have not been fully tested and evaluated {{in a wide range of}} industrial fluids. Acoustic characterisation tests were carried out at SP, with the aim of understanding the ultrasound beam properties after propagating through industrial stainless steel (316 L) pipe walls. For these tests, a high-precision robotic XYZ-scanner and needle hydrophone setup were used. Different ultrasound sensor configurations were mounted to a stainless steel pipe while using different coupling media between the transducer-to-wedge and sensor wedge-to-pipe boundaries. The ultrasound beam propagation after the wall interface was measured by navigating the needle hydrophone within a predefined 2 -dimensional spatial grid. The most suitable coupling material was determined from the acoustic characterisation, and then used in the in-line rheological characterisation tests to evaluate the performance of the Flow-VizTM rheometric unit against conventional tube viscometry. The in-line rheological tests were conducted with bentonite, kaolin and Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) model fluids. The flow loop used consisted of three different pipe test sections; and two concentrations of each fluid were tested in order to ascertain the consistency of the measurements. The in-line rheological tests showed good agreement (± 15 %) between the two techniques and Flow-VizTM was able to provide important data at very low shear rates. Acoustic characterisation indicated that variations in the beam properties were highly dependent on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplants</b> used to mount the sensors to the stainless steel pipes. Furthermore, the in-line results showed the effectiveness of Flow-VizTM as an industrial rheometer. The non-invasive ultrasound sensor technology, was for the first time acoustically characterised through stainless steel. This information will now be used to further optimise the unique technology for advanced industrial applications, e. g. oil drilling fields, complex cement grout and food processing applications...|$|R
40|$|Sonography is {{suitable}} for breast imaging {{not only because of}} its nonionizing-radiation, but also its cost-effectiveness and availability. The recently developed high-resolution scanners can provide much finer detail concerning the anatomical information of the breast parenchyma. Better diagnostic results can be therefore achieved.

40|$|Objectives:Determination of {{physical}} and mechanical characteristics and properties of thin-walled (0. 39 mm) expanded polytetrafluoroethylene stretch vascular prostheses by time-resolved scanning acoustic microscopy (TR-SAM). Materials and Methods:Samples of Stretch Gore-Tex® were mounted on polymethylmethaacrylate substrate, and ethyl alcohol was used as <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplant.</b> A 10 MHz ultrasound transducer mounted on a SAM 50 ® scanning acoustic microscope generated short, pulsed sound waves. Reflected signals were used for imaging and for computer analysis of time resolved wave forms acquired by a digital sampling oscilloscope to calculate physical and mechanical characteristics of the material. Results:Graft wall thickness: 0. 395 (0. 352 / 0. 401) mm; graft wall sound wave penetration velocity: 1111 (1083 / 1129) ms− 1; acoustic impedance: 3. 685 (2. 975 / 4. 370) 106 kg m− 3 s− 1; attenuation coefficient: 0. 144 (0. 096 / 0. 229) dB mm− 1 MHz− 1; material density: 3360 (2712 / 3982) kg m− 3; elastic stiffness: 4. 06 (3. 35 / 4. 83) GPa (median and (25 / 75) percentiles; n= 8 samples, 10 measurements spaced 100 μm apart in each sample).

40|$|EMATs {{have been}} used in {{ultrasonic}} based research for over 20 years [1, 2]. Improvements in permanent magnet technology and the required supporting electronic circuitry have made EMATs a realistic alternative to piezoelectric transducers in many applications. EMATs are limited to working on electrical conductors and are roughly three orders of magnitude less sensitive than PZT, so generally {{there has to be a}} special reason to use an EMAT in preference to a PZT. The scanning of an adhesively bonded plate is one of these areas where the EMAT should offer an improvement over tests done with conventional PZT transducers. The EMAT is a broadband device (5 MHz bandwidth centred on 5 MHz), giving it high spatial resolution in the direction of propagation, and is also a totally non-contact device, so no <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplant</b> is required. The most attractive feature of the EMAT used here in this work is that it generates radially polarised SH waves which should be more sensitive than longitudinal waves at normal incidence to a bonded interface. The design and construction of the EMAT will first be discussed and this will be followed by the presentation of various results obtained using the EMAT systems. EMATs {{have been used}} to probe bond integrity in the past [3, 4], but have to the best of the authors knowledge not been used in a broadband, true pulse-echo mode...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} a lot rock {{mechanics}} {{research has been}} conducted. One of the main subjects was the Excavation Damage Zone (EDZ). It was of importance because EDZ causes significant changes on mechanical properties, hydraulic conductivity, orientation of the stress field and many other parameters of rock around underground excavations. Some companies like ANDRA (Agence Nationale pour la Gestion des Déchets Radioactifs, France), UK NIREX (United Kingdom NIREX Limited) and SKB (Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co.) involved {{in the construction of}} underground spent nuclear fuel repositories have invested significant funds in these researches and extensive knowledge have been obtained in this field. However, most of the research has been concentrated on underground openings excavated with smooth blasting or TBM and very little has been done on drifts excavated in production conditions. Therefore the EDZ is of interest for LKAB (Swedish Co.) and it initiated a research project. Within that project the extent of EDZ was investigated by four different methods – Cross-Hole Seismic, Spectral Analyses of Surface Waves, Borehole Image Processing and Ultra-Sonic method. This thesis work deal with identification of extension of EDZ by diametrical measurements of p-wave velocity (Ultra-Sonic method) on rock cores delivered from the Kirunavaara mine. Diametrical measurements were carried out on cores from two types of rock – iron ore and host rock. To be able to pick up good <b>acoustic</b> signal a <b>couplant</b> have been used. Based on received data two types of analysis have been done – first analysis is based on coefficient of anisotropy, kv, and second is based on ration VPs/VPd. Results obtained during measurements revealed damage of rock in different scale, but the reason which caused that damage could not be identified. In heavily damaged rock the influence of couplant on results was noticed. For that reason some additional tests have been carried out – with saturated sample and Ultrasonic Gel as a couplant to see how large the influence is {{and to be able to}} estimate the real velocity of p-wave. Moreover there was a problem with getting signal on heavily damaged rock, therefore some study should be done to identify either it is problem of method or equipment. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
30|$|Some larvae or adults {{immediately}} began chewing the specimen {{after they were}} placed in the specimen; others were left still for as long as overnight to wait for chewing behavior to be observed. When the larva or adult began chewing the bamboo specimen, the AE sensor (R 15 α, Physical Acoustics Co., USA) with a resonant frequency of 150  kHz was attached to the end surface of the specimen which was closer to the beetle’s mouthparts than the other. This type of sensors was chosen because the use of sensors with resonant frequencies of 140 – 150  kHz has been common in the AE detection of insects [5 – 11, 14, 15]. A silicone grease was applied as an <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplant</b> between the specimen and the sensor. Because the sensor was insensitive to airborne noise, no sound-proof box was used in this experiment. The sensor was connected to the PC via an AE tester (AE 9501 A, NF Co., Japan) and a PC-oscilloscope (DSO- 2090 USB, Qingdao Hantek Electronic Co., Ltd., China). The AE signals from the sensor were amplified by 40 times and filtered by a high-pass filter with the cut-off frequency of 100  kHz. The signal waveform was acquired every time a trigger occurred and was displayed on the PC screen in real time. Because the trigger level was not constant, the threshold that defines an AE hit was later determined at 20.5  mV. Therefore, a signal that exceeded 20.5  mV was counted as an AE hit. The amplitude display range was 398  mV, meaning that parts of the waveforms that exceeded this range would not be displayed or measured.|$|E
40|$|Recent train accidents, {{associated}} {{direct and}} indirect costs, as well as safety concerns, have reaffirmed the need for developing rail defect detection systems more effective than those used today. Current methods for detecting internal flaws in rails rely primarily on ultrasonic pulse-echo technology operated in a water- filled wheel or sled. Presence and loss of echoes along each tested direction are analyzed in parallel to map surface and internal cracks in the rail. While this technology has served the industry well, several inherent weaknesses exist. Contact heads and cross-sectional inspection limit {{the speed of the}} measurement; liquid couplant is required to maintain efficient wave/echo transmission through the contact patch. Despite the <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplant,</b> significant transmission loss results from the pulse/echo passing through the contact patch twice. More importantly, ultrasonic beams launched vertically {{from the top of the}} rail head can miss internal defects located under horizontal shelling; this was the case, in the disastrous train derailment at Superior, WI in 1991. As a proposal to address these issues, the use of ultrasonic guide waves appears promising. One objective of this work is extending the fundamental knowledge of the guided wave propagation in rails by predicting modal and forced solutions in the high frequency (< 500 kHz) range. The selection of guided wave features sensitive to the presence of the different type of defects is essential for a successful defect detection performance. Another accomplishment of this work is the development of a rail defect detection prototype based on a laser/air-coupled ultrasonic technique. The prototype has been successfully tested twice in the field for the Federal Railroad Administration and it shows promise for implementation in rail inspection car...|$|E
30|$|To {{discuss the}} {{relationship}} of AE amplitude to larval head size and instars, AE signals generated by larvae of various body sizes were recorded, with the propagation distances kept constant. Four newly hatched first instar larvae and 13 larvae in middle or later instars were individually inoculated in bamboo specimens and the amplitude of AE hits were recorded. The head capsule widths of the first instar larvae were measured before AE measurement. The specimens [15 (L)[*]×[*] 20 (T) mm] were prepared from a single air-dry madake internode [6  mm (R) thick]. A longitudinal hole with a depth of 5  mm was made on one end surface of each specimen using a push pin or drill bits (φ 1.2 – 1.4  mm), depending on the larval body size, and a larva was placed in this hole. This resulted in a larva-to-sensor distance of 10  mm. Each specimen was placed vertically {{on the face of}} the AE sensor, with the inoculated end surface on top, with a silicone grease as an <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplant.</b> AE measurement was conducted using the AE system (DiSP with AEwin) in the environmental chamber for at least 2  h after the larva started feeding. The mean value of 12 maximum amplitude values recorded in 10 -min intervals during a 2 -h period was calculated for each larva. This value is also referred to as mean maximum amplitude. After AE measurement, each of the middle or later instar larvae was extracted and killed in 99.5 % ethanol. Because the head capsules of D. minutus larvae were partially hidden in the thoraces, except in the first instar, the head capsules of these extracted larvae were extruded from the thoraces to measure the widest part of the capsules.|$|E
30|$|The {{amplitude}} attenuation of longitudinally propagating {{elastic waves}} per unit distance {{was measured by}} inputting continuous waves into bamboo culms of different lengths. Three bamboo specimens [300  (L)[*]×[*] 20 (T) mm] were prepared from air-dry internodes of madake culms [6 – 7  mm (R) thick] at 8 – 9 % MC and with an air-dry density of 0.87 – 0.89  g/cm 3. Elastic waves were input from one end surface of each specimen, and the amplitude of the waves was measured {{at the other end}} surface. Then, the length of the specimen was shortened by 50  mm and the same procedure was repeated four times, until the specimen’s remaining length was 100  mm. The input signals of continuous sinusoidal waves with a frequency of 150  kHz were generated using a digital function generator (DF 1906, NF Corp., Japan) and were transduced and transmitted through a piezoelectric actuator (the same model as the AE sensors). To simulate AE waves generated by D. minutus larvae, a push pin was inserted into the end surface of the specimen, 2  mm below the inner surface, and the transmitter was fixed {{to the head of the}} push pin. A receiver AE sensor was attached to the other end surface of the specimen, and output signals detected by the receiver were acquired using an AE tester (AE 9501 A, NF Corp., Japan). A silicone grease was applied as an <b>acoustic</b> <b>couplant</b> between the transmitter and the push pin, and between the specimen and the receiver. The transmitter, the specimen, and the receiver were held together with a clamp. The amplitude of the output signals was displayed using a PC-oscilloscope (DSO- 2090 USB, Qingdao Hantek Electronic Co., Ltd., China). The measurement system is summarized in Fig.  3. The attenuation in dB/mm was calculated as the slope of the regression line relating the amplitude level of the output signals to the propagation distance (length of the specimen).|$|E
