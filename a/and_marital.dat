5|$|Artificial {{birth control}} predates Christianity; the Catholic Church has {{condemned}} these methods throughout its history. In {{response to the}} Church of England accepting the practice of artificial contraception in 1930, the Catholic Church issued the papal encyclical Casti connubii on 31 December 1930. The 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae is a reaffirmation of the Catholic Church's traditional view of marriage <b>and</b> <b>marital</b> relations, and a continued condemnation of artificial birth control.|$|E
5|$|Differences between Chinese and Khitan society {{included}} {{gender roles}} <b>and</b> <b>marital</b> practices: the Khitans {{took a more}} egalitarian view towards gender, {{in sharp contrast to}} Chinese cultural practices that segregated men's and women's roles. Khitan women were taught to hunt, managed family property, and held military posts. Many marriages were not arranged, women were not required to be virgins at their first marriage, and women had the right to divorce and remarry.|$|E

40|$|The aimed of this {{research}} was to analyze the difference, correlation, <b>and</b> influence of <b>marital</b> readiness, basic task, crisis task, and development task fulfillment of preschool families in Bubulak Village, Bogor District, West Java Province. Ninety families with preschool-aged children were chosen by simple random sampling. Data were collected by interviews and analyzed by descriptive, Pearson correlation, and multiple linear regression test. The results showed that wife marital readiness lower compared with husband <b>marital</b> readiness. Husband <b>and</b> wife <b>marital</b> readiness correlated with family tasks fulfillment. Husband <b>and</b> wife <b>marital</b> readiness also had a significant effect on family developmental tasks. Family developmental tasks <b>and</b> wife <b>marital</b> readiness influenced on child development. Husband <b>and</b> wife <b>marital</b> readiness also {{have a significant effect on}} the family crisis task.

5|$|One of {{the major}} issues are aspects of sharia (Islamic law) known as Muslim {{personal}} law (MPL) or Muslim family law. Some of the thorny issues regarding {{the way in which}} MPL has thus far been formulated include polygyny, divorce, custody of children, maintenance <b>and</b> <b>marital</b> property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.|$|E
5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length <b>and</b> <b>marital</b> status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{the brutal}} {{policies}} of the organization soon {{made their way to}} Phnom Penh and into the population foretelling the violence that was about to consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual <b>and</b> <b>marital</b> habits were foresworn. War was one thing, the offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was quite another. Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was no coincidence. The concentration of the PAVN effort on South Vietnam allowed the Khmer Rouge to apply their doctrine and policies without restraint for the first time.|$|E

5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital <b>and</b> <b>marital</b> abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E
