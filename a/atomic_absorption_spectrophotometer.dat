40|$|The {{estimation}} ofserum gold {{in patients}} with rheuma-toid arthritis treated with gold salts was first reported in detail by Freyberg, Block, and Levey (1941) and Freyberg, Block, and Wells (1942) using the colori-metric method of Block and Buchanan (1940). This method is cumbersome in that wet digestion is needed, a relatively large sample size is employed, and the concentrations found tend to be high when compared to procedures presently available. Neutron activation analysis for estimation of gold is the most sensitive method available, but few papers applying this method to the measurement of serum gold levels have been reported and in these {{only a small number}} of patients treated with gold have been studied (Brune, Samsahl, and Wester, 1966; Krusius, Markkanen, and Peltola, 1970; S 0 lvsten, 1964). This is probably due to the lengthy nature of the analysis, considerable expense, and the relative unavailability of suitable neutron sources and multi-channel analysers. <b>Atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy is ideal in many respects for the estimation of metals in biological fluids. The measurements are rapid with minimum sample preparation and the available instruments have adequate sensitivity for serum.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The use of gas jets in a {{sputtering}} cell {{makes this}} direct sampling method practical for <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> and mass spectrometry determinations. With a commercial six-jet sputtering source, the Atomsource (Analyte Corp., Grants Pass, Oregon), that directly atomizes solid samples for conventional <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrophotometers,</b> the sample loss rate for a Cu sample is 400 μg/min with a 0. 2 L/min gas flow rate, and 170 μg/min with no gas flow. With a single-jet glow discharge source, the gas jet increases the absorbance {{by a factor}} of 40. Studies of the electrical and spectral characteristics of this six-jet Atomsource and a similar single-jet glow discharge source have been made to help determine the mechanisms responsible for the increased absorbance and the increased sampling rate. A scanning electron microscope is used to investigate the effect of experimental parameters such as current density, sputter time, gas flow rate, and cathode base material on the microstructure of the cathode surface. The Atomsource is interfaced to the mass spectrometer of a VG PlasmaQuad ICP-MS, replacing the ICP. The pressure, current, anode voltage, sampling distance, and sampling cone hole size are optimized to obtain improved performance for analytical applications. With an optimized source, it is possible to determine elements at low concentrations that would be difficult to determine with ICP-MS. Three zirconium standards, one zircaloy standard, and one zircaloy sample were analyzed and the presence of 15 elements was determined. The average relative precision of measurement for 10 elements was better than 4 percent. In a multielement analysis the detection limits for 13 elements were lower than 0. 5 ppm, while single element determination improved the detection limits by an order of magnitude.

This study aimed at determining the concentration of heavy metals in soils, water and vegetables of Shhnama region in Shahroud. Methods: Vegetables studied included parsley, leek, leaf beet, fenugreek, cress, basil, radish and the coriander. The sampling was performed during 3 months, from September to October, 2008. The collected 180 samples of vegetables, water, soil, after preparation by <b>atomic</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>Spectrophotometers,</b> were analyzed according to standard methods. Results: Mean concentration values of lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic and zinc in vegetable samples were, respectively 23. 99, 2. 09, 5. 4, 5. 26, 168. 4 micrograms per gram of plant tissue. Mean concentrations of heavy metals in water were, respectively, 7. 55, 4. 85, 0. 78, 12. 83 and 347. 99 mg per liter in water samples. Mean concentrations of heavy metals in soil were, respectively, 81. 12, 14. 43, 134. 32, 19. 08 and 435 micrograms, per gram of soil sample. Comparing the mean concentration values for heavy metals available in vegetables, water and soil with standard values, significant differences are observed except for Zn.
