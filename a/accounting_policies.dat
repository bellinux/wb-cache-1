The audit of the sorority led to findings that supported the claims in the previous lawsuit. The audit also found two former officials continued to use sorority credit cards after their service ended, failing to appropriately document charges. Another lawsuit against the organization, the former president McKinzie and other officials contained similar allegations. The audit found that McKinzie and the other officials secretly created {{a second set of}} financial books to get around the sorority's <b>accounting</b> <b>policies.</b> According to the audit, [...] "(n)early $1.7 million in payments were made to the former president, Barbara McKinzie, without authorization. Approximately $282,000 in credit card charges on a second set of books appear to be fraudulent, including personal charges the sorority wasn't reimbursed for." [...] The sorority later expelled McKinzie and won an arbitration award of $ 1.6 million against her, which (as of January 2017) was challenged by McKinzie in court.|$|E

30|$|Several studies {{focus on}} {{accounting}} identification, accounting measurement, and <b>accounting</b> <b>policy.</b> The basis of accounting identification is accrual accounting, butliterature raises {{the concept of}} cash flow based accounting, adjusted from cash based accounting, that could provide more useful information for decision making and solve the limitations of accrual based accounting. For accounting measurement, Lin (1997) investigates the relationship between uncertainty and accounting which argues that accounting has a time-lag and that uncertainty comes from monetary measurement. Xie (1997) presents two non-monetary asset measure models on the labor theory of value and marginal utility theory of value which {{are different from the}} capital preservation concept of accounting. Meanwhile, with the development of financial derivatives, Huang (1997 a) believes that historical cost accounting will be replaced by fair value accounting in the twenty-first century and briefly introduces the concept of fair value accounting in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). With respect to <b>accounting</b> <b>policy,</b> Huang and Yang (1995) explore questions such as what is <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> and why there is <b>accounting</b> <b>policy.</b> They regard <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> as the principle, procedure and method by which a certain accounting unit is used to make financial statements, including macro-level <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> such as <b>accounting</b> standards, and firm-level <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> issued by the firms themselves according to their particular situations. Consistent with Huang and Yang (1995), Li and Zhu (1996) argue that accounting environment and firm operation should be taken into consideration for the choice of <b>accounting</b> <b>policy.</b> As well, Huang and Yang (1996) investigate <b>accounting</b> <b>policy</b> in details, that is the separation between financial accounting and tax <b>accounting</b> in <b>accounting</b> <b>policy.</b> Financial <b>accounting</b> and tax accounting are separated due to different objectives, legislative authority and calculation principles. Compared with accounting development internationally, Tang and Lu (1997) put forward the challenge for financial accounting in China, including accounting identification, accounting measurement, financial reporting, accounting theory, the release and diffusion of accounting information, and the combination of financial accounting and managerial accounting.|$|R
