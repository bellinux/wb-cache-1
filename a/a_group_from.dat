5|$|After {{a drunken}} and violent fight with Graham in 1938, Scott {{returned}} to Asheville. <b>A</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> Zelda's hospital {{had planned to}} go to Cuba, but Zelda had missed the trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The trip was a disaster even by their standards: Scott was beaten up {{when he tried to}} stop a cockfight and returned to the United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized. The Fitzgeralds never saw each other again.|$|E
5|$|Australian ornithologist Dom Serventy {{visited the}} island in 1945 but left no {{published}} account. In 1959, <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> the University of Western Australia's Department of Zoology, accompanied by the English botanist Mary Gillham, travelled to the island; a brief article on its physiography, vegetation and vertebrate fauna was published the following year by Glen Storr. More recent visitors have included P. R. Howden in 1974, Robert Ivan Taylor Prince in 1976, Ronald Eric Johnstone in 1981 and 1983, Phillip Fuller in 1992, and Judith Harvey and Vanda Longman in 1999.|$|E

50|$|Phosphorylases {{should not}} be {{confused}} with phosphatases, which remove phosphate groups.In more general terms, phosphorylases are enzymes that catalyze the addition of <b>a</b> phosphate <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> inorganic phosphate (phosphate + hydrogen) to an acceptor, not to be confused with a phosphatase (a hydrolase) or a kinase (a phosphotransferase). A phosphatase removes <b>a</b> phosphonate <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> donor using water, whereas a kinase transfers <b>a</b> phosphonate <b>group</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> donor (usually ATP) to an acceptor.|$|R

5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 6June1944, Albermarle {{aircraft}} arrived, carrying the brigade's pathfinders, a company from the 1st Canadian Battalion {{to clear the}} drop zone (DZ) of obstructions, <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> each battalion, and brigade headquarters. Some planes got lost and failed to reach the DZ or arrived late. Others were damaged before dropping all their paratroops and turned back, and one returned to base after failing to find the drop zone at all.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California {{at least two}} million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an ice age. One million years ago, <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps {{at the same time}} as humans.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{announced}} that Aruban authorities had provided its agency with documents, suspect interviews, and other evidence.

5|$|The Norwegian-born Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevink had {{emigrated to}} Australia in 1888, {{where he worked}} on survey teams in Queensland and New South Wales before {{accepting}} a schoolteaching post. In 1894 he joined a sealing and whaling expedition to the Antarctic, led by Henryk Bull. In January 1895 Borchgrevink was one of <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> that expedition that claimed the first confirmed landing on the Antarctic continent, at Cape Adare. Borchgrevink determined to return with his own expedition, which would overwinter and explore inland, with {{the location of the}} South Magnetic Pole as an objective.|$|E
5|$|Theoretically, other true {{compounds}} may be possible, such as helium fluorohydride (HHeF) {{which would}} be analogous to HArF, discovered in 2000. Calculations show that two new compounds containing a helium-oxygen bond could be stable. Two new molecular species, predicted using theory, CsFHeO and N(CH3)4FHeO, are derivatives of a metastable FHeO− anion first theorized in 2005 by <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> Taiwan. If confirmed by experiment, the only remaining element with no known stable compounds would be neon.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day there was still no signs of the {{expected}} German ground attack. That night was also uneventful but just after stand to on 8 June, German infantry were observed advancing through the woods to their front. Holding fire until the last minute, the Germans were beaten back but ATroop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw. That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting CTroop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and DTroop moved down the road to deal with them. Outnumbered two to one DTroop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|In June 1963 the Spokane Comets Western Hockey League {{franchise}} {{was purchased}} by a group led by the Maple Leafs, who relocated them to become the Denver Invaders and act as the Leaf's farm team. Though the league did not acknowledge that the Maple Leafs had an ownership stake in the team, they held a majority position with the Denver partners only owning roughly 36%. Following reported losses of $150,000 in their first season, Smythe announced that the team would be relocated after the team failed to reach a 2,000 season ticket target by a league-imposed deadline. The team became the Victoria Maple Leafs for the following season. In June 1967 MLGL sold the team for $500,000 to <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> Phoenix, which relocated it to become the Phoenix Roadrunners.|$|E
5|$|In late 2000, Wail {{traveled}} to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9/11 Commission believes {{that three of the}} future muscle hijackers, including Wail and Waleed, traveled in <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, 1879, <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> Leadville struck {{gold in the}} {{uppermost}} Roaring Fork valley below the pass. Four miles (6.4km) to the west, they established a settlement in the upper Roaring Fork Valley that eventually took the name Independence from the holiday on which it was established. The pass, the lake from which the Roaring Fork rises and another nearby mountain all took that name as well. The Twin Lakes and Roaring Fork Toll Company, established to build a road through to the camps in the lower Roaring Fork Valley, improved the original path over the pass sufficiently enough by 1880 that horses {{could be used for}} the trip.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after dark, around 7:00p.m., {{the first}} Ottoman counterattack came after <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> the 1st Battalion, 57th Regiment, under Major Zeki Bey, arrived to {{reinforce}} the battalions of the 47th. Attacking with hand grenades, the fighting {{took place in the}} complicated maze of the former Ottoman trench system. The close quarters meant that some of the grenades would travel back and forth up to three times before exploding. The Australians held the old Ottoman fire trench and had footholds deeper in Ottoman lines. They blocked the Ottoman communications trenches as best they could, often with the bodies of the dead, to thwart raids. Other bodies were moved to unused communication trenches and saps, and where possible the wounded were evacuated, however, the fighting was so intense, the conditions so cramped and the men so exhausted that in many cases they were left to lie {{at the bottom of the}} trench.|$|E
5|$|The Las Vegas {{situation}} {{was one of}} a bevy of developments that absorbed the league in the 1994 to 1995 offseason. The team was not officially disbanded until April 1995 but not before the league damaged its credibility by twice giving provisional approval to a relocation to Jackson, Mississippi, {{to the point where the}} Mississippi team was included on the 1995 internal schedule and had hired a general manager and coaching staff, only to have the deal collapse amid squabbles with the Las Vegas corporation that owned the Posse. <b>A</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> Miami, Florida tried to convince the league to let it buy the remains of the Posse and move them to South Florida as the Miami Manatees in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew a decent crowd just above 20,000.|$|E
5|$|At 15:15 Lalor {{left the}} defence of The Nek to a platoon that had arrived as reinforcements, and moved his company to Baby 700. There he joined <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> the 2nd Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Leslie Morshead. Lalor was killed soon afterwards. The left flank of Baby 700 was now held by sixty men, {{the remnants of}} several units, commanded by a corporal. They had survived five charges by the Turks between 07:30 and 15:00; after the last charge the Australians were ordered to withdraw through The Nek. There, a company from the Canterbury Battalion had just arrived, with their commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Stewart. By 16:00 the New Zealand companies had formed a defence line on Russell's Top. On Baby 700, there was on the left Morsehead's and Lalor's men, {{and at the top}} of Malone's Gulley were the survivors of the 2nd Battalion and some men from the 3rd Brigade. On the right were the men left from the Auckland companies, and a mixed group from the 1st, 2nd, 11th and 12th Battalions. Once Stewart's men were secure, he ordered Morsehead to withdraw. During a Turkish artillery bombardment of The Nek, Stewart was killed. The artillery heralded the start of a Turkish counter-attack; columns of troops appeared over the top of Battleship Hill and on the flanks and attacked the ANZAC lines.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} layers at Mummy Cave {{yielded a}} few prismatic stone blades dating to about 7300BC. Several layers contained no artifacts and were defined by soot layers. By layer6 the first parallel-oblique points appeared. By Layer8, roughly corresponding to 6500BC, the cultural evidence became continuous. Layers8, 9, 10 and 12 produced lanceolate or leaf-shaped projectile points {{which have been}} interpreted as corresponding to Angostura-style points. This implies that the inhabitants of Mummy Cave during this era were big-game hunters from the Great Plains who adapted to the mountain environment. In layer16, radiocarbon dated to 5630BC, {{a new type of}} point appeared. These Blackwater side-notched points implied the arrival of <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> eastern Nebraska or western Iowa, replacing the previous group which may have moved to the north. The presence of such points suggests a connection with the Simonsen Site in northeastern Iowa, which has been dated to the Early Archaic period. This transition coincided with the climatic shift to the Altithermal. Side-notched points recovered from layers21, 24 and 28 imply a return of the previous inhabitants; the easterners had moved on to the central Columbian Plateau.|$|E
5|$|While {{the north}} and south faces of Adams are climbed easily, the west and east faces of the {{mountain}} were deemed impossible to climb because of the steep cliffs and ice cascades. To some, this assumption was a challenge and for years, C. E. Rusk searched for a way to climb the east face. On one of these excursions, in 1919, Rusk named the Wilson Glacier, Victory Ridge, and the Roosevelt Cliff. It was on this trip that Rusk decided that the Castle held the easiest route up. In 1921, 67 years after the first ascent of Adams, <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>from</b> the Cascadians mountaineering club, led by Rusk, completed the first ascent of the precipitous east face of the mountain. Their route took them up the Rusk Glacier, onto Battlement Ridge, up and over The Castle, and across the vast, heavily crevassed eastern side of the summit ice cap. One of the party, Edgar E. Coursen, said that the route was “thrilling to the point of extreme danger.” Others in the party were Wayne E. Richardson, Clarence Truitt, Rolland Whitmore, Robert E. Williams, and Clarence Starcher. Three years later, in 1924, a group of three men from the Mazamas finally climbed the west face of Adams. This route is straightforward, but made difficult by icefalls, mud slips, and easily started rock avalanches.|$|E
