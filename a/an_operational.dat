5|$|At {{the opening}} of 1987, {{the last year of}} the war, the Libyan expeditionary force was still impressive, {{comprising}} 8,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, many multiple rocket launchers (rocket artillery) and regular artillery pieces, Mi-24 helicopters and sixty combat aircraft. These forces did not have a unified command, but were divided into <b>an</b> <b>Operational</b> Group South, active in the Tibesti with 2,500 men, and <b>an</b> <b>Operational</b> Group East, centered in Faya-Largeau.|$|E

5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} transmitters to work in <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, interceptor, and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the basic concept was considered unworkable as <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> system, and all effort moved to designs with both the transmitter and receiver in the interceptor aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50Â°. Although subtropical storms rarely have hurricane-force winds, they may become tropical in nature as their cores warm. From <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> standpoint, a tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|As well as <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> {{aircraft}} carrier, Melbourne was Flagship of the RAN, a role {{she received}} almost immediately following her 1956 arrival in Australia, and fulfilled until her decommissioning in 1982. During her service, the carrier was deployed overseas on 35 occasions, visited over 22 countries, and {{was seen as}} the physical and psychological centrepiece of the RAN fleet.|$|E

5|$|In April 1962, McNamara {{asked the}} Nike team to {{consider}} using the Zeus site on Kwajalein as <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> anti-satellite base after the main Zeus testing had completed.

5|$|On 28 January 2008, {{the drive}} shaft of a Danish AW101 broke, {{leading to an}} {{emergency}} landing at Billund Airport. Following the incident, the Danish fleet was grounded as a precaution and the AW101's future was publicly debated. In {{the first six months}} of 2008, the RDAF reported <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> availability of roughly 50%, well below the target of 80%, partly due to an inadequate maintenance organisation and staff shortages.|$|E

5|$|When {{accepted}} into <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> squadron, the candidates must complete the SBS Swimmer Canoeist Course, SC3 Course. The course lasts {{for several months}} and covers long distance Dives, Swims and Kayaks in open sea, often in poor weather. Underwater demolitions, Maritime counter terrorism, are also practised. On completing SBS troopers will be put on one year probation.|$|E

Each division's staff performed regular readiness reviews on each assigned cutter; riding with the crews to judge their effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|After {{the closing}} in 1991 the {{foundation}} Stiftelsen Rjukanbanen {{was established to}} ensure that the railway remained in <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> condition, and kept the two railway ferries and some of the rolling stock in operational condition. Norsk Transport retained for a period maintenance of the Rjukan Line, while the Tinnoset Line remained part of the rail network maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The foundation operated ad-hoc charter services on both the Tinnoset Line and the Rjukan Line, as well as with both railway ferries. By 2004 the foundation had run out of money, and closed down.|$|E
5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> amplifier.|$|E
5|$|As {{the program}} (and PAVN air defences) evolved, {{so did the}} relay aircraft. The EC-121Rs and their crews proved too {{vulnerable}} and were partly replaced in 1969 and 1970 by QU-22Bs (modified Beech A-36 Bonanzas) which were to be remotely piloted, and which had undergone primary mission equipment and PME flight tests at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in 1968. The aircraft suffered from mechanical difficulties, however, and were never flown during <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> mission without a pilot. They were replaced by C-130B models in December 1971.|$|E

5|$|At the 2014 Wales summit, {{the leaders}} of NATO's member states reaffirmed their pledge to spend the {{equivalent}} of at least 2% of their gross domestic products on defense. In 2015, five of its 28 members met that goal. On 15 June 2016, NATO officially recognized cyberwarfare as <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> domain of war, just like land, sea and aerial warfare. This means that any cyber attack on NATO members can trigger Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Montenegro became the 29th and newest member of NATO on 5 June 2017, amid strong objections from Russia.|$|E
5|$|In August 1941, No. 450 Squadron {{personnel}} were separated from No. 260 Squadron, when the latter received its own ground crew. No. 450 Squadron moved to Rayak airfield, Lebanon, {{where it was}} allocated Hurricanes and Miles Magister trainers. A batch of 20 trainee Australian, British and Canadian pilotsâthe majority being Australianâwere posted to the squadron in early October, and it began duties as <b>an</b> <b>Operational</b> Training Unit. A fortnight later these pilots were posted out and, lacking trained pilots, the squadron's aircraft were re-allocated. On 20 October, the squadron moved to Burg El Arab, Egypt, and began operating as an advanced repair, salvage and service unit, {{taking part in the}} North African Campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its pilot training responsibilities, No.79 Squadron's Operations Flight provides aircraft to support Navy and Army training exercises. These duties are undertaken by experienced pilots who did not successfully complete operational conversion training, and also by new pilots who have completed training with No.76 Squadron and been posted back to No.79 Squadron until a place becomes available in <b>an</b> <b>operational</b> conversion course. No.76 Squadron has a similar Operations Flight. Most of No. 79 Squadron's exercises with the Navy take place {{off the coast of}} Western Australia, but aircraft are occasionally deployed to Darwin for this task.|$|E
