50|$|Counterbalance valves {{are in fact}} {{a special}} type of pilot {{controlled}} <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> Whereas the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is open or closed, the counterbalance valve acts {{a bit like a}} pilot controlled flow control.|$|R
50|$|A {{duckbill}} <b>valve</b> is a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> {{in which}} flow proceeds through a soft tube that protrudes into the downstream side. Back-pressure collapses this tube, cutting off flow.|$|R

30|$|The {{direction}} of the flow in the network (i.e., in each edge) is given by {{the solution of the}} numerical model (after solving the system of equations). However, in some flowlines (typically those connected directly to the wells) there are sometimes non-return <b>valves</b> (<b>check</b> <b>valves)</b> or certain type of equipment (e.g., pumps or compressors) that allow only one preferential flow direction (from the well). This is reason why the graph is both directed and undirected. In the present work, all pipes or connectors coming out of wells have an outwards preferential direction. Similarly, all pipes or connectors coming into a separator have an inwards preferential direction.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 39 The working {{mechanism}} and {{life expectancy of}} <b>automatic</b> pump <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> which are important for the operational safety of oscillating displacement pumps, are closely examined. A calculation process for {{the determination of the}} valve kinematic and pressure losses is discussed, which is based on hydrodynamic coefficients. These coefficients are dependent on the Reynolds number. It also is based on the force equilibrium exerted on the active valve body. It is shown that a numerical calculation can correctly determine closing delay, closing speed and valve pressure losses for Newtonian liquids. A design strategy is shown for the prognosis of life expectancy of <b>automatic</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> It is based on the tribometric simulation in a tamping tribometer. Field tests have shown that the tribometric simulation is close to reality. However, the tribosystem must necessarily be operated in its stable range to eliminate radial erosion. In addition to the relative hardness of the construction material or to the abrasive particles, the SAR-Number, which should be smaller than 90 - 100, is an important indicator. The investigations are a substantial contribution to the design improvement of <b>automatic</b> pump <b>check</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valves</b> {{are often}} used with some types of pumps. Piston-driven and {{diaphragm}} pumps such as metering pumps and pumps for chromatography commonly use inlet and outlet ball <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> These valves often look like small cylinders attached to the pump head on the inlet and outlet lines. Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> such as ball <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> The feed pumps or injectors which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> to prevent back-flow.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> clack valve, {{non-return}} valve, reflux valve, or one-way valve is a valve {{that normally}} allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it {{in only one}} direction.|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} throttle <b>valve</b> {{connected to}} <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is called one way flow control valve, while air passes from one direction to other the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> {{will not allow}} the air flow (As the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> allows flow only in one direction) while through the restricted way of throttle compressed air flow takes place. While the air comes out from other way both the ways of throttle {{as well as the}} <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> opens to pass the compressed air therefore the piston moment in one direction can be controlled.|$|R
5000|$|A ball <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> {{in which}} the closing member, the movable part to block the flow, is a ball. In some ball <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> the ball is {{spring-loaded}} to help keep it shut. For those designs without a spring, reverse flow is required to move the ball toward the seat and create a seal. The interior surface of the main seats of ball <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> {{are more or less}} conically-tapered to guide the ball into the seat and form a positive seal when stopping reverse flow.|$|R
5000|$|An in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> {{similar to}} the lift <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> However, this valve {{generally}} has a spring that will 'lift' when there is pressure on the upstream side of the valve. The pressure needed on the upstream side of the valve to overcome the spring tension is called the 'cracking pressure'. When the pressure going through the valve goes below the cracking pressure, the spring will close the valve to prevent back-flow in the process.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{efficient}} computation of hydraulic switching systems with a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> by a mixed time–frequency domain method; frequency-domain modelling is per-formed on the wave propagation in a pipe and time-domain modelling {{is applied to the}} switching <b>valve</b> and the <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> The dual property of the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> makes the complete problem have variational inequality properties. A solution method is presented which replaces the pressure and the flowrate of the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> as a function of one new variable. The resulting system of non-linear algebraic equations is solved using a Newton–Raphson method in combination with a smoothing of the non-smooth properties of the <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> The method is applied to a parameter study of a hydraulic buck converter...|$|R
50|$|A stop-check <b>valve</b> is a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> with {{override}} control to stop flow regardless of flow direction or pressure. In addition to closing {{in response to}} backflow or insufficient forward pressure (normal check-valve behavior), {{it can also be}} deliberately shut by an external mechanism, thereby preventing any flow regardless of forward pressure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> are {{required}} to prevent back pressure. Regulations for these <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> specify the design capabilities of the valve used, according to the hazard. Category 2 contamination may be prevented by a single <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> but category 3 requires a double <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> (these are manufactured as a convenient single unit, or even integrated into tap (faucet) fittings). Category 5 requires an air gap, not merely a valve. A recent introduction to the UK has been the Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) valve, a form of double <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> where the intervening zone is drained and normally kept empty. If the downstream valve leaks and permits backflow, this will drain out through the vent rather than building up pressure against the upstream valve. These valves are complex, requiring certified installation and annual checks. They are used for category 4 systems, such as fire sprinklers where the system has an antifreeze additive.|$|R
50|$|By a wide margin, wet pipe {{sprinkler}} systems are installed {{more often than}} all other types of fire {{sprinkler systems}}. They also are the most reliable, because they are simple, with the only operating components being the automatic sprinklers and (commonly, but not always) the <b>automatic</b> alarm <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> An <b>automatic</b> water supply provides water under pressure to the system piping.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{study is}} focused on the flow analysis within the concentric in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> In-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is part of the pipe and shut off the stream of fluid. In case that backflow occurs on the downstream side, the valve is fully or partially lifted and then abruptly closes. This effect brings undesirable pressure shocks in the entire system. The study therefore deals with the CFD analysis of steady and unsteady flow with respect to velocity and pressure field. Especially unsteady calculation mode reflects the influence of local inertial acceleration acting on the fluid and on the valve. Analysis is complemented by equation of motion of a valve which interacts with the fluid...|$|R

40|$|Common-cause failure (CCF) {{events can}} {{significantly}} impact {{the availability of}} safety systems of nuclear power plants. For this reason, the International Common Cause Data Exchange (ICDE) project was initiated by several countries in 1994. Since 1997 it has been operated within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) /Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) framework and has successfully been operated over six consecutive terms (the current term being 2015 – 2017). The ICDE project allows multiple countries to collaborate and exchange CCF data to {{enhance the quality of}} risk analyses, which include CCF modeling. As CCF events are typically rare, most countries do not experience enough CCF events to perform meaningful analyses. Data combined from several countries, however, have yielded sufficient data for more rigorous analyses. The ICDE project has meanwhile published 11 reports on the collection and analysis of CCF events of specific component types (centrifugal pumps, emergency diesel generators, motor operated valves, safety and relief <b>valves,</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> circuit breakers, level measurement, control rod drive assemblies, and heat exchangers) and two topical reports.

40|$|This study {{systematically}} {{explores the}} relatively neglected surge protection strategy of installing an in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> at an intermediate point within a pipeline. The in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is selected to isolate {{part of the}} system from a high-pressure source of fluid subsequent to a low-pressure water hammer event, in this way greatly reducing or eliminating any return surge. A typical application involving a pipeline with an isolated high point within its profile is numerically investigated. The low pressure transient event first opens an air-vacuum valve at the line’s high point. However, the violent expulsion and collapse of this air cavity is thereafter avoided, and thus the resulting water hammer pressures dramatically reduced, by an in-line <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> installed between the high point and the downstream reservoir. The effectiveness of the surge protection is shown to depend on hydraulics and topology of the line (particularly the position of the high point), on the position of the <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> and on both the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> Although the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> only protects the lower (normally upstream) portion of the line from the return surge, the transient response of the remainder of the line can sometimes be improved through installing either a bypass around the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> or by perforating the <b>check</b> <b>valve’s</b> working element. The role and function of any pressure-relieving function at the valve is also numerically investigated and is shown to be a compromise between upstream and downstream protection. Bryan W.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper the first ex vivo {{implantation}} results of our minimally invasive glaucoma drainage device (GDD.) The GDD is designed to treat glaucoma patients by draining out their extraneous aqueous humor out of the anterior chamber utilizing a MEMS micro-fluidic normally closed (NC) <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> The NC <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is encapsulated in protective tubing made from parylene C, which has been proved to be biocompatible in implantation.

Pre-implanted characterization curve demonstrates a cracking pressure of 10 – 20 mmHg of the NC <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> which agrees with our theoretical design. Ex vivo implantation results show that cracking pressure is measured as 24 mmHg by unloading the eye pressure.

50|$|A swing <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> or tilting disc <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> {{in which}} the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening {{cross-section}} may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although swing <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> can come in various sizes, large <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> are often swing <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism {{is an example of}} this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.|$|R
30|$|The kick {{injection}} system {{is made up}} of an air compressor supply, a gas flow meter, a pressure sensor, a solenoid <b>valve,</b> and a <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> The air compressor compresses air into an air pressure vessel and automatically shuts off at a pre-programmed pressure. The pressure vessel is equipped with a valve and a pressure gauge to discharge the pressured air and monitor the pressure in the vessel respectively during the experiment. The air pressure in the vessel is maintained between 120 and 150  psi.|$|R
5000|$|A lift-check <b>valve</b> is a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> {{in which}} the disc, {{sometimes}} called a lift, can be lifted up off its seat by higher pressure of inlet or upstream fluid to allow flow to the outlet or downstream side. A guide keeps motion of the disc on a vertical line, so the valve can later reseat properly. When the pressure is no longer higher, gravity or higher downstream pressure will cause the disc to lower onto its seat, shutting the valve to stop reverse flow.|$|R
