40|$|The {{construction}} of multigrid operators for disordered linear lattice operators, {{in particular the}} fermion matrix in lattice gauge theories, by means of algebraic multigrid and block LU decomposition is discussed. In this formalism, the effective coarse-grid operator is obtained as the Schur complement of the original matrix. An optimal approximation to it is found by a numerical optimization procedure akin to Monte Carlo renormalization, resulting in a generalized (gauge-path dependent) stencil that is easily evaluated for a given disorder field. <b>Applications</b> to preconditioning <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> methods are investigated.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the <b>application</b> of penalty <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> methods {{to the problem}} of optimal placement and operation of control valves in water supply networks, where the minimization of average zone pressure is the objective. The optimization framework considers both the location and settings of control valves as decision variables. Hydraulic conservation laws are enforced as nonlinear constraints and binary variables are used to model the placement of control valves, resulting in a mixed-integer nonlinear program. We review and discuss theoretical and algorithmic properties of two solution approaches. These include penalty <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> methods that solve a sequence of nonlinear programs whose stationary points converge to a stationary point of the original mixed-integer program. We implement and evaluate the algorithms using a benchmarking water supply network. In addition, the performance of different update strategies for the penalty <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> parameters are investigated under multiple initial conditions. Practical recommendations on the numerical implementation are provided...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop and}} study {{averaging}} schemes for solving fixed point and variational inequality problems. Typically, researchers have established convergence results for solution methods for these problems by establishing contractive estimates for their algorithmic maps. In this paper, we establish global convergence results using nonexpansive estimates. After first establishing convergence {{for a general}} iterative scheme for computing fixed points, we consider <b>applications</b> to projection <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> algorithms for solving variational inequality problems and to a generalized steepest descent method for solving systems of equations. As part of our development, we also establish a new interpretation of a norm condition typically used for establishing convergence of linearization schemes, by associating it with a strong-f-monotonicity condition. We conclude by applying our results to transportation networks...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{data have}} been {{obtained}} on the creep compliance <b>and</b> the <b>relaxation</b> modulus of two epoxy resins in their transition regions. These tests were combined with birefringence measurements to follow the changes in bond orientation of the polymers as the strain or stress varies. Experimental data on the stress- and strain-optical coefficients are presented for both creep <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> experiments. It was proved that {{the validity of the}} time-temperature superposition principle can be extended to these two coefficients characterizing the optical viscoelastic properties of the two epoxy resins. Master curves of F (t/k) versus log (t/k) were constructed, where F (t/k) represents in turn one of the quantities studied namely creep compliance, <b>relaxation</b> modulus <b>and</b> stress- or strain-optical coefficients. The creep <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> time factors k, corresponding to the creep <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> curves at the various temperatures, are plotted against the inverse of the absolute temperature T. The approximate equality of the time factors for mechanical and separately for optical creep <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> was established from these plots. This equality proves that creep D-functions <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> E-functions are the reciprocals of one another at any time and that the variation of birefringence with time follows the same law in the respective creep <b>and</b> <b>relaxation</b> tests. © 1962 Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff-Verlag...|$|R
