5|$|Newton {{assisted}} Somerset from 1876 until 1890. The county cricket club {{had only}} been formally set-up the previous year, and was seeking first-class status. The majority of matches played by Newton for the county between 1876 and 1878 <b>are</b> <b>recorded</b> by CricketArchive as being for the 'Gentlemen of Somerset', and are not categorised as first-class cricket, and although those from 1879 onwards <b>are</b> <b>recorded</b> as being for 'Somerset', they are generally regarded as remaining a 'second-class' of cricket.|$|E

5|$|A Wesleyan chapel {{was built}} in 1865; a small {{weatherboard}} building with an attached Sunday School. The Church eventually fell out of use and became a private home.

5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes <b>are</b> <b>recorded</b> strikes out. A batter against whom four balls <b>are</b> <b>recorded</b> is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, {{provided}} the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
