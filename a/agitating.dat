5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between care-recipients’ <b>agitated</b> behaviors, family caregivers’ burnout and abuse in community dwelling older Chinese with dementia in Hong Kong. Design: 6 -month prospective study Method: 149 caregivers provided information on their demographic characteristics, care recipients’ everyday functioning and <b>agitated</b> behaviors and caregivers’ burnout symptoms. Caregivers were re-interviewed 6 months later and provided information on changes in both care recipients everyday functioning and <b>agitated</b> behaviors, and verbally and physically abusive behaviors directed at care recipients in the past month. Results: The single most significant variable in predicting abuse at 6 -month follow-up was abuse at baseline. In additionApart from baseline abuse, verbal abuse was predicted by more co-residing days, {{a high level of}} <b>agitated</b> behavior, and a strong sense of caregiver depersonalization. Care recipients {{were more likely to be}} physically abused if they were male, had no chronic conditions other than dementia, and demonstrated a high level of <b>agitated</b> behaviors. Entering caregiver burnout into the model did not modify {{the association between}} care recipients <b>agitated</b> behavior and abuse for either verbal or physical abuse. Conclusion: This study is the first to establish an association between care-recipients’ <b>agitated</b> behaviors, burnout and abuse by family caregivers using prospective data. The present results confirmed that care recipients’ <b>agitated</b> behaviors and caregivers symptoms of burnout are associated with family caregivers’ abusive behaviors. Caregiver burnout did not mediate the association between <b>agitated</b> behaviors and abuse. Proper management of care recipients’ <b>agitated</b> behaviors and adequate support provided to family caregivers may help prevent development of new cases of elder mistreatment...|$|R

The neural substrate underlying the <b>agitated</b> behaviors in dementia is unclear. We hypothesized that different dimensions of <b>agitated</b> {{behaviors are}} mediated by distinct neural systems. Methods: All the patients (n= 32) underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Using the <b>Agitated</b> Behavior in Dementia scale, we identified the relationships between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) patterns {{and the presence of}} each of three dimensions of <b>agitated</b> behavior (physically <b>agitated</b> behavior, verbally <b>agitated</b> behavior, and psychosis symptoms) in AD patients. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software was used to explore these neural correlations. Results: Physically <b>agitated</b> behavior was significantly correlated with lower rCBF values in the right superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann 22) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann 47). Verbally <b>agitated</b> behavior was significantly associated with lower rCBF values in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann 46, 44) and the left insula (Brodmann 13). The psychosis symptoms were significantly correlated with lower rCBF values in the right angular gyrus (Brodmann 39) and the right occipital lobe (Brodmann 19). Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that three different <b>agitated</b> behaviors may represent distinct neural networks in AD patients.

After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was <b>agitating</b> against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E

Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began <b>agitating</b> against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm the resistance though sporadic strikes continued.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to explore why some {{individuals}} with dementia and <b>agitated</b> behavior showed limited response to a personalized intervention. Ten consistently <b>agitated</b> individuals (i. e., non-responders) were compared with 34 individuals who were more settled during the intervention (i. e., responders). Most participants had severe cognitive deficits; however, non-responders were more impaired. Where responders showed large improvements across conditions, <b>agitated</b> behavior remained equally high in non-responders. Responders and non-responders showed increased interest and engagement during the intervention. Increased <b>agitated</b> behavior was associated with severe cognitive impairment. Although studies have shown that psychosocial interventions can reduce <b>agitated</b> behavior, {{there does seem to be}} a point where it becomes more difficult to reduce this behavior. However, non-responders still displayed interest, and the authors believe further personalization of the intervention is possible. Therefore, severe dementia and <b>agitated</b> behavior should not exclude individuals from psychosocial interventions; however, a more detailed and timely implementation plan of such treatments may be warranted...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{diagnostic}} entity {{of major}} depressive episode includes both simple and <b>agitated</b> or mixed depression. Mixed depression {{is characterized by a}} full depressive episode with several symptoms of excitatory nature. Mixed depressions worsen if treated with antidepressants. METHOD: We have reviewed the clinical charts of the 2141 patients treated at the Centro Lucio Bini of Rome from January 1999 to June 2006. These patients were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. Research diagnostic criteria were applied for <b>agitated</b> depression with motor agitation and Author's diagnostic criteria for <b>agitated</b> depression without motor agitation. RESULTS: One thousand and twenty-six patients had a depressive episode as index episode. Three hundred and forty six (33 %) were mixed depressive states. One hundred and thirty eight (44 %) of them were spontaneous; in 173 cases, the onset of the mixed depression was associated with antidepressants. CONCLUSION: Psychic and motor agitation are considered equally important for the definition of <b>agitated</b> depression. Treating <b>agitated</b> depression with antidepressants worsens the clinical picture. The use of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), neuroleptics and anticonvulsants are recommended. The term Melancholia Agitata is proposed for <b>agitated</b> (mixed) depression...|$|R
