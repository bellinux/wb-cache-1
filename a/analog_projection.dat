50|$|For <b>analog</b> <b>projection</b> of {{photographic}} slides, projector and screen use a 1:1 aspect ratio, supporting {{horizontal and vertical}} orientation equally well. In contrast, digital projection technology typically supports vertically oriented images only {{at a fraction of}} the resolution of landscape-oriented images. For example, projecting a digital still image having a 3:2 aspect ratio on a 16:9 projector employs 84.3% of available resolution in horizontal orientation, but only 37.5% in vertical orientation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} compressed sensing (CS) {{techniques for}} signal reconstruction and channel estimation in OFDM-based high-rate ultra wideband (UWB) communication systems. We employ a parallel CS structure that exploits frequency domain sparsity. We also consider multipath UWB channels {{in both the}} line-of-sight and non line-of-sight environments. UWB signal detection and channel estimation from sub-Nyquist <b>analog</b> <b>projections</b> is carried out using an optimized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm and the smoothed ℓ 0 algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate significant gains {{in the form of}} reliable signal recovery and channel estimation as well as dramatically sub-Nyquist sampling rates for the analog-to-digital converters while maintaining high data rates.

40|$|The Discrete Radon Transform (DRT) {{preserves}} {{discrete digital}} image information whilst recasting 2 D image {{data in a}} form that closely resembles 1 D <b>analog</b> <b>projections.</b> The projective representation makes the DRT an effective tool for data compression and for tomographic reconstruction, in particular to obtain images from a limited set of real projection data. For prime sized images formed on regular square or hexagonal arrays, the projective mapping operation is arithmetic addition. Algorithms are presented for efficient computation of the forward and inverse DRT transformation and to perform elementary image rotation and translation operations in the digital projection space. Manipulating image data as DRT projections rather than in the spatial domain avoids the need for expensive reconstruction and re-projection of the data. Comparing objects in projection space may accelerate iterative reconstruction schemes. For some general image-processing operations, projection-based algorithms may produce efficiencies not realisable in the spatial domain. The patterns of pixel locations that combine to form each projection element are shown to have interesting distributional properties that derive from the prime, cyclic nature of the DRT. Key Words: discrete image processing, computer algorithms, Radon transforms...|$|R
40|$|We {{initiate}} {{the study of}} annihilators in C*-algebras, showing that they are, in many ways, the best C*-algebra <b>analogs</b> of <b>projections</b> in von Neumann algebras. Using them, we obtain a type decomposition for arbitrary C*-algebras that is symmetric and completely consistent with the classical von Neumann algebra type decomposition. We also show that annihilators admit a very simple notion of equivalence that is again completely consistent {{with the notion of}} Murray-von Neumann equivalence in von Neumann algebras, sharing many of its general order theoretic properties...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe digital Radon {{transform}} (DRT) can {{be adapted}} to reconstruct images from <b>analog</b> <b>projection</b> data. This new technique is a variation of the conventional back-projection method. It requires no pre-filtering of the projection data, straightforward 1 D linear interpolation and some simple sorting of projection samples. The DRT enables the use of a form of block-data copy for the reconstruction, which is fast in comparison to the usual methods of back-projection. To obtain reconstructed images of high quality, further intrinsic interpolation is required; the reconstructed image size has to be several times larger than the number of projection samples. We describe an algorithm to convert <b>analog</b> <b>projection</b> data into a form suitable to apply the DRT. We compare the performance of the “standard” DRT and a hybrid version of the DRT to some conventional reconstruction algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Radiology {{departments}} are implementing conversion {{from the use}} of hard copy film in favor of digital imaging. New digital acquisitions are increasing the efficacy of radiological imaging. The outputs of new modalities such as magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) are digital. They both involve gathering information that allows reconstructing cross sectional projections of internal structures and displaying them as digital images. Other technologies, e. g., computed radiography (CR), can provide digital radiographic data that replaces <b>analog</b> <b>projection</b> radiography. To date, the processed digital data is still transferred to film to provide a typical radiographic film in appearance. The film is presented to the doctor for diagnostic review. The research in this dissertation is concerned with making a film-less department. It specifically addresses problems in presenting CR images to the physician. The goal of this research is to create a computer recognition algorithm that will automatically recognize the orientation and discriminate between the lateral and posteroanterior view of digital chest radiographs image. The algorithm maintains 91. 9 % accuracy rate. The recognition takes. 15 second per image...|$|E
40|$|GIRL: A Labyrinth Dark was an {{experimental}} gallery piece that combined projections, dance, circus arts, puppetry and traditional theatre techniques {{to explore the}} non-linear way the brain processes the trauma of sexual assault. The main goal of the design of this piece {{was to create a}} world which could be visually and physically manipulated by an ensemble (The Muses) to antagonize and obstruct the protagonist’s (Girl) journey. These obstructions were to appear as a tangible manifestation of the way the brain cordons off memories that are too stressful for the body to handle. In terms of lighting design, this was a project that demanded creativity. With no budget and limited resources, the goal of creating an amorphous void which at one moment could appear abysmal and the next moment be filled with projections of text and imagery seemed almost impossible. However, through the combination of both digital and <b>analog</b> <b>projection,</b> we created something that celebrated the spirit of the text. The term “analog projection” can be defined here as a projection style that utilizes a medium other than a computer, digital projector or TV. In GIRL, this medium was an old-school overhead projector, transparencies and food coloring. This allowed us to create visceral, highly pigmented lighting effects directly on performers’ bodies in a way that reflected the fulcrum on which this universe spun: real-time manipulation of the world in an effort to obstruct Girl’s path.

40|$|Neural network {{models of}} {{categorical}} perception can {{help solve the}} symbol-grounding problem [Harnad, 1990; 1993] by connecting <b>analog</b> sensory <b>projections</b> to symbolic representations through learned category-invariance detectors in a hybrid symbolic/nonsymbolic system. Our nets learn to categorize and name 50 x 50 pixel images of circles, ellipses, squares and rectangles projected onto the receptive field of a 7 x 7 retina. The nets first learn to do prototype matching and then entry-level naming for the four kinds of stimuli, grounding their names directly in the input patterns via hidden-unit representations. Next, a higher-order categorization (symmetric vs. asymmetric) is learned, either directly from the input, as with the entry- level categories, or from combinations of the grounded category names (symbols). We analyze the architectures and input conditions that allow grounding to be "transferred" from directly grounded entry-level category names to higher- order category names. Implications of such hybrid models for the evolution and learning of language are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Neural net {{models of}} {{categorical}} perception (compression of within-category similarities and separation of between-category differences) {{are applied to}} the symbol grounding problem (of how to connect symbols with meanings) by connecting <b>analog</b> sensory <b>projections</b> to arbitrary symbolic representations via learned category invariance detectors in a hybrid symbolic/nonsymbolic system. Our nets are trained to categorise and name 50 x 5 O pixel images (circles, ellipses, squares and rectangles) projected onto the receptive field of a 7 x 7 retina. They first learn to do prototype matching and then entry-level naming for the four kinds of stimuli, grounding their names directly in the input patterns via hidden-unit representations ("sensorimotor toil"). We show that higher-order categorisation (e. g., "symmetric" vs. "asymmetric") can be learned in two different ways: either (1) directly from the input, just as with the entry-level categories (i. e., by toil), or (2) indirectly, from boolean combinations of the grounded category names (symbols) {{in the form of}} propositions DESCRIBING the higher-order category ("symbolic theft"). We analyse the architectures and input conditions that allow grounding (in the form of compression/separation in internal similarity space to be "transfered" in this second way from directly grounded entry-level category names to higher-order category names. Such hybrid models have implications for models of the evolution and learning of language...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, feature {{extraction}} algorithms {{have been developed}} for extraction of characteristic features from harmonic signals. The common theme for all developed algorithms is the simplicity in generating a significant set of features directly from the time domain harmonic signal. The features are a time domain representation of the composite, yet sparse, harmonic signature in the spectral domain. The algorithms are adequate for low-power unattended sensors which perform sensing, {{feature extraction}}, and classification in a standalone scenario. The first algorithm generates the characteristic features using only the duration between successive zero-crossing intervals. The second algorithm estimates the harmonics 2 ̆ 7 amplitudes of the harmonic structure employing a simplified least squares method without the need to estimate the true harmonic parameters of the source signal. The third algorithm, resulting from a collaborative effort with Daniel White at the DSP Lab, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, presents an analog front end approach that utilizes a multichannel <b>analog</b> <b>projection</b> and integration to extract the sparse spectral features from the analog time domain signal. Classification is performed using a multilayer feedforward neural network. Evaluation of the proposed feature extraction algorithms for classification through the processing of several acoustic and vibration data sets (including military vehicles and rotating electric machines) with comparison to spectral features shows that, for harmonic signals, time domain features are simpler to extract and provide equivalent or improved reliability over the spectral features in both the detection probabilities and false alarm rate. ...|$|E
