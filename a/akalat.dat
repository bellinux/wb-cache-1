50|$|The Iringa <b>akalat</b> (Sheppardia lowei) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Muscicapidae.It is endemic to Tanzania.|$|E
50|$|The Rubeho <b>akalat</b> (Sheppardia aurantiithorax) is {{a member}} of the Old World flycatcher family, (Muscicapiidae), known from the Eastern Arc of Tanzania. Akalats trapped in 1989 here were assumed to be an {{isolated}} population of Iringa <b>akalat</b> which occurs c. 150 km to the south, but further specimens collected in 2000 led to the description of the bird as a new species. The bird's English name relates to its type locality, Rubeho, Morogoro; the scientific name to the ochraceous colour on its throat and upper breast.|$|E
5000|$|Yet {{the calls}} of the {{aforementioned}} species only doubtfully agree with the <b>akalat's</b> appellation as an omen of death. It is recorded that the <b>akalat's</b> forest song, respectively referred to as [...] "boofio" [...] and [...] "woofio" [...] by the Bulu and Ntumu peoples, is believed by them to predict {{the death of a}} near parent who bids them farewell with this song.|$|R
50|$|The <b>akalats</b> (stressed on {{the second}} syllable) are {{medium-sized}} insectivorous birds in the genus Sheppardia. They were formerly placed in the thrush family, Turdidae, but are more often now treated {{as part of the}} Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Bowdler Sharpe, who {{had never}} visited Africa, {{associated}} the <b>akalats,</b> in their Bulu appellation, with birds of [...] "different kinds" [...] occurring in the forest understorey. His main collector in West Africa, George L. Bates, denoted them more specifically as [...] "little members of the genus Turdinus, which are called in Fang and Bulu [...] "Akalat"....". The latter genus denoted a group of Old World babblers, currently classed as near-babblers in the genus Illadopsis.|$|R
50|$|The Usambara <b>akalat</b> (Sheppardia montana), {{also known}} as the Usambara alethe or Usambara robin-chat, is a species of bird in the family Muscicapidae.It is endemic to Tanzania.|$|E
50|$|The {{subspecies}} S. b. poensis on {{the island}} of Bioko is sometimes considered to be a separate species, Alexander's <b>akalat.</b> This subspecies' name commemorates Boyd Alexander, an English ornithologist.|$|E
50|$|He {{compiled}} A Checklist of the Birds of South Africa with Alwin Karl Haagner in 1910. The {{bird species}} Sheppardia gunningi, also called east coast <b>akalat</b> or Gunning's akelat, {{is named for}} him.|$|E

50|$|Sharpe {{was awarded}} an honorary LL.D. by the University of Aberdeen. He was {{fellow of the}} Linnean Society and the Zoological Society of London. A gold medal was awarded to him in 1891 by the Emperor of Austria. Many species and {{subspecies}} have been named after him including Sharpe's starling (Cinnyricinclus sharpii), Bycanistes fistulator sharpii, Sharpe's Apalis (Apalis sharpii) Sharpe's <b>akalat</b> (Sheppardia sharpei), Sharpe's pied-babbler (Turdoides sharpei) and the Burmese subspecies of the sarus crane (Grus antigone sharpii). A genus Sharpia was erected but is now considered to be synonymous with Ploceus.|$|E
50|$|David Armitage Bannerman's volumes on West African birds, {{published}} from 1930 {{through to}} 1951, became well-established reference {{works for the}} region, and retained the name <b>akalat</b> for Trichastoma, which is Illadopsis. Reichenow however classed Turdinus batesi as an Alethe, then in the Turdidae (thrushes and flycatchers), followed by Jackson and Sclater in 1938 who applied it to Sheppardia specifically. Mackworth-Praed and Grant (1953, 1955) and Williams (1963 - 1980s) retained their usage. In 1964 the name was still recorded as denoting both groups, namely the Malococincla, i.e. Illadopsis near-babblers in West Africa, and the Sheppardia chats in East African literature, though the latter convention prevailed in modern times.|$|E
40|$|Biodiversity {{information}} in Angola is limited or nonexistent, hindering {{the design and}} implementation of conservation strategies. The Escarpment forest {{is one of the}} most important areas for bird diversity in the country. However, there is almost no information about the territorial needs and habitat preferences of its threatened endemic birds. This study evaluated these needs and preferences in Gabela <b>akalat</b> Sheppardia gabela, a range-restricted endemic to the Central Escarpment. Eighteen individuals of Gabela <b>akalat</b> were captured and radio-tracked with the objectives of establishing their territory size (through home-range size estimates) and habitat preferences using compositional analysis. Home-range sizes were slightly larger than other Sheppardia species and Gabela <b>akalat</b> evidently avoided clearings and preferred forest habitat, although it was also able to use farmland areas and secondary growth to a lesser extent. Conservation measures should focus on the preservation of remaining old-growth forest through the establishment of a nature reserve in Kumbira. To assure the success of such an initiative, the local population should participate in planning, administration and enforcement. We outline some measures that could help address the economic needs of the local community while maintaining forest cover...|$|E
40|$|Biodiversity {{surveys and}} the {{compilation}} of indigenous knowledge {{were conducted in}} eight previously unstudied proposed and already gazetted Forest Reserves of Mtwara Region, south-eastern Tanzania, from April to August of 2005. The results indicate relatively low biodiversity and endemism values in these forests, {{and high levels of}} forest disturbance. In most areas the original vegetation has been converted by clearance for cultivation and by fire, and has regenerated into degraded forms of Swahilian/Coastal Mixed Dry Forest, Swahilian/Coastal Brachystegia Forest and floristically impoverished Zambezian-Swahilian Brachystegia Woodland. Some Coastal Forest endemic and threatened species, however, occur in the degraded forest patches, such as east coast <b>akalat</b> Sheppardia gunningi, Reichenow’s batis Batis mixta reichenowi, spotted flat-lizard Platysaurus maculatus, woodland toad Mertensophryne micranotis and the shrub Gardenia transvenulosa. The low proportion of endemic and threatened species recorded implies that these forests are of modest biological importance {{within the context of the}} Eastern Arc Mountains and Coastal Forests Biodiversity Hotspot. Nevertheless, local inhabitants depend heavily on the long-ter...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{habitats}} {{are being}} rapidly lost due to human activities. It is therefore vital {{to understand how}} these activities influence biodiversity so that suitable guidelines can be established for conservation. This is particularly important in understudied, high biodiversity, {{areas such as the}} Angolan Escarpment. Here we examine which habitat characteristics drive bird diversity and endemic species presence at Kumbira Forest, a key site in the Central Escarpment Forest. Bird diversity was sampled by 10 min bird point counts, whereas habitat characteristics were measured by a combination of ground-based vegetation surveys and remotely sensed data modelling of Landsat images. GLM, multi-model inference and model averaging were used to determine the most important variables driving species richness and the presence of endemics. The remote sensing variables performed poorly in predicting presence of Red-crested Turaco Tauraco erythrolophus and Gabela Bushshrike Laniarius amboimensis but they contributed significantly to explain species richness and Gabela <b>Akalat</b> Sheppardia gabela presence, both of which were associated with greater canopy cover. Liana density and elevation were also important explanatory variables in certain cases. Conservation actions at Kumbira should focus on increasing canopy cover and maintaining forest integrity (as measured by liana density), as these actions are likely to have the most positive outcomes for the avifauna.
