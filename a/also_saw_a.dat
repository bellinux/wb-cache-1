5|$|After scoring 1,050runs (including six centuries) at {{an average}} of 75.00 in the 1940–41 season, Barnes played little cricket until 1945–46, when he scored centuries in five {{successive}} matches for New South Wales. He was picked for the 1945–46 Australian tour of New Zealand and played in the representative match that was later designated as the first Test match between the two countries: he made 54 as Australia won easily. The post-war period <b>also</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> new approach to batting on the part of Barnes. He discarded his aggressive and flamboyant shot-making and re-invented himself as a watchful, more defensive player, which made his scoring more prolific, although less crowd pleasing.|$|E
5|$|Between 1893 and 1904, Italy {{laid down}} eight battleships; the later {{two classes of}} ship were remarkably fast, though the Regina Margherita class was poorly {{protected}} and the Regina Elena class lightly armed. In some ways, these ships presaged {{the concept of the}} battlecruiser. The Austro-Hungarian Empire <b>also</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> naval renaissance during the 1890s, though of the nine pre-dreadnought battleships ordered only the three of the Habsburg class arrived before Dreadnought herself made them obsolete.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, cadence-lypso’s {{popularity}} declined greatly. Some Dominican performers remained famous, such as Ophelia, a very renowned {{singer of}} the period. Popular music during this time was mostly zouk, a style pioneered by the French Antillean band Kassav, who used styles of folk music of Martinique and Guadeloupe. Soca, a kind of Trinidadian music, was also popular at the time, producing bands like Windward Caribbean Kulture. The '80s <b>also</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> rise in popular for jazz {{and the formation of}} several jazz bands, while groups like Exile One began exploring tradition rhythms from jing ping and lapo kabwit.|$|E
5|$|Ja'far did {{not long}} enjoy his victory; {{in the same}} year, {{he was killed by}} two of his slaves, at the {{instigation}} of his uncle and his brother, who then usurped the governorship. This heralded a period of internal strife among Sicilian Muslims. Warfare continued through the 880s, with the Arabs attempting to subdue the remaining Byzantine strongholds in the northeastern third of the island, but with limited success: the raids yielded booty to pay the army, but no forts were taken. The same period <b>also</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> resurgence of Byzantine strength in the Italian mainland, where generals like Nikephoros Phokas the Elder won a string of victories against the Muslims.|$|E

He rushes {{out of the room and}} makes his way to the bowling alley, where Angie lies dead from a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that every person who saw the apparitions was about to die, implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who <b>also</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> victim's ghost, is struck by the implication.|$|E

The lowest ever attendance at Prenton Park was on 20 February 1984, when only 937 supporters watched a 2–0 victory over Halifax Town. However, the decade <b>also</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> high number of supporters in the ground for other reasons. In the Hillsborough disaster, 96 Liverpool F.C. fans lost their lives and, on 15 April 1989, 12,000 people attended a memorial service at Prenton Park.|$|E
5|$|The 1994 live double album A Night in San Francisco {{received}} favourable reviews as well {{as commercial}} success by reaching number eight on the UK charts. 1995's Days Like This also had large sales – though the critical reviews were not always favourable.

The move brought {{an end to}} the traditional methods of printing using hot molten metal to produce type and printing plates, and introduced computer technology. The £4million development saw the Echo become the first daily newspaper in the North East to be completely produced by photo-composition and web-offset printing. It <b>also</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> change in the Echos appearance, with a new shape, bolder typefaces and clearer printing. The first new-look Echo was printed at Pennywell on 26 April 1976 and was issue number 32,512.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of June was heralded by {{the debut of}} United's third kit, which debuted in the opening match of the month. The new third kit, which featured a primary color of red, with black accents debuted in the 3 June away fixture at Los Angeles Galaxy. June <b>also</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> wave of controversy arrive involving Charlie Davies and deceiving match officials during the run of play, causing Davies to be fined by MLS. As the international transfer window neared, United made an unanticipated, blockbuster trade with their Atlantic Cup rivals, New York Red Bulls on 27 June. On the pitch, however, United failed to win any matches during the month, tallying three draws and a loss during the month.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of the EIHL saw a series of games between the EIHL clubs {{and the members of}} the BNL. In {{addition}} to three home games and three away games against their Elite opponents, each club also played one home game and one away game against the BNL clubs in crossover match-ups.

5|$|Three {{species of}} {{hippopotamus}}, the European hippopotamus (Hippopotamus antiquus), Hippopotamus major and Hippopotamus gorgops, ranged throughout continental Europe and the British Isles. All three species became extinct {{before the last}} glaciation. Ancestors of European hippos {{found their way to}} many islands of the Mediterranean Sea during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene <b>also</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> number of dwarf species evolve on several Mediterranean islands, including Crete (Hippopotamus creutzburgi), Cyprus (the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus, Hippopotamus minor), Malta (Hippopotamus melitensis), and Sicily (Hippopotamus pentlandi). Of these, the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus survived {{until the end of the}} Pleistocene or early Holocene. Evidence from an archaeological site, Aetokremnos, continues to cause debate on whether or not the species was encountered, and was driven to extinction, by man.|$|E
5|$|While the {{transition}} from the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic—which took place with {{the transition}} from the fourth to the third millennium BCE—witnessed much economic and technological continuity, it <b>also</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> considerable change in the style of monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England. By 3,000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased being built, and were instead replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. These stone rings are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, {{with the exception of the}} island's south-eastern corner. Stone circles are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen.|$|E

The secondary battery was reduced to sixteen 5-inch/51 caliber guns. In late 1919, she sailed to the Pacific Ocean and joined the newly formed United States Pacific Fleet. She continued to conduct training and patrol duties in the Pacific until the mid-1930s when she was transferred again to the Atlantic, and began operating out of the North Atlantic, with the exception of several occasional trips to the West Coast of the United States.|$|E
