40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the time of {{mechanical}} product design and ensure the high quality of their assembly drawings, this paper develops an intelligent approach for generating assembly drawings automatically from three-dimensional (3 -D) computer assembly models of mechanical products by simulating the experienced human designer's thinking mode with the aid of computer graphics and knowledge-based expert system. The key issues include the strategies and methods for selecting the necessary views in an <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing,</b> determining necessary sectional views in each view, eliminating the unreasonable projective overlap of the components in each view, and minimizing the numbers of both the views in an <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> and the sectional views in each view. Based on the approach, corresponding software prototype was developed. Finally, it is demonstrated, from an example of the fixture in a modularized drilling machine, that its <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> was generated successfully using this intelligent software prototype. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|During {{the fall}} of 2013, a study was {{conducted}} where students completed the PSVT:R and the MCT and then {{were asked to complete}} three different modeling tasks. These tasks included modeling a part when given the object {{in the context of an}} <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing,</b> modeling a part when given an isometric pictorial of the object, and finally modeling a part when given a detail drawing of the object. Research questions for this study include the following: Does a simpler rubric provide similar scores as the previous rubric? Is there a relationship between a student’s spatial visualization ability and their ability to model a part from a pictorial, <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> or detail drawing? Is the MCT still a better predictor of a student’s modeling success than the PSVT:R? Scores evaluated based on the simplified rubric were significantly higher than the scores evaluated based on the original rubric for the part modeled from the <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing.</b> This study revealed significant positive correlations between each modeling task and the two spatial visualization tests...|$|R

40|$|During the Fall 2012 {{semester}} a {{study was}} conducted in a junior-level constraint-based modeling course to determine the relationship between students' ability to create solid models when given an <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> and their spatial visualization ability. Students were administered the PSVT:R and the MCT and were then given an <b>assembly</b> <b>drawing</b> and asked to model as many of the seven parts as possible during a 110 minute class period. The parts in the assembly ranged in complexity from a ball to a valve body. Students were given a ruler to measure parts on the Bsize drawing and determine sizes of features based on the given scale (2 : 1). Relationships were examined between the PSVT:R, MCT, modeling activity, final project and the final exam.

50|$|The odds {{of getting}} 2 out of 6 <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers</b> plus the extra number are {{approximately}} 1 in 81.207, {{less likely than}} getting 3 out of 6 <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers.</b> However, there is no prize for only getting 2 out of 6 <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers</b> plus the extra number, which explains why Mark Six has lower overall odds. If one day this became the 8th division of the game, the overall odds of Mark Six would reduce to 1:32.208, comparable to counterparts in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Prizes {{are awarded}} to players who match {{at least three}} of the six <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers,</b> with prizes {{increasing}} for matching more of the <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers.</b> All players who match all six <b>drawn</b> <b>numbers</b> win equal shares of the jackpot; the chance of doing so is 1 in 13,983,816. If four, five, or six balls are matched, the relevant prize is divided equally between all who match that many balls. If no player matches all six numbers, the jackpot is added to that of the next Lotto draw—a Rollover.|$|R
