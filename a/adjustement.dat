Since this relatively old idea has attracted a significant interest in recent years, we prove that a careful implementation of the analog RF front-end is extremely critical to the asymptotic behavior of multicarrier transmission in approaching capacity, In fact multicarrier signals exhibit extreme vulnerability to distortions induced by RF electronics.
