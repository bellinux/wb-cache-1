40|$|Ankara : The Department of Industrial Engineeringand the Graduate School of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2012. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2012. Includes bibliographical refences. In this study, the {{location}} of disaster response and relief facilities in Istanbul is investigated in view of a possible earthquake. Our objective is to determine and analyze the assignments of demand nodes to shelter nodes. We propose two mathematical models for this purpose. Model 1 is a path based model, in which the possible paths are determined by preprocessing the network data to assign demands to shelters while obeying path capacities. Model 2 is an arc based model that uses the network data directly and creates the paths as a byproduct of the solution. Both of the models ensure that each demand node is served by at least a shelter node in accordance with road and <b>shelter</b> <b>capacities.</b> We {{examine the effect of}} the <b>shelter</b> <b>capacity,</b> the number of shelters, and the road capacities on the results in different cases. In these cases, we find out that the <b>shelter</b> <b>capacity,</b> number of <b>shelters,</b> and road <b>capacities</b> influence the <b>shelters</b> to be opened, the assignment of the demand nodes to these shelters and the used arcs/paths in this assignment.

40|$|European {{wild rabbit}} populations are declining in Mediterranean ecosystems, where {{the species is}} of special {{conservation}} interest, and translocations {{are one of the}} most-used tools to recover populations. We evaluated the effects of habitat and physiological and immune condition on the short- and long-term survival of translocated adult wild rabbits. Rabbits were released in four different habitat treatments frequently used in conservation programmes: <b>additional</b> <b>shelter,</b> <b>additional</b> food, <b>additional</b> <b>shelter</b> plus food, predator exclusion and control. Before releasing the rabbits, we determined their physiological condition from body-mass and serum levels of urea, creatinine and total protein, and their immune condition from the concentrations of antibodies against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease. The risk of dying during the first 18 days post-release was two times lower in the predator exclusion treatment than that in the <b>additional</b> <b>shelter,</b> food, shelter plus food treatments and control. Short-term survival was also negative and positively correlated with creatinine and protein levels, respectively. The risk of dying from 19 to 180 days post-release in the additional food treatment was 10 and nine times lower than in predator exclusion and control, respectively, and negatively correlated with the antibody concentration against myxomatosis. The results suggest that short-term survival was related to predation risk and physiological condition, and long-term survival was related to food availability and myxomatosis incidence. We recommend that translocation programmes should consider using soft-release methods {{to reduce the risk of}} predation and ensure that all individuals are released in the best possible physiological condition to increase their short-term survival. We also suggest that the habitat be managed to ensure that the environment provides the appropriate conditions (i. e. food and shelter) for individuals and population persistence. Immune condition should be taken into account and translocation programmes should consider the origin of donor populations to reduce the variability of pathogen and virus strains. © 2011 The Authors.

5000|$|Auckland {{city centre}} had a daytime {{population}} of 78,000, but by April 1942 <b>shelter</b> <b>capacity</b> was only 20,000. [...] Furthermore, experience in Britain during the Blitz indicated that deep shelters provided greater protection. [...] Due to its topography and central location, Albert Park - a communal facility {{built in the}} 1880s {{on the site of}} an 1840s army barracks - was chosen as the site for a major construction. In 1942 a large complex of tunnels and shelters was established under the park, capable of sheltering 20,400 people.|$|R
25|$|Once dried, the peats are carted to the croft {{and built}} into a large stack. These often resembled {{the shape of the}} croft house – broad, curved at each end and tapered to a point about 2 metres high. They varied in length from about 4 to 14 metres. Peat {{stacking}} also follows local customs and a well built peat stack can be a work of art. Peat stacks provide <b>additional</b> <b>shelter</b> to houses.

5000|$|Fili (Фили) is a surface-level {{station on}} the Filyovskaya Line of the Moscow Metro. The station was opened on 7 November 1959, as the last surface side {{platform}} {{station on the}} line. The dual platforms are protected by canopies and are intersected at either end by road overpasses that provide <b>additional</b> <b>shelter</b> for waiting passengers. Two glazed upper-level entrance vestibule at both end of the station allow passengers to change platforms. Robert Pogrebnoi and Yuriy Zenkevich were the main architects for the station's design. Daily passenger volume is approximately 30,100.|$|R
30|$|The two {{objectives}} {{formulated by}} Eqs.  1 and 2 minimize TSA and TWET. It {{should be noted}} that the unit of the TWET is weighted seconds, which also takes into account the width of the evacuation route and the evacuation population in addition to the travel length and speed. In this study, evacuation speed is set according to the work of Gates et al. (2006). To make shelter allocation success more likely, <b>shelter</b> <b>capacity</b> or service area also needs to be taken into account to ensure that all residents can be housed. Therefore, the two key constraints are distance and capacity.|$|R
50|$|The {{logistical}} {{problems of}} maintaining a population of 20,000 in close confines were not thoroughly explored, and testing the installation was difficult because it required closing the motorway and rerouting the usual traffic. The only large-scale test, a five-day exercise in 1987 to practice converting the road tunnels into usable shelters, revealed many problems: among other things, it took 24 hours to fully close all four blast doors, and it proved impossible {{to set up the}} 20,000 beds within reasonable time. Afterwards, the <b>shelter's</b> <b>capacity</b> was reassessed at 10,000-17,000. Doubts about the tunnel's viability as a shelter remained.|$|R
40|$|This study formulates a mixed-integer {{facility}} location {{model to}} optimize emergency shelter location and resource allocation {{based on a}} set of existing candidate shelters. This model minimizes network access time between an affected census block and a potential emergency shelter, the operating costs of a shelter as a function of <b>shelter</b> <b>capacity,</b> and the cost of not accommodating all evacuees with emergency <b>shelter</b> <b>capacity</b> at the planning stage. This study consists of two parts, one conducting a sensitivity analysis for model parameters and executing the model for a worst case scenario and the second part expanding the model to include stochastic scenarios. In {{the first part of this}} study a sensitivity analysis of the model examines the impact of the model parameters. The sensitivity analysis and case study show that not only does the total number of shelters vary under different scenarios, but also the distribution in the sizes of recommended shelters. In the second part, 9 scenarios were generated, varying storm severity and location of landfall. This stochastic element is included in the model to determine which shelters should be opened based on the probability of the different scenarios occurring. The application of the model including the stochastic element can be used by emergency planners because of the high level of uncertainty associated with the severity of a hurricane and location of landfall. A comparison of the results of the deterministic model and the stochastic model is presented in this study...|$|R
