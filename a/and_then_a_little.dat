500|$|In {{reviewing}} Epiphany 2.30 in July 2010 Jack Wallen {{described it}} as [...] "efficient, but different" [...] and noted its problem with crashes. [...] "When I first started working with Epiphany it crashed on most sites I visited. After doing a little research (<b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> debugging) I realized the issue was with JavaScript. Epiphany (in its current release), for some strange reason, doesn't like JavaScript. The only way around this was to disable JavaScript. Yes this means a lot of features won't work {{on a lot of}} sites – but this also means those same sites will load faster and won't be so prone to having issues (like crashing my browser)." [...] Wallen concluded positively about the browser, [...] "Although Epiphany hasn't fully replaced Chrome and Firefox as my one-stop-shop browser, I now use it much more than I would have previously. [...] small footprint, fast startup, and clean interface." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Gordon {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the 2009 season in front of 176,300 who attended the race. He also earned $541,874 in race winnings. Gordon was delighted with his victory: [...] "Incredible team effort. This whole year has been amazing. What a great car. I've never had a car like this at Texas. We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It was nice to get our car up front and get some clean air on it. We had to work really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> while longer we could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl sits for a moment on the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Same old story, Daren, {{same old}} way, {{a game of}} billiards now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> game of cards. But I'm more lonely than I used to be." ...|$|R
60|$|Bo {{stared at}} him, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> giving <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gasp, she drooped.|$|R
60|$|Hawtrey lay silent <b>a</b> minute, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{confidential}} gesture.|$|R
2500|$|Poirot's {{death was}} {{the end of a long}} journey for me. I had only ever wanted to play Dame Agatha's true Poirot [...] He was as real to me as he had been to her: a great detective, a {{remarkable}} man, if, perhaps, just now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> irritating.|$|E
2500|$|According to Timberlake, {{the album}} [...] "goes {{a lot of}} {{different}} directions. I think there's probably {{a little bit of what}} was reminiscent on the first album <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of what’s reminiscent of the second album, and then some new stuff." [...] While working on the album, Timberlake thought: [...] "If Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin can do 10-minute songs and Queen can do 10-minute songs then why can't we? We'll figure out the radio edits later." ...|$|E
60|$|The other trembled, was silent; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{commanding}} himself, {{asked the}} ingredients of the medicine.|$|E
60|$|Weston {{looked at}} her gravely, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> deprecatory gesture.|$|R
60|$|Hetty {{glanced at}} her sharply, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gesture of comprehension.|$|R
60|$|Weston {{looked at}} her <b>a</b> moment hesitatingly, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gesture of deprecation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hop Lung flix bloys, play flishee tlick," [...] {{answered}} the Celestial. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> later he set about preparing supper.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Fraser, who, {{it struck}} her, looked older since his absence, turned first {{a little red}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pale, and said, ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Longdon pondered <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to Vanderbank's surprise, at {{any rate}} to his deeper amusement, candidly asked: [...] "Only Fernanda? No other lady?" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Starbrow laughed again, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> frowned <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>and</b> sat {{silent for}} some time.|$|R
60|$|She sat {{silent for}} <b>a</b> minute, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> turned <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>and</b> {{took out a}} letter.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl looked}} at him {{steadily}} <b>a</b> moment, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hopeless gesture of resignation.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it wasn't, {{it would}} {{probably}} not be tried," [...] she said. [...] "One could fancy that it was, now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> painful to the surgeon." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> knot drew {{up close}} {{to the line of}} taboo itself, and began to discuss in loud and serious tones a {{pressing}} question of savage theology and religious practice.|$|E
60|$|Flatface had screwed {{himself up}} with such considerations; made a few more {{inflammatory}} speeches to his men, by way of screwing them up also, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> before midnight, set forth on his expedition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three pounds, Hassan, silence, {{and good}} day! You'll live longer if {{you open your}} windows now <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> get <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fresh air, instead of praying {{yourself}} hoarse." ...|$|R
60|$|Jefferson {{looked at}} him hard a moment, with the fingers of one hand closed, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sign.|$|R
60|$|The porter grinned, <b>and</b> just <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> old gentleman with a rosy, cheery face {{pushed him}} aside and trotted down the steps.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> inconsequential in his generosity," [...] Carroll rejoined. [...] "I didn't {{know he was}} {{interested}} in that kind of thing, but as I don't like to be outdone by my partner, I'll subscribe the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still, contentment does not, as a rule, carry a {{young man}} very far in this country. In fact, it is now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{difficult}} to distinguish between it and something else that is less creditable {{to the man who}} possesses it." ...|$|E
60|$|Nasmyth {{was content}} to stay, and he felt {{that it would be}} a {{kindness}} to his host. Acton appeared willing to fall in with the views of his wife, but Nasmyth fancied that he was now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lonely in his own house.|$|E
6000|$|The Countess stared, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> violent laugh: [...] "It's certain all {{the nice}} men do it. Get married and you'll see!" [...] she added.|$|R
60|$|Austin went on {{with his}} dressing, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> took <b>a</b> <b>little</b> medical {{treatise}} out of a drawer. He spent some time turning over it before he looked up.|$|R
6000|$|Again Leger {{glanced at}} Sewell, who said nothing, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> made <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sign to the speaker. [...] "Nobody would expect it of them," [...] he said. [...] "Get on." ...|$|R
60|$|Nettie stood silent a moment, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> flush {{crept into}} her face, as she {{glanced down at}} the {{diamonds}} on her white wrists, and her long trailing dress. It was, Appleby fancied, of as costly fabric as the looms in Europe could produce.|$|E
60|$|It {{was evident}} to Jimmy {{that his father}} already had taken as much as was good for most men; {{and he did not}} often shrink from a responsibility, that is, when he {{recognized}} it as such, which is now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> difficult when one is young.|$|E
60|$|Far off {{he heard}} the city's hum and noise, And now and then the shriller {{laughter}} where The passionate purity of brown-limbed boys Wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air, And now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tinkling bell As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} are always meaning kindly," [...] she replied; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> outburst, [...] "but why will you be sending money to that man? It must not be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do try {{to think}} for yourself," [...] said she. [...] "Don't always do just what Jessie does, that's silly. Have an idea of your own now <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> Be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> original." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have so {{much the}} {{advantage}} of us here," [...] replied d'Alcacer, [...] "that you may well be generous and forget that oversight; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more confidence. [...] ." ...|$|R
