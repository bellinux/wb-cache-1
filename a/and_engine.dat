5|$|SS American was a steel-hulled, single {{propeller}} {{cargo ship}} built at Chester, Pennsylvania, by the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding <b>and</b> <b>Engine</b> Works for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company and the Hawaiian sugar trade. During World War I {{service for the}} United States Navy, the ship was known as USS American (ID-2292). Late in her career for American-Hawaiian, she was renamed SS Honolulan.|$|E
5|$|She {{remained}} in service until 8 February 1945, {{when she ran}} aground in the Alverstraumen narrows.

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-30 was a Soviet turbojet-powered {{tactical}} bomber {{designed as}} a higher-performance, swept wing version of the Ilyushin Il-28, in the late 1940s.

40|$|Engine room {{monitoring}} {{control system}} is monitoring <b>and</b> controlling main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> from long distance by powerline communication network and wireless network {{to ease the}} operator in operating the ship and save operational cost. To prevent error in programming the main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine,</b> a simulation using instrument software is needed to know the machine characteristic. After simulation result fulfills the requirement which is approached the value of test record, it {{can be applied to}} the real machine. In this study, some steps were done such as: getting know type of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> which performance will be simulated and programmed, getting test record of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine,</b> getting know how the main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> work, making simulation of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> work system, doing monitoring control simulation by powerline communication and wireless network, comparing the results between simulation and test record of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine.</b> Engine programming can be set after simulation result meets the requirement. Result of simulation fulfills the requirement, the difference values between machine simulation using software instrument and test record of main <b>engine</b> <b>and</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> are around 1 %- 2 %. If engine room monitoring control system by wireless and powerline communication is applied in the ship, the ship owner will get advantages because it will prolong ship durability and can monitor operasional of main engine or Auxiliary engine from long distance; while the operator will be easier in operating the ship.

5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, {{the ship}} was used {{primarily}} to train gunners <b>and</b> <b>engine</b> room personnel, as the US Navy had expanded significantly to combat the German U-boat campaign. She escorted convoys in late 1918, {{and after the war}} ended she took part in the effort to bring American soldiers back from France. New Hampshire remained in service for only a few years after the war, as the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty significantly reduced the navies of the signatories; as a result, {{the ship was}} sold for scrap in November 1923.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis port side {{directly}} into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room <b>and</b> <b>engine</b> room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E
5|$|Blakeley was {{launched}} 19 September 1918 by William Cramp and Sons Ship <b>and</b> <b>Engine</b> Building Company in Philadelphia and {{sponsored by the}} wife of Charles Adams Blakeley. The ship was commissioned 8 May 1919, {{under the command of}} Commander W. Brown, Jr.. She immediately joined the Atlantic Fleet. Blakely patrolled along the East Coast of the United States until she was decommissioned on 29 June 1922, and returned to Philadelphia. She was recommissioned from 1932 to 1937 to serve with the Scouting Fleet, and then was again decommissioned in Philadelphia. Low military budgets were the cause of these periods of inactivity, as the Navy did not have the funds or manpower to maintain a number of ships, including Blakeley.|$|E

5|$|Both {{models were}} plagued from the onset by inefficient engines, but {{were capable of}} the short-distance {{takeoffs}} required by the Swiss (330meters for the P–16, 232meters for the N-20). After wind tunnel <b>and</b> <b>engine</b> tests, but before the N–20 could make its maiden flight, Federal Councillor Karl Kobelt cancelled the N-20project in 1953, leading to much resentment of the government by Emmen engineers when the FFA project was continued. Eventually, neither of the aircraft came into production, although {{the wings of the}} P-16 were later used {{in the development of the}} successful Learjet.|$|E

This tank was abandoned in La Gleize on 24 December 1944, where the advance of Kampfgruppe Peiper was halted. The front part, about 1/3, of the gun barrel is restored with a Panther gun barrel and muzzle brake. It also has restored mudguards. It is stripped of exterior and internal fittings and most of the torsion bars are broken, but it still has its gearbox <b>and</b> <b>engine</b> in place.|$|E
5|$|Despite the project's termination, the two {{companies}} continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering {{to the needs of}} the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items—such as the larger Pegasus engine—McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure <b>and</b> <b>engine</b> for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.|$|E

5|$|Developed in {{response}} to the American Polaris programme, the Tu-142 grew out of the need for a viable Soviet ASW platform. It succeeded the stillborn Tu-95PLO project, Tupolev's first attempt at modifying the Tu-95 for maritime use. The Tu-142 differed from the Tu-95 in having a stretched fuselage to accommodate specialised equipment for its ASW and surveillance roles, a reinforced undercarriage to support rough-field capability, improved avionics and weapons, and enhancements to general performance. The Tu-142's capability was incrementally improved while the type was in service, eventually resulting in the Tu-142MZ, the final long-range Tu-142 with highly sophisticated combat avionics and a large payload. Tupolev also converted a number of Tu-142s as avionics (Tu-142MP) <b>and</b> <b>engine</b> (Tu-142LL) testbeds.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} flight segment from Baltimore to Columbia, the crew {{experienced}} fuel flow disruptions to both right side engines, eventually leading {{both of them}} to shut down, after multiple unsuccessful attempts by the crew to restore proper fuel flow <b>and</b> <b>engine</b> operation. Flying with asymmetric thrust from the two left side engines (which were operating normally at that point), the captain decided to land at Byrd Field (now called Richmond International Airport), near Richmond, Virginia, as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{suffered from}} leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft {{were found to}} have cracks in outer wing ribs and stringers. There were also problems with aileron control cylinders, electrical connectors, <b>and</b> <b>engine</b> compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions.
