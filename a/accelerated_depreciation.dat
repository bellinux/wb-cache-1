Wage and price controls would be in effect on August 15, 1971. But most troublesome to urban retail centers, corporate retailers were no longer investing in large, stand-alone department stores. Increasingly, corporate emphasis was on vacating downtown areas and moving to suburban shopping centers. Tax incentives allowing <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> favored construction of enclosed, suburban malls over freestanding retail outlets.|$|E
500|$|In the US, {{wind power}} {{receives}} a production tax credit (PTC) of 1.5¢/kWh in 1993 dollars for each kW·h produced, {{for the first}} ten years; at 2.2 cents per kW·h in 2012, the credit was renewed on 2 January 2012, to include construction begun in 2013. A 30% tax credit can be applied instead of receiving the PTC. Another tax benefit is <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation.</b> Many American states also provide incentives, such as exemption from property tax, mandated purchases, and additional markets for [...] "green credits". The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 contains extensions of credits for wind, including microturbines. Countries such as Canada and Germany also provide incentives for wind turbine construction, such as tax credits or minimum purchase prices for wind generation, with assured grid access (sometimes referred to as feed-in tariffs). These feed-in tariffs are typically set well above average electric power prices. In December 2013 U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander and other Republican senators argued that the [...] "wind energy production tax credit {{should be allowed to}} expire at the end of 2013" [...] and it expired 1 January 2014 for new installations.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{framework for}} the discussion of <b>accelerated</b> tax <b>depreciation</b> methods for regulated utilities is constructed. Using this framework a number of results are derived, some of them novel. We show, for example, under what circumstances interested parties such as the customers and the tax collector should rationally prefer flowthrough or normalization. The most important conclusion is that, following a switch from straight-line book and tax <b>depreciation</b> to <b>accelerated</b> tax <b>depreciation</b> with flowthrough, very substantial rate increases will always be required after a fixed interval, regardless of the firm's growth rate. Effects of <b>accelerated</b> tax <b>depreciation</b> on interest coverage and tax-free dividends are also discussed, and some numerical results are given. The model is general enough to allow incorporation {{of a number of}} realistic conditions, as, for example, debt in the capital structure and a dispersed life table. ...|$|R
2500|$|In the mid-20th century, {{with the}} rise of the suburb and {{automobile}} culture in the United States, a new style of shopping center was created away from downtown. Early shopping centers designed for the automobile include Market Square, Lake Forest, Illinois (1916), and Country Club Plaza, Kansas City, Missouri (1924). From early on, the design tended to be inward-facing, with malls following theories of how customers could best be enticed in a controlled environment. Similar, the concept of a mall having one or more [...] "anchor stores" [...] or [...] "big box stores" [...] was pioneered early, with individual stores or smaller-scale chain stores intended to benefit from the shoppers attracted by the big stores. Mall construction in America was encouraged by the <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> laws of 1954, which incentivized greenfield development on the urban fringe. A second stimulus came from legislation passed in 1960, which allowed investors to band together in REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) to avoid corporate income taxes. The laws helped to shape the familiar exurban landscape of malls, motels, and fast food chains.|$|E

Furthermore, the optimality of fluctuating tax rates hinges on the government being able to commit to the path of future tax rates.

The economic integration into Germany was completed with the withdrawal of all Saar-Franken two years later.

The conversion had been brought forward by half a year because of the <b>accelerating</b> <b>depreciation</b> of the French franc. The date was kept secret (called [...] "day X") to avoid currency speculation, and only published two days in advance.

5000|$|<b>Accelerated</b> <b>{{depreciation}}</b> {{refers to}} any one of several methods by which a company, for 'financial accounting' or tax purposes, depreciates a fixed asset {{in such a way that}} the amount of depreciation taken each year is higher during the earlier years of an asset’s life. For financial accounting purposes, <b>accelerated</b> <b>depreciation</b> is expected to be much more productive during its early years, so that depreciation expense will more accurately represent how much of an asset’s usefulness is being used up each year.

40|$|To {{promote the}} {{development}} and application of renewable energy, under the planning and execution of Bureau of Energy of Ministry of Economical Affairs (BOEMOEA), Taiwan has implemented many measures for subsidizing the installation of RE apparatus since 2000. Besides subsidizing the installing expenses, Taiwanese government also provides incentive measures of finance/tax, such as investment deduction and <b>accelerating</b> <b>depreciation.</b> The successive growth {{of the amount of}} installing cases has apparently constructed the base of promotion and application of renewable energy; on the other hand, many barriers to be overcome were continuously discovered during the executing processes. To effectively remove these promoting barriers, the Energy Commission (the pre-BOE) issued "Renewable Energy Development Plan" through the endorsement of Executive Yuan in January 2002. The purpose of this plan is to establish an inter-ministerial coordinating mechanism of a higher administrative level, which may focus all resources to be functioned as a working team. In the meantime, to further establish a systematically promoting mechanism, the Bureau of Energy then pushes the legislation of "Renewable Energy Development Bill". According to the drafted plan of this law, the power capacity of renewable energies will be 12 % share of the national power installation capacity by 2020. Furthermore, in the Nuclear-free Homeland National Conference held in June 2003, government planned that the power capacity of renewable energy must reach 10 % of the total power capacity in the nation by 2010. However, the share of the power capacity of renewable energy to the national power installation capacity is only 6. 17 %, currently, so there is still a lot of growing space for the development of renewable energy in Taiwan.

A mathematical analysis of certain patterns of <b>accelerated</b> tax <b>depreciation</b> recently available in the UK for capital expenditure is presented. This analysis shows that, where there is a time lag between asset purchase and the incidence of tax relief, an optimal cost of capital may be derived at which the incremental value of the accelerated allowances is at a maximum. In the case of declining balance depreciation for plant and machinery, it is shown that this optimal cost of capital is independent of the proportion of the asset cost that may be allowed against tax in the first year.
