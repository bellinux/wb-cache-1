5|$|The yodel is a {{long and}} complex call made only by the male. It {{is used in the}} {{establishment}} of territorial boundaries and in territorial confrontations, and the length of the call corresponds with the loon's level of aggression. The dominant frequencies in the yodel indicate the body mass <b>and</b> <b>thereby</b> <b>the</b> health of males. A male that occupies a new territory appears to alter its yodel to be clearly distinguishable from the call of the previous territory owner.|$|E
5|$|Goronwy ap Tudur Hen (died 1331), {{also known}} as Goronwy ap Tudur or Goronwy Fychan, was a Welsh aristocrat and Lord of Penmynydd. He {{was a member of}} the Tudor family of Penmynydd, Anglesey, North Wales, and a direct {{ancestor}} of Owen Tudor <b>and</b> <b>thereby</b> <b>the</b> Royal House of Tudor. He was a soldier for the English crown, who fought in the First War of Scottish Independence, including in the English invasion which led to the Battle of Bannockburn. He remained loyal to King Edward II of England until the king's death, and was both a yeoman and forester of Snowdon. After his death in 1331, his body was interned in Llanfaes Friary, near Bangor, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|Although the reaction, which {{included}} punishment, new regulations, SRM institutional reform, fewer Vietnamese serving in France, increased specialisation – were considerable, {{military and civilian}} authorities in both Vietnam and France did not believe them sufficient for the reassertion of control over their colonised troops. A further four decisions were implemented, aimed at striking the a stable racial balance among the troops in French Indochina. The number of ethnic Vietnamese soldiers was perceived to be too great and thus threatening {{in the wake of}} the mutiny. A safer proportion aimed at reducing the overall ratio among Indochina's colonial troops of 1:1 ethnic Vietnamese to European and indigenous ethnic minorities (Montagnards) was implemented. This demonstrated French distrust of Vietnamese troops and the apparent belief that the fidelity of Vietnamese soldiers was maximised by creating a racial balance within the army that was tilted towards showing all Vietnamese soldiers – <b>and</b> <b>thereby</b> <b>the</b> Vietnamese population at large – the futility of attempting insurrection and mutiny.|$|E

5|$|Research into medieval foodways was, until around 1980, a much {{neglected}} {{field of}} study. Misconceptions and outright errors were common among historians, {{and are still}} present in {{as a part of}} the popular view of the Middle Ages as a backward, primitive and barbaric era. Medieval cookery was described as revolting due to the often unfamiliar combination of flavors, the perceived lack of vegetables and a liberal use of spices. The heavy use of spices has been popular as an argument to support the claim that spices were employed to disguise the flavor of spoiled meat, a conclusion without support in historical fact and contemporary sources. Fresh meat could be procured throughout the year by those who could afford it. The preservation techniques available at the time, although crude by today's standards, were perfectly adequate. The astronomical cost and high prestige of spices, <b>and</b> <b>thereby</b> <b>the</b> reputation of the host, would have been effectively undone if wasted on cheap and poorly handled foods.|$|E

25|$|The {{increase}} in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back {{many of the}} downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, <b>and</b> <b>thereby</b> <b>the</b> rates of ionisation, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.|$|E
