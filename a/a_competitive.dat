5|$|<b>A</b> <b>competitive</b> {{inhibitor}} and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is <b>a</b> <b>competitive</b> inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} a small and {{decreasing}} number of hog slaughter firms are using their "market power" {{to take advantage of}} U. S. hog producers. Existing studies have simply calculated industry concentration ratios and assumed/asserted that the performance of such a concentrated industry must be different from the performance of <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> industry. These researchers have rejected without testing the hypothesis that: the observed performance of the U. S. hog slaughter industry is not different from the performance that would be generated by <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> industry. This paper derives the theoretical relationships between hog and pork prices, and hence the farm-wholesale price spread, that would exist in <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> slaughter hog market. These performance norms are then confronted with observed weekly price/quantity relationships over the 1991 - 2001 period to compare observed market performance with the ideal performance norms derived from the economic theory of <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> market. Based on the market performance measures derived from economic theory of <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> market, the hypothesis that the U. S. hog slaughter hog market is <b>a</b> perfectly <b>competitive</b> market cannot be rejected. There simply is not any evidence to support allegations of abuse of market power by meat packers.

The fifth Matsalu Nature Film Festival was held between September 19 and September 23, 2007, and had more than 7,000 visitors. Organizers admit that as the festival is held on a nature reserve, it cannot grow much larger in a little town and therefore plan to bring mostly European nature documentaries to the festival, {{at the same time}} not forgetting the human-related topics.|$|E
