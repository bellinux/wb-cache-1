25|$|That {{which has}} {{happened}} is a warning. To forget it is guilt. It must be continually remembered. It was possible for this to happen, and it remains possible {{for it to happen}} again at <b>any</b> <b>minute.</b> Only in knowledge can it be prevented.|$|E
25|$|Stability {{is crucial}} in {{practical}} applications of Nash equilibria, since the mixed strategy of each player is not perfectly known, but has to be inferred from statistical distribution of their actions in the game. In this case unstable equilibria are very unlikely to arise in practice, since <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> change in the proportions of each strategy seen {{will lead to a}} change in strategy and the breakdown of the equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|After {{his captors}} departed, he freed himself by chewing through the ropes with his teeth, {{and made his}} way through the miles of jungle to American lines. Before {{accepting}} medical attention from Lt. Col. Stanley Radzyminski MD, he gasped a warning to Martin Clemens and Lieutenant Colonel Edwin A. Pollock, whose 2nd Battalion 1st Marines held the defences at the Ilu River mouth. Vouza told him that an estimated 250 to 500 Japanese soldiers were coming to attack his position in <b>any</b> <b>minute.</b> This warning gave the Marines brief but precious time of about 10 minutes to prepare their defences along the Ilu river. The subsequent Battle of the Tenaru was a clear victory for the Marines.|$|E

25|$|At dawn on June 11, Hampton {{devised a}} plan {{in which he would}} split his {{divisions}} across the two roads leading to Clayton's Store and converge on the enemy at that crossroads, pushing Sheridan back to the North Anna River. Hampton took two of his brigades with him from Trevilian with his third remaining on his left to prevent flanking. The other division, under Fitzhugh Lee, was ordered to advance from Louisa Court House, making up the right flank. While the Confederates began their advance, Sheridan started his. Two brigades of Brig. Gen. Alfred T. A. Torbert's division moved down the road to Trevilian Station while a third advanced toward Louisa Court House. The first contact occurred on the Trevilian Road as the South Carolinians of Brig. Gen. Matthew C. Butler's brigade clashed with Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt's skirmish line. Hampton dismounted his men and pushed the skirmishers back into the thick woods, expecting Fitzhugh Lee to arrive on his right at <b>any</b> <b>minute.</b> However, Hampton was severely outnumbered and soon he was forced back. Eventually Col. Gilbert J. Wright's Confederate brigade joined in the close-quarter fighting in the thick brush, but after several hours they also were pushed back within sight of Trevilian Station.|$|E
500|$|... "This {{movie is}} kind of like a horror film where you're unable to see the killer," [...] says Innis. [...] "You know a bomb could go off at <b>any</b> <b>minute,</b> but you never know just when it's going to happen, so the ideas of [...] Hitchcock—about making your {{audience}} anxious—were influential for us when we did the editing."The raw footage was described as a [...] "hodge-podge of disconnected, nausea-inducing motion that was constantly crossing the 180-degree line".|$|E
500|$|Many {{survivors}} of the tragedy refused to blame anyone. Survivor John Jacques wrote, [...] "I blame nobody. I am not anxious to blame anybody... I {{have no doubt that}} those who had to do with its management meant well and tried to do the best they could under the circumstances." [...] Another survivor, Francis Webster, was quoted as having said, [...] "Was I sorry that I chose to come by hand cart? No. Neither then nor <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> of my life since. The price we paid to become acquainted with God was a privilege to pay and I am thankful that I was privileged to come in the Martin Hand Cart Company." [...] On the other hand, survivor John Chislett, who later left the Church, wrote bitterly of Richards promising them that [...] "we should get to Zion in safety." ...|$|E

500|$|Reactions to {{the video}} were mixed. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented it is [...] "more {{thematic}} and thought provoking than the videos for 'Baby Boy' and 'Naughty Girl'", Beyoncé's songs from her debut album, Dangerously in Love. Allhiphop's Eb Haynes described the video [...] "visually fresh" [...] and [...] "couture motivated". A news article published by Hindustan Times reported that a particular scene in the video is suggestive of oral sex. Natalie Y. Moore of In These Times magazine echoed the latter's commentary, writing that the video showcases Beyoncé [...] "strutting her sexuality", and that in Jay-Z's scenes it [...] "looks as if <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> now she'll give him fellatio". [...] The video later appeared {{on a list of}} Yahoo! Music News' Worst Videos of All Time, which pointed to the negative fan reaction and stated, [...] "It's probably the least horrific video listed ... but as far as Beyoncé videos go, it is [...] a stinker." ...|$|E
500|$|As Lupton points out, all of Angelou's autobiographies, {{especially}} Caged Bird and {{its immediate}} sequel Gather Together in My Name, are [...] "very much {{concerned with what}} [...] knew and how she learned it". Lupton compares Angelou's informal education with the education of other Black writers of the twentieth century, who did not earn official degrees and depended upon the [...] "direct instruction of African American cultural forms". Angelou's quest for learning and literacy parallels [...] "the central myth of black culture in America": that freedom and literacy are connected. Angelou is influenced by writers introduced to her by Mrs. Flowers during her self-imposed muteness, including Edgar Allan Poe and William Shakespeare. Angelou states, early in Caged Bird, that she, as the Maya character, [...] "met {{and fell in love}} with William Shakespeare". Critic Mary Vermillion sees a connection between Maya's rape and Shakespeare's [...] "The Rape of Lucrece", which Maya memorizes and recites when she regains her speech. [...] Vermillion maintains that Maya finds comfort in the poem's identification with suffering. Maya finds novels and their characters complete and meaningful, so she uses them to make sense of her bewildering world. She is so involved in her fantasy world of books that she even uses them as a way to cope with her rape, writing in Caged Bird, [...] "...I was sure that <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> my mother or Bailey or the Green Hornet would bust in the door and save me".|$|E
500|$|Timothy Zachery Mosley {{was born}} on March 10, 1972 in Norfolk, Virginia, to Latrice, who ran a {{homeless}} shelter, and Garland Mosley, an Amtrak employee. He graduated from Salem High School of Virginia Beach, Virginia. During his time as a DJ, {{he was known as}} [...] "DJ Tim" [...] or [...] "DJ Timmy Tim". His brother, Sebastian, is reportedly around nine years younger. His sister Courtney Rashon is a makeup artist and author from New Jersey. While attending high school, Timbaland began a long-term collaboration with rapper Melvin (Magoo) Barcliff. The teenage Mosley also joined the production ensemble S.B.I. (which stood for 'Surrounded By Idiots') which also featured Neptunes producer Pharrell. Mosley was also high school friends with brothers Terrence and Gene Thornton, who would become known as Pusha T and Malice of the rap group Clipse, respectively. In 1986, when Timbaland was 14 years old, he was accidentally shot by a co-worker at a local Red Lobster restaurant and was partially paralyzed for nine months. During this time, he began to learn how to DJ using his left hand.Tim rarely talks about the shooting, and is, in fact, quite critical of gangsta rappers who boast of their war wounds. I'm not a rapper," [...] he says dismissively. I'm not talking about my scars or my battles. Still, the shooting did help him form a bond with 50 Cent. I'll tell you this, Tim says. If you get shot and you survive, you feel like you're an Incredible Hulk. Them bullets don't hurt when they go in. But then they got that burnin', that acid burn. Goddamn! It feels like a stove burning your blood. You feel like <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> you gonna be dyin'.}} ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the early}} morning of October 13, Báthory {{appeared}} on the [...] "heights beyond the brook." [...] Ali was forced to stand ground {{in order to secure}} an eventual redrawl and evacuate his booty." [...] Báthory ordered his army to prepare for battle: his 3,000 Transylvanian Saxons, supported by a second line of Transylvanian Wallachians, comprised the right flank on the Mureş River, while the Hungarians comprised the left flank—he and his heavy cavalry were placed in the middle. The Ottoman leaders were in disagreement and had their preparations for the battle delayed; after [...] "three hours of idle waiting, Báthory, confident that Pál Kinizsi would arrive <b>any</b> <b>minute,</b> gave the order to attack." [...] The Transylvanian Saxons opened the attack, but were routed; the Transylvanian Wallachians followed their fate, with many being wounded or killed; and later, the Hungarian line would be pressured to retreat to the centre. Báthory then charged with his heavy cavalry, but fell off his horse; this alerted his companions who interpreted it as a bad omen and advised him to either turn back or retreat to the mountains. He ignored their advice and as head of his cavalry, charged the first Ottoman line with a great force, [...] routing them. Ali then charged with his cavalry and a fierce battle took place that lasted for three hours. Báthory was seriously injured, as he bled from six wounds; [...] "his horse had been killed under him." [...] Surrounded by a [...] "wall of corpses" [...] and barely holding onto his life, he was about to lose the battle when Kinizsi's army appeared on the hill, with drums and trumpets making their noise. Some 900 Serbs under a Demeter Jakšić assisted by [...] "numerous courtiers of the king", charged against the Turks. The Turks, who were taken by surprise, were slaughtered by the furious Kinizsi and after a renewed attack, he managed to save Báthory.|$|E

2500|$|Some, such as {{the critic}} Vincent Canby, were {{concerned}} that his monologues were so intense that {{it seemed as though}} at <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> his [...] "creative process could reverse into a complete meltdown". His biographer Emily Herbert described his [...] "intense, utterly manic style of stand-up [...] defies analysis ... beyond energetic, beyond frenetic [...].

2500|$|Solon's travels {{finally brought}} him to Sardis, capital of Lydia. According to Herodotus and Plutarch, he met with Croesus and gave the Lydian king advice, which Croesus failed to {{appreciate}} {{until it was too}} late. Croesus had considered himself to be the happiest man alive and Solon had advised him, [...] "Count no man happy until he be dead." [...] The reasoning was that at <b>any</b> <b>minute,</b> fortune might turn on even the happiest man and make his life miserable. It was only after he had lost his kingdom to the Persian king Cyrus, while awaiting execution, that Croesus acknowledged the wisdom of Solon's advice.|$|E
2500|$|Hitler {{demanded to}} see {{plans for the}} {{invasion}} of Switzerland after the armistice with France. Franz Halder, the head of OKH, recalled: [...] "I was constantly hearing of outbursts of Hitler's fury against Switzerland, which, given his mentality, might have led at <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> to military activities for the army." [...] Captain Otto-Wilhelm Kurt von Menges in OKH submitted a draft plan for the invasion. [...] Generaloberst Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb's Heeresgruppe 'C (HGr. C), led by Generalleutnant Wilhelm List and 12th Army would conduct the attack. Leeb himself personally reconnoitered the terrain, studying the most promising invasion routes and paths of least resistance. Menges noted, in his plan, that Swiss resistance was unlikely and that a nonviolent Anschluss was the most likely result. With [...] "the current political situation in Switzerland," [...] he wrote, [...] "it might accede to ultimatum demands in a peaceful manner, so that after a warlike border crossing a rapid transition to a peaceful invasion must be assured." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1995 the ISI {{reported}} to Bhutto that Narasimha Rao had authorised nuclear tests, {{and that they}} could be conducted at <b>any</b> <b>minute.</b> Benazir put the country's nuclear arsenal programme on high-alert made emergency preparations, and ordered the Pakistani armed forces to remain on high-alert. However the United States intervened, Indian operations for conducting the nuclear tests were called off and the Japanese government attempted to mediate. In 1996, Benazir Bhutto met with Japanese officials and warned India about conducting nuclear tests. She revealed {{for the first time that}} Pakistan had achieved parity with India in its capacity to produce nuclear weapons and their delivery capability. She told the Indian press, that Pakistan [...] "cannot afford to negate the parity we maintain with India". These statements represented a departure from Pakistan's previous policy of [...] "nuclear ambivalence."

[...] "If (India) conducts a nuclear test, it would forced her (Pakistan) to.. [...] "follow suit..." [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|Swinton {{described}} Burn After Reading as [...] "a kind of monster caper movie," [...] {{and said}} of the characters, [...] "All of us are monsters – like, true monsters. It's ridiculous."

It's the whatever-ness of it. You feel that at <b>any</b> <b>minute</b> of any day in any town, this could happen." [...] Malkovich {{said of the}} characters, [...] "No one in this film is very good. They're either slightly emotional or mentally defective. Quirky, self-aggrandizing, scheming." [...] Pitt said the cast did little ad-libbing because the script was so tightly written and wove so many overlapping stories together. Veteran actor Richard Jenkins said the Coen brothers asked him if he could lose weight for his role as the gym manager, to which Jenkins jokingly replied, [...] "I'm a 60-year-old man, not Brad Pitt. My body isn't going to change." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1898, in {{the midst}} of virulent anti-Spanish press campaign, a number of papers quoted {{interviews}} with Cortina and discussed Carlist claims as proof that the Madrid government might fall <b>any</b> <b>minute.</b> Headlines and narration helped to mobilize the American public opinion, though certainly this was not Cortina’s intention. In May 1898 he transferred the realization of his prediction to June 1, 1898, called the Carlists of America to join the claimant and declared he would travel to Europe shortly. It is not clear whether he did indeed; one source claims vaguely that he [...] "took part in the 1898-1899 conspiracy." [...] He might have been involved in shipment of arms to Carlist conspirators, though nature of his engagement is highly unclear. In 1901 a Spanish military attaché in Washington reported to Madrid that Cortina helped him identify a cargo of 5,000 rifles, sent from New York to Lisbon and intended for a Carlist depot in Badajoz. If true, that would suggest that either Cortina changed sides or that he worked for the Carlists and for the Madrid government at the same time. Though also in the 20th century Cortina frequently visited Spain, he was hardly reported as engaged in Carlist activities, focused on promotion of his linguistic business. During resurgence of Carlism in the 1930s he was not mentioned in party propaganda.|$|E
