5|$|Further {{exploration}} of Indiana {{led to the}} French establishing an important trade route between Canada and Louisiana via the Maumee and Wabash rivers. The French built a series of forts and outposts in Indiana <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>hedge</b> against the westward expansion of the British colonies from {{the east coast of}} North America and to encourage trade with the native tribes. The tribes were able to procure metal tools, cooking utensils, and other manufactured items in exchange for animal pelts. The French built Fort Miamis in the Miami town of Kekionga (modern Fort Wayne, Indiana). France assigned Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes, as the first agent to the Miami at Kekionga.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer, {{reviewing}} {{his options}} in early 1943, gave {{priority to the}} gun-type weapon, but <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>hedge</b> against the threat of pre-detonation, he created the E-5 Group at the Los Alamos Laboratory under Seth Neddermeyer to investigate implosion. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. It was decided that the plutonium gun would receive {{the bulk of the}} research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be more easily adapted from it.|$|E

25|$|It was {{introduced}} to British gardens in 1736. In the UK, it is encountered frequently in gardens both large and small, {{as well as some}} parks, and is most common in the eastern areas of the country. It is sometimes employed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>hedge,</b> but is considered inferior for this usage compared to Tsuga heterophylla (western hemlock); it is not well adapted to the UK climate and as a consequence often has a poorly developed, forked and sinuous trunk there. In Germany, it is the most frequently seen hemlock in cultivation, and is also used in forestry.|$|E

25|$|For the consumer, channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>hedge</b> against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E
25|$|Changing {{the title}} of the {{screenplay}} to La Dolce Vita, Fellini soon clashed with his producer on casting: the director insisted on the relatively unknown Mastroianni while De Laurentiis wanted Paul Newman <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>hedge</b> on his investment. Reaching an impasse, De Laurentiis sold the rights to publishing mogul Angelo Rizzoli. Shooting began on 16 March 1959 with Anita Ekberg climbing the stairs to the cupola of Saint Peter’s in a mammoth décor constructed at Cinecittà. The statue of Christ flown by helicopter over Rome to Saint Peter's Square was inspired by an actual media event on 1 May 1956, which Fellini had witnessed. The film wrapped August 15 on a deserted beach at Passo Oscuro with a bloated mutant fish designed by Piero Gherardi.|$|E
25|$|The {{pipeline}} {{allowed an}} oil bonanza to take shape. Per capita incomes rose throughout the state, with virtually every community benefiting. State leaders were determined that this boom would not end like the fur and gold booms, {{in an economic}} bust {{as soon as the}} resource had disappeared. In 1976, the state's constitution was amended to establish the Alaska Permanent Fund, in which a quarter of all mineral lease proceeds is invested. Income from the fund is used to pay annual dividends to all residents who qualify, to increase the fund's principal <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>hedge</b> against inflation, and to provide funds for the state legislature. Since 1993, the fund has produced more money than the Prudhoe Bay oil fields, whose production is diminishing. , the fund's value was over $30 billion.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} results of {{ordinary}} least squares, bivariate vector autoregressive, and error correction models to estimate the hedge ratios for cotton production across different countries and to determine whether New York Cotton Exchange futures prices can serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>hedging</b> tool for cotton producers. Models comparison shows that the error correction model fits the data better. The results of the error correction model show that the spot prices and the NYCE futures prices are co-integrated in United States, Australia, and China, but not in Africa Franc Zone countries. In addition, for countries with higher market power, such as US and China, and countries without market distortions, such as Australia, the New York Cotton Exchange futures prices can serve <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>hedging</b> tool for cotton producers. In contrast, for less developed countries, such as Africa Franc Zone countries, and Pakistan, the NYCE futures prices cannot serve as hedging tool against the risks faced by cotton farmers...|$|R

40|$|Although covered {{interest}} parity (CIP) can {{be derived}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> arbitrage or <b>a</b> <b>hedging</b> condition {{in the absence of}} the bid-offer spreads, the arbitrage condition collapses when the spreads are introduced.

Furthermore, CIP is the results of a banking operation, and it holds irrespective of the market efficiency and the presence or otherwise of capital controls...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to this trade with the US, the coup regime was supported by massive profits from the drug trade thanks to the Haitian military's affiliation with the Cali Cartel; Aristide publicly stated that his own pursuit of arresting drug dealers was one event that prompted the coup by drug-affiliated military officials Raul Cedras and Michel Francois (a claim echoed by his former secretary of State Patrick Elie). Representative John Conyers (D-Michigan) {{expressed concern that the}} only US government agency to publicly recognize the Haitian junta's role in drug trafficking was the DEA, and that, despite a wealth of evidence provided by the DEA proving the junta's drug connections, the Clinton administration downplayed this factor rather than use it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>hedge</b> against the junta (as the US government had done against Manuel Noriega). Nairn in particular alleged that the CIA's connections to these drug traffickers in the junta not only dated to the creation of SIN, but were ongoing during and after the coup. Nairn's claims are confirmed in part by revelations of Emmanuel Constant regarding the ties of his FRAPH organization to the CIA before and during the coup government.|$|E
25|$|The modern Islamic {{fundamentalist}} {{movements have}} their {{origins in the}} late 19th century. The Wahhabi movement, an Arabian fundamentalist movement {{that began in the}} 18th century, gained traction and spread during the 19th and 20th centuries. During the Cold War following World War II, some NATO governments, particularly those of the United States and the United Kingdom, launched covert and overt campaigns to encourage and strengthen fundamentalist groups in the Middle East and southern Asia. These groups were seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>hedge</b> against potential expansion by the Soviet Union, and as a means to prevent the growth of nationalistic movements that were not necessarily favorable toward the interests of the Western nations. By the 1970s, the Islamists had become important allies in supporting governments, such as Egypt, which were friendly to U.S. interests. By the late 1970s, however, some fundamentalist groups had become militaristic leading to threats and changes to existing regimes. The overthrow of the Shah in Iran and rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini {{was one of the most}} significant signs of this shift. Subsequently, fundamentalist forces in Algeria caused a civil war, caused a near-civil war in Egypt, and caused the downfall of the Soviet occupation in Afghanistan. In many cases the military wings of these groups were supplied with money and arms by the U.S. and U.K.|$|E
