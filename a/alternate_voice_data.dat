The core play mechanics and story for all games remained mostly the same with some artistic changes in the remastered versions. For the remastering, both games have had a graphics overhaul to allow them to support modern 720p resolution on consoles, as well as run at locked 30 frames per second. Both games also feature an <b>alternate</b> <b>voice</b> dub, as well as PlayStation Network Trophies and Xbox 360 Achievements. Players have the option to switch between the original voice acting and the <b>alternate</b> <b>voice</b> acting for Silent Hill 2, while the re-dub is mandatory for Silent Hill 3 because it lacks the original voice acting.|$|R

In this research, <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> was used to estimate HR, because it can easily be recorded using a common device such as smartphone. To evaluate the feasibility of HR estimation using recorded voice, experiments were conducted with two subjects. In the experiment, 60 sets of HRs and <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> were measured per subject. A correlation between HR and the vocal frequency was observed, and the feasibility of HR estimation using <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> was confirmed. The relationship between HR and <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> was modeled using a polynomial function of vocal frequency. Using the proposed model, HR could be estimated with high correlation coefficients and small estimation errors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a brief survey about the existing key exchange protocols namely MIKEY, ZRTP and SDES. The core features of these protocols and their suitability to SIP-VoIP Networks are analyzed in this paper. The focused research area in VoIP {{is related to}} the Security and Quality of service of the <b>Voice</b> <b>data.</b> Among these areas VoIP security and confidentiality of <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> turns to be a challenging one. As VoIP delivers the voice packet over the public internet, using the transparent IP protocol suite the confidentiality of the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> is at risk. Moreover exchanging cryptographic keys to encrypt the media stream in the Session Initiation Protocol has proven to be quite difficult task. There is a need for stronger key management protocols which will secure the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> from all types of attack and which also provides a feasible key exchange mechanism. Each of these three key management protocols is surveyed and in addition its resistant against Man-In-The-Middle Attack has also been analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Determining how to {{transport}} delay-sensitive <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> {{has long been}} a problem in multimedia networking. The difficulty arises because <b>voice</b> and best-effort <b>data</b> are different by nature. It would not be fair to give priority to voice traffic and starve its best-effort counterpart; however, the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> delivered might not be perceptible if each voice call is limited to the rate of an average TCP flow. To address the problem, we approach it from a user-centric perspective by tuning the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> rate based on user satisfaction. Our contribution in this work is threefold. First, we investigate how Skype, the largest and fastest growing VoIP service on the Internet, adapts its <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> rate (i. e., the redundancy ratio) to network conditions. Second, by exploiting implementations of public domain codecs, we discover that Skype’s mechanism is not really geared to user satisfaction. Third, based on a set of systematic experiments that quantify user satisfaction under different levels of packet loss and burstiness, we derive a concise model that allows user-centric redundancy control. The model can be easily incorporated into general VoIP services (not only Skype) to ensure consistent user satisfaction...|$|R
