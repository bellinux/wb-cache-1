There have also been concerns that by applying a limited set of criteria to world universities, and given the strong desire to feature in the top 200 universities, rankings actually encourage the homogenization of higher education institutions, making them less responsive and less relevant to their immediate contexts.

25|$|Self-esteem was {{believed}} to be a cultural phenomenon of Western individualistic societies since low self-esteem was not occurring in collectivist countries such as Japan. The idea of low self-esteem and its many negative consequences led California assemblyman John Vasconcellos to work to create and fund the Task Force on Self-Esteem and Personal <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Responsibility</b> in California in 1986. Vasconcellos argued that this task force could combat many of the state's problems from crime and teen pregnancy to school underachievement and pollution. He compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease: it could help protect people from being overwhelmed by life's challenges.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} [...] "Ten Key Values" [...] {{statement was}} approved by the Greens' national steering committee and released in late 1984. [...] The values in the original statement are: Ecological Wisdom, Grassroots Democracy, Personal <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Responsibility,</b> Nonviolence, Decentralization, Community-based Economics, Postpatriarchal Values, Respect for Diversity, Global Responsibility, and Future Focus. [...] One unusual aspect, say many observers, is the way the values are described; instead of declaratory statements full of [...] "shoulds" [...] and [...] "musts", each value is followed by a series of open-ended questions. [...] "That idea... came from Mark Satin", Spretnak told scholar Greta Gaard in 1997. [...] Its effect, says sociologist Paul Lichterman, was to promote dialogue and creative thinking in local Green groups across the U.S.|$|E
500|$|The {{parliamentary}} debate {{was held on}} 8 April, {{one day after the}} 2010 general election had been announced, meaning it was during the so-called [...] "wash-up period" [...] when legislation is passed with little scrutiny. Only one hour was spent debating the ban and all three parties agreed, meaning no vote was required. In an interview conducted in July 2010, when he was no longer a minister, Johnson admitted the decision to ban mephedrone was sped up after widespread reporting of deaths caused by the drug, and because the government wished to pass the law before parliament was dissolved prior to the upcoming general election. In January 2011, however, Johnson told the Scunthorpe Telegraph that the decision was based only on information from the ACMD. An editorial in the April 2010 edition of The Lancet questioned the decision to ban mephedrone, saying the ACMD did not have enough evidence to judge the potential harms caused by mephedrone and arguing that policy makers should have sought to understand why young people took it and how they could be influenced to not take it. Evan Harris, then the Liberal Democrat science spokesman, stated the ACMD [...] "was not 'legally constituted'" [...] as required by the Misuse of Drugs Act, when the report on cathinones was published, since after Taylor resigned, it lacked a veterinary surgeon. In the rush to make mephedrone illegal, the act that was passed specified the inactive enantiomer of mephedrone, leaving the active form legal until the loophole was closed in February 2011 by another act of parliament. In Chemistry World, John Mann, professor of chemistry at Queen's University Belfast, suggested the UK create a law similar to the Federal Analog Act of the United States, which would have made mephedrone illegal as an analog of cathinone. In August 2010, James Brokenshire, the Home Office drugs minister, announced plans to create a new category in the Misuse of Drugs Act, through the Police Reform <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Responsibility</b> Bill, that would allow new legal highs to be made temporarily illegal, without the need for a vote in parliament or advice from the ACMD, as was required to categorise mephedrone.|$|E
