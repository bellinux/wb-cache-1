25|$|Malay {{historical}} linguists {{agree on}} {{the likelihood of the}} Malay homeland being in western Borneo stretching to the Bruneian coast. A form known as Proto-Malay language was spoken in Borneo at least by 1000 BCE <b>and</b> <b>was,</b> <b>it</b> has been argued, the ancestral language of all subsequent Malayan languages. Its ancestor, Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, a descendant of the Proto-Austronesian language, began to break up by at least 2000 BCE, possibly {{as a result of the}} southward expansion of Austronesian peoples into Maritime Southeast Asia from the island of Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Guidott set up {{a medical}} {{practice}} in the English town of Bath in 1668. He {{became interested in the}} curative properties of the waters and he wrote A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water in 1676. This brought the health-giving properties of the hot mineral waters {{to the attention of the}} aristocracy. Doctors and quacks set up further spa towns such as Harrogate, Bath, Matlock and Buxton soon after taking advantage of mineral water from chalybeate springs. Here cures were guaranteed by 'taking the water' or being 'dipped' by bathing attendant in cold water. Treatment was received in the nude. Until the 1670s nude female bathing in the spas was the norm and only after that restrictions were imposed. As time progressed the resorts had to address two questions; was it right that men and women bathed together, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> right that clothes should be worn. Establishments sought to impose dress codes.|$|E

2500|$|Behind the scenes, Clark had {{discovered}} that Moses had {{made a deal with}} Otto Hermann Kahn to realign the Northern State around his private golf course. Clark forwarded his discovery to Hutchinson and Hewitt, who in turn, demanded the payment sources for all purchases of private property. They also requested the information if any alignment was to cross through the route of a donor <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> changed after the gift. Moses denied the accusations made by Hewitt and Hutchinson, but soon admitted to Roosevelt that he had accepted $10,000 (1929USD) to shift the route but said the shift was to satisfy the objections of local landowners who refused to accept the alignment in Dix Hills. Roosevelt originally wanted to support the alignment through Wheatley Hills, but once Clark threatened to expose the disclosure to the public, he relented. On October 23, 1929, Clark told Roosevelt that the citizens were sick of Moses, who they claimed [...] "refused to compromise" [...] and was [...] "highly insulting". Roosevelt wasted no time coming up with a compromise to make the route have an abrupt turn at Glen Cove Road in Wheatley Hills.|$|E
2500|$|The {{book was}} written between 1959 and 1960. L'Engle wrote {{repeatedly}} about {{the writing of}} the story and the long struggle to get it published. In A Circle of Quiet (1972), she explains that the book was conceived [...] "during a time of transition." [...] After years of living in rural Goshen, Connecticut and running a general store, L'Engle's family, the Franklins, moved back to New York City, first taking a ten-week camping trip across the country and back again. L'Engle writes that [...] "we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains, wholly new and alien to me. And suddenly into my mind came the names, MrsWhatsit. MrsWho. MrsWhich." [...] This was in the spring of 1959. L'Engle was reading about quantum physics at the time, which also made its way into the story. When she completed the book in early 1960, however, it was rejected by at least 26publishers, because it was, in L'Engle's words, [...] "too different," [...] and [...] "because it deals overtly with the problem of evil, and it was really difficult for children, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> a children's or an adults' book, anyhow?" ...|$|E
