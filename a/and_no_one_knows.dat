2500|$|The {{emergence}} of Trinitarian theology of God the Father in early Christianity {{was based on}} two key ideas: first the shared identity of the Yahweh of the Old Testament and the God of Jesus in the New Testament, and then the self-distinction and yet the unity between Jesus and his Father.

In Christianity, God is called [...] "Father" [...] in a more literal sense, besides being the creator and nurturer of creation, and the provider for his children. [...] The Father is said to be in unique relationship with his only begotten (monogenes) son, Jesus Christ, which implies an exclusive and intimate familiarity: [...] "No one knows the Son except the Father, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him." ...|$|E
