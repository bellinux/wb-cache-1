5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Greenup was chosen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector for the ticket of James Madison and George Clinton. In 1812, {{he became a}} {{justice of the peace}} in Franklin County. In August 1812, Kentucky Secretary of State Martin D. Hardin {{recommended}} to Governor Isaac Shelby that Greenup be appointed Assistant Secretary of State. Shelby made the appointment, and when Hardin, resigned December 15, 1812, Shelby nominated Greenup as his replacement. The Kentucky Senate approved the nomination on February 3, 1813, and Greenup served until his resignation on March 13, 1813.|$|E
5|$|Having {{successfully}} {{dealt with}} the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound. Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor from serving consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, {{at the conclusion of}} his term in 1796. For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm. He was selected <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.|$|E
5|$|Magoffin became {{active in}} the Democratic Party, serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector in 1844, 1848, 1852, and 1856 and as a {{delegate}} to the Democratic National Convention in 1848, 1856, 1860, and 1872. He served one term in the Kentucky Senate in 1850, but declined his party's nomination for {{a seat in the}} U.S. House of Representatives in 1851. In 1855 was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, running on a ticket with Beverly L. Clarke, who was defeated by Know Nothing candidate Charles S. Morehead.|$|E

5|$|Owsley {{returned}} to the state House in 1831, and served {{in the state senate}} from 1832 to 1834. He also served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector for Henry Clay in 1833. When James Turner Morehead ascended to the governorship upon the death of John Breathitt, he appointed Owsley Secretary of State for his shortened term from 1834 to 1836. In 1843, Owsley retired from the practice of law and purchased a farm in Boyle County.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution vests {{the three}} {{branches}} of the state with different aspects of governmental power. The executive {{is made up of}} the President and the Cabinet, which is headed by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet is accountable to the electorate and is an embodiment of representative democracy. The President is elected by the people to act as a constitutional safeguard in protecting the national reserves and preserving the integrity of the public service. To qualify <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> candidate, stringent criteria must be satisfied.|$|E
5|$|A Democrat in a Whig district, Powell's {{political}} career {{began with an}} 1836 bid for {{a seat in the}} Kentucky House of Representatives. He campaigned vigorously while his opponent, John G. Holloway, relied largely on his party affiliation to carry the election. This proved a critical misstep for Holloway, as Powell secured the surprise victory. Holloway apparently learned from his mistake. Upon the completion of Powell's term in 1838, Holloway challenged Powell again, and defeated him by a considerable majority. Six year later, Powell was chosen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector on the Democratic ticket, supporting James K. Polk.|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Scott {{traveled}} to Philadelphia to help clarify service records {{that would determine}} the final pay {{of the men who}} served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky. He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799. Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest in a political career. With the advent of the First Party System, he declared himself a Democratic-Republican, as did most Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over Caleb Wallace. Scott and his fellow electors all cast their votes for the ticket of Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, Johnson was {{selected}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector for Tennessee, giving him more statewide publicity. Although Democratic President Martin Van Buren {{was defeated by}} former Ohio senator William Henry Harrison, Johnson was instrumental in keeping Tennessee and Greene County in the Democratic column. He {{was elected to the}} Tennessee Senate in 1841, where he served a two-year term. He had achieved financial success in his tailoring business, but sold it to concentrate on politics. He had also acquired additional real estate, including a larger home and a farm (where his mother and stepfather took residence), and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves.|$|E
5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> {{candidate for}} 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and {{campaign finance reform}} initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E

5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in Covington, Stevenson was elected county attorney for Kenton County. He was chosen as a delegate to the 1844 Democratic National Convention and was elected to represent Kenton County in the Kentucky House of Representatives the following year. He was reelected in 1846 and 1848. In 1849, he was chosen as a delegate to the state constitutional convention that produced Kentucky's third state constitution. In 1850, he, Madison C. Johnson, and James Harlan were appointed as commissioners to revise Kentucky's civic and criminal code. Their work, Code of Practise in Civil and Criminal Cases was published in 1854. He was again one of Kentucky's delegates to the Democratic National Conventions in 1848, 1852, and 1856, serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector in 1852 and 1856.|$|E

5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than anything else to the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector in 1793.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} {{articulate}} a specific campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E
5|$|Beli Orao (White Eagle) was a royal yacht {{built for}} the Royal Yugoslav Navy in 1939–1940, with the {{intention}} she would serve as an escort in wartime. She was captured by the Italians during the World War II Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, and was re-armed and saw service as a gunboat in the Royal Italian Navy, briefly as Alba then Zagabria, undertaking harbour protection and coastal escort duties. After the Italian armistice with the Allies in September 1943, she was handed back to the Royal Yugoslav Navy-in-exile in December of that year. After the war she remained in Yugoslav hands under the names Biokovo then Jadranka, serving as a naval yacht and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> yacht for the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, and also as a dispatch boat. In 1978, {{she was still in}} service as a private yacht.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} {{served in}} the Virginia House of Delegates and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> elector, the aging Scott now ran for governor. His 1808 campaign was skillfully managed by his step-son-in-law, Jesse Bledsoe, and he won a convincing victory over John Allen and Green Clay. A fall on the icy steps of the governor's mansion early in his term confined Scott to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life, and left him heavily reliant on Bledsoe, whom he appointed Secretary of State. Although he frequently clashed with the state legislature over domestic matters, the primary concern of his administration was the increasing tension between the United States and Great Britain that eventually led to the War of 1812. Scott's decision to appoint William Henry Harrison as brevet major general in the Kentucky militia, although probably in violation of the state constitution as Harrison was not a resident of the state, was nonetheless praised by the state's citizens. After his term expired, Scott returned to his Canewood estate. His health declined rapidly, and he died on October 22, 1813. Scott County, Kentucky, and Scott County, Indiana, are named in his honor, as are the cities of Scottsville, Kentucky, and Scottsville, Virginia.|$|E
