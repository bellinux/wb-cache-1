40|$|The {{internal}} {{organization of}} large firms {{as well as}} procurement and regulation contexts frequently involve a hierarchical nexus of contracts, with substantial delegation of decision making across layers. Such hierarchical delegation of decision making creates problems <b>of</b> <b>aligning</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>of</b> vertically related agents, and coordinating the actions of different branches of the hierarchy. In a principal-agent setting with private information, it is shown that under certain assumptions (top-down contracting, observability of subcontracting outcomes, absence of limited liability constraints) the hierarchy can implement second-best allocations. Incentive problems are overcome via compensations that are linear in a measure of performance of the concerned department, defined as {{the difference between a}} measure of imputed revenues and procurement costs. The coordination problem is overcome by conditioning output targets and payments on cost reports submitted by other branches; despite this, agents' strategies are dominant with respect to the behavior of members of other branches. The result provides conditions for the lack of a `control loss' from hierarchical decentralization of decision making, owing to incentive or coordination problems. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{conflict}} of interest which arises in the credit ratings industry due to the current issuer-pay model. We argue that {{the most efficient way}} <b>of</b> <b>aligning</b> the <b>incentives</b> <b>of</b> rating agencies is to return to an investor-pay system. Careful analysis of the reforms currently being discussed suggests that, by themselves, they will have insufficient impact if the current issuer-pay model is maintained. While a return to the pre- 1970 s investor-pay model would solve {{the conflict of}} interest problem, the issue of free-riding amongst some investors is likely to result in insufficient revenues for the rating agencies. We argue that although free-riding is a problem, the increasing use of ratings by institutions coupled with the rise in the speed of information diffusion and predominance of electronic trading venues over the last few decades would ensure that there are investors willing to subscribe to ratings. This investor-pay revenue could be supplemented by a government subsidy to ensure that sufficient resources are available to the rating agencies. To fund the government subsidy, we propose that a small tax would be levied on issuers or at the point of issue. A limited number of rating licenses which provided a ‘right to rate’ which would be auctioned (just like 3 G auctions) and the auction winners would be entitled to a portion of the tax pool which is paid in arrears and linked to the share of the investor-pay market that they manage to achieve. Such a system would <b>align</b> the <b>incentives</b> <b>of</b> the rating agencies with investors, would ensure a commercially viable ratings agency industry and would have negligible impact on primary issuance markets...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{why some}} employers provide matching contributions to 401 (k) plans in company stock and explores {{the implications of}} match policy for employee retirement wealth. Unlike stock option grants to non-executives, a firm’s decision to match in company stock {{does not appear to}} be strongly correlated with cash flow or with measures of the benefits <b>of</b> <b>aligning</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>of</b> employees and employers. Rather, we find evidence that firms are more likely to provide the match in company stock if firm risk is low (i. e. lower stock price volatility and lower bankruptcy risk) and employees are also covered by a defined benefit plan. These findings suggest that firms consider the retirement security of their workers in making the match decision, either because firms want to minimize the risk of violating their fiduciary responsibility or because employees more fully value company stock at companies with lower firm-specific risk. Evidence also indicates that firms may want to match in company stock to boost employee ownership, perhaps to help deter takeovers, or because of the tax advantages for dividends on the company stock match. Simulation results suggest that sufficiently risk-tolerant individuals actually prefer a 401 (k) plan at a company with a company stock match to a plan at a company with an unrestricted match, unless the equity premium is reduced substantially...|$|R

40|$|We study firms {{adopting}} stock-option {{plans for}} outside directors {{in a sample}} of Fortune 1000 firms from 1997 to 1999. Fixed-effects models accounting for self-selectivity bias indicate that companies with such plans have higher market-to-book ratios and profitability metrics. Option plan adoptions generate positive cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) and favorable revisions in analysts' earnings forecasts. Outside director appointments produce CARs close to zero for firms with option plans but significantly negative CARs for firms without them. We conclude that such stock-option plans help <b>align</b> the <b>incentives</b> <b>of</b> outside directors and shareholders, thereby improving firm value. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} {{intertwined}} problems of malware and online fraud, {{and argue that}} the fact that service providers often are financially responsible for fraud causes a relative lack <b>of</b> <b>incentives</b> for clients to manage their own security well.

We introduce an exceedingly lightweight audit mechanism to address this need – permitting for post-mortem infection analysis – and prove its security properties based on standard cryptographic hardness assumptions. We describe a deployment architecture that <b>aligns</b> the <b>incentives</b> <b>of</b> participants in order to facilitate quick adoption and widespread use of the technology. Our approach is flexible enough to protect even low-end computing devices like mobile handsets, which future malware will target heavily, but whose power and bandwidth limitations result in poor effectiveness for traditional anti-virus solutions.
