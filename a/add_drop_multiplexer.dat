The implemented by this method, interferometric device based on a full-cycle waveguide coupler exhibits symmetric and simultaneously optimised add/drop responses, of zero loss. Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (OADMs) based on Bragg Gratings (BG) are low cost and high performance solutions for use in Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) Optical Communication Systems. A number of different BG-based four-port OADMs implemented in interferometric configurations [1 - 2] have been proposed to date. Mainly they are based on half-cycle waveguide couplers (HCC) with a BG written into the uniform coupler waist [2], with the known limitations of the non symmetric add/drop response [3]. The design and implementation of the novel symmetric full cycle based OADM discussed here, overcome the performance limitations of the aforementioned HCC based OADMs. The proposed device is shown schematically in Fig. 1. The length Lc of the coupler is equal to the beat length Zc between the even and odd supermodes of the coupler which is defined as Zc=λ/(ne-no) where ne and no are the effective refractive indices of the even and odd supermodes respectively, and λ is the operating wavelength. The length Lx corresponds to π/ 2 phase difference between the normal modes at the coupler waist, Lp is the penetration depth at the design Bragg wavelength and Lg the BG length.

Transparency in the optical layer enables the transport networkto accept new bit rates, codes and formats of the clients. Theenabling technologies to achieve a reconfigurable andtransparent network are integrated tuneable devices andswitches. In this thesis some of these devices have beenexperimentally evaluated according to theirs cascadability andcrosstalk performance. A unidirectional self-healing wavelength divisionmultiplexed ring was designed, assembled and evaluated. Byutilising WDM, logical networks could be constructed withoptical add drop multiplexers (OADM) to support communicativeand distributive services. The main transmission limitation ofthe ring was homogenous broadening of the opticalamplifiers. The second network element investigated, was the opticalcrossconnect (OXC). The OXC was comprised of optical InP andLiNbO 3 switches and tuneable filters, which were experimentallyevaluated. Two OXCs and an OADM were installed in the Stockholmgigabit network (SGN) with fault and configurationmanagement. The cascadability of OXCs with reshaping repeaters andoptical or electrical switches was investigated. The jitter ofthe OXC with electrical switches limited its performance, whilethe OXC with optical switch was limited by its crosstalk. Crosstalk especially intra-band crosstalk, which beats with thesignal, is a severe limitation of optical networks. Experimentsand simulations were performed on the time dependence of theintra-band crosstalk. It was shown and experimentally confirmedthat the quasi-correlated intra-band crosstalk could be theworst case. In {{the next phase of}} the network five OADMs and one OXC,which interconnected a unidirectional and a bidirectionalprotected ring, were integrated into SGN with a web basedmanagement system. The OADMs were evaluated in a recirculating loop toinvestigate the cascadability of the nodes. The nodes could bedivided into optical channel or fibre protection and notch ordemultiplex filtering. An optimum of loss of the cascadedoptical amplifiers were found, which maximised the gainflatness and the signal to noise ratio.

The result of this combination {{can be referred to}} as a hybrid. The projects described in this work concern a number of these hybrids. The collection of projects are limited to optical applications, but are otherwise enormously different. There is perhaps no better way to illustrate this breadth than their characteristic length-scale. That is, the general size of the elements being hybridized. Ten orders of magnitude lie between the smallest system described and largest systems. At the several-nanometer scale, a single component of a composite optical material. Diamond possesses a unique combination of refractive and dispersive optical properties, making it an attractive optical material. Unfortunately, the lowest cost diamond available possesses large amounts of impurities and color. In an attempt to remove the visible color from commercially available detonation-origin nanodiamond powders we developed a facile three-step cleaning process. This process and the resulting qualities of the nanodiamond are discussed. At tens to hundreds of nanometers scale, we have worked to optimize a complete composite material system; a combination of Polystyrene-b-poly (2 -vinyl pyridine) (PS-b-P 2 VP), a block co-polymer with self-assembly properties, and controlled size iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticles. The applications in mind are magnetic field sensors, used in medical testing and physical experiments, and fiber optic isolators, used extensively in telecommunications networks. These composites exhibited commercially significant Verdet constants in room temperature Faraday rotation measurements, and possess processing benefits over the current state-of-the-art magneto-optically active materials. Several behaviors with respect to wavelength, particle loading, and primary particle size are discussed. At the micron to centimeter scale, we have designed and characterized a high-speed fiber-optic switch for telecommunications networks capable of reconfiguring 100 times faster than currently available technologies with comparable port counts. The switch is an unconventional hybrid of the micron-scale optics of single-mode fiber modes, and the centimeter scale of free-space holography. Built primarily using off-the-shelf components and a commercially available digital micro-mirror device (DMD), the switch is protocol and bit-rate agnostic, robust against random mirror failure, and provides the basic building block for a fully reconfigurable optical <b>add</b> <b>drop</b> <b>multiplexer</b> (ROADM).

A system possessing the peak efficiency of PV, with the deployable storage of CSP, would most effectively meet demand around the clock. In order to combine these technologies, we have developed an approach for designing a dichroic coating to optimize performance of such a system utilizing multi-junction photovoltaic cells while diverting unused light to heat collection.

They also present the current status and the challenges and opportunities for further research on the topic. The manuscript “ Effect of Polarization Mode Dispersion on the BER Performance of Optical CDMA ” deals with impact of polarization mode dispersion on the bit error rate performance of direct sequence optical code division multiple access. The authors, Md. Jahedul Islam and Md. Rafiqul Islam present an analytical approach toward determining the impact of different performance parameters. The authors show that the bit error rate performance improves significantly by the third order polarization mode dispersion than its first or second order counterparts. The authors Md. Shohrab Hossain, Mohammed Atiquzzaman and William Ivancic of the paper “ Cost and Efficiency Analysis of NEMO Protocol Entities ” present an analytical model for estimating the cost incurred by major mobility entities of a NEMO.

40|$|Networking of {{computing}} devices {{has been going}} through rapid evolution and thus continuing to be an ever expanding area of importance in recent years. New technologies, protocols, services and usage patterns {{have contributed to the}} major research interests in this area of computer science. The current special issue is an effort to bring forward some of these interesting developments that are being pursued by researchers at present {{in different parts of the}} globe. Our objective is to provide the readership with some insight into the latest innovations in computer networking through this. This Special Issue presents selected papers from the thirteenth conference of the series (ICCIT 2010) held during December 23 - 25, 2010 at the Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. The first ICCIT was held in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 1998. Since then the conference has grown to be one of the largest computer and IT related research conferences in the South Asian region, with participation of academics and researchers from many countries around the world. Starting in 2008 the proceedings of ICCIT are included in IEEExplore. In 2010, a total of 410 full papers were submitted to the conference of which 136 were accepted after reviews conducted by an international program committee comprising 81 members from 16 countries. This was tantamount to an acceptance rate of 33 %. From these 136 papers, 14 highly ranked manuscripts were invited for this Special Issue. The authors were advised to enhance their papers significantly and submit them to undergo review for suitability of inclusion into this publication. Of those, eight papers survived the review process and have been selected for inclusion in this Special Issue. The authors of these papers represent academic and/or research institutions from Australia, Bangladesh, Japan, Korea and USA. These papers address issues concerning different domains of networks namely, optical fiber communication, wireless and interconnection networks, issues related to networking hardware and software and network mobility.

The paper “High Performance Hierarchical Torus Network Under Adverse Traffic Patterns” addresses issues related to hierarchical torus network (HTN) under adverse traffic patterns. The authors, M. M. Hafizur Rahman, Yukinori Sato, and Yasushi Inoguchi observe that dynamic communication performance of an HTN under adverse traffic conditions has not yet been addressed. The authors evaluate the performance of HTN for comparison with some other relevant networks. It is interesting to see that HTN outperforms these counterparts in terms of throughput and data transfer under adverse traffic. The manuscript titled “Dynamic Communication Performance Enhancement in Hierarchical Torus Network by Selection Algorithm” has been contributed by M. M. Hafizur Rahman, Yukinori Sato, and Yasushi Inoguchi. The authors introduce three simple adapting routing algorithms for efficient use of physical links and virtual channels in hierarchical torus network. The authors show that their approaches yield better performance for such networks. The final title “An Optimization Technique for Improved VoIP Performance over Wireless LAN” has been contributed by five authors, namely, Tamal Chakraborty, Atri Mukhopadhyay, Suman Bhunia, Iti Saha Misra and Salil K. Sanyal. The authors propose an optimization technique for configuring the parameters of the access points. In addition, they come up with an optimization mechanism in order to tune the threshold of active queue management system appropriately. Put together, the mechanisms improve the VoIP performance significantly under congestion. Finally, the Guest Editors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the 15 reviewers besides the guest editors themselves (Khalid M.

They have responded to the Guest Editors in the shortest possible time and dedicated their valuable time to ensure that the Special Issue contains high-quality papers with significant novelty and contributions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn a WDM network, routing {{a request}} {{consists}} in assigning it a route {{in the physical}} network and a wavelength. If each request uses at most 1 /C of the bandwidth of the wavelength, we {{will say that the}} grooming factor is C. That means that on a given edge of the network we can groom (group) at most C requests on the same wavelength. With this constraint the objective can be either to minimize the number of wavelengths (related to the transmission cost) or minimize the number of <b>Add</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>Multiplexers</b> (shortly ADM) used in the network (related to the cost of the nodes). We consider here the case where the network is a path on N nodes, PN. Thus the routing is unique. For a given grooming factor C minimizing the number of wavelengths is an easy problem, well known and related to the load problem. But minimizing the number of ADMs is NP-complete for a general set of requests and no results are known. Here we show how to model the problem as a graph partition problem and using tools of design theory we completely solve the case where C= 2 and where we have a static uniform all-to-all traffic (one request for each pair of vertices) ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{the next generation}} of the Optical Cross <b>Add</b> and <b>Drop</b> <b>Multiplexer</b> (OXADM) for optical networks device particularly of the metropolitan ring and mesh configurations. OXADM is able to provide survivability through restoration against failures by means of linear, multiplex and ring protection to both configurations. Hybrid restoration technique with OXADM enables the linear, ring and multiplex protection mechanism to be integrated in single optical network which will be activated according to the degree and types of failure. Present simulation study has shown the topology migration can be implemented by using OXADM without any node restructuring and reinstallation. Any loss due to link extension can be compensated with the amplifier gain. The minimum gain required in the mesh is equal to the value in ring topology if the span is remain unchanged...|$|R
