The {{effect of}} {{alloying}} elements, heating rate and quenching temperature on the hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> 42 CrMo after induction hardening were investigated by thermal simulation tests, hardness tests, optical microscopy(OM) and scanning electronic microscopy(SEM). The steel No. 2 {{was obtained by}} adding 1. 49 % Ni and reducing 0. 32 % Cr in steel No. 1. Experimental {{results show that the}} hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 1 decreases while that <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 2 slightly increases under the quenched temperature of 900 °C when the heating rate increases from 100 °C/s to 300 °C/s. When the heating rate is 300 °C/s, the hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 1 increases sharply with the elevating of the quenched temperature. However, the hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 2 increases gently with the quenched temperature increasing below 900 °C but keeps constant above 900 °C. It is interesting that the hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 2 is obviously higher than that <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 1 under the same heating process. This phenomenon {{can be attributed to the}} following aspects: firstly, the Ac 1 and Ac 3 temperatures can largely decrease and the dissolution of carbide proceeds further; secondly, the addition of alloying element and the dissolution of carbide in the austenite can improve the hardenability <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> and thus increase the volume percentage of martensite in the quenched microstructure; in addition, the quenched microstructure <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 2 is finer than that <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 1 which undoubtedly helps the increase of hardness.

Test of two {{specimens}} (four different joints) <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> {{secondary beam}} embedded in reinforced concrete girder in frame structure and one specimen with steel cantilever beam embedded in reinforced concrete girder under static load were conducted. The steel beam up-flange was pulled {{out because of}} the concrete cracks caused by the moment, shear and torsion at the upper zone of the concrete beam near the steel beam end. Shear failure of the concrete beam and the top flange pullout failure are the most hazardous failure modes. Lacking restraint of concrete and the reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> bar in the concrete slab and catenary action <b>of</b> restraint <b>steel</b> beam, the capacity <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> cantilever beam is much smaller than other beams.
