Researchers believe that the odontoblasts would not form {{if it were not}} for the changes occurring in the IEE. As the changes to the IEE and the formation of odontoblasts continue from the tips of the cusps, the odontoblasts secrete a substance, an organic matrix, into their immediate surrounding. The organic matrix contains the material needed for dentin formation. [...] As odontoblasts deposit organic matrix termed predentin, they migrate toward the center of the dental papilla. Thus, unlike enamel, dentin starts forming in the surface closest to the outside of the tooth and proceeds inward. Cytoplasmic extensions are left behind as the odontoblasts move inward. The unique, tubular microscopic appearance of dentin is a result of the formation of dentin around these extensions.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} disorder on the dynamical spectrum of layered $f$-electron systems. With random dilution of $f$-sites in a single Kondo insulating layer, we explore the range and extent to which Kondo hole incoherence can penetrate into <b>adjacent</b> <b>layers.</b> We consider three cases of neighboring layers: band insulator, Kondo insulator and simple metal. The disorder-induced spectral weight transfer, used here for quantification of the proximity effect, decays algebraically with distance from the boundary layer. Further, we show that the spectral weight transfer is highly dependent on the frequency range considered {{as well as the}} presence of interactions in the clean <b>adjacent</b> <b>layers.</b> The changes in the low frequency spectrum are very similar when the <b>adjacent</b> <b>layers</b> are either metallic or Kondo insulating, and hence are independent of interactions. In stark contrast, a distinct picture emerges for the spectral weight transfers across large energy scales. The spectral weight transfer over all energy scales is much higher when the <b>adjacent</b> <b>layers</b> are non-interacting as compared to when they are strongly interacting Kondo insulators. Thus, over all scales, interactions screen the disorder effects significantly. We discuss the possibility of a crossover from non-Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid behavior upon increasing the ratio of clean to disordered layers in particle-hole asymmetric systems.

40|$|In {{photonic}} crystals made {{of materials}} with a frequency dependent dielectric function surface plasmon modes are extending over some <b>adjacent</b> <b>layers</b> {{and it turns}} out, that the dispersion can be tailored by coupling surface plasmons of <b>adjacent</b> <b>layers.</b> To give a detailed study we start investigating surface plasmons on a single metallic sheet. The mode dispersion is not bijective any more (i. e. is bent back) due to the coupling of surface plasmons and radiative modes, and the group velocity diverges and is even negative. This effect is still physical as the absorption of the metal influ-ences {{the properties of the}} surface plasmons and yields an inequality between group and energy velocity. Next to these effects we investigate the propagation distance of the surface states and optimize them by varying the thickness of the layers. Finally we calculate the dispersion for two <b>adjacent</b> <b>layers</b> to see possible coupling effects...|$|R

We find that spin magnetic moments localized at the vacancy site decrease by 10 % for our two configurations, compared with the graphene monolayer with a monovacancy. The reduction of the spin magnetic moment in the graphene bilayers is attributed to the interlayer charge transfer from the <b>adjacent</b> <b>layer</b> to the layer with the monovacancy, compensating for spin magnetic moments originating from quasilocalized defect states...|$|E

Here we show that, in the simplest case of a uniformly magnetized layer, this yields an unperturbed in situ frequency reference. We also discuss demagnetization contributions to measured shifts for this case.

40|$|During the {{processing}} of laminar ceramic, biaxial, residual stresses can arise due to differential thermal contraction between unlike layers. A tensile stress can cause pre-existing flaws to extend across the layer and into the <b>adjacent</b> <b>layers</b> and then tunnel until they meet either another crack or a free surface. A previous analysis has shown that for a given residual stress there is a critical layer thickness, below which no tunnel cracks will exist, regardless of initial flaw size.
