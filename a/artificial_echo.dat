40|$|International audienceThis {{contribution}} {{describes how}} Roma professional musicians in Romania use electronic sound processing for live performances in various contexts. It focuses on four techniques - amplification, mixing, reverberation and echo - which are intimately linked {{in the practice}} of these musicians. The latter two effects are modeled on natural acoustic phenomena, but are used by the musicians to create sound environments with artificial, impossible or paradoxical properties. The article details how these techniques are used, in relation to the typical interactions between the musicians and their audiences. This leads to the argument that <b>artificial</b> <b>echo</b> and reverberation (building upon amplification and mixing) are used by Roma professional musicians as techniques to "enchant" both the performance places and the social relations which they host...|$|E
40|$|Rats {{were trained}} to respond on a lever {{adjacent}} to a sounding speaker (the sound source) when a single click was emitted. A second click (the <b>artificial</b> <b>echo)</b> was presented through a second speaker on the opposite side. In Condition I, the echo (equal in intensity to the source) was delayed from. 015 to 32 milliseconds; greater than 75 % correct responses were given for delay times between about. 040 milliseconds (lower threshold) and 8 milliseconds (upper threshold). In Condition II, the echo (simultaneous with the source) was reduced in intensity relative to the source over a range from 2. 5 decibels to 40 decibels; greater than 75 % correct responses occurred for intensity reductions greater than 5 decibels. In Condition III, both the intensity and the delay time of the echo were manipulated in a manner analogous to that which would occur under natural conditions; greater than 95 % correct responses were given for delay times from 1 to 32 milliseconds. These data indicate that both time and intensity differences are necessary for localization of primary sources, with delay time contributing more at short echo path distances, and intensity differences at long distances...|$|E

40|$|Audio {{equalization}} is {{a technique}} which consists of boosting or cutting certain frequency components of a given signal for sound quality enhancement. Equalizer is an electronic device or type of software that increases and decreases the power of sound waves. The paper deals with the analysis of audio signals to develop insight on its frequency bands and auditory perception. This paper shows {{the implementation of the}} echo and reverberation effects using the TI’s C 6713 DSK. The effects are simulated using SIMULINK (The Mathworks, Inc.). Those simulation models are used to generate the DSP code for the real-time implementation. Once any of the models is complete and built, it automatically opens Code Composer Studio and compiles the Simulink block sets model. This gives us added advantage of easily writing codes on MATLAB and implementing it on the DSP processors. Echo and Reverberation are two of the simplest applications of Digital Signal Processing. DSP allows <b>artificial</b> <b>echoes</b> and reverberation to be added during mix down to simulate various ideal listening environments...|$|R

40|$|In 5 {{roosting}} bats the resting frequency, that is {{the mean}} frequency of the cf-portion of consecutive sounds, is kept constant {{with a standard deviation}} which varies between 30 120 Hz in different bats and at different days. In 15 bats the emitted sounds were electronically shifted in frequency and played back as <b>artificial</b> <b>echoes.</b> Upward frequency shifts were responded by a decrease of the emission frequency. This frequency compensation occurred at frequency shifts of up to 4400 Hz in all bats and up to 6000 ttz in a few bats. The frequency decrease in different bats over the whole compensation range was 50 - 300 tIz smaller than the frequency shifts in the echoes. The echoes, therefore, returned at a frequency, called the reference frequency, which was by this compensation offset higher than the resting frequency. The standard deviations of the emission frequency in compensating bats were only slightly larger than in roosting bats and the same in the whole compensation range. All bats started to compensate frequency shifts when they were slightly larger than the compensation offset. Downward frequency shifts were not responded by a change of the emission frequency, but the accuracy with which the emission frequency was kept decreased somewhat. From these results it is concluded that the Doppler shift compensation system of the Horseshoe bats compares the echo frequency with the reference frequency and compensates deviations of upward frequency shifts. ...|$|R
40|$|Binaural auralizations using {{headphones}} {{have become}} increasingly pop-ular in virtual reality applications to create a realistic three dimensional sound scape. Conventional methods use dummy heads to capture the sig-nals that arise at the ears of a listener. Such recordings cannot be played back with head-tracking, which is a significant limitation. Spherical micro-phone arrays allow capture of the spatial structure of a sound field. It is possible to impose the acoustic properties {{of the human body}} onto such a sound field and to calculate the signals that would arise at the ears of a listener who is coincident with the microphone array. Rotations of the listener, and therefore head-tracking, are straightforward to achieve. This thesis investigates signal processing of sound fields captured with spherical microphone arrays in combination with spherical measurements of head related impulse responses. When implemented, such signal processing enables true three dimensional audio with possible head tracking for all rotations, without limitations on the number of simultaneous users. The thesis has three major parts; the theory behind sound field expan-sions to the spherical harmonics domain and the related signal process-ing, controlled simulations to quantify the e˙ects di˙erent signal processing chains have on the resulting binaural signals, and a user study to see the subjective e˙ects of the proposed signal processing chains. A magnitude-phase separated expansion method is proposed to reduce time domain errors due to discrete spatial sampling, which is evaluated both with simulations and in the user study. The proposed expansion method performs worse than previously used expansion methods for non-anechoic spaces, resulting in <b>artificial</b> <b>echoes</b> in the binaural sound signals...|$|R

40|$|Change of globe surface {{height is}} an {{important}} factor to study human living environment. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on ICESat is the first laser-ranging instrument for continuous global observations of the Earth. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of full-waveform laser altimeter, this study simulated the operating mode of ICESat and modeled different terrains’ (platform terrain, slope terrain, and <b>artificial</b> terrain) <b>echo</b> waveforms based on the radar equation. By changing the characteristics of the system and the targets, numerical echo waveforms can be achieved. Hereafter, we mainly discussed the factors affecting the amplitude and size (width) of the echoes. The experimental results implied that the slope of the terrain, backscattering coefficient and reflectivity, target height, target position in the footprint and area reacted with the pulse all can affect the energy distribution of the echo waveform and the receiving time. Finally, Gaussian decomposition is utilized to decompose the echo waveform. From the experiment, it can be noted that the factors which can affect the echo waveform and by this way we can know more about large footprint full-waveform satellite laser altimeter...|$|R

Account is {{taken of the}} irregularity polarizations, scale length and the magnetic dip angle of the echo. Ray tracing equations are defined for wave propagation in a horizontally stratified ionosphere which has been bathed with HF signals and therefore contains wavelike structures. Irregularities polarized within the meridian plane are found to cause the spread F echoes, while perpendicularly polarized irregularities do not. A magnetic dip angle of 5 deg must be exceeded for the spread F to become strong. The irregularities need scale lengths exceeding 100 m. Modes of operation are identified for inducing the required spread F echoes using ground-based radiotelescopes...|$|R
50|$|Putnam was {{the first}} person in the US to use <b>artificial</b> {{reverberation}} using <b>echo</b> chambers for commercial recording. (The BBC's broadcasting studios in Savoy Hill, London, used for both broadcasting and commercial recording, were the first anywhere to use purpose made echo chambers with both echo send and returns and cue sends and multi-band EQ, and recording to disc and tape as early as 1931.) He also developed the first US multi-band audio equalizer, and with his company Universal Recording Electronics Industries (UREI), he was responsible for the development of classic recording studio equipment including the UREI 1176LN, the UREI Time Align Monitor, and the Universal recordings consoles, which soon became standard equipment in studios all over America. Alongside his friend Les Paul, Putnam was also involved in the early development of stereophonic recording and he founded several major independent recording studios in Chicago, Las Vegas, Hollywood and San Francisco.|$|R
40|$|The {{compensation}} of Doppler-shifts by the bat, Rhinolophusferrumequinum, functions only when certain temporal {{relations between the}} echo and the emitted orientation sound are given. Three echo configurations were used: a) Original orientation sounds were electronically Doppler-shifted and played back either cut at the beginning (variable delay) or at the end (variable duration) of the <b>echo.</b> b) <b>Artificial</b> constant frequency <b>echoes</b> with variable delay or duration were clamped to {{the frequency of the}} emitted orientation sound at different Doppler-shifts. c) The echoes were only partially Doppler-shifted and the Doppler-shifted component began after variable delays or had variable durations. With increasing delay or decreasing duration of the Doppler-shifted echo the compensation amplitude for a sinusoidally modulated + 3 kHz Dopplershift (modulation rate 0. 08 Hz) decreases for all stimulus configurations (Figs. 1, 2, 3). The range of the Doppler-shift compensation system is therefore limited by the delay due to acoustic travel time to about 4 m distance between bat and target. In this range the overlap duration of the echo with the emitted orientation sound is always sufficiently long, when compared with data on the orientation pulse length during target approach from Schnitzler (1968) (Fig. 5). ...|$|R
