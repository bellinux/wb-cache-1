Trikoupis) and the savant. [...] However, it is mainly the poet and the savant who speak. [...] The poet is {{trying to prove that}} katharevousa is an artificial language, of no use to either the people nor to literature. [...] The poet supports a literary language based on the language spoken by the people, that should be elaborated on by the poet. [...] In order to support his argument, the following phrase is used: [...] "firstly succumb to the language of the people <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are worthy, conquer it". His arguments are based on the French Age of Enlightenment {{on the subject of the}} use of national languages and on examples of Italian poetry, by which he tries to prove that no word is vulgar in itself but gets its meaning by the poem's context. [...] At the end of the work, the poet abandons the rational reasoning and supports his arguments with passion.|$|E
