5|$|While the inceptive noir, Stranger on the Third Floor, was a B picture {{directed}} by a virtual unknown, {{many of the}} films noir still remembered were A-list productions by well-known film makers. Debuting as a director with The Maltese Falcon (1941), John Huston followed with Key Largo (1948) and The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Opinion is divided on the noir status of several Alfred Hitchcock thrillers from the era; at least four qualify by consensus: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951) and The Wrong Man (1956). Otto Preminger's success with Laura (1944) made his name and helped demonstrate noir's adaptability to a high-gloss 20th Century-Fox presentation. Among Hollywood's most celebrated directors of the era, arguably none worked more often in a noir mode than Preminger; his other noirs include Fallen Angel (1945), Whirlpool (1949), Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950) (all for Fox) and Angel Face (1952). A half-decade after Double Indemnity and The Lost Weekend, Billy Wilder made Sunset Boulevard (1950) and <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> (1951), noirs that were not so much crime dramas as satires on Hollywood and the news media. In a Lonely Place (1950) was Nicholas Ray's breakthrough; his other noirs include his debut, They Live by Night (1948) and On Dangerous Ground (1952), noted for their unusually sympathetic treatment of characters alienated from the social mainstream.|$|E
25|$|In a 2014 article, Douglas cited The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, Champion, <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole,</b> The Bad and the Beautiful, Act of Love, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Indian Fighter, Lust for Life, Paths of Glory, Spartacus, Lonely Are the Brave, and Seven Days in May as {{the films}} {{he was most}} proud of {{throughout}} his acting career.|$|E
25|$|While he {{continued}} to play with his band, without any real connections to the recording industry, Strait became friends with Erv Woolsey, who operated one of the bars in which the <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> band played, and who had previously worked for the major label MCA Records. Woolsey convinced some of his Music Row (Nashville, TN) connections to come to Texas and to listen to Strait and his band play. Impressed with the performance, but concerned that they couldn't market the Western Swing sound that the band featured, they left without a deal. After several unsuccessful trips to Nashville {{in search of a}} record deal in which Strait was turned down by every label in town, he considered giving up music altogether. He was offered a job designing cattle pens and decided to take it. He gave the band notice that he was leaving, but after a discussion with his wife, she convinced him to give music one more year. Not long afterward, MCA signed Strait to a recording contract in February 1981. The initial deal was for one song. If the single did well, the label would then consider doing an album. The <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> band remained with Strait, performing as the backup and touring band for the now solo act.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, McCall {{signed with}} [...] "Wayside Records" [...] and {{released}} four singles. In 1970, he released his first album, Meet Darrell McCall for Mercury Records. Hank Williams Jr. recorded a song penned by McCall in 1971 entitled [...] "Eleven Roses." [...] It became a No. 1 hit for Williams {{and resulted in}} a songwriting contract offer from [...] "Tree International Publishing" [...] for McCall, who accepted. In 1974, he signed with Atlantic Records, releasing the single [...] "There's Still a Lot of Love in San Antone." [...] The following year he left Atlantic and signed with Columbia records. During this period his popularity grew due to the Outlaw Country sound being pushed into the mainstream. With Columbia he recorded the hit duet [...] "Lily Dale" [...] with Willie Nelson, which became a top 40 hit and was awarded the [...] "Best Duet of 1977" [...] by Cash Box Magazine. After a few more singles with the label, McCall signed with Hillside Records in 1980 and released a single, but then decided to sign with RCA Records. With RCA, he released his final top 40 hit [...] "Long Line of Empties." [...] His final charting single [...] "Memphis in May" [...] was released for Indigo Records in 1984. In 1986, McCall recorded two albums, including one with Johnny Bush. Following these releases, he stopped recording but continued to tour. However, he did appear as the lead singer on a few tracks of <b>the</b> <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole's</b> 1995 debut album.|$|R
500|$|Four {{years after}} the Abbey Road sessions, Harrison {{revisited}} [...] "You" [...] while completing his final album for Apple Records, the soul-influenced Extra Texture (Read All About It), at A Studios in Los Angeles. His standing with music critics had recently plummeted following a North American tour with Ravi Shankar in Novemberâ€“December 1974 and his accompanying album, Dark Horse. These two projects had been marred by Harrison's laryngitis-ravaged singing voice; in addition, a number of concert reviewers had condemned Harrison for refusing to indulge the public's nostalgia for the Beatles, and for his on-stage spiritual pronouncements. Looking to rehabilitate himself with critics and his audience in early 1975, Harrison had what author Robert Rodriguez describes as [...] "at least one <b>ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> commercial <b>hole...</b> <b>the</b> Motown-esque 'You'".|$|R

25|$|The {{life and}} death of Collins {{inspired}} the musical Floyd Collins by Adam Guettel and Tina Landau, as well as one film documentary, several books, a museum and many short songs. <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> (alternate title, The Big Carnival) is a 1951 film by Billy Wilder based on the media circus surrounding the attempted rescue of a man stuck in a cave. The film depicts a fictional incident, but Collins is mentioned by name in the dialogue. He is mentioned in two novels by Kentucky writers Robert Penn Warren and James Still: The Cave and River of Earth.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{became an}} {{international}} star through positive reception for his leading {{role as an}} unscrupulous boxing hero in Champion (1949), which brought him his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Other early films include Young Man with a Horn (1950), playing opposite Lauren Bacall and Doris Day; <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> opposite Jan Sterling (1951); and Detective Story (1951). He received a second Oscar nomination for his dramatic role in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), opposite Lana Turner, and his third nomination for portraying Vincent van Gogh in Lust for Life (1956).|$|E

500|$|... "Radio Bart" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening {{came up with the}} idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole,</b> which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO following the airing of the episode, David Benioff {{spoke about the}} revelation in King's Landing, and Tommen's decision to abolish [...] "trial by combat," [...] stating [...] "This moment is a grievous blow for Cersei because she's been counting on trial by combat really {{since the end of}} season five. This was always her <b>ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> the Mountain was never going to lose a trial by combat there's no one out there who could beat him. And then Tommen takes it away from her and knowing really what he's doing. He might be a weak King, but he's not an idiot, he understands that this move is going to mean that she's probably not going to fare that well in this trial. So it's a pretty devastating moment for Cersei, and you see that in her reaction, and partly because it just bodes so ill for this coming trial, and partly because it's her own son who's really betrayed her." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1951, Douglas starred as a {{newspaper}} reporter anxiously looking for a big story in <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole,</b> director Billy Wilder's first effort as both writer and producer. The subject and story was controversial at the time, and U.S. audiences stayed away. Some reviews saw it as [...] "ruthless and cynical ... a distorted study of corruption, mob psychology and the free press." [...] Possibly it [...] "hit too close to home", says Douglas.|$|E

Dominguez and Foote left the band after graduating in 1975, prompting {{a search for a}} new singer. The band members posted bulletins around the campus of Southwest Texas. One was noticed by an agricultural science student, George Strait. He contacted the band and was hired after an audition. Soon after, the group was renamed [...] "Ace in the Hole".|$|E
2500|$|On September 26, 2012, Strait {{announced}} that he was retiring from touring, and that his Cowboy Rides Away Tour would be his last. Tickets for both arenas and stadiums on the Cowboy Rides Away Tour sold out in a matter of hours. The tour started on January 18, 2013 in Lubbock, Texas and was divided into two legs: 21 concerts in 2013 and 26 concerts in 2014, for a total of 47 concerts. The tour ended in Arlington, Texas on June 7, 2014. Strait was supported on the tour by his longtime eleven-member touring group, the <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> Band. For the 2013 leg, Martina McBride was the opening performer.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his college}} years, Strait joined the country band Stoney Ridge, {{answering}} a flyer the band posted around campus {{looking for a}} new vocalist. Strait renamed the group the <b>Ace</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> Band and quickly became the lead; they began to perform at different honky-tonks and bars around south and central Texas, traveling as far east as Huntsville and Houston. They gained a regional following and opened for national acts such as The Texas Playboys. Soon, his band was given the opportunity to record several Strait-penned singles including [...] "That Don't Change The Way I Feel About You," [...] and [...] "I Can't Go On Dying Like This" [...] for the Houston-based D label. However, the songs never achieved wide recognition, and Strait continued to manage his family cattle ranch during the day in order to make some extra cash.|$|E
