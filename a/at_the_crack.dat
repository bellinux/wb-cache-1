40|$|International audienceCeramic Matrix Composites {{reinforced}} with long fibers are potential candidates for high-temperature structural applications. Their lifetime is mainly {{controlled by the}} fibers. The rupture mechanism of fibers under environmental conditions and mechanical stress is the environmentally assisted propagation of their surface defects toward their core. <b>The</b> analysis of <b>cracks</b> subcritical propagation is called static fatigue, because most works use a Paris-like law relating <b>the</b> <b>crack's</b> velocity to <b>the</b> <b>crack's</b> stress intensity factor. This law, depending on temperature, agrees fairly well with experimental results for constant environmental conditions. However, is not directly suitable to varying ones, {{as it is the}} case in real composites. The approach to subcritical propagation introduced here relies on classical fracture mechanics, in which the environment only modifies <b>the</b> damage zone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack's</b> tip. <b>The</b> model does not explicitly depend on temperature, but only on the total oxygen flux reacting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack's</b> tip. Consequently, this model is valid for any temperature and oxygen pressure, which can vary along time, as long as the environment is modelled properly. For Hi-Nicalon fibers up to 1000 °C in dry atmosphere, we introduced the chemical phenomena observed through simple diffusion/reaction models in order to define the true oxygen flux reacting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack's</b> tip. <b>The</b> resulting identified model is validated on experimental data...|$|R

500|$|Moffat's plan [...] "from the outset", to tie {{the episode}} into the {{overarching}} story arc of the series, was that Rory not just die but be erased from history in {{the crack in the}} universe. Moffat would later bring Rory back in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", though the episode reveals his consciousness was placed in a Roman centurion Auton as part of a trap for the Doctor to save the universe from the cracks. Moffat also thought it was appropriate as the trio had had fun, and now {{it was time for a}} casualty.

Patton commanded the battle from a shell hole for another hour before being evacuated. He stopped at a rear command post to submit his report before heading to a hospital. Sereno E.

40|$|International audienceA new {{modeling}} {{approach to}} subcritical crack propagation (i. e. static fatigue) in ceramics {{has recently been}} introduced [9] and applied {{to the case of}} ceramic fibers. This approach relies on classical fracture mechanics, in which the zone near <b>the</b> <b>crack's</b> tip is modified by the environment (particularly through oxidation, corrosion, etc). In some cases, {{it comes down to the}} widely-used three-parameters Paris-like subcritical crack propagation law. For the general case, a two-parameter propagation law is derived that only depends on the total oxygen flux reacting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack's</b> tip. Consequently, this model is valid for any temperature, oxygen or water pressure, etc, which can vary along time, as long as the environment is modelled properly. For Hi-Nicalon fibers up to 1000 °C in dry atmosphere, the chemical phenomena observed are introduced through simple diffusion/reaction models in order to define the true oxygen flux reacting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack's</b> tip. <b>The</b> resulting identified model is validated on experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{composite}} materials {{have a significant}} role in structural retrofitting and repairing. The failure of retrofitted members is usually due to delamination of the plate from the beam. This mode of failure may occur either <b>at</b> <b>the</b> plate end or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracked</b> zone in a concrete beam. This paper aims to examine the critical interfacial shear stresses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>cracked</b> region. <b>The</b> methodology consists of analytical and finite element solutions. A closed form solution is developed to express the distribution of interfacial shear stresses along <b>the</b> bond length <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracked</b> zone of a reinforced concrete beam. In the analytical solution the nonlinear behavior of concrete is examined. In this part, by solving equilibrium equations based on the strain compatibility condition, the tensile force in FRP fabric would be calculated as a boundary condition in defining the interfacial shear stress function. Also, the numerical solution using FEM is performed in order to control the analytical predictions. In this part the concrete is linear elastic and the pattern of a single <b>crack</b> formation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> midspan is prepared...|$|R

40|$|Published 20 June 2017 This study {{proposes a}} time-domain {{spectral}} finite element (SFE) model and investigates nonlinear guided wave interaction at a breathing crack. An extended time-domain SFE method {{based on the}} Mindlin–Hermann rod and Timoshenko beam theory is proposed to predict the nonlinear guided wave generation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> breathing <b>crack.</b> An SFE crack element is proposed to simulate the mode-conversion effect, in which a bilinear crack mechanism is implemented {{to take into account}} <b>the</b> contact nonlinearity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> breathing <b>crack.</b> There is good agreement between the results calculated using the proposed time-domain SFE method and threedimensional finite element simulation. This demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed SFE method in simulating contact nonlinearity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> breathing <b>crack.</b> Parametric studies using the fundamental symmetric (S₀) and anti-symmetric (A₀) modes of guided waves are also carried out to provide physical insights into the higher harmonics generated due to <b>the</b> contact nonlinearity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> breathing <b>crack.</b> <b>The</b> magnitude of the higher harmonics generated as a function of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> depth is investigated in detail.
