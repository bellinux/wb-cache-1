5|$|In 1999, Six Flags Great Adventure spent $42 {{million on}} new attractions {{including}} <b>a</b> <b>prototype</b> Floorless Coaster, Medusa (later renamed Bizarro), developed and built by Bolliger & Mabillard.

5|$|None of {{the other}} base units rely on <b>a</b> <b>prototype</b> – {{all are based on}} {{phenomena}} that are directly observable and had been in use for many years before formally becoming part of the metric system.|$|E
50|$|The Westland F.7/30 (or Westland PV.4) was <b>a</b> British fighter <b>prototype.</b> <b>A</b> single <b>prototype</b> {{was built}} in 1934, but the type was not put in {{production}} because its performance fell far below the RAF's requirements. The Gloster Gladiator won the F.7/30 competition.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> first <b>prototype</b> was {{proposed}} with 3 grenades in an internal tubular magazine. The prototype was deemed too heavy (8 kg) and bulky to be acceptable, {{which led to}} the design of <b>a</b> second <b>prototype.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Maschinenpistole 40 ("Machine pistol 40") {{descended from}} its {{predecessor}} the MP 38, {{which was in}} turn based on the MP 36, <b>a</b> <b>prototype</b> made of machined steel. The MP 36 was developed independently by Erma Werke's Berthold Geipel with funding from the German Army. It took design elements from Heinrich Vollmer's VPM 1930 and EMP. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted <b>a</b> <b>prototype</b> to answer a request from the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.|$|E
