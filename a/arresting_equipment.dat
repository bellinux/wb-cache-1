40|$|This {{cooperative}} research work {{is concerned with}} the development of fall <b>arrest</b> <b>equipment</b> constructed from textile materials for use in mountaineering, caving and industrial safety applications. The range of webbings available for use in fall <b>arrest</b> <b>equipment</b> is examined, and some basic experiments to determine the effect of severe abrasion are described. The methods of stitching slings (loops of webbing) are examined, and the effects of external abrasion on conventional lap joints and bartacked joints are compared. The development of harnesses is examined and the factors affecting their future design are considered. The major part of the work {{is concerned with the}} way in which the energy of a falling body is absorbed in a fall arrest system and with the peak impact loads imposed on the system's components. To measure these loads, apparatus was developed at the cooperating company's premises, together with appropriate instrumentation. A series of tests were carried out to determine loads in falls of increasing severity. The ensuing development work concerned textile shock absorbers, which are designed to limit the impact force in a fall to a predetermined maximum. Using the drop test apparatus, it was shown that such shock absorbers have very little practical effect in a climbing situation. However, the principles embodied in these devices were used to develop an industrial safety lanyard with an integral shock absorber which conforms to British Standard 1397. This device is lighter and more compact than others currently on the market and represents a step forward in the field. ...|$|R

40|$|The present {{work was}} {{undertaken}} {{to demonstrate the}} effect of jet plane sounds on the economical performances in female chickens, by use of growth, feed requirement, sexual maturity, laying rate, average and total egg weights, and some other characters as the indicators. The experiment {{was carried out in}} the specially constructed poultry house, provided with air conditioning and sound <b>arresting</b> <b>equipments,</b> using S. C. White Leghorn and New Hampshire chickens as the materials. The frequency and intensity of sounds supplied was settled according to those of flying over jet planes near Itazuke airbase. The frequency was from 72 to 166 per day and the intensity was about 110 - 120 phones. There was no detrimental effect of the sounds on growth rate, feed requirement, and sexual maturity in chickens treated with the sounds throughout their lives. However, a little retardation of sexual maturity was found in some pullets, when the sound supplies was started at 16 weeks of age. In the group of pullets treated with the sounds throughout their laying period, the laying rate seemed to decrease more rapidly than that of the control group, and a significant interaction between the breed and the treatment was estimated in the total weight of laid eggs. Analyzing the data, the authors summarized their opinion that White Leghorn pullets may be more susceptible to the sound supplies than New Hampshire pullets. A little detrimental effect of the sounds seemed to be observed on the total weight of laid eggs, when the treatment was begun after the pullets had come to layers. No significant effect of the sounds was observed on the frequency of occurrence of soft shelled or blood spotted eggs. 本研究は成長,飼料の要求率,性成熟,産卵率,平均卵重量,生産卵総重量,およびその他いくつかの形質を指標として,雌鶏の生産性に対するジェット機騒音の影響を明らかにするために計画されたものである. 実験は単冠白色レグホンおよびニューハンプシャー種を供試鶏として,本研究のためにとくに設計された,空気および音響制御装置をもつた実験鶏舎内で遂行された. 供試鶏に加与された騒音の回数と強度は,板付飛行場付近の実情に応じて定められたが,その回数は 1 日あたり 72 回から 166 回の間にあり,強度はおよそ 110 ～ 120 フオーンであつた. 幼雛の時期から継続的に騒瞥を加与したばあいには,成長,飼料要求率,および性成熟に対して,その影響を認めることができなかつた. しかし 16 週齢以後に騒音処理を開始したものには,少数例ではあつたが多少性成熟の遅延がみられた. 産卵期を通じて騒音処理を継続したものでは,産卵率がいくらか早く低下するような傾向があり,生産卵の総重量において品種と処理との間の相互作用に有意性が認められた. 著者らはこの関係資料を分析した結果,白色レグホンの方がニューハンプシャーよりも,騒音処理の影響をうけやすいと要約した. 産卵開始後に騒音処理を開始すると,生産卵の総重量にいくらかの悪影響があるように思われた. 軟卵および血点卵の出現率には,騒音の影響を認めることができなかつた...|$|R
