25|$|Radar systems must {{overcome}} unwanted signals {{in order to}} focus on the targets of interest. These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (<b>atmospheric</b> <b>noise</b> and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.|$|E

He helped develop an air-driven noise generator that produced 10,000 acoustic watts and was driven by a [...] diesel engine. He helped NASA with voice communication equipment including long lines between Cape Canaveral and Houston as well as assisting the Air Force with their worldwide telephone system. He worked on military listening systems. In 1968, Hilliard retired from regular employment at LTV, continuing to work with LTV as a consultant {{but in the same}} manner as if he hadn't retired. In the early 1970s, Hilliard directed the hearing conservation program at Bio-Medical Engineering Corporation. He founded J.K.Hilliard and Associates in the mid-1970s, performing architectural acoustic analysis and creating the standards for California's multi-family housing construction acoustic design policies, significantly influencing interior and exterior noise-control standards for homeowners across the United States.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Marconi began {{investigating}} the means to signal completely across the Atlantic in order to compete with the transatlantic telegraph cables. Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, Rosslare Strand, Co. Wexford in 1901 to act as a link between Poldhu in Cornwall, England and Clifden in Co. Galway, Ireland. He soon made the announcement that the message was received at Signal Hill in St John's, Newfoundland (now part of Canada) on 12 December 1901, using a [...] kite-supported antenna for reception—signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at Poldhu, Cornwall. The distance between the two points was about [...] It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was—and continues to be—considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters (frequency ≈850kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. We now know (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter S. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>noise.</b> (A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995.) The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.|$|E

Results of {{the analysis of the}} measurements are summarized as follows: 1) The daytime noise intensity which is predominant in the tropical region and near South Africa corresponds well to the meteorological situation. 2) <b>Atmospheric</b> radio <b>noise</b> intensity measured on board the "SOYA" agrees well with the values predicted on the "Noise Map" prepared by CRPL and with the result of measurement at the fixed stations (Singapore and Pretoria). 3) Characteristics of the <b>atmospheric</b> radio <b>noise</b> were examined in connection with the solar zenith angle and the latitude. Both the mode of diurnal variation and the relation between absorption and solar zenith angle very distinctly with the latitude. 4) Decrease in the intensity at midnight towards the south from about 32 °S is greater than that of the intensity calculated only from the distance (the so-called unabsorbed field intensity) and smaller than what was predicted on the CRPL 2 ̆ 7 s map. 5) Abnormal enhancement of the radio noise was seen when the ship went under the pouring rain, while the noise fell down to zero level with a flash of lightning, and then it rose exponentially with the time constant of the order of 1 minute. These facts seem to suggest the mechanism how the <b>atmospheric</b> radio <b>noise</b> originates in rain falls.

We present an analytical expression of the spectrum of acceleration fluctuations of the test-masses of the interferometer {{in terms of the}} experimentally obtainable spectrum of pressure fluctuations. Second, we consider the gravitational coupling of interferometer test-masses to fluctuations of atmospheric density due to the propagation of sound waves generated in a turbulent Lighthill process. We present an analytical expression - in the Fourier space - of the spectrum of acceleration fluctuations of the test-masses of the interferometer.

30|$|In {{communication}} theory, the GG distribution finds many modeling {{applications in}} impulsive noise channels which {{occur when the}} noise pdf has a longer tail than the Gaussian pdf. For example, in Beaulieu and Young (2009) it is shown that in ultrawideband (UWB) systems with time-hopping (TH) the interference should be modeled with probability distributions that are more impulsive than the Gaussian. Moreover, {{it has been shown}} that for the moderate and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) the interference in the TH-UWB is well modeled by the GG distribution with a parameter p≤ 1. In Algazi and Lerner (1964) and Miller and Thomas (1972) certain <b>atmospheric</b> <b>noises</b> were shown to be impulsive and GG distributions with parameter values of 0.1 <p< 0.6 were shown to provide good approximations to their distributions.|$|R
