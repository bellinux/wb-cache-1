5|$|There {{are many}} {{stakeholders}} {{in many countries}} such as The United States who report several concerns in the usage of rules-based accounting. According to recent studies, many believe that the principles-based approach in financial reporting would not only improve but would also support an auditor upon dealing with client’s pressure. As a result, financial reports could be viewed with fairness and transparency.

Public and private arrangements exist to assist and guide countries struggling with sovereign debt payments, such as the Paris Club and London Club. National securities commissions and independent financial regulators maintain oversight of their industries' foreign exchange market activities.

During that period the concept become deployed in the political armory of opposing interests. Banks claimed that mark-to-market had caused or exacerbated the crisis. Those opposed to the banks (<b>accounting</b> professionals, <b>standard</b> setters, advocacy groups) claimed that mark-to-market gave appropriate valuations of financial businesses that had mismanaged their own investment risks.
