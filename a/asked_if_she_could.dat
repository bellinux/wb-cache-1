5|$|Lépine {{sat for a}} time in {{the office}} of the {{registrar}} on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The Wheeler family {{stayed at}} the ranch many a summer. In 1900, Wheeler invited his client Phoebe Hearst to visit Wheeler Ranch with his family for the summer. Hearst <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{purchase}} the land, but Wheeler declined. Insistent, Hearst came to an arrangement whereby she would purchase a 99-year lease on part of the land, and she also purchased adjoining land held by Edward Clark, her financial adviser, who called it Wyntoon for the local Wintu tribe. Hearst applied the name Wyntoon to the combination of Clark's former holdings and her new lease, and in 1901 contracted for a magnificent seven-story house to be built. Wheeler was displeased with the extravagant plans, as he and Hearst had previously agreed her building would be modest. However, he did not stop her.|$|E

5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, she <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E
5|$|Many {{songs on}} Graduation contain {{background}} vocals provided by Connie Mitchell of the Australian dance music group Sneaky Sound System. The collaboration came about when West met her bandmates Angus McDonald and Daimon Downey at a diner in Sydney while touring {{the country with}} U2 around November 2006. Seeking musical inspiration, West asked McDonald for ideas, who in turn suggested that he be introduced to Mitchell. Upon meeting Mitchell after she arrived at Studios 301 where he was recording music during the tour, West had her sing over a vocal track and quickly took a liking to her voice. U2 singer Bono and guitarist The Edge also complimented Mitchell's singing while visiting the studio. Some time later, Mitchell {{received a call from}} West who <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> travel to The Record Plant in Los Angeles to begin recording tracks for his third studio album. Mitchell later admitted that while she previously didn't know who Kanye West was and never really cared for hip-hop music, the collaboration has changed her views.|$|E

25|$|On 29 April, a DIMIA officer {{contacted}} the Missing Persons Unit of the Queensland Police, {{and sent them}} the information they had collected about Anna. The Unit {{said that they had}} no records matching the descriptions provided. On 11 May, Rau <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> apply for a German passport, and DIMIA officials prepared a form filled in with her details, giving her name as Anna Schmidt. Four days later, the German Consulate in Sydney rejected the passport application, because it contained insufficient or inadequate information. On 17 June, DIMIA {{contacted the}} Australian Embassy in Berlin for assistance in identifying Rau.|$|E

Then in May 2013, Japanese music magazine CD Journal confirmed {{the release of}} a new single, entitled [...] "Contrail". The track was entirely written, composed, arranged, and produced by Japanese musician Nao'ymt. It was recorded by D.O.I. at Daimonion Studios, Shibuya, Tokyo in 2013. The finished composition was then mastered by American music engineer Cris Gehringer at Sterling Studios, New York City, New York.|$|E
500|$|After {{releasing}} the book, John Lennon, My Brother—written with Giuliano, and a foreword by McCartney—Baird travelled to New York during 1989 {{to appear at}} a Beatlefest convention, and was <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> prove she was really Lennon's half-sister. Baird declined, saying {{she was not going}} to produce her passport, and the audience would just have to take her word for it. In 2000, Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs, erected on major routes into Liverpool, saying, [...] "Liverpool welcomes you – to the birthplace of THE BEATLES", and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon's birthday.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s a {{young girl}} wrote to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> [...] "accidentally" [...] drop and smash a {{seemingly}} valuable vase on an edition of Antiques Roadshow. This was broadcast {{as part of a}} regular edition of Antiques Roadshow (as well as in the Jim'll Fix It episode), with many of the crowd at the Roadshow looking on, horrified, until the antiques expert explained the ruse.|$|R

500|$|The crowd became {{steadily}} younger over time. In the 1990s, {{when her}} parents still operated the bar, Barisich <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> sell a case of what was then considered premium beer. She recalled, [...] "I convinced them to let me buy a case of Heineken's, which at that time sold for unheard-of price of a buck a bottle. My dad said that people would never pay that much {{for a bottle of}} beer, and they'd only let me buy the case if I promised to drink what didn't sell." [...] Her introduction of premium beer proved to be successful. Lutz would soon be recognized by Blitz-Weinhard for serving more Blitz beer than any other establishment.|$|E

She also performed the song during the Body Talk Tour. She performed the acoustic version during a birthday party on the 1 November 2010 episode of Gossip Girl. The show's producers <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> perform the song. She spoke of the appearance with Entertainment Weekly, saying, [...] " [...] no lines, but there's {{a little bit of}} interaction with me and someone—it was more reacting, because we didn’t really act too much." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in the 1940s Douglas was {{approached}} by a publisher {{to contribute to the}} Rivers of America Series by writing about the Miami River. Unimpressed with it, she called the Miami River about [...] "an inch long", but in researching it became more interested in the Everglades and persuaded the publisher instead to allow her to write about them. She spent five years researching what little scientific knowledge was recorded about the ecology and history of the Everglades and South Florida. Douglas spent time with geologist Garald Parker, who discovered that all of South Florida's fresh water source was the Biscayne Aquifer, and it was filled by the Everglades. Parker confirmed the name of the book that has since become the nickname for the Everglades when Douglas, trying to capture the essence of the Everglades, <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> safely call the fresh water flowing from Lake Okeechobee a river of grass.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1995 O'Connor [...] "was so {{interested}} in a (television) discussion about abuse and the Catholic church that she rang in to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> appear.

6000|$|He {{was again}} silent, as in contemplation, and Amabel's {{overcoming}} emotion had been calmed and chastened down again, {{now that it}} was no longer herself that was spoken of. Both were still, and he seemed to sleep a little. When next he spoke, it was to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> repeat their old favourite lines in [...] "Sintram". They came to her lips, and she repeated them in a low, steady voice.|$|R
500|$|As burlesque comedy {{material}} became {{progressively more}} ribald, Skelton moved on. [...] He {{insisted that he}} was no prude; [...] "I just didn't think the lines were funny". He became a sought-after master of ceremonies for dance marathons (known as [...] "walkathons" [...] at the time), a popular fad in the 1930s. The winner of one of the marathons was Edna Stillwell, an usher at the old Pantages Theater. She approached Skelton after winning the contest and told him that she did not like his jokes; he <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do better. They married in 1931 in Kansas City, and Edna began writing his material. At the time of their marriage Skelton was one month away from his 18th birthday; Edna was 16. [...] When they learned that Skelton's salary was to be cut, Edna went to see the boss; he resented the interference, until she came away with not only a raise, but additional considerations as well. Since he had left school at an early age, his wife bought textbooks and taught him what he had missed. With Edna's help, Skelton received a high school equivalency degree.|$|E
500|$|Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, set out {{the case}} for the prosecution. The {{evidence}} was overwhelming; the prosecution case highlighted the contents of Lody's notebook and the luggage that he had left at the Roxburgh Hotel, and called a series of witnesses, including the elderly Scottish woman who ran the boarding-house in which he had stayed in Edinburgh and the fashionably dressed Ida McClyment, who caused a stir when she described her meeting with Lody aboard the London to Edinburgh train. Bodkin did not read the incriminating letters aloud, due to the sensitivity of their content, but described them in general terms. The witnesses testified about their interactions with Lody and identified him as the man who had posed as [...] "Charles A. Inglis", though the proprietress of the Edinburgh boarding-house experienced some difficulty. When she [...] "was <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see 'Charles A. Inglis' in court, [...] looked everywhere except at the dock. Lody, who was sitting, stood up and gently waved his hands to attract her attention, while he smiled broadly and almost broke into laughter at the absurdity of the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift {{was very}} fond of Caillat's 2007 debut album, Coco. Swift explained, [...] "When it came out, I {{fell in love with}} the way that she makes music." [...] Swift later {{contacted}} her management and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> write a song with Caillat. They confirmed Caillat would be available due to a then upcoming concert in Nashville, Tennessee and, coincidentally, on the same day, Swift had a vacation day. According to Swift, [...] "Breathe" [...] is about having to depart from a someone, however, not blaming anyone. Swift believed the scenario was one of the most difficult goodbyes, [...] "when it's nobody's fault. It just has to end." [...] Swift explained, [...] "It was total therapy because I came in and I was like look, 'One of my best friends, I'm gonna have to not see anymore and it's not gonna be part of what I do. It's the hardest thing to go through. It's crazy listening to the song because you would think it's about a relationship and it's really about losing a friend and having a fallout." [...] Caillat and Swift said one of the beauties of the song was that many people would be able to relate to it because it is never specific as why the departure is occurring or whose fault it was.|$|E
60|$|Wayland, {{without really}} knowing {{anything}} about it, suspected that he owed {{his life to}} her intervention, and this belief deepened the feeling of admiration which he had hitherto felt toward her. He listened to her at work around the fire with a deepening sense of his indebtedness to her, and when she looked in to <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do anything for him, his throat filled with an emotion which rendered his answer difficult.|$|R
5000|$|A {{neighbor}} recalled to The New York Times that Perry [...] "had {{a really}} bad temper", getting into a shouting match with an elderly neighbor and yelling at others when they came up the cul-de-sac the new home {{was at the end}} of. In mid-August, when the final $12,500 payment to the former Bass Berry paralegal would have been due, he wrote her a letter saying he was having trouble coming up with the money and <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> wait until October.|$|R
5000|$|In 1951, a black teacher {{approached}} the college <b>asking</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> fulfill continuing education requirements at the college. Dr. James W.

[...] This action came three years before the Supreme Court's decision to ban school segregation, Brown v. Board of Education.|$|R
500|$|In 1989, Chen {{attended}} {{a concert in}} Taipei by the American Youth Orchestra, a touring ensemble of Boston's New England Conservatory. Following the performance, Chen's accompanist escorted her backstage, introduced her to the conductor, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> play for him. Chen's opportunity came {{the next morning when}} she played for conductor Benjamin Zander in a closed basement hotel bar and was offered a scholarship immediately. She performed with the American Youth Orchestra before being invited to attend the Walnut Hill School, a preparatory school linked to the New England Conservatory, two months later at age sixteen. She left her parents, who thought she would study to become a concert violinist, and {{for more than three years}} lived with a couple in Boston she referred to as her [...] "American parents" [...] (Mark Churchill and Marylou Speaker Churchill, who was once a member of the Portland Junior Symphony). Chen continued her undergraduate and graduate work at the Conservatory. Speaker taught Chen, who also received violin instruction from James Buswell and Eric Rosenblith as well as conducting supervision from Frank Battisti and Richard Hoenich. Chen became the first person to graduate from the New England Conservatory with a double master's degree in conducting and violin performance and received two honors from the institution: the Chadwick Medal for outstanding undergraduate work, and the Schuller Medal for [...] "extraordinary contribution to musical life in the community". [...] Later in her career, in October 2010, Chen returned to the New England Conservatory to guest conduct the Philharmonia. Chen dedicated the concert to the late Marylou Speaker Churchill, and thanked Benjamin Zander and dean emeritus Mark Churchill for [...] "making her career possible".|$|E
500|$|By the {{afternoon}} of Friday 8November, the newspapers' early editions carried photographs of the Lucans across their front pages, accompanied by headlines like [...] "Body in sack... countess runs out screaming", and [...] "Belgravia murder– earl sought". A meeting that day at the Clermont, between John Aspinall, Daniel Meinertzhagen, Charles Benson, Stephen Raphael, Bill Shand-Kydd, and Dominick Elwes, became the cause of much press speculation. Meinertzhagen and Raphael later insisted that the gathering was just a rational discussion between concerned friends, keen to share anything they knew about what had happened, but {{the relationship between the}} police and Lucan's social circle was strained; some officers complained that an [...] "Eton mafia" [...] worked against them. Susan Maxwell-Scott refused to add to her statement, and when Aspinall's mother, Lady Osborne, was <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> help locate Lucan's body, she replied [...] "The last I heard of him, he was being fed to the tigers at my son's zoo", prompting the police to search the house and the animal cages there. They searched fourteen country houses and estates, including Holkham Hall and Warwick Castle, to no avail. Amidst concerns expressed by the Labour MP Marcus Lipton that some people were [...] "being a bit snooty" [...] with the police, Benson wrote a letter to The Times asking him to either identify those people or [...] "kindly withdraw his remarks". To their cost, Private Eye accused James Goldsmith of being at the Clermont meeting, when he was actually in Ireland. Dominic Elwes went to see Lady Lucan in hospital and was reportedly deeply shocked both by her appearance and her statement [...] "Who's the mad one now?" [...] Elwes was apparently unhappy at some of the negative press coverage of the countess, and was later ostracised by his friends for his part in an article critical of Lucan, which appeared in the Sunday Times Magazine. He committed suicide in September 1975.|$|E
