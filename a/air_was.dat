5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed in late October. It became Tropical Depression Four-C on October 30 well southwest of Hawaii. Although the waters were very warm, some dry <b>air</b> <b>was</b> located {{north of the}} system. It slowly moved westward without intensifying, and dissipated the next day as the circulation became exposed.|$|E
5000|$|Compressed <b>air</b> <b>is</b> <b>air</b> {{kept under}} a {{pressure}} that {{is greater than}} atmospheric pressure. Compressed <b>air</b> <b>is</b> an important medium for transfer of energy in industrial processes. Compressed <b>air</b> <b>is</b> used for power tools such as air hammers, drills, wrenches and others. Compressed <b>air</b> <b>is</b> used to atomize paint, to operate air cylinders for automation, and {{can also be used}} to propel vehicles.Brakes applied by compressed air made large railway trains safer and more efficient to operate. Compressed <b>air</b> brakes <b>are</b> also found on large highway vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Humid <b>air</b> <b>is</b> less dense than dry air {{because a}} {{molecule}} of water (M ≈ 18 u) is less massive than either a molecule of nitrogen (M ≈ 28) or a molecule of oxygen (M ≈ 32). About 78% of the molecules in dry <b>air</b> <b>are</b> nitrogen (N2). Another 21% of the molecules in dry <b>air</b> <b>are</b> oxygen (O2). The final 1% of dry <b>air</b> <b>is</b> {{a mixture of}} other gases.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>is</b> channeled {{within the}} air shower using a {{closed-loop}} system, where it <b>is</b> continuously re-circulated. <b>Air</b> <b>is</b> forced through a motorized filter/blower module {{into a large}} plenum, then into the shower through jet nozzles. Particle-laden, contaminated <b>air</b> <b>is</b> routed {{out of the shower}} compartment through floor vents and returned to the filtration unit. This process ensures that only decontaminated <b>air</b> <b>is</b> used to remove particulates from personnel and other equipment, such as supply carts.|$|R
5|$|Air {{quality in}} Boston is {{generally}} very good: during the ten-year period 2004–2013, {{there were only}} 4 days in which the <b>air</b> <b>was</b> unhealthy for the general public, according to the EPA.|$|E
5|$|Coal was {{the almost}} {{exclusive}} {{fuel for the}} pre-dreadnought period, though navies made the first experiments with oil propulsion in the late 1890s. An extra knot or two of speed could be gained by applying a 'forced draught' to the furnaces, where <b>air</b> <b>was</b> pumped into the furnaces, but this risked damage to the boilers.|$|E
5|$|EVA Air carried 6.2 million {{passengers}} in 2007, and employed 4,800 staff members as of April 2008. The carrier returned to profitability {{in the first}} quarter of 2009, with a US$5.9 million net gain. In August 2010, EVA <b>Air</b> <b>was</b> named one of the top 10 international airlines in Travel+Leisures World's Best Awards.|$|E
50|$|The {{size and}} {{strength}} of thermals {{are influenced by the}} properties of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere). Generally, when the <b>air</b> <b>is</b> cold, bubbles of warm <b>air</b> <b>are</b> formed by the ground heating the air above it and can rise like a hot air balloon. The <b>air</b> <b>is</b> then referred to as unstable. If there is a warm layer of air higher up, an inversion can prevent thermals from rising high and the <b>air</b> <b>is</b> said to be stable.|$|R
50|$|On 7 November 2015 in {{connection}} with the bankruptcy of Estonian <b>Air,</b> <b>Airest</b> <b>is</b> no longer flying on Stockholm - Tallinn - Petersburg route. <b>Airest</b> <b>was</b> also operating on lines to Oslo and Vilnius. In accordance with the feedback from Estonian Air, the service provided by <b>Airest</b> <b>was</b> precise and satisfying.|$|R
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>is</b> so {{frequently}} {{used as a}} coolant that <b>air</b> cooling <b>is</b> seldom mentioned in a refrigeration context. Due to the low boiling point of its constituents and low heat-carrying capacity, <b>air</b> <b>is</b> infrequently used as a refrigerant.|$|R
5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the <b>air</b> <b>was</b> dry, the bar of charcoal would be light while the <b>air</b> <b>was</b> humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E
5|$|In Blamey's {{reorganisation}} of the Army in April 1942, Herring {{was given}} command of Northern Territory Force. At this time Darwin was {{being subjected to}} Japanese air raids. As supply by sea or <b>air</b> <b>was</b> impractical, Herring developed a land line of communications running across the outback from Alice Springs.|$|E
5|$|In September, the {{ownership}} of Color <b>Air</b> <b>was</b> rearranged. Sunde reallocated his ownership and created Color Group, that would wholly own both Color Line, Scandi Line, Larvik Line and Color Air. Sunde retained a 77% ownership in the corporation through Larvik Scandi Line. The group was subsequently listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In the general meeting held in December, two of the largest owners of Color Line, Vital Forsikring and the Government Pension Fund of Norway, both were opposed to the merger, as they felt the purchased companies were overvalued. Color <b>Air</b> <b>was</b> at the time valuated at NOK157 million. After a long process between the miniority shareholders and Color Group, the valuation was adjusted to NOK108 million. In May, Olav Nils Sunde bought the entire Color Group, and delisted it from the stock exchange following the conflict with the other shareholders.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{acoustic}} dynamical systems, a single sound pitch is a mode, {{in which the}} <b>air</b> <b>is</b> the medium, the sound pressure in the <b>air</b> <b>is</b> the excitation, and the displacement of the <b>air</b> molecules <b>is</b> the modal variable.|$|R
5000|$|The Agents in Rebus (<b>AIR)</b> <b>are</b> {{featured}} in John Conroe's [...] "Demon Accords" [...] series. Conroe's <b>AIR</b> <b>is</b> a secret organization {{hidden in the}} U.S. government.|$|R
25|$|In some engines, bleed <b>air</b> <b>is</b> also {{tapped to}} provide power for accessories, {{as well as}} a {{mechanical}} shaft drive. Bleed <b>air</b> <b>is</b> particularly useful when a source of compressed <b>air</b> <b>is</b> specifically needed, either to pressurise cabin air, or as a supply of cooling air to other components (to avoid excess heat, this is taken for a low-pressure tapping, or from the LP compressor of a two-shaft engine). One important use for bleed <b>air</b> <b>is</b> for cross-starting of other engines in a multi-engine aircraft.|$|R
5|$|In the 13th century, Roger Bacon {{argued that}} {{the speed of light}} in <b>air</b> <b>was</b> not infinite, using {{philosophical}} arguments backed by the writing of Alhazen and Aristotle. In the 1270s, Witelo considered the possibility of light travelling at infinite speed in vacuum, but slowing down in denser bodies.|$|E
5|$|India's premier radio broadcaster, the All India Radio (<b>A.I.R),</b> <b>was</b> the {{official}} radio {{partner of the}} Games. The AIR hired 150 programmers and engineers for {{the coverage of the}} Games.|$|E
5|$|Krohn <b>Air</b> <b>was</b> {{a virtual}} airline, {{with a single}} Jetstream 32 {{operated}} by AIS Airlines. The airline provided two daily round trips between Molde Airport, Årø and Trondheim Airport, Værnes. As of 2013 Claus Krohn owned 90 percent of the company, and Roy Uren was co-owner.|$|E
2500|$|Although the 11" [...] <b>Air</b> <b>is</b> only {{slightly}} {{lighter than the}} 13" [...] Air, the biggest difference is the footprint which gives each model a distinct category; the 13” <b>Air</b> <b>is</b> much closer in size to most other conventional laptops, while the 11” <b>Air</b> <b>is</b> almost {{small enough to fit}} in a space that can hold an iPad.|$|R
50|$|Hot <b>air</b> <b>is</b> {{frequently}} used in recreational ballooning. Hot <b>air</b> <b>is</b> lighter than <b>air</b> at ambient temperature, {{to a degree}} which can be approximated using the ideal gas law.|$|R
50|$|Coined by Colin Ramage in 1968, {{the name}} {{combines}} the terms maritime and continent normally used as opposites in {{the description of}} climate. Maritime <b>air</b> <b>is</b> humid, and continental <b>air</b> <b>is</b> dry.|$|R
5|$|The {{sneak preview}} of Up in the <b>Air</b> <b>was</b> the highest profile hit during the Telluride film festival. The film also {{tied for third}} place in the Toronto International Film Festival Indiewire poll.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of Kanon, the Key staff started production on Air and expanded {{the number of people}} involved in this project compared to Kanon. The executive producer for <b>Air</b> <b>was</b> Takahiro Baba from VisualArt's, the publishing company that Key is under. The planning for <b>Air</b> <b>was</b> headed by Jun Maeda who was also one of two main scenario writers, the other being Takashi Ishikawa. Scenario assistance was provided by four more people: Kazuki Fujii, Kai, Tōya Okano, and Yūichi Suzumoto. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Miracle Mikipon, Na-Ga, and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino. The music in the game was composed primarily by Shinji Orito, Jun Maeda, and Magome Togoshi, who had started working with Key since before Kanons release. After {{the completion}} of Air, two of the staff—Kazuki Fujii, and Takashi Ishikawa—left Key.|$|E
5|$|By 1994, EVA <b>Air</b> <b>was</b> {{providing}} {{regular service}} to 22 destinations worldwide, and carrying over 3 million passengers annually. In 1995, the airline posted its first profit on revenues of US$1.05 billion, one year ahead of schedule. Internationally, EVA Air's rapid expansion and increased passenger volume was boosted by its safety record, {{in contrast to}} its primary competitor, China Airlines. In addition to receiving IOSA (IATA Operational Safety Audit) certification, EVA Air in 1997 achieved simultaneous official ISO 9002 certification {{in the areas of}} Passenger, Cargo, and Maintenance Services.|$|E
40|$|Staggering {{amounts of}} {{compressed}} <b>air</b> <b>are</b> wasted or misapplied in otherwise well run manufacturing facilities, often adding {{thousands of dollars}} in extra operating cost per year. The process of eliminating this expensive waste requires a thorough examination of each use of compressed air, as well as how the overall compressed <b>air</b> system <b>is</b> configured, operated, and managed. There are eleven important questions managers should answer for their compressed air applications to understand whether compressed <b>air</b> <b>is</b> the right tool for the job, how compressed <b>air</b> <b>is</b> applied, how it is delivered and controlled, and how the compressed <b>air</b> system <b>is</b> managed...|$|R
25|$|Dilution <b>air</b> <b>is</b> airflow {{injected}} {{through holes}} in the liner {{at the end of}} the combustion chamber to help cool the air to before it reaches the turbine stages. The <b>air</b> <b>is</b> carefully used to produce the uniform temperature profile desired in the combustor. However, as turbine blade technology improves, allowing them to withstand higher temperatures, dilution <b>air</b> <b>is</b> used less, allowing the use of more combustion air.|$|R
50|$|A building's HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) {{system can}} {{make use of}} an air-side {{economizer}} to save energy in buildings by using cool outside air {{as a means of}} cooling the indoor space. When the temperature of the outside <b>air</b> <b>is</b> less than the temperature of the recirculated air, conditioning with the outside <b>air</b> <b>is</b> more energy efficient than conditioning with recirculated air. When the outside <b>air</b> <b>is</b> both sufficiently cool and sufficiently dry (depending on the climate) the amount of enthalpy in the <b>air</b> <b>is</b> acceptable and no additional conditioning of it is needed; this portion of the air-side economizer control scheme is called free cooling.|$|R
5|$|Color Air {{had only}} one seating class, offered no {{on-board}} beverages and had no frequent flyer program or lounges. Color Air had an agreement for tickets to be sold at the Rimi supermarkets, {{as well as by}} phone and Internet. If bought at a travel agency, there was a NOK 200 surcharge. This was because Color <b>Air</b> <b>was</b> not linked to the Amadeus booking system, owing to the costs associated with membership.|$|E
5|$|During the {{dictatorship}} of Ferdinand Marcos, {{in accordance with}} Presidential Decree no. 645, the old Manila Hotel Company was liquidated and the government took over its ownership. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) was given the mandate {{to form a new}} subsidiary corporation that would restore, renovate, and expand the Manila Hotel. In the following two decades, Mr. Marcos's wife, Imelda, could frequently be seen at the hotel restaurants. During her visits, a red carpet and garlands were put out and the <b>air</b> <b>was</b> sprayed with deodorant. Under Imelda's patronage, the hotel reaped international recognition and awards. It was the place to go and be seen during the martial law years.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{during her}} reign, Anne {{and her husband}} spent the winter at Kensington and St James's Palaces, and the summer at Windsor Castle or Hampton Court Palace, where the <b>air</b> <b>was</b> fresher. George had {{recurrent}} asthma, and the cleaner air in the country was better for his breathing. They visited the spa town of Bath, Somerset, in mid-1702, {{on the advice of}} George's doctors, and again in mid-1703. They occasionally visited Newmarket, Suffolk, to view the horse racing. On one visit, Anne bought George a horse, Leeds, for the vast sum of a thousand guineas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>is</b> {{drawn into}} the engine through two air filters located above each {{cylinder}} head. The amount of the <b>air</b> <b>is</b> metered by two hot film mass air flow sensors B2/6&7. On Sprinter models, a single <b>air</b> filter housing <b>is</b> mounted upon brackets {{on top of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|A {{current of}} <b>air</b> <b>is</b> {{passed through the}} mill. This helps keep the mill cool, and sweeps out {{evaporated}} moisture which would otherwise cause hydration and disrupt material flow. The dusty exhaust <b>air</b> <b>is</b> cleaned, usually with bag filters.|$|R
50|$|As of November 2015, Big <b>Air</b> <b>is</b> the onsite FBO {{providing}} {{fuel and}} services for pilots and crew. Full service 100LL and Jet-A fuel <b>is</b> provided. Big <b>Air</b> <b>is</b> located on the airports main ramp between Delta and Echo.|$|R
