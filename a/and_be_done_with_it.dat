500|$|The {{writing process}} for this album was more {{communal}} {{compared to that}} for Hello Master; Heppner had written much of the band's debut album himself and his bandmates helped him in arranging the material, but the sophomore album featured more contributions from each band member. Nudo once again wrote and sang a song for the record, and although Watchorn did not write the lyrics to an entire song by himself for this album, he and Heppner collaborated on several of them, including [...] "Lady Killer". Watchorn explained that the songs changed drastically between {{the time they were}} first written and when they got recorded, and that the songs [...] "weren't complete until they actually made the record." [...] He also said that the album's protracted production history enabled the group to experiment with the songs and repeatedly alter them to taste, thus ironically yielding a record that was considered better than if they had been able to simply record it <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> sooner.|$|E

To prevent further delay and a greater possibility of a buildup on the wings, the pilot, Captain Morwood, decided to have the aircraft fuelled while the engine <b>was</b> running <b>and</b> with passengers on board. This procedure <b>was</b> not then, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> not now, prohibited by Transport Canada. Airline instructions were also inconsistent.|$|R
