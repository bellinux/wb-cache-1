5|$|Nevertheless, Stein {{appeared}} to be in good spirits; during the warm-up, Wales goalkeeper Neville Southall found that the Scottish fans in the crowd kept all of the balls he and Eddie Niedzwiecki were using. On returning to the dressing room he spoke about it to Stein, who then went out onto the pitch <b>and</b> <b>gestured</b> to the fans to return all the balls. Prior to the start he took his place in the dugout and the game kicked off without incident.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the first}} five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's {{decision}} <b>and</b> <b>gestured</b> to a red mark on his shirt, indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up {{his end of the}} pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day, Miller {{came in at}} 2/121—O'Reilly {{believed}} that Bradman was trying to force the pace and had promoted Miller above Lindsay Hassett, the usual number four batsman—and was dismissed for a duck; he failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on instead of turning in, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich. After Australia finished at 509 {{on the third day}} to take a 344-run lead, Miller opened the bowling with Johnston—Lindwall was injured while bowling in the first innings and was unable to take to the field. Miller removed Washbrook for one, caught behind by Tallon from a top-edged hook shot. Washbrook was displeased with the decision <b>and</b> <b>gestured</b> to a red mark on his shirt, indicating his opinion that the ball hit his clothing rather than the bat.|$|E
3000|$|We {{conducted}} an experiment {{to evaluate the}} improvement in speech <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> recognition using the proposed integrative recognition method.

25|$|At {{the start}} of the Grand Prix, Senna {{retained}} the lead from Schumacher, but proceedings soon became interrupted by a startline accident. JJ Lehto's Benetton-Ford had stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the Opel Vectra medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. The Vectra's slow pace was later questioned because of the consequential drop in tyre pressures on the Formula One cars. Senna had pulled alongside the Vectra <b>and</b> <b>gestured</b> to the driver, Max Angelelli, to increase his speed. On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace with the third-quickest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher.|$|E

40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that both pitch range <b>and</b> <b>gestures</b> contribute to the perception of speakers’ liveliness in speech. However, the relation between speakers’ pitch range <b>and</b> <b>gestures</b> has received little attention. It is possible that variations in pitch range might be accompanied by variations in <b>gestures,</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. In second language speech, the relation between pitch range <b>and</b> <b>gestures</b> might also be affected by speakers’ difficulty in speaking the L 2. In this pilot study we compare global pitch range <b>and</b> <b>gesture</b> rate in the speech of 3 native Italian speakers, telling the same story once in Italian and twice in English {{as part of an}} in-class oral presentation task. The hypothesis tested is that contextual factors, such as speakers’ nervousness with the task, cause speakers to use narrow pitch range and limited gestures; a greater ease with the task, due to its repetition, cause speakers to use a wider pitch range <b>and</b> more <b>gestures.</b> This experimental hypothesis is partially confirmed by the results of this study...|$|R

On the 14 August episode of Raw, Bálor suffered a loss to Wyatt in singles competition. On 20 August, Bálor, as the Demon King, defeated Wyatt at SummerSlam. Bálor competed in a battle royal to determine the #1 contender for the Intercontinental Championship on the 28 August edition of Raw, but was distracted and eliminated by Wyatt, who was not in the match. Wyatt challenged Bálor to a match at No Mercy, but against Bálor, rather than the [...] "Demon." [...] Bálor was attacked by Wyatt prior to the match, but would go on to defeat Wyatt..

Though he was ejected (along with Rodriguez) from the game following the incident, the Red Sox, spurred on by the fight, came from behind to win 11–10. It is also sometimes regarded as the turning point in the Red Sox season, as they posted MLB's best record after the melee. Boston culminated the season with its first World Series championship in 86 years, after being the first team to overcome a three games to none deficit in the ALCS vs. the New York Yankees.|$|E

It was later announced that Batista would be participating in the 2014 Royal Rumble match. Batista returned as a face to confront WWE World Heavyweight Champion Randy Orton on the January 20 Raw, and vowed to win the Royal Rumble match and become champion at WrestleMania XXX. Later that night, Batista confronted Alberto Del Rio, who had been trash talking him for several weeks, and eventually attacked him with a Batista Bomb. Six days later at the Royal Rumble, Batista entered the Rumble match at number 28 and last eliminated Roman Reigns to win the match, becoming the fifth wrestler to win multiple Rumble matches, and the first, and so far only multi-time Royal Rumble winner to win from the same entrant number (28). The live crowd reacted negatively towards Batista's win, as Daniel Bryan did not {{take part in the}} match. Despite a positive reaction originally, the crowd began to boo Batista after Reigns was eliminated. After the show went off the air, Batista mocked Bryan <b>and</b> <b>gestured</b> his middle finger at the crowd. According to Batista, he thought a return as face was a bad idea because of the fans being so invested in Daniel Bryan's [...] "Yes Movement". On the February 3 Raw, Batista was confronted and was ultimately assaulted by Del Rio before chasing him off. Batista retaliated the following week, powerbombing Del Rio through the announce table.|$|E
60|$|Just {{how much}} she didn't really like her {{children}} she presently realized when in the feeble irascibility of their sickness they fell quarrelling. They became--horrid. Millicent and Annette being imprisoned in their beds it seemed good to Florence {{when she came back}} from the morning's walk, to annex and hide a selection of their best toys. She didn't take them and play with them, she hid them with an industrious earnestness in a box window-seat that was regarded as peculiarly hers, staggering with armfuls across the nursery floor. Then Millicent by some equally mysterious agency divined what was afoot and set up a clamour for a valued set of doll's furniture, which immediately provoked a similar outcry from little Annette for her Teddy Bear. Followed woe and uproar. The invalids insisted upon having every single toy they possessed brought in and put upon their beds; Florence was first disingenuous and then surrendered her loot with passionate howlings. The Teddy Bear was rescued from Baby after a violent struggle in which one furry hind leg was nearly twisted off. It jars upon the philoprogenitive sentiment of our time to tell of these things and still more to record that all four, stirred by possessive passion to the profoundest depths of their beings, betrayed to an unprecedented degree in their little sharp noses, their flushed faces, their earnest eyes, their dutiful likeness to Sir Isaac. He peeped from under Millicent's daintily knitted brows <b>and</b> <b>gestured</b> with Florence's dimpled fists.
