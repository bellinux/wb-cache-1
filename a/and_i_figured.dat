500|$|Upon {{being cut}} by the 49ers, Mitchell chose to close the book on this playing career even though {{he may have been}} able to pursue an {{opportunity}} in the fledgling World Football League, saying, [...] "I had a chance, whatever happened, good or bad, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> a guy's got to work someday." ...|$|E
500|$|Slayer {{embarked}} on the Reign in Pain tour with the bands Overkill in the United States and Malice in Europe; they {{also served as}} the opening act for W.A.S.P.'s U.S. tour in 1987. In late November 1986, drummer Lombardo quit the band; he said: [...] "I wasn't making any money. I think I had just gotten married, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> if we were gonna be doing this professionally—on a major label—I wanted my rent and utilities paid." [...] To continue the tour Slayer enlisted Whiplash drummer Tony Scaglione.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and I thought to myself, 'People have to hear this stuff'. What I had to offer was the music <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> if we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, {{he dropped}} out of Colby College to pursue music professionally. He wrote to his mother at the time, saying, [...] "I'm heading west. I know 200 songs now, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> if <b>I</b> keep {{learning}} more I should be all right." ...|$|R
50|$|I'm a singer; I {{learned that}} your voice mellows with time. You don't usually stay a tenor if you're a man. My voice has darkened; {{it has more}} depth. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> when it quits, I'll quit. I don't like that fake-y thing. As long as it holds up, I'll keep performing.|$|R
25|$|This {{country has}} been good to me. It gave me {{everything}} I have. I have never come out for any candidate before but I think Wendell L. Willkie {{will give us a}} square deal. So I am for Willkie because I think he will help my people, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> my people should be for him, too.|$|R
500|$|Laich {{received}} {{national media}} attention {{when he stopped}} to help two stranded Capitals fans change their flat tire after a Game 7 loss in the 2010 playoffs. When he came across {{the woman and her}} teenaged daughter stranded on the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, Laich stopped to install their spare and apologized for the club's early loss in the playoffs. [...] For his efforts, Laich was hockey analyst Michael Farber's nominee for the 2010 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year. When asked about the incident, Laich responded, [...] "It's not a big deal. It was just a tire. The lady was stranded {{on the side of the}} road, I saw that it was just a lady and her daughter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> my tire expertise outweighed hers." ...|$|E
500|$|Wallace alerts {{the office}} that the company's {{troubles}} {{have been published in}} the Wall Street Journal, but Michael and Erin mistake this to mean the [...] "feelings journal", Michael listens to [...] "Lullaby" [...] by Shawn Mullins to soothe himself; Chun explained that the reason the song was chosen was because [...] "Michael would probably have loved top 40 pop from the 90s. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> the song would have to be devoid of subtext. That's why 'Lullabye' felt like a fit." [...] When Jim lowers the volume on Michael's computer, the tell-tale [...] "click" [...] of a Mac computer comes out of the speakers. Daniels and Chun note that this was intentional, and they wanted that specific sound, even though Windows computers do not make that sound. Pam's southern accent is compared to the fictional character Forrest Gump. After Andy successfully does a Savannah accent, Kevin asks him to do [...] "the Swedish Chef". Andy, not understanding the reference asks [...] "what province" [...] he is from, to which Kevin replies that [...] "he lives on Sesame Street, dumbass." [...] Angela blames her character's dabbling with the dark arts—she portrays a witch doctor in the game—with being exposed to the Harry Potter series.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Flynn was {{conceived}} as a British farmer named Bastian until his voice actor was finally cast. The directors cited actors Errol Flynn and Gene Kelly, and Star Wars character Han Solo, among several individuals by whom Flynn was inspired. Greno explained that [...] "Having Flynn as a thief seemed like a fresh spin, especially in contrast to Rapunzel, who is a really smart girl but is just locked away in this tower. So {{she has a very}} limited world view and Flynn could complement that as this worldly guy." [...] The film's change in title from Rapunzel to the more gender-neutral Tangled {{is due in part to}} Flynn's role and involvement. First observing that the Disney tradition is [...] "to name the movie after the Princess", the directors had initially thought that the film [...] "would be structured like Cinderella where there's Cinderella and then a Prince that pops into the movie once in a while". This changed, however, as Flynn was gradually developed into a much more prominent character. Howard explained that [...] "When Nathan <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> out that this film was really about two characters, Flynn and Rapunzel, we knew that changing the title would be a good idea." [...] Meanwhile, the title Tangled summarizes the relationship between protagonists Flynn and Rapunzel, and antagonist Mother Gothel. Additionally, Flynn also narrates the film, providing it with [...] "an ironic counterpoint", according to Children's Literature and Learner Empowerment: Children and Teenagers in English Language Education author Janice Bland. As [...] "an example of first-person voice-over narration", Flynn's narration [...] "compels the viewer to identify empathetically with" [...] Flynn and Rapunzel.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's easy," [...] {{said the}} farmer. [...] "Lane he squeezes {{somebody}} until he can't {{hold on to}} his property, then he puts up the money and another man buys the place dirt-cheap for him, in his own name. Suppose that man goes back on Lane? 'This place is my own,' says he. Well, he's recorded owner, isn't he? <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> Lane wouldn't be mighty keen on dragging that kind of case into the courts." ...|$|R

Nothing wrong with the man that I know of, but I'm not fond of anybody who gets in my way, and Alton of Somasco has taken out timber rights all over the valley where we're running the Tyee. He got in with his claim {{a day or two}} ahead of me." ...|$|R
2500|$|No {{discussion}} of Blake's {{life would be}} complete without mention of his long-term commitment to vegetarianism, a philosophy that he adopted with evangelical zeal. In a 1955 article reporting Blake's departure from the island, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reminisced about the sight of the great surfer as, [...] "Late in the evening... he would seek his way back to (his) tiny boat, carrying a brown paper sack containing carrots, celery, a loaf of bread, some cheese (and) ice cream for his lonely evening meal." [...] A 1989 article explains: “Blake states: ‘I knew I didn't want to be killed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> all animals felt the same way.’” ...|$|E
2500|$|Inter band {{arguments}} {{about the direction of}} the group between Byrd {{and the rest of his}} band mates led the band to split up within months of the album's release. The United States of America was first released in 1968 on Columbia Records. The album spent nine weeks on the charts in the United States, peaking at number 181 on the Billboard album charts in May 1968. The album failed to chart in Britain. The album was reissued on compact disc by Columbia Records in 1992 with two bonus tracks. In 1997, the album was re-issued in the United Kingdom on Edsel Records. On July 13, 2004 Sundazed Records re-issued the album on vinyl and compact disc with a new album cover from the original UK and Europe releases, and with the CD version containing 10 bonus tracks. USA member Joseph Byrd claims to have little input to the Sundazed re-release of the album. [...] Byrd claims he was [...] "interested in doing notes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> this was a chance to get my voice heard - Dorothy and Rubinson had both done extensive interviews referring to me in unpleasant fashion (as justification for their coup, I imagine). I asked for $300 and got it. I've written elsewhere to you that Sundazed took out all references they found controversial, including one about Bill Graham." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{study was}} poorly {{received}} by {{a portion of}} the Romanian cultural environment, who objected to the revelations about the direct connections between various interwar intellectuals and fascist groups such as the Iron Guard. Rejecting accusations that he was diverting focus from the negative impact of communism, Ornea stated that he had simply carried on with research that would have been censored under Ceaușescu: [...] "I continued my exegesis on the currents of though of the interwar. In 1980 I published a book on the twenties, named Tradiționalism și modernitate în deceniul al treilea. I could not, at the time, advance in this field because I could not write with probity about totalitarianism under totalitarian currents of thought. [...] In autumn 1990 I returned to the interwar period [...] There was not a single malevolent intent in doing so. I purely and simply carried on with an exegesis I had begun earlier". His preface for one edition of the book further explained this rationale: [...] " [...] could not be published because it was impossible to properly comment on the ideas of totalitarianism and the single party [...] of parliamentary democracy [...] And it should not have been published then because it unveiled the political credo of those who, back in the thirties, were the prominent personalities among the new generation (Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Constantin Noica and others). It was untimely because it would have provided arguments for not publishing their work (which, in any case, was always subject to the uncertain status of accidental tolerance). <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured,</b> like so many other intellectuals, that the work of these personalities should have, by all means, been published. I therefore postponed the writing of this book for settled times placed under a more fastidious sign".|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{worrying}} {{over that}} business ever since it happened," [...] continued Buck. [...] "There's {{one thing about}} it that's got me all twisted up, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>figure</b> it out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] he said dryly, [...] "we'll {{give you}} a chance of helping us to put the {{handcuffs}} on him. Now, because they wouldn't risk the bridge, and the ice is not thick yet everywhere, there are just two ways they could bring the stuff across, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> we'd be near the thing if we fixed on Graham's Pool. Still, Courthorne's no kind of fool, and just because that crossing seems the likeliest he might try the other one. You're ready for duty, Trooper Payne?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Porter {{began his}} {{engineering}} career in 1954 at WLAC-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, where {{he wished to}} be a cameraman—nobody wanted to mix sound, though, and that job was assigned to him, {{the guy with the}} least seniority. He mixed up to four microphones for television broadcast for $92 per week, equivalent to $ today. At nearby RCA Records in 1959, the chief engineer was transferred after angering Chet Atkins, and Porter applied for the position. He was told by an RCA executive from New York that the job would ruin his marriage, but Porter said [...] "I can handle that"—he was hired at $148 per week, and given two weeks to learn all the equipment and how to mix up to 12 microphones for music recordings. Shortly after starting with RCA on March 31, 1959, Porter mixed the single [...] "Lonesome Old House" [...] for Don Gibson; it was a crossover success in both the country music and the pop music charts, and Porter began to be requested by name. In June 1959, he mixed [...] "The Three Bells" [...] for the Browns, with Atkins producing and Anita Kerr arranging. While editing the master to be sent to New York for pressing, Porter accidentally hit the wrong controls on the tape recorder and stretched the tape {{at the beginning of the}} song, distorting the pitch. Without telling anyone, he spliced a different take with a good intro onto the beginning, and sent that version instead. Four decades later, Porter recalled his quick fix: [...] "this was a need-to-know situation <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> nobody needed to know. I had been in the business three months or something like that. You're not a good engineer until you destroy a master and hopefully live to talk about it." [...] In July, the song went to number one on the U.S. country and pop charts, and Porter's reputation rose.|$|E
6000|$|The woman's {{black eyes}} softened. [...] "Sure, {{that was a}} little thing, and don't count for much. The posies were so pretty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> they'd keep fresh a little longer," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|Gordon {{glanced at}} Mattawa, who grinned. [...] "Well," [...] said Mattawa, [...] "it was only {{yesterday}} when I fell in, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> Charly was going {{right under the}} fall the day before. Oh, yes, I guess we'd better get the thing through while it's light." ...|$|E
5000|$|Coble pledged not {{to receive}} any pension from the United States government. He told CBS Up to the Minute, [...] "I figured taxpayers pay my salary - {{not a bad}} salary, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> that's sufficient. Let me fend for myself after the salary's collected." [...] He also stated to CBS, [...] "I've pledged my {{assurance}} I won't take the pension. That's between my constituents and me. As far as convicted felons, I guess that's between their constituents and themselves." [...] He {{was one of two}} Congressmen, with Ron Paul, to have pledged to decline his pension.|$|R
6000|$|My {{botanist}} fails altogether {{to grasp}} what {{the disappearance of}} diseases means. His mind has no imaginative organ of that compass. As I talk his mind rests on one fixed image. This presents what the botanist would probably call a [...] "dear old doggie"--which the botanist would make believe did not possess any sensible odour--and it has faithful brown eyes and understands everything you say. The botanist would make believe it understood him mystically, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> his long white hand--which seems to me, in my more jaundiced moments, to exist entirely for picking things and holding a lens--patting its head, while the brute looked things unspeakable....|$|R
6000|$|... "That they'll go {{off when}} I want them," [...] and Jefferson laughed a little grating laugh. [...] "I've had them {{ready for some}} while, and took {{a good deal of}} trouble timing the fuses. Now, the effect of giant-powder's usually local, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figure</b> one could throw these things far enough for us to keep outside the {{striking}} radius. They'd go better with a little compression, but there's a big detonator inside them which should stir them up without it. If these two sticks fell upon a nigger they wouldn't blow him up. They'd dissolve him right into gases, and it's quite probable there wouldn't be any trace of him left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Get {{out until}} you're feeling better. That kind of thing's catching, and we've lots to do,' I said; and he laughs with a cackle like an hysterical woman, and blinks {{straight}} past me. Steel <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> he'd {{got hold of}} some smuggled whisky and been drinking bad, but afterwards Henderson's Jo said no.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{a notion}} I could agree with him--I {{liked the way}} he talked--and I told him Helen could go, but {{the next time he}} called he was to walk right into the office instead of hanging round the counter. I asked him what he'd done with all the canned truck he'd bought, {{and he said he was}} {{inclined}} to think his partner had eaten most of it. Since then he's been over pretty often, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> it was time I gave you a hint." ...|$|E
60|$|While {{this was}} in the course of being said, the squatter, and father of squatters, led the way into his own cabin, where he seated himself with an air of authority, causing the females and younger males of his brood to range {{themselves}} in a circle behind his chair. Seeing the folly of resistance, at a hint from Zephaniah I followed, the three young men occupying the place near the door, as a species of guard. In this manner we formed a sort of court, in which the old fellow figured as the investigating magistrate, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> as the criminal.|$|E
6000|$|Graham nodded. [...] "He can't help it. It {{was born}} in him. You <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can <b>figure</b> <b>and</b> plan, but Courthorne is different--the right thing comes to him. I knew the first night I saw him, you had got the man you wanted at Silverdale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “The peacock,” said Nettie in the drawl {{she assumed}} {{only when it}} suited her, “is easy. They’re vain, you know, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wouldn’t <b>figure</b> it was worth while to spread out my best tail before men like Tony Palliser. I’m quite fond of being looked at, too.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Rowe sang professionally {{with the}} Baltimore Opera. He says about this job, [...] "I joined the opera {{to get my}} union card <b>and</b> meet girls. <b>I</b> was a saloon singer, so I {{went down to the}} Baltimore Opera and learned an aria <b>and</b> auditioned. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I'd do one show and quit. But the girls were {{everywhere}} and the truth is, the music was really decent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took hold}} of that thing, Loudon, and just studied it up," [...] he replied. [...] "It took my fancy; it was so romantic, and then I saw there was boodle in the thing; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> on the {{business}} till no man alive could give me points. Nobody knew I had an eye on wrecks till one fine morning I dropped in upon Douglas B. Longhurst in his den, gave him all the facts and figures, {{and put it to}} him straight: 'Do you want me in this ring? or shall I start another?' He took half an hour, and when I came back, 'Pink,' says he, 'I've put your name on.' The first time I came to the top it was that Moody racket; now it's the Flying Scud." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a cold fact, but in {{this case}} it has to be done. I got my money hard." [...] In proof of it he held up one hand from which three fingers were missing. [...] "That was the result of working sixteen hours right off in a one-horse sawmill. We had one light above the bench, and when I was too played out to see quite what I was doing I got my hand drawn in. I made the rest of my pile--it's a mighty little one--much the same way, and now I'm holding tight to what is mine. I {{provided}} your outfit, for, crazy as it seemed, I believed Grenfell's tale, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> that you were straight men; but I know what generally happens when the little man goes around the city with a mine to sell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was on my}} last {{prospecting}} trip I {{found the}} spruce," [...] he said. [...] "I'd been looking round for the Company I was with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> I'd strike the coast over the range. The creeks were full of snow-water, and as I was held up here and there before I could get across, provisions began to run short. By and by I fell sick; but I {{had to get out}} of the mountains, and I was pushing on for the Strait when I struck the place where the spruce is. After that, I got kind of muddled in the head, but I went down a long valley on an easy grade and struck some Siwash curing the last of the salmon. The trouble is, I was too sick to figure exactly where the small inlet they were camped by lies. They took me back with them to their rancherie--you could find that--and sailed me across to Comox by and by. I came down on a steamboat, and the doctor told me I'd made my last journey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Finding {{that our}} {{correspondence}} was using up {{no end of}} time <b>and</b> ink, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> {{it would be better}} for us to talk things over together comfortably, and as some of you come from Vancouver, and some from round the lake, this place appeared a convenient center," [...] began Savine.
