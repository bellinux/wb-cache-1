500|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, Eastwood {{stated that}} he would be voting for John McCain, citing {{the fact that he had}} known McCain since he {{returned}} to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW. Eastwood said of McCain: [...] "I met him years ago when he first came back from Vietnam. This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. I thought he was a terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> watching him come along <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> watching him campaign and win the job. But I'm not a fan of what he's doing at the moment.... I just don't think he's governing. I don't think he's surrounded himself with the people he could have surrounded himself with." ...|$|E

Drago won the next two in 15 minutes with breaks of 44 and 109—completing the latter in four minutes—before an 86 break gave White the victory, after which White said, [...] "Playing Tony here, I {{got a taste of}} what players have against me at the Masters when the crowd are all on my side but they were fair <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> every minute of it." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Ian McShane {{was asked about the}} process of shooting his final scene where he is shown hanging after being killed by the Brotherhood, with McShane saying that the filming of the scene was [...] "very easy. You just have to hold your breath for 10 seconds and look sufficiently dead for them to get it." [...] He also noted in the interview, [...] "Rory was a delight to work with, and so was the director. The whole experience was five days in Belfast, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> it a lot." [...] Prior to the season, in August 2015, reports emerged about the spotting of Rory McCann at a hotel frequented by actors during filming of the series, in Belfast. McCann, whose character is frequently shown chopping wood in the episode, previously spoke in interviews about his prior career with chopping down trees, revealing [...] "I was a lumberjack for years, [...] and I even trained myself to be a tree surgeon." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film was due to air on British {{television}} in December 2012, Hedren gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she repeated her claims about Hitchcock: [...] "He {{made it very clear}} what was expected of me, but I was equally clear that I wasn't interested...Nobody is denying that Hitchcock was a brilliant moviemaker <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> working with him before I realised he was starting to take an almost obsessive interest in me." [...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive to me, with the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore. He had an eye for the specifics of the character." ...|$|E

Describing the song, Jackson said, [...] "It's a different kind of song for me, it's more of like a throwback. More of a doowoop-y , which I've never done before which is quite exciting, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> recording it in the studio." [...] John Platt, senior Vice President of Virgin Records and EMI Publishing, commented that Damita Jo [...] "is really about positive love and where she's at in her life right now. The second half of the album was very easy once me and Janet got to know each other, and found the songs that really were true to her and that she can sing with conviction.

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, Myrie-Williams {{returned}} to Cheltenham Town, signing on a one-month loan deal on 14 August 2008. On bringing Myrie-Williams back to the club, Cheltenham manager Keith Downing said [...] "Jennison is an exciting young player who will give us some different options. We've perhaps been lacking a bit of pace and he will give us that as well". He made his second debut for the club four days later, scoring with a header in the 80th minute to ensure Cheltenham picked up their first win of the 2008–09 season with a 2–0 win against Swindon Town. Myrie-Williams made five appearances for Cheltenham during his one-month loan spell, scoring one goal. He returned to Bristol City on 15 September 2008. Shortly after returning to his parent club, Myrie-Williams was loaned out to another League One club, this time in the form of Carlisle United. Myrie-Williams stated that the move appealed to him because of manager John Ward, who he had played under at Cheltenham Town— [...] "We have kept in contact since I was at Cheltenham. He's a good manager <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> playing for him. I heard about a possible move in pre-season which came to nothing but I'm delighted to finally be here". He made his Carlisle debut on 20 September 2008, coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute in a 2–0 home defeat to Leeds United, a result that ended Carlisle's 100% home record. His loan spell was extended for another month on 15 October 2008. His final appearance for Carlisle was in the club's FA Cup 1–1 draw with Grays Athletic, a game in which Myrie-Williams was substituted after 59 minutes. He made 10 appearances during his two months at Carlisle. Myrie-Williams was loaned out for a third time during the 2008–09 season, his fifth loan spell in total, when he joined Hereford United in January 2009. He scored his first goal for Hereford on 17 February 2009 in the club's 2–0 home victory against Leeds United, scoring with a low shot to give Hereford the lead just before half-time. He returned to Bristol City after Hereford's 1–0 home loss against Peterborough United on 21 February 2009. A month later, Myrie-Williams rejoined Hereford {{until the end of the}} season. Myrie-Williams scored his second goal for Hereford in an away draw with Yeovil Town in April 2009. He made 15 appearances over the period of the two loan spells, scoring twice, as Hereford were relegated back to League Two after finishing bottom of the table.|$|E

Etim in an interview with Leadership Newspaper stated: [...] "I am not exactly a rookie {{when it comes to the}} Igbo Language but until Phone Swap, I never needed to speak Igbo as a native would.

Some of their earliest drawings were copies of Sunday school cards and pictures from the family bible. [...] "Those early years which Beauford <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> together I am sure shaped the direction of our lives as artists. We were constantly doing something with our hands – modelling with the very red Tennessee clay, also copying pictures. One distinct difference in Beauford and myself was his multi-talents. Beauford could always strum on a ukulele and sing like mad and could mimic with the best. Beauford and I were complete opposites: me an introvert and Beauford the extrovert." [...] The Delaneys attended Knoxville's Austin High School, and among Beauford's early works was a portrait of Austin High principal Charles Cansler.|$|E

2500|$|Sharon Knolle of TV Squad stated [...] "From the {{inspired}} 'Tik Tok' musical opening sequence to {{the last}} gag, 'To Surveil With Love' {{ranks as one of}} the best 'Simpsons' episodes in years. I never expected the rest of the episode to live up to that killer opening, but, unbelievably, it just got better as it went along." [...] Todd VanDer Werff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- and said [...] "I thought this was a strong episode of The Simpsons. I laughed frequently throughout, I thought both of the major storylines mostly made sense and concluded well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> some of the ways the episode turned satire on its ear. I particularly liked the idea of Lisa conforming by becoming a brunette after everyone made fun of her for being a blonde. Dumb blonde jokes are as old as time itself, but the way the episode turned the whole thing into a sly parody of diversity and conformity was winning." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the disappointing results, Israel {{received}} something of a consolation prize, as the country swept the Eurovision-sanctioned 2010 Marcel Bezençon Awards, winning for best artist, best composition, and best entry of the contest.

He told one reporter, [...] "I’m proud and happy over the performance and for representing [...] “We brought Israel artistic accolades. It was a fun experience <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> every minute of it.

2500|$|A {{month in}} advance of the 2011 World Cup in March, Sangakkara decided that he would resign the {{captaincy}} after the tournament. Sri Lanka reached the final of the tournament. Throughout the tournament Sangakkara was in prolific form with the bat scoring 465 runs from 9 matches and was the third highest run-scorer behind team-mate Tillakaratne Dilshan and India's Sachin Tendulkar. Days after guiding Sri Lanka to the finals of the World Cup, Sangakkara announced to the public he was stepping down as captain of the T20 and ODI teams. He offered to continue as Test captain if deemed necessary for transition to new skipper, but Dilshan was appointed captain across all formats. Reflecting on the decision afterwards, he said that [...] "captaining Sri Lanka is a job that ages you very quickly... It's rarely a job you will last long in... I also had a two-year stint, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> it at times, certainly on the field where our results showed we were one of the top two sides in the world for one-and-a-half years, especially in the shorter form of the game." ...|$|E

[...] Gasly claimed Heidfeld had placed him in a position to impact the wall following the later releasing his brake pedal. Nevertheless, he described his weekend as [...] "very positive", but did not anticipate his advancing into super pole after having only one day's worth of experience driving in the series: [...] "We had a very busy schedule, especially with me arriving later on during the event. There was a lot to learn but we did great. We scored important points for the team. It was a great opportunity to discover a new discipline <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the challenge very much."

But, it never was something I felt I was needing to defend or stick to, or that it represented me artistically." [...] Other changes to the art style from the shorts were dictated by animation director, Mike L. Mayfield. Weidenfeld stated that Mayfield [...] "was instrumental in turning Brad's original style into what we had the first season." [...] Among them were the addition of pupils which, according to Weidenfeld, some of Neely's fans were unhappy over.
