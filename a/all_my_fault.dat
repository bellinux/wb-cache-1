500|$|Rotten, meanwhile, {{suffering}} from flu and coughing up blood, felt increasingly isolated from Cook and Jones, and disgusted by Vicious. On 14 January 1978, during the tour's final date at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, a disillusioned Rotten introduced the band's encore saying, [...] "You'll get one number and one number only 'cause I'm a lazy bastard." [...] That one number was a Stooges cover, [...] "No Fun". At {{the end of}} the song, Rotten, kneeling on the stage, chanted an unambiguous declaration, [...] "This is no fun. No fun. This is no fun—at all. No fun." [...] As the final cymbal crash died away, Rotten addressed the audience directly—"Ah-ha-ha. Ever get the feeling you've been cheated? Good night"—before throwing down his microphone and walking offstage. He later observed, [...] "I felt cheated, and I wasn't going on with it any longer; it was a ridiculous farce. Sid was completely out of his brains—just a waste of space. The whole thing was a joke at that point.... wouldn't speak to me.... He would not discuss anything with me. But then he would turn around and tell Paul and Steve that the tension was <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> because I wouldn't agree to anything." ...|$|E
500|$|The younger Angelo Padovani {{went with}} De Angelis to confront Morisi in San Giovanni in Persiceto. Padovani {{recalled}} finding her in tears. After the visitors {{assured her that}} they meant no harm, Morisi recounted what she had told Feletti. She said that a grocer named Cesare Lepori had suggested the baptism when she mentioned Edgardo's sickness, and shown her how to perform it. She had not mentioned it to anyone, she went on, until soon after Edgardo's brother Aristide {{died at the age}} of one in 1857—when a neighbour's servant called Regina proposed that Morisi should have baptised Aristide, that she had done so to Edgardo [...] "slipped out of my mouth". According to Padovani, Morisi described crying during her interrogation by the inquisitor, and expressed guilt over Edgardo's removal: [...] "figuring that it was <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> I was very unhappy, and still am." [...] Morisi agreed to have this formally recorded, but was gone when Padovani and De Angelis returned after three hours with a notary and two witnesses. After searching for her in vain, they went back to Bologna with only their hearsay account of her story, which Padovani thought genuine: [...] "Her words, and her demeanour, and her tears before she could launch into her story, persuaded me that what she told me was all true." ...|$|E

Bad as I was--and he should be sorry to have to name <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>faults</b> at a breath--God and nature had given me 'trop de sensibilité et de sympathie' not to be profoundly {{affected}} by an appeal so touching." ...|$|R

Headquartered in Los Gatos, California, Netflix has amassed a collection of 100,000 titles and over 93 million subscribers. Hastings {{got the idea for}} Netflix after his company was acquired. [...] "I had a big late fee for 'Apollo 13.' It was six weeks late and I owed the video store $40. I had misplaced the cassette. It was <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I didn’t want to tell my wife about it. And I said to myself, 'I’m going to compromise the integrity of my marriage over a late fee?' Later, {{on my way to the}} gym, I realized they had a much better business model. You could pay $30 or $40 a month and work out as little or as much as you wanted." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Garbage had lyrical {{input from}} all band members, Manson was {{responsible}} for all the lyrics in Version 2.0.. Consequently, it was described by Manson as [...] "more direct and more personal than the first. I was able to verbalize things a little clearer this time—I mean, I'm no Nick Cave, I'm never gonna be Bob Dylan. I do what I can to express myself." [...] The singer [...] "tried to let the darker undercurrents come through to offset some of the pop melodies", adding that [...] "like human beings, songs shouldn't be one-dimensional". The singer declared that the introspective nature of Version 2.0 served to [...] "reassure myself while I'm going crazy" [...] due to her experiences during production, as she was [...] "living by myself in a hotel, and I {{had no one to}} really talk to" [...] and every day coming back by herself really late after working on the studio. Manson added that only [...] "The Trick Is to Keep Breathing" [...] had something that was out of her life, being inspired by her friend Ruthie Trouble. [...] "Medication" [...] came about from a frightful, isolating experience with the US medical system. The song, Manson explained, is [...] "a reflection on past ills in a way ... about taking blame on yourself for things that you had no control of at the time, and finally pushing off and realizing that this was not my fault. It wasn't <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> There's a huge relief and release that comes from that".|$|E
