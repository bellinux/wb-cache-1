5|$|The second-largest {{commercial}} airport is William P. Hobby Airport (named Houston International Airport until 1967) which operates primarily short- to medium-haul domestic flights. However, in 2015 Southwest Airlines launched service {{from a new}} international terminal at Hobby airport to several destinations in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. These were the first international flights flown from Hobby since 1969. Houston's aviation history is showcased in the 1940 <b>Air</b> <b>Terminal</b> Museum located in the old terminal building {{on the west side}} of the airport. Hobby Airport has been recognized with two awards for being one of the top five performing airports in the world and for customer service by Airports Council International.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Weather Bureau {{office was}} moved to 2nd floor of the {{original}} Boise <b>Air</b> <b>Terminal</b> Building at Gowen Field on December 19, 1939. All operations at the U.S. Federal building and the old Boise Airport were transferred to the new office by February 20, 1940. In addition to the surface weather observations of temperature, precipitation and wind, Radiosonde observations which began September 1, 1939 at the downtown airport, were moved to a small building north of the Boise terminal building at Gowen Field in 1940. A new balloon inflation building was built east of the terminal in October 1954 with a dome on top to hold the signal receiving equipment. The building {{was moved to}} the NIFC campus in August 1969 where it is still being used today. The temperatures and precipitation were taken near the airport terminal building through 1969 though they were moved periodically to accommodate the growing airport. The wind instrument was moved several times through 1969 {{from the top of the}} United Hanger to the top of the terminal building to field northwest of the runway. The office remained on the 2nd floor of the terminal building until June 1969.|$|E
25|$|The airport {{has been}} named United Airport (1930–1934), Union <b>Air</b> <b>Terminal</b> (1934–1940), Lockheed <b>Air</b> <b>Terminal</b> (1940–1967), Hollywood-Burbank Airport (1967–1978), Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (1978–2003), Bob Hope Airport (since 2003, legal name), and Hollywood Burbank Airport (since 2016, {{branding}} name).|$|E

25|$|KL City <b>Air</b> <b>Terminal,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Kuala Lumpur City <b>Air</b> <b>Terminal</b> or KL CAT located at KL Sentral {{is a virtual}} extension of KL International Airport where city check-in services are provided. KL City <b>Air</b> <b>Terminal</b> is recognised by International Air Transport Association which carries IATA designation XKL. Currently there are only 3 airlines providing city check-in services, they are Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines and Malindo Airways. However, the situation is due to be changed as 10 SITA's AirportConnect CUTE (Common Use Terminal Equipment) were installed on 10 check-in desks in KL CAT that enables all airlines to offer city check-in service for their passengers.|$|E

25|$|Dedicated on Memorial Day Weekend (May 30 – June 1), 1930, the United Airport was {{the largest}} {{commercial}} airport in the Los Angeles area until it was eclipsed in 1946 by the Los Angeles Municipal Airport (now Los Angeles International Airport) in Westchester when that facility (the former Mines Field) commenced commercial operations.

The <b>air</b> <b>terminals</b> are typically arranged at or along the upper points of a roof structure, and are electrically bonded together by bonding conductors (called [...] "down conductors" [...] or [...] "downleads"), which are connected by the most direct route to one or more grounding or earthing terminals.

25|$|Considerable {{material}} {{is used to}} make up lightning protection systems, so it is prudent to consider carefully where an <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> will provide the greatest protection. Historical understanding of lightning, from statements made by Ben Franklin, assumed that each lightning rod protected a cone of 45 degrees. This {{has been found to}} be unsatisfactory for protecting taller structures, as it is possible for lightning to strike the side of a building.|$|E
25|$|A {{lightning}} protection {{system is designed}} to protect a structure from damage due to lightning strikes by intercepting such strikes and safely passing their extremely high currents to ground. A {{lightning protection}} system includes a network of <b>air</b> <b>terminals,</b> bonding conductors, and ground electrodes {{designed to provide a}} low impedance path to ground for potential strikes.|$|R
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>terminals</b> are {{the supply}} air outlets and return or exhaust air inlets. For supply, {{diffusers}} are most common, but grilles, and for very small HVAC systems (such as in residences) registers {{are also used}} widely. Return or exhaust grilles are used primarily for appearance reasons, but some also incorporate an air filter and are known as filter returns.|$|R

Another feature of Gatwick's new <b>air</b> <b>terminal</b> was its modular design, permitting subsequent, phased expansion.|$|E
