He preserved various elements of the old colonial order in his administration, particularly on issues of law and order. The police and military structures were left largely intact. White Kenyans were left in senior positions within the judiciary, civil service, and parliament, with the white Kenyans Bruce Mackenzie and Humphrey Slade being among Kenyatta's top officials.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home <b>and</b> <b>forget</b> the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} {{learning}} <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> of speech commands in speech dialogue systems. We discuss two mathematical models for learning and four models for forgetting. Furthermore, we describe the experiments {{used to determine the}} learning <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> curve in our environment. Our findings are compared to the theoretical models and based on this we deduce which models best describe learning <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> in our automotive environment. The resulting models are used to develop an adaptive help system for a speech dialogue system. The system provides only relevant context specific information. ...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{significant}} {{success of these}} films, Crystal wrote, directed, and starred in Mr. Saturday Night (1992) <b>and</b> <b>Forget</b> Paris (1995). In the former, Crystal played a serious role in aging makeup, as an egotistical comedian who reflects back on his career, although the character was from his SNL days. Though some of his subsequent films were not as well received as his earlier hits, Crystal had another success alongside Robert De Niro in Harold Ramis' mobster comedy Analyze This (1999). More recent performances include roles in America's Sweethearts (2001), the sequel Analyze That (2002), and Parental Guidance (2012).|$|E

At various points, his friends saw him shoot up not just heroin, but also cocaine, vodka, as well as a mixture of rum and Coke.

25|$|Produced on a shoestring, about 75% of {{the budget}} was funded by Bord Scannán na hÉireann (The Irish Film Board), plus some of Carney's own money. The {{director}} gave his salary to the two stars, and promised {{a share of the}} back-end for everyone if the film was a success. Shot with a skeleton crew on a 17-day shoot, the filmmakers saved money by using natural light and shooting at friends' houses. The musical party scene was filmed in Hansard's own flat, with his personal friends playing the partygoers/musicianshis mother, Catherine Hansard, is briefly featured singing solo. The Dublin street scenes were recorded without permits and with a long lens so that many passersby didn't even realize that a film was being made. The long lens also helped the non-professional actors relax <b>and</b> <b>forget</b> about the camera, and some of the dialogue ended up being improvised.|$|E

40|$|This thesis explores how {{architecture}} aids in {{the performance}} of open-ended narratives by engaging both actively and passively with memory, i. e. remembering <b>and</b> <b>forgetting.</b> I argue that architecture old and new stems from specific cultural and social forms, and is dictated by processes of remembering <b>and</b> <b>forgetting.</b> It is through interaction (between inhabitant and object) that architecture is given innate meanings within an urban environment that makes its role in the interplay one of investigative interest. To enable the study of this performance, I develop a framework based on various theoretical paradigms to investigate three broad questions: 1) How does one study the performance of memory <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> through architecture in dynamic urban landscapes? 2) Is there a way to identify markers and elements within the urban environment that enable such a study? 3) What is the role that urban form plays within this framework and does the transformation of urban form imply the transformation of memory <b>and</b> <b>forgetting?</b> The developed framework is applied to a macro (an urban level study of Bangalore, India) and micro level study (a singular or object level study of Stari Most/ Old Bridge, Mostar, BiH), to analyse the performance of remembering <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> in various urban spheres through interaction with architecture and form. By means of observations, archival research, qualitative mapping, drawings and narrative interviews, the study demonstrates that certain sites and characteristics of architecture enable the performance of remembering and the questioning of forgetting by embodying features that support this act. Combining theory and empirical studies this thesis is an attempt to elucidate on the processes through which remembering <b>and</b> <b>forgetting</b> is initiated <b>and</b> experienced through architectural forms. The thesis argues for recognising the potential of architecture as one that embodies and supports the performance of memory <b>and</b> <b>forgetting,</b> by acting as an auratic contact zone...|$|R
