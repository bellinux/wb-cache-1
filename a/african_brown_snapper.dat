5000|$|This fish reaches 30 cm (12 in) in length. The body {{of these}} fish is unusual; it is ventrolaterally {{flattened}} and elongated, giving {{the appearance of}} a knife blade. The caudal and anal fins are fused and run from beneath the gill opening to the pointed end of the body, creating a uniform, skirt-like fin. This appendage gives the animal superior control in the water, as it is able to propel itself forward and backward with a minimum of wasted energy. The pelvic fins are extremely reduced and are not used in locomotion. The dorsal fin is absent. The pectoral fins of the <b>African</b> <b>brown</b> knifefish are lengthy and designed to give the animal precise control as it swims. They are often employed in a windmilling motion, in conjunction with the caudal/anal fin, as the fish retreats into its lair. [...] The scales of the knifefish are extremely small, giving it a smooth appearance broken only by its fairly prominent lateral line. Apart from its eyes, the lateral line is the knifefish's most important sensory apparatus. The <b>African</b> <b>brown</b> knifefish is nocturnal and uses the nerve-filled pits running down its body to navigate lightless waters. In addition, the eyes of this fish are large in relation to its body size. They provide the animal with excellent night vision.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe dyes {{commonly}} used in the textile industry have structural resonant valence distribution, within a complex molecule, which determines {{the color of the}} dyes. The coloring is produced by chromospheres holding radiation in UV-visible range. Besides coloring, these compounds can be found in waste water and cause serious problems in living organisms, because their biodegradation products may be a source of toxic substances such as amines, which are generated from the characteristic azo chromospheres groups in most of the dyes. Current treatments for color removal from hazardous waste from these materials are complex and costly, for this reason some industries do not treat the wastes generated during the staining step. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the use of nanoclay as adsorbents for dye used in the textile industry. The dyes used in this work are commercially known as: Orange GR, Black GN an <b>African</b> <b>Brown.</b> Nanoclay was obtained by bentonite treated with organic cation.

5000|$|The overall {{synopsis}} of the Geography Trilogy {{is to create}} a link and understanding to other cultures histories while evolving and experimenting with his artistic works in three different continents. For example, Geography formulated in Africa, Tree originated in Asia, and Come Home Charley Patton brought Lemon back to the United States. Ralph Lemon's creative journey began with Geography in Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea. The journals he wrote gave insight into the life of an [...] "American, <b>African,</b> <b>brown,</b> black, blue black, male, and artist." [...] Embodying these characteristics, Lemon sought not only to create art about his culture but to connect with his heritage during the duration of his visit. Lemon then ventured to Asia for his next piece in the trilogy Tree. Tree is ritually structured through Buddhism, and reveals a conflict of cultural values pertaining to performance, race, identity, modernity and tradition. Lemon finished the trilogy in the US with Come Home Charley Patton, a piece that revisits a segregated time in history. The performance of Come Home Charley Patton shows how [...] "different generations remember the same critical events and places; what kind of narratives do justice to traumatic memories; and what form memories can ultimately take through the aesthetic works of this project." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Although {{there have}} been {{numerous}} studies involving fish, birds, and mammals, {{little is known about the}} response of the cytochrome P 4501 A system of snakes to halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs). The present study describes the induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) in primary hepatocytes of the <b>African</b> <b>brown</b> house snake (Lamprophis fuliginosus). Hepatocytes were exposed in multiwell plates to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and four different non-ortho-substi-tuted coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs 77, 81, 126, and 169). Exposure to TCDD and PCB 126 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in EROD activity, with maximum inducible EROD activities of 177 6 56 (mean 6 SEM) and 101. 1 6 55 pmol/min/mg protein for TCDD and PCB 126, respectively. None of the other PCBs caused a measurable induction of EROD, which suggests reduced inducibility of snake hepatocytes compared to some vertebrate taxa. Median effective concentrations (EC 50 s) were 0. 16 6 0. 03 nM for TCDD and 8. 25 6 4. 14 nM for PCB 126. The relative potency (REP 20 – 80) range for PCB 126 was 0. 044 to 0. 046. Compared to results from in vitro systems using other vertebrate species, both the maximum inducibility and the REPs estimated for L. fuliginosus were within the same range as those reported for mammals and the more sensitive bird species but were greater than the values reported for most fish species. In conclusion, induction of EROD activity in primary hepatocytes appears to be a useful approach for evaluating the dioxin-like potencies of aryl hydrocarbon–receptor agonists in snakes. The test system offers...|$|R
40|$|Five {{artificial}} reef {{sites in the}} vicinity of Tanegashima were investigated through underwater observation, as to the degree of shoaling, scouring, general condition, and fish gathering patterns. These reefs were located in relatively shallow sandy bottom areas, at depths from 12 - 28 m. The reefs are generally of a single layer construction, with the blocks concentrated into an area with a maximum height of only 3 m. The shallow reefs are generally subject to shoaling effects. Regions with sea beds showing sediment transport ripples have the highest shoaling effect. A maximum shoaling rate of 8 - 9 cm/year was calculated for the reefs. Due to the shallow nature of these reefs, schools of the following larval fishes were observed {{in the shadow of the}} reefs: Spratelloides japonicus (banded blue sprat), Apogon semilineatus (bottom perch), Trachurus japonicus (Japanese horse mackerel), Scomber japonicus (mackerel), and Lutjanus vitta (<b>brown</b> striped <b>snapper).</b> Larger fish included Oplegnathus fasciatus (striped beak-perch), Plectorhynchus pictus (painted sweetlip), and Prionurus microlepidotus (surgeon fish), but in limited numbers.

40|$|Currently, the Ursidae family {{includes}} eight bear species. They {{represent an}} unusual family within {{the order of}} the Carnivores because of their peculiar physiological adaptations related to hibernation. These physiological features, unique in the animal kingdom, make bear a unique model for medical research in full expansion because of its putative clinical applications. This point will be developed in introduction of this manuscript. Surprisingly, the phylogenetic relationships within the extant Ursid representatives remain unclear. In order to clarify their phylogeny, we sequenced 12 nuclear genes for all the Ursid species (nearly 8 kilobases corresponding to 6 genes implied in the pathway of the thyroid hormones, 3 genes specific to the sexual chromosomes, and 3 other autosomal genes). By concatenating these new data with those available in the sequence databanks, phylogenetic reconstructions (maximum likelihood and bayesian analyses) were carried out on a nuclear DNA dataset of 10 kilobases. It was then possible to refine the phylogeny of the Ursidae family. In addition, based on the study of the genes SRY (Sex determining region of the Y chromosome), ZFX/ZFY (Zinc Finger protein) and AMLX/AMLY (Amelogenine), we developed a reliable method to determine the sex of Ursidae based on the analysis of DNA extracted from non invasive samples such as hairs or faeces. If this tool has obvious implication for the conservation biology of Ursidae (most of the extant species are threatened with extinction), it also opens new prospects in palaeontology. This kind of analysis was indeed applied to samples of fossils of North <b>African</b> <b>brown</b> bears (Ursus arctos).

40|$|Anti-ectoparasite {{vaccines}} offer attractive {{alternatives to}} the use of chemical pesticides, especially if they also control the pathogens that ectoparasites transmit. However, selection of suitable antigens is a major constraint on vaccine development. The recombinant tick cement protein, 64 TRP, derived from the <b>African</b> <b>brown</b> ear tick, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, acts as a transmission-blocking vaccine in a mouse model of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) transmission, protecting immunised mice against lethal challenge with TBEV after exposure to infected ticks. 64 TRP acts as a dual action vaccine, targeting both ‘exposed’ antigens in tick saliva and ‘concealed’ antigenic epitopes in the tick midgut. To assess further the suitability of 64 TRP as a vaccine antigen, we examined the function (including localisation) of the protein, and its sequence variability. Histological profiles of normal hamster skin showed similarities between normal skin proteins in the epidermis (keratin) and dermis (collagen/reticulin) and the tick cement cone. Immuno-reactivity of anti- 64 TRP sera with hamster skin suggests a potential sequence similarity of 64 P with host skin proteins and may reflect previously reported sequence similarities of 64 P with skin keratin and collagen proteins. Variability in the N-terminal signal peptide and in the C-terminal glycine-rich amino acid repeats of 64 P protein was detected; previous studies showed the C-terminal region to be immunologically non-protective. Using in situ hybridisation and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR, 64 P mRNA was detected in the types II and III salivary gland acini. The highest levels of 64 P mRNA were observed in 1 -day fed females, and 1 - and 7 -day fed males. Salivary glands of longer feeding females and unfed ticks as well as midguts of both sexes were negative. Early expression in tick salivary glands is consistent with previously published data that 64 P is a cement protein, and contributes to its candidacy as a vaccine antigen. However, further studies are required to assess whether cross-reactivity with skin proteins may induce autoimmunity. ...|$|R
