40|$|The Liquid Droplet Radiator is one {{of several}} {{radiator}} systems currently under investigation by NASA Lewis Research Center. It involves the direct exposure of the radiator working fluid to the space environment. An area of concern is the potential harmful effects of the low-Earth-orbit atomic oxygen environment on the radiator working fluid. To address this issue, seven candidate fluids were exposed to an oxygen plasma environment in a laboratory plasma asher. The fluids studied included Dow Corning 705 Diffusion Pump Fluid, polymethylphenylsiloxane and polydimethlsiloxane, both of which are experimental fluids made by Dow Corning, Fomblin Z 25, made by Montedison, and three fluids from the Krytox family of fluids, Krytox 143 AB, 1502, and 16256, which are made by DuPont. The fluids were characterized by noting changes in visual <b>appearance,</b> <b>physical</b> <b>state,</b> mass, and infrared spectra. Of the fluids tested, the Fomblin and the three Krytoxes were the least affected by the oxygen plasma. The only effect noted was a change in mass, which was most likely due to an oxygen-catalyzed deploymerization of the fluid molecule...|$|R

40|$|The chiral Lagrangian for Goldstone boson {{scattering}} is a {{power series}} expansion in numbers of derivatives. Each successive term is suppressed by powers of a scale, Λ_χ, which must be less than of order 4 π f/√(N) where f is the Goldstone boson decay constant and N {{is the number of}} flavors. The chiral expansion therefore breaks down at or below 4 π f/√(N). We argue that the breakdown of the chiral expansion is associated with the <b>appearance</b> of <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> other than Goldstone bosons. Because of crossing symmetry, some "isospin" channels will deviate from their low energy behavior well before they approach the scale at which their low energy amplitudes would violate unitarity. We argue that the estimates of "oblique" corrections from technicolor obtained by scaling from QCD are untrustworthy.

5000|$|The {{exploration}} {{on sexual}} fluidity initiated by Lisa M. Diamond presented a cultural {{challenge to the}} LGBT community; this is because although researchers usually emphasize that changes in sexual orientation are unlikely, despite conversion therapy attempts, sexual identity can change over time. That sexual orientation is not always stable challenges the views of many within the LGBT community, who believe that sexual orientation is fixed and immutable. For example, the public and media attention following Ruby Rose's debut on Orange Is the New Black largely concerned heterosexual women commenting on her <b>physical</b> <b>appearance,</b> and <b>stating</b> that they would [...] "go gay for her"; {{this resulted in a}} new, open discourse about sexual fluidity and whether or not sexual orientation can change, with some of the media, including lesbian critics, expressing disapproval toward heterosexual women declaring that they would be romantically or sexuality interested in Rose.|$|R

All <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> are {{obtained for the}} abelian theory. There are {{an infinite number of}} <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> with different ghost numbers. Simple examples of <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> in a non-abelian theory are also given. Two-dimensional topological gauge theories have recently appeared in various places of field theoretical models. They have an action which can be obtained from the Chern-Simons action in three dimensions [1] by a dimensional reduction. The SL(2, R) topological gauge theory was shown [2, 3] to describe two-dimensional gravity coupled to a scalar field [4]. The world-sheet action for two-dimensional stringy black-hole near the spacetime singularity contains an abelian topological gauge theory as a part [5]. The topological gauge theories are also interesting by themselves as an example of topological conformal field theories [6]. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the structure of <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> in the topological gauge theories. We will use the BRST formalism in the light-cone gauge developed for the gauge group SL(2, R) in Ref. [3]. ∗ <b>Physical</b> <b>states</b> are identified with elements of the BRST cohomology. We mainly study the abelian theory and obtain all its <b>physical</b> <b>states.</b> There are an infinite number of <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> with different ghost numbers. The <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> are generated by the zero modes of the fields acting on various vacua. The non-zero modes of the fields are excluded from <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> due to the BRST quartet mechanism [7]. We also study non-abelian theories but the analysis is far from complete. We only give several simple examples of <b>physical</b> <b>states</b> for the gauge group SL(2, R). We consider a topological gauge theory with a gauge group G in two dimensions. The topology of the two-dimensional surface is chosen to be M = R × S 1 with coordinates x µ (µ = 0, 1), x 0 ∈ R, 0 ≤ x 1 < 2 π.
