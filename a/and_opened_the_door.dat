5|$|Ostrom's {{description}} of Deinonychus in 1969 {{has been described}} as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid-20th century. The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to speculation that dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. This development has been termed the dinosaur renaissance. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of Deinonychus and that of birds, an observation which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Forty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate {{lack of attention to}} the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to new vehicles and figures—such as Spy Magician (M13X & M14X)—Takara {{introduced a new}} class of figure dubbed the Titans which employed a magnetic ball/joint system that allowed for a new level of interchangeability between toys. Japanese pop-culture character tie-in toys were also released—such as Microman Jeeg, Robotman Gakeen and Robotman Mechadon—which helped expand Takara’s line beyond its own in-house characters <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to greater licensing opportunities for their designs.|$|E

25|$|Hoping to {{distract}} Bragg's attention, Grant authorized Thomas's army to {{advance in the}} center of his line to the base of Missionary Ridge. A combination of misunderstood orders and the pressure of the tactical situation caused Thomas's men to surge to the top of Missionary Ridge, routing the Army of Tennessee, which retreated to Dalton, Georgia, fighting off the Union pursuit successfully at the Battle of Ringgold Gap. Bragg's defeat eliminated the last Confederate control of Tennessee <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to an invasion of the Deep South, leading to Sherman's Atlanta Campaign of 1864.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, James Cronin, Val Fitch and {{coworkers}} provided clear evidence from kaon decay that CP-symmetry could be broken. This work won them the 1980 Nobel Prize.

The discovery shocked particle physics <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to questions still {{at the core of}} particle physics and of cosmology today. The lack of an exact CP-symmetry, but also {{the fact that it is}} so nearly a symmetry, created a great puzzle.|$|E

Winterfeldt, ever the opportunist, fell into conversation with Werner {{and in the course}} of it, learned of Werner's dissatisfaction with {{his lack of}} career advancement. During the negotiations for his transfer to Prussian service, Winterfeld reported that Werner who, at the beginning of the First Campaign of the war with Austria, had made a coup when, with 60 Hussars, he had routed several larger units. Thus Werner went to Prussian service in 1750, where experienced soldiers were gladly accepted.|$|E
25|$|Scott Cowen began a dialog {{with other}} {{university}} presidents calling for a change to the existing system that rewards established powers {{at the expense of}} less successful programs.

The capturing of ample supplies justified Lee's conceptual plan to provision his army on the march. The Federal defeat stunned the North, and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton called for additional militia to be federalized. Shortly afterwards, President Lincoln requested 100,000 volunteers to repel the threatened invasion. Several fleeing members of the scattered 87th Pennsylvania hastily tramped {{back to their homes}} near Gettysburg and in adjoining York County, Pennsylvania, spreading news to local officials that the Confederates were now in the Valley in strength, with apparent designs on invading Pennsylvania. Gov. Andrew Curtin of Pennsylvania, in response to these reports and other military intelligence, called for 50,000 volunteers to protect the Keystone State.|$|E

25|$|The conservatives for {{the first}} time in the country's history, came into the power under a {{democratic}} system, under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif. Nawaz Sharif became the 12th Prime Minister of Pakistan on 1 November 1990 as well as head of IJI and succeeded Benazir Bhutto as Prime minister. IJI had been created and funded by the Zia loyalists in the ISI; it received Rs 15 million from the ISI. He campaigned on a conservative platform and vowed to reduce government corruption. He focused on improving the nation's infrastructure and spurred the growth of digital telecommunication. He privatised government banks <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for further industrial privatisation, and disbanded Zulfikar Bhutto's policies. He legalised foreign money exchange to be transacted through private money exchangers. His privatisation policies were continued by both Benazir Bhutto in the mid-1990s and Shaukat Aziz as well in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese wines {{were first}} shipped to England in the 12th century from the Entre Douro e Minho region (which today {{includes}} modern Portuguese wine regions {{such as the}} douro and vinho verde). In 1386, Portugal and England signed the Treaty of Windsor which fostered close diplomatic {{relations between the two}} countries <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for extensive trade opportunities. The 1703 Methuen Treaty furthered advanced English economic interest in Portugal by reducing tariffs and giving Portuguese wines preferential treatment in the British wine market over French wines. Around this time, the fortified wine known as port was increasing in popularity in Britain. The lucrative trade in Port prompted the Portuguese authorities to establish one of the world's first protected designation of origin when Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal established boundaries and regulations for the production of authentic Port from the Douro in 1756.|$|E
25|$|The 2006 Trojans {{came out}} strong, easily {{defending}} their top 10 status throughout the year. As the season progressed, USC began to display marked inconsistencies, as their margins of victory began to slip. The first setback {{proved to be}} a 31–33 loss to unranked Oregon State, in which the Beavers were able to repeatedly capitalize on several Trojan turnovers. Even though USC dropped initially in the polls, they worked their way back up. After defeating both Cal and Notre Dame, they held the number 2 spot heading into the final week of the season. The Trojans were considered to be a virtual lock for the National Championship Game against Ohio State and just needed to beat UCLA. USC was shocked in the final game of the season, losing to crosstown rival UCLA 13–9. This eliminated the Trojans from championship contention <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for Florida to become Ohio State's opponent. The Trojans did earn a Rose Bowl bid and defeated Michigan 32-18. It was the Trojans fifth straight BCS Bowl appearance.|$|E

25|$|Penderecki {{was born}} in Dębica, to Tadeusz Penderecki, a lawyer, and Zofia (née Wittgenstein). Penderecki's grandfather, Robert Berger, was a highly talented painter and {{director}} of the local bank at the time of Penderecki's birth; Robert's father Johann moved to Dębica from Breslau (now Wrocław) in the mid-19th century. His grandmother was an Armenian from Isfahan, Iran. Penderecki used to go to Armenian Church in Kraków with her. Penderecki was the youngest of three siblings; his sister, Barbara, was married to a mining engineer, and his older brother, Janusz, was studying law and medicine {{at the time of his}} birth. Tadeusz was a violinist and also played piano. In 1939, the Second World War broke out, and Penderecki's family moved out of their apartment as the Ministry of Food was to operate there. After the war, Penderecki began attending grammar school in 1946. He began studying the violin under Stanisław Darłak, Dębica's military bandmaster who organized an orchestra for the local music society after the war. Upon graduating from grammar school, Penderecki moved to Kraków in 1951, where he attended Jagiellonian University. He studied violin with Stanisław Tawroszewicz and music theory with Franciszek Skołyszewski. In 1954, Penderecki entered the Academy of Music in Kraków and, having finished his studies on violin after his first year, focused entirely on composition. Penderecki's main teacher there was Artur Malawski, a composer known for his choral works and orchestral works, as well as chamber music and songs. After Malawski's death in 1957, Penderecki took further lessons with Stanisław Wiechowicz, a composer primarily known for his choral works. At the time, the 1956 overthrow of Stalinism in Poland lifted strict Communist cultural censorship <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to a wave of creativity.|$|E
