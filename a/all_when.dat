5|$|Having {{captured}} Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled. However, {{there were}} many who had gone home before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at <b>all.</b> <b>When</b> {{the success of the}} crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope. Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, {{there were only a few}} hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at <b>all.</b> <b>When</b> severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots and the Bills {{were both}} charter {{members of the}} AFL, and even competed {{with each other in}} an AFL playoff game. They have {{remained}} divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O.J. Simpson, Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, Jim Kelly, and Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady has dominated the Bills ever since taking over as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 26-3 regular season record over them. Though Patriots fans usually feel apathetic towards the Bills, Bills fans have come to despise the Patriots more than any other rival. The rivalry has remained somewhat intense in recent years with multiple players having played for both teams, the Bills usually giving their <b>all</b> <b>when</b> playing the Patriots, and the presence of Rex Ryan, who coached both the Bills and Jets and was known for his trash-talk.|$|E

She set up Kanda's backstory by introducing the Third Exorcists, characters related to him and Alma Karma. In Hoshino's original drafts, Kanda's past {{had a number of}} plot holes. A rewritten, published version had a young Kanda walking along a path surrounded by dead people who had cared for him. Due to its violence, the image was replaced with one in which Kanda learns that Alma Karma had killed them <b>all.</b> <b>When</b> the chapters were collected into a volume, Hoshino added a small chapter which included the corpses.|$|E

25|$|Various {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} God establish God as a useful or even necessary assumption. Contrastingly some atheists hold firmly to the belief that assuming the existence of God introduces unnecessary complexity (Schmitt 2005, e.g., the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit). Taking a nuanced position, philosopher Del Ratzsch suggests that the application of the razor to God may not be so simple, least of <b>all</b> <b>when</b> we are comparing that hypothesis with theories postulating multiple invisible universes.|$|E
25|$|About 120 Provisional IRA members caused {{their own}} deaths, almost <b>all</b> <b>when</b> {{they were killed}} by their own {{explosives}} in premature bombing accidents – 103 deaths according to CAIN, 105 according to an RUC report of 1993.

25|$|The rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{in the early years}} of the Big 12, above <b>all</b> <b>when</b> the tenures of Rick Barnes and Eddie Sutton coincided at the two schools, a time when both {{programs}} were nationally prominent.

In recent years, the rivalry has declined in intensity as both programs have receded from the national spotlight.|$|E

25|$|As local {{officials}} in the countryside competed to over-report the levels of production that their communes had achieved {{in response to the}} new economic organisation, local peasants were left with a vastly decreased surplus in order to meet their quotas, and then no surplus at <b>all.</b> <b>When</b> they eventually failed to produce enough crops even to meet the quotas to feed the cities, peasant farmers were unfairly accused of hoarding, profiteering, and other counter-revolutionary activities by Chinese Communist Party officials, who cited the massively inflated production estimates of the local party leaders as evidence.|$|E

25|$|After the {{retirement}} of Kumar Sangakkara, his position remained vacant for a new player and Kusal was brought into the team.

But then he took 2 catches and 1 stumping in that innings. He showed his batting talents right on the first innings of the match, {{where he was the}} top scorer for Sri Lanka with 56 runs in first innings.|$|E

25|$|At Astoria a {{peaceful}} celebration of Fidesz started. Despite their readiness (during the previous few days, hundreds of policemen {{were called in}} from {{the country to the}} city), police did little to defend the crush of radical anti-government protests that took place only 300–500 metres away and pressed nearer and nearer by police's gas attacks in the wide Erzsébet Boulevard. That night and the next day many political analysts and congressmen brought up the idea that this police behaviour was not by chance. Fidesz celebration, with a participation of thousands, ended at 18:00. That crowd could not be disbanded at <b>all</b> <b>when</b> police started a horse assault on Deák Square protesters.

25|$|To prevent {{his father}} disowning him, Barry {{attempts}} {{to live a}} heterosexual existence and begins dating a girl named Judy, to Colin's dismay.

However, the equipment {{turns out to be}} borrowed via Hire Purchase, and when the repayments are not made, the finance company repossesses it <b>all.</b> <b>When</b> Barry is evicted from his flat, he decides to take a job as a DJ on a cruise liner in July 1988. Colin is saddened to see him leave. Barry returns briefly in February 1989 on the day that Colin leaves Walford. Colin departs saying a particularly heartfelt goodbye to Barry.|$|E

25|$|Gary Blair {{was named}} the {{assistant}} coach of the 1996 R. William Jones Cup Team. The competition was held in Taipei,Taiwan. The USA team was dominant, winning their games by an average off 33 points per game. The USA team won their opening seven games, behind the scoring leadership of Sheri Sam, who averaged 13 points per game. In the eighth game, they played undefeated Slovakia, {{in a game that}} would determine the gold medal. The USA fell behind; Slovakia had a 22–15 lead. The USA came back, but was still behind at halftime. The game was tied at 45 <b>all,</b> <b>when</b> the USA hit several free throws to take a lead they would not give up. The USA team won the game and the championship 72–62. In the final game, the USA beat South Korea to finish the competition with a perfect 9–3 record.|$|E
25|$|Proteins, unlike nucleic acids, {{can have}} varying charges and complex shapes, {{therefore}} {{they may not}} migrate into the polyacrylamide gel at similar rates, or at <b>all,</b> <b>when</b> placing a negative to positive EMF on the sample. Proteins therefore, are usually denatured {{in the presence of}} a detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) that coats the proteins with a negative charge. Generally, the amount of SDS bound is relative to the size of the protein (usually 1.4g SDS per gram of protein), so that the resulting denatured proteins have an overall negative charge, and all the proteins have a similar charge-to-mass ratio. Since denatured proteins act like long rods instead of having a complex tertiary shape, the rate at which the resulting SDS coated proteins migrate in the gel is relative only to its size and not its charge or shape.|$|E

The Suez Crisis (from July 1956) wrecked everything the Pact was trying to achieve; Jellicoe was appalled by British policy and came close to resigning (L. Windmill p.136).|$|E
