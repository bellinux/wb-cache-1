40|$|Biodiesel {{has been}} {{considered}} as a reasonable replacement fuel for petroleum diesel. It has many advantages over petroleum diesel including its biodegradability and non-toxicity. In addition, it provides free aromatics and sulphur combustion {{and it is a}} greener fuel with lower carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons emissions. However, biodiesel has lower heating value and it is relatively more expensive than petroleum diesel. In an attempt to reduce the cost of biodiesel, waste cooking oil (WCO) {{has been considered}} as a competitive feedstock. It also provides more sustainability for the produced biodiesel as it is a result of transformation of waste to greener source of energy. The main concern for using WCO as a feedstock for biodiesel production is the presence of high concentration of free fatty acids (FFA), which result in saponification reaction while using the conventional <b>alkaline</b> catalysed process. <b>Saponification</b> lowers the biodiesel yield by preventing the separation of biodiesel from the product. In this study, a non-catalytic method for biodiesel production from WCO using supercritical methanol has been investigated. Two different feedstocks with different FFA concentration have been examined. Response surface methodology (RSM) using Box Behnken Design (BBD) and Central Composite Design (CCD) has been employed to analyse the effect of different reaction variables including methanol to oil (M:O) molar ratio, temperature, pressure and time on biodiesel yield. Numerical optimisation has been applied to determine the optimum conditions for maximum production of biodiesel for each feedstock. It has been concluded that the feedstock with higher FFA concentration produce higher biodiesel yield within the same reaction conditions. This result indicates the significance of using supercritical methanol technique for feedstocks with high FFA concentration as it enhances both esterification of FFA and transesterification of triglycerides (TG) to fatty acids methyl esters (FAME) ...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose is {{the most}} {{abundant}} natural polymer worldwide. The importance of cellulose does not arise only from the outstanding physical properties of cellulose itself, {{but also from the}} fact that cellulose can be converted to yield cellulose derivatives having interesting properties. Cellulose derivatives are regarded as complex copolymers which are heterogeneous at least in molar mass and chemical composition. This heterogeneity critically affects many of the properties of these derivatives such as adhesion strength, solubility, viscoelasticity and ability to control drug release from hydrophilic tablets and needs to be investigated. Despite the large number of applications, today’s characterization strategies for cellulose derivatives include mainly characterization of molar masses and their distribution, average degree of substitution (DS) and the distribution of the substituents within the individual anhydroglucose units (AGUs), i. e. partial DS in positions of O- 2, O- 3, and O- 6 atoms. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is an established technique for the characterization of molar masses and their distribution of cellulose and cellulose derivatives. NMR techniques are employed to determine the average DS and the distribution of substituents on the monomer level. However, the use of cellulose derivatives for a particular application is strongly dependent on the distribution of the substituents among the polymer chains (heterogeneity of 1 st order) and along the polymer chains (heterogeneity of 2 nd order). Frequently, the polymer chains are (partially) degraded by using acids or enzymes. The degradation of the sample results in a mixture of monomers and/or oligomers present in different molar ratios. The resulting products are separated and characterized subsequently in detail. For this purpose, various analytical techniques, alone or in combination, such as SEC, anion exchange chromatography (AEC), gas liquid chromatography (GLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) are employed on the hydrolyzed products to provide information on both monomer composition and the substituent distribution on the oligomer levels. This procedure yields the distribution of the differently substituted AGUs along the polymer chain (2 nd order heterogeneity). In general, the information is lost on whether the different monomeric or oligomeric units result from the same or from different chains, if the sample is partially or fully degraded. Therefore, establishing methods to characterize the chemical heterogeneity of cellulose derivatives on the level of intact polymeric chains is still a highly challenging task. Gradient HPLC {{has been shown to be}} a powerful tool for separating (co) polymer molecules according to chemical composition. The separation methods allow calculating the chemical composition distribution (CCD) of the copolymers. Nevertheless, knowledge on the separation of cellulose derivatives, particularly cellulose acetates (CA), with respect to DS is very limited and attempts to perform separations of such polymers according to chemical heterogeneity are scarcely found in literature. The present research work was mainly focused on the applicability of liquid chromatography for the analysis and characterization of molecular heterogeneity of CAs. The following significant results were obtained: 1. From the synthesis, it was shown that <b>alkaline</b> partial <b>saponification</b> of a high DS CA is a suitable method for preparing CAs of different average DS without altering the degree of polymerization. The comparison of the theoretical DS-values with ones determined by 1 H-NMR showed that the deacetylation reaction can be well controlled by the amount of sodium hydroxide added. 2. FTIR / ATR could be used to determine DS for very small sample amounts. This made it possible to characterize chromatographic fractions with respect to their DS. 3. From solubility tests, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylacetamide (DMAc) / lithium chloride (LiCl) were identified to dissolve the CAs, irrespective of DS. Therefore, these two solvents were utilized for chromatographic experiments. 4. An SEC method for characterization of molar masses and their distribution of the CAs in the DS-range of DS = 1. 5 - 2. 9 was developed. SEC light scattering investigations in pure DMSO and DMAc revealed aggregates which could be completely suppressed by the addition of LiCl. However, the significantly lower refractive index increment (dn/dc) of CA in DMSO as compared to DMAc made DMAc the preferred choice for SEC experiments. Samples differing in DS but being prepared from the same parent material showed nearly the same elution profile and nearly identical calibration curves, indicating that variations of the DS within the DS-range of DS = 1. 5 - 2. 9 do not alter remarkably the hydrodynamic volume. As a consequence, all the CA samples can be evaluated based on the same calibration curve, irrespective of their DS. The comparison of the true molar masses obtained by light scattering with PMMA equivalent molar masses revealed that the latter overestimated the absolute ones significantly. Therefore, correction factors were determined allowing calculating the true molar masses based on a PMMA calibration curve. 5. A gradient HPLC method for separating CAs within the DS range of DS = 1. 5 - 2. 9 was developed. By coupling liquid chromatography with infrared spectroscopy it was proved that a separation by DS was achieved not only for samples clearly differing in their average DS, but also within a single sample. Thus, the developed method for the first time allowed determination of the DS distribution of intact cellulose acetate chains, irrespective of DS. 6. Having established separations by DS and by molar mass, the correlations between DS and molar mass were examined. For this purpose, two dimensional separations were performed. First, a chromatographic separation according to DS was carried out using the gradient method developed before. The fractions, which were assumed to be homogenous in composition, were subsequently separated by SEC. The newly developed 2 D LC system allowed new insights into the heterogeneity of the CAs. ...|$|R

Therefore, considerable research has been focused towards measuring PAHs in vegetation using different analytical methods. However, in most cases information on the efficiencies of the different extraction methods employed is missing. This complicates data interpretation and inter-study comparisons.

40|$|This work {{describes}} new syntheses of surfactants and polymers {{based on}} renewable raw materials, mainly oleochemical epoxides and polyolamines based on carbohydrates using. Polyolamines, {{which are available}} by reductive amination of reducing carbohydrates, were reacted with different epoxides to synthesize carbohydrate-based surfactants. Selective conversion in methanol / water -mixtures at 70 °C conversion led to quantitative yields. Epoxides used were alpha-epoxides, omega-epoxy fatty acid methyl esters, glycidyl ethers of fatty alcohols, glycidol, mono- and diepoxides of alpha,omega-diolefins as well as glycidyl ethers of diols or glycerol. First the epoxides were reacted with glucamine and N-alkyl glucamines. Depending on combination, surfactants having different structures were obtained (linear surfactants, symmetric and asymmetric Y-type structures). The use of diepoxides of alpha,omega-diolefins or glycidyl ethers of diols or glycerol led to Bola- or Gemini-surfactants or, reacted with glucamine, to polymers. The products of the last-mentioned polyaddition were water-soluble polymers (Mw up to 22500 g/mol). Also cyclization was observed and this was forced by the dilution principle. The low molecular weight products and the polymers could be separated by fractionation or ultra-filtration. Especially, the products based on long-chain N-alkyl glucamines and glycidol {{as well as the}} Gemini-surfactants showed high surface activity. Many of the further products were rather poor surfactants, which was caused mostly by their low solubility in water. The surface active properties of these derivatives could be increased by conversion to the corresponding hydrobromides (acidification with HBr). After this, instead of the above glucamines further polyolamines were used. Galactamines, polyolamines based on disaccharides, ' fructamines ' and 2 -glucamin, which was obtained from glucosamine hydrochloride (product from hydrolysis of chitin), as well as glucamines from reductive amination with hydrophilic amines (ethanolamine or glucamine) or diamines were reacted with epoxides. More hydrophilic amines led to water-soluble products and the use of diamines to a further group of Gemini-surfactants. Both groups of carbohydrate-based surfactants showed good surface active properties. Further Gemini-surfactants could be obtained by reaction of 1 : 2, 7 : 8 -diepoxy octane with an excess of glucamine followed by addition of long-chain epoxides. Enzymatic hydrolysis or <b>alkaline</b> <b>saponification</b> of the products based on omega-epoxy fatty acid esters led to amphoteric surfactants.

Following this extraction, two different clean-up methods were tested: 1) silica and alumina clean-up in pasteur pipettes, and 2) SPE clean-up (silica). <b>Alkaline</b> <b>saponification</b> with SPE clean-up was deemed the better of the two clean-up methods, and was therefore used in the main experiments. This method reclaimed approximately 40 - 50 % of the crude oil (70 % for the ‘low oil’ sample) analysed on GC-FID, and had a higher and more stable recovery of the internal standards used (67 - 85 %). However, this clean-up procedure was characterized by a high ‘blank’ sample, indicating that contamination was introduced to the samples. After the extraction and clean-up method was established, an experimental set-up for the main experiments was determined. This set-up consisted of a flow through system made up of 6 x 20 L glass tanks, each contained 400 stage five C. finmarchicus. The copepods were given a diet of the micro algae Rhonomodas baltica. The oil dispersion was generated by a dispersion generator developed at NTNU and SINTEF Sealab which generate oil dispersions with defined droplet size distribution. The estimated amount of crude oil in C. finmarchicus faeces exposed to 1 ppm Troll crude oil was also determined. It was decided, based on the low amount of oil estimated, to collect faeces from the individual exposure tanks once every day, and to combine the collected faeces from three days into composite samples. Two experiments (experiment 1 and 2) were performed using this set-up. During experiment 1, the C. finmarchicus started egg production. Observations made during the development of the extraction and clean-up method indicate that C. finmarchicus in the egg laying phase has reduced faeces production. This may strongly affect the amount of oil detected from the faeces. The experiment was therefore repeated (experiment 2), with care being taken to avoid egg laying animals. The samples in this experiment were analysed on GC-FID to determine the total hydrocarbon concentration (THC). Oil was not detected in any of the samples at concentrations above the blank levels (6. 5 ± 0. 7 µg/mg dry weight). The samples were also analysed on GC-MS SIM for selected aromatic compounds, however, no compound was detected above the blank levels. The high concentrations detected in the ‘blank’ samples are believed to have been introduced by the use of the commercial SPE columns during the clean-up step. Other possible sources of contamination are the filter papers used, or cross-contamination from the other samples and from the laboratory in general. This high ‘blank’ sample makes it clear that more work is needed in order to develop a suitable clean-up method for the determination of crude oil in C. finmarchicus faeces. </p...|$|E
