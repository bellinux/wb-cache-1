5000|$|Clothes {{transformed}} from boxy styles, with square shoulders, to feminine and luxurious, with soft shoulder lines, corseted waists, round padded hips, and long skirts, {{leading to the}} knee-length [...] "sack" [...] dress. The knee-length skirts and dresses were the most oversized items of this 1950s. The introduction of new fabrics, including Terylene, Orlon, Banlon, <b>Acrilan</b> and Poplin, allowed for new fashion styles to be both created and introduced. Among these were the [...] "wash-and-wear" [...] sweater, the permanently pleated skirt, and the [...] "drip-dry" [...] skirt. Skirts of this era known as circle skirts were supported by layers of petticoats, creating a circular look that accentuated the waist line. Essentially, the petticoat reinforced the femininity of this period.|$|E

To circumvent restrictions on associating smoking with youth, glamour or life style, CDP devised a memorable series of images placing the product's gold pack in highly contrived, surreal surroundings. No people were shown, and not a word of copy, apart from the obligatory Government health warnings.|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{microbial}} contamination {{were carried out}} on a carpet strip (<b>acrilan)</b> installed in a laboratory corridor and on two carpet strips (<b>acrilan</b> and wool) installed in two rooms in a pediatric hospital. A sampling procedure of randomly removing 8 -mm plugs from the carpets was used for subsequent enumeration and identification of contaminating microorganisms. Microbial counts increased with time, reached a “plateau” at about 4 weeks, {{and appeared to be}} related to the amount of activity present in the carpeted area. Vacuuming of carpets showed only a slight reduction in the number of recoverable microorganisms. Qualitative studies on a strip of <b>acrilan</b> carpet installed in a hospital room indicated that Staphylococcus epidermidis and gram-positive nonsporeforming rods were the predominating microorganisms. Coagulase-positive S. aureus organisms were isolated during every sampling period, and gram-negative rods were also regularly isolated. Most nitrate-reducing gram-negative rods belonged to the Enterobacter and Escherichia groups. Survival studies conducted on carpet strips after hospital installation showed relatively constant levels of contamination for about 6 weeks, followed by a gradual reduction in numbers; coagulase-positive S. aureus were found for 35 days, whereas the proportions of most organisms remained relatively constant with time...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Twelve <b>Acrilan</b> acrylic, twelve Orlon acrylic, {{and twelve}} wool {{blankets}} were studied {{to determine the}} effect of laundering on thermal insulation value. The thirty-six blankets used in this study were selected and purchased by Florence Petzel for use {{in the study of the}} effects of maintenance on wool and acrylic blankets. Specified sections of each of the blankets were laundered zero, one, five or ten times using a soak wash method. Cutting diagrams were then developed for each blanket section. Seven hundred twenty warmth tests specimens, each measuring five inches square, were prepared at the time of Petzel's study. They were kept under constant temperature before the testing began and throughout the testing procedures. The laboratory tests included a thickness reading on the Compressometer and a warmth determination using the Cenco-Fitch instrument. The data from the warmth study is discussed in two parts. The thickness measurements and thermal conductivity values for each laundry interval are noted first. This is followed by a discussion of the significance of the relationship of thickness to warmth. The findings show a loss in the thickness of the Orlon acrylic and <b>Acrilan</b> acrylic blankets during laundering caused by matting and/or a loss of fibers. Conversely, the wool blankets gained continuously in thickness due to shrinkage. The thickest blankets had the lowest thermal conductivity values and were the best insulators; the thinnest blankets had the largest thermal conductivity values and had the least insulation value. This emphasizes the importance of the retention of thickness for the maintenance of warmth. There was not a significant difference in the amount of heat that was transmitted by the Orlon acrylic, <b>Acrilan</b> acrylic or wool blankets. This implies that warmth is dependent upon the thickness of a blanket and the retention of that thickness rather than upon the fiber content. An increase in insulation value was generally followed by a decrease in insulation value if the blanket lost thickness. The insulation value improved if the blanket shrank and became more compact. However, there is a point at which compactness is detrimental to warmth because of the reduction of vital air spaces. It was concluded that the warmth of a blanket is controlled by the thickness of the blanket and its ability to retain that thickness with laundering. It was further concluded that a thickness reading which is interpreted along with data on dimensional stability, yarn count, weight, and breaking strength would be sufficient to predict warmth for consumer purposes and information. It was recommended that subjective testing with individuals be included in future evaluations for more meaningful information. The best guide for the selection of a blanket still appears to be the brand name of a reputable manufacturer and a business firm to which the blanket may be returned if its performance is not satisfactory. One could expect to find warm blankets made from any fiber material provided the blanket is suitably woven and sufficiently thick...|$|E
