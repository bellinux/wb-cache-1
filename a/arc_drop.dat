40|$|The {{hybrid mode}} {{operation}} for {{the reduction of}} plasma drops is being investigated. This report discusses the results obtained from two molybdenum emitter converters. One converter had a molybdenum collector {{and the other a}} nickel collector. The molybdenum collector converter was operated in a hybrid mode (at an interelectrode distance of 1. 7 mm) and produced a minimum barrier index of 1. 96 eV at an emitter temperature of 1500 K. The <b>arc</b> <b>drop</b> was calculated to be 0. 14 eV, using the published results for a molybdenum collector. On the other hand, the nickel collector converter was operated in a conventional ignited mode (at an interelectrode distance of 0. 5 mm) and produced a minimum barrier index of 2. 1 eV at an emitter temperature of 1700 K. It is tentatively concluded that a large-gap operation of the hybrid mode converter permits the diffusion of cesium ions to a distance in the order of one millimeter for an effective neutralization of electron space charge. By employing a low work function collector (1. 55 eV) in a hybrid mode converter with an <b>arc</b> <b>drop</b> of 0. 14 eV, it appears that a barrier index as low as 1. 69 eV could be achieved...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—Subacromial {{impingement}} syndrome (SIS) is {{a frequent}} cause of shoulder pain. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the diagnostic values of clinical diagnostic tests, in patients with SIS.  METHODS— 72 female, 48  male patients with shoulder pain were included in the study. Five had bilateral shoulder pain, so 125  painful shoulders were evaluated. Details were recorded about the patients' ages and sexes, as well as characteristics of pain and related problems. Detailed physical examination and routine laboratory tests were performed. Conventional radiography and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder region of all patients were performed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the results of subacromial injection test, a reference standard test for SIS. Test positive patients constituted SIS group and test negative patients the non-SIS group. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive values of some clinical diagnostic tests such as Neer, Hawkins, horizontal adduction, painful <b>arc,</b> <b>drop</b> arm, Yergason and Speed tests for SIS were determined by using 2  ×  2  table.  RESULTS—The most sensitive diagnostic tests were found to be Hawkins test (92. 1 %), Neer test (88. 7 %) and horizontal adduction test (82. 0 %). Tests with highest specificity were drop arm test (97. 2 %), Yergason test (86. 1 %) and painful arc test (80. 5 %) consecutively.  CONCLUSION—The highly sensitive tests seem to have low specificity values and the highly specific ones to have low sensitivity values. Although this finding suggests that these diagnostic tests are insufficient for certain diagnosis, it is suggested they play an important part in clinical evaluation. ...|$|E

The thruster has operated in a pulsed, quasi-steady mode (pulse length: 5 ms). Magnetic fluctuations in the plasma jet have been measured by means of two non-intrusive sets of magnetic probes. The first set consists of two flux probes, turned around the thruster cylindrical insulator. The probes allow the fluctuations of the magnetic field on {{the entire length of}} the thruster to be detected and the axial periodicity in axial direction of the instabilities (mode n) to be obtained. The second set consists of an array of five biaxial probes, placed inside the cylindrical insulator of the thruster. By measuring the magnetic field fluctuations, the array allows the azimuthal periodicity (mode m) to be obtained. Tests have been carried out on the thruster with and without the insertion of an insulating plate in the discharge chamber for passive instability suppression.

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} divided into three more or less separate sections. The first section (Chapters II - VI) deals with an analysis of the transport properties of a partially ionized gas subject to the constraint that the average random energy of all constituent particles is exactly equal (equipartition of energy). This constraint is necessary so that the formal Chapman-Enskog solution of Boltzman's equation can be used to evaluate the various transport coefficients. Subject to this constraint, a set of tractable equations describing the mass and energy diffusion in a partially ionized gas is obtained that includes all terms correct to the order of the square root of the ratio of the electron to atom mass compared to one. The transport coefficients are evaluated for helium and argon over the complete range of partial ionization assuming that the species particle densities are quite close to their equilibrium values. The analysis indicates that the electron and ion diffusion velocities are more closely coupled than the equations of Chapman and Cowling show. The added coupling implicitly applies the constraint of zero mass velocity to the gas locally. Because of this constraint a current in the direction of (E x B) x B occurs in addition to the direct and Hall currents. It is shown that {{the only part of the}} thermal conductivity that can be influenced by a magnetic field is that part of the energy carried by the diffusion of the charged particles. For this reason, magnetic fields, in general, cannot be nearly as effective in reducing heat transfer rates as was previously thought, e. g., a magnetic field will have no influence on the thermal conductivity in a fully ionized gas, except through its influence on the current density and the thermal diffusion. Chapters VII - IX comprise the second section of this paper and deal with the development of a similarity solution for axially symmetric electric discharges. A number of parameters are obtained and discussed. The solution is evaluated for a discharge in argon gas at one atmosphere pressure in which the temperature on the axis of the discharge varies from 6, 000 °K to 19, 000 °K. The current-voltage characteristic obtained from this solution is compared with an experimentally determined curve of H. Maecker. The third section of this paper (Chapters X - XIII) is concerned with the mechanisms of energy transfer in arc jet devices. Use is made of the previous sections of the paper to determine the relative magnitude of the amount of energy that is transferred to the gas in the various parts of the electric discharge. The various possible electrode configurations are discussed in detail and compared. The design and performance of an annular electrode arc heater with a rotating arc is next described and discussed. Because of a number of undesirable performance characteristics of this type of electrode configuration, a modified heater was constructed with the cathode emission occurring along the axis of the applied magnetic field. Details of the unexpectedly good performance of this configuration are given. It is shown that the <b>arc</b> potential <b>drop</b> depends primarily on the strength of the applied magnetic field and the gas enthalpy downstream of the arc. The dependence of the <b>arc</b> potential <b>drop</b> on the <b>arc</b> current and the ambient pressure is shown to be weak over the ranges tested, e. g., 50 to 300 amperes for the current and 1 to 4 atmospheres for the pressure. Some heat transfer measurements taken with this equipment are presented. Appendix I is concerned with the evaluation of the transport coefficients in a partially ionized gas.

In particular, addition of CO_{ 2 } increases the threshold current for the transition from unstable globular to more stable spray transfer mode. We report on the diagnostics—using optical emission spectroscopy—of a GMAW plasma in pure argon and in mixtures of argon, CO_{ 2 } and N_{ 2 } while operated in spray and globular transfer modes. The spatially resolved plasma parameters are obtained by applying the Abel transformation to laterally integrated emission data. The Stark widths of some iron lines are used to determine both electron density and temperature, and line intensities yield relative contents of neutral and ionized iron to argon. Our experimental results indicate a temperature <b>drop</b> on the <b>arc</b> axis in the case of spray <b>arc</b> transfer. This <b>drop</b> reduces with addition of N_{ 2 } and disappears in globular transfer mode when CO_{ 2 } is added. Despite the temperature increase, the electron density decreases with CO_{ 2 } concentration. The highest concentration of iron is observed in the plasma column upper part (close to the anode) and for GMAW with CO_{ 2 }. Our results are compared with recently published works where the effect of non-homogeneous metal vapour concentration has been taken into account...|$|R
