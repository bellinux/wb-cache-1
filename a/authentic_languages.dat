40|$|Summary: The {{purpose of}} this article is to assess how {{multilingualism}} affects judicial interpretation of EU law. In the EU, the European Court of Justice is in the position of having the ﬁnal say on what EU norms mean. Therefore, the article looks into the case law of that Court. It is well known that all ofﬁcial EU languages (23 of them at present) are <b>authentic</b> <b>languages.</b> Less known is what the related consequences are for interpretation in judicial proceedings. The ﬁrst aim of the article is to ﬁnd out what consequences the ECJ has drawn from this fact. Secondly, even though in some cases (eg CILFIT) the ECJ has postulated language comparison as a necessary step in construing the meaning of EU law, it is clear that such comparisons are not performed on a regular basis. Therefore, the article looks into when, on whose initiative, and for what purpose the Court performs a comparison of the same EU norm(s) expressed in different languages. The article then looks into what the Court does if discrepancies in different language versions are found, and concludes that such a problem is overcome by looking for the purpose of a legal norm. Finally, it is found that multilingualism does not signiﬁcantly affect the manner and outcome of interpretation by the ECJ...|$|E

40|$|The {{theological}} {{changes of}} the Reformation were paralleled by an increasing reliance on the literal meaning of Scripture and an examination of passages in <b>authentic</b> <b>languages</b> {{in order to find}} the full resonance of each word to achieve the greatest possible emphasis; this emphasology was the principal function of the interpretation, founded on a pluralistic meaning of the text. Lutheran hermeneutes developed a common method of interpretation and format of presentation. The hermeneutical treatises written by German authors in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries have been virtually ignored by scholars of all disciplines, partly because they did not seem important in the context of modern philosophy, aesthetics, or theology (Gadamer).;This method influenced Kuhnau 2 ̆ 7 s musical settings in two ways. He used it as the procedure for his own exegesis of the text and chose musical devices to emphasize the meanings found in the interpretation, making his composition, in effect, a re-phrasing in music of his hermeneutical interpretation of a Biblical passage. That this is so can be seen in his own description of the musical setting of Psalm 1 in his writings and in his music. The other influence is in the structure of his cantata texts, which are seen to follow the traditional hermeneutical categories. The operation of these principles is evident not only {{in the structure of the}} texts, but also in Kuhnau 2 ̆ 7 s writings.;This study examines musical sources and writings critically, using the tools and terms of contemporary hermeneutics (and rhetoric). The results change our understanding of the music and music theory of the pre-Enlightenment period in Germany. For German composers of sacred music the response to the text was determined by the absolute authority of the Bible as the word of God and the primacy of literal, emphatic and pluralistic interpretation. Kuhnau 2 ̆ 7 s compositions are considered, in this study, in their own historic-critical context, and this stands in direct contrast to the music of the high Baroque...|$|E

The legal {{consequences of the}} territorial conception [...] Chapter IV. The province provision within the Travaux préparatoires [...] Chapter V. The province provision in its equally <b>authentic</b> <b>languages</b> [...] Chapter VI. Looking up [...] Bibliography [...] Appendices. The eventual migration of humans to outer space appears extremely likely when humanity’s development is viewed through the long‐term lens of the emerging discipline of ‘Big History’. When this future migration occurs, unexamined legal questions will arise {{at the intersection of}} international space law and international migration law. One possible governance model assisting such migration to outer space arises from an evolved understanding of the Outer Space Treaty, in particular its statement at Article I that the ‘exploration and use of outer space … shall be the province of all mankind. ’ The potential exists, de lege ferenda, to recognise the international legal personality of ‘mankind’ (or humankind), endowing this provision with the important role of investing residual sovereignty and ultimate title over areas of outer space in all of humanity. This thesis advocates such an evolutionary interpretation of the province provision, by recognising that the ordinary meaning of the word ‘province’ and both the activities of ‘exploration’ and ‘use’ all have legal associations with territory. Such a territorial conception can be highly facilitative of future migration to outer space and governance of space communities, by resulting in: 1) freedom of movement in outer space as an individual human right; 2) the bifurcation of sovereignty enabling territorial administration and resource utilisation by other subjects of international law; and 3) the ability for humankind to require acceptance of its compulsory jurisdiction over international disputes arising in outer space. This thesis undertakes a detailed examination of the Treaty’s travaux préparatoires to find a level of support exists within its negotiation history for this bold interpretation. Finally the term ‘the province of all mankind’ is analysed in each of the Treaty’s official languages, with this territorial conception of the province provision offering a unity of meaning between these five equally authentic texts.

40|$|The recent {{explosion}} in technology, {{in particular in}} computer and digitizing systems, has many implications for heritage language maintenance and learning. In particular, <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> usage can be easily recorded and preserved for those goals. That same explosion, however, {{can lead to a}} less than appropriate implementation of technology for language maintenance and learning. Further, certain cultural boundaries can make it difficult to have access to <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> usage, particularly by out-group individuals who work on indigenous languages. This paper presents a pilot study that attempts to both implement technology in an appropriate manner and surmount the problems faced by out-group language researchers by training an in-group member, in this case a speaker of Navajo, in the methodology and technology necessary for recording and preserving her heritage language. The results of this work are discussed, as well as the role of computer and digitizing technology in language maintenance and teaching. ...|$|R

40|$|Defense date: 23 / 02 / 2009 Examining Board: Profs. Bruno De Witte (EUI), Patrick Glenn (McGill University, Montreal), Manuela Guggeis (Legal Service of the Council of the European Union, Brussels), Jacques Ziller (Supervisor, former EUI and University of Pavia) The {{phenomenon}} of multilingual law stems from official multilingualism, which usually requires {{not only that}} the law should be enacted in all official languages, but also that texts of a single legal instrument expressed in different official languages be treated as equally authentic. Since all <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> versions are equal, all of them should be taken into consideration and none of them should prevail for interpretation purposes. In order to guarantee this equality, the principle of equal authenticity presumes that all <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> versions are originals and render the same meaning. However, in practice, multilingual law is often drafted by means of translation. Hence, there is a risk that those language versions prepared by means of translation will be deemed of questionable reliability, and therefore will not be considered when a multilingual legal instrument is interpreted. Contradictions between the presumptions behind the principle of equal authenticity and practice of multilingual legislative drafting draw attention to a paradox which can and has challenged the equality between <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> versions. The thesis provides strong evidence - through a comparative study of multilingual legislative drafting in the European Union and Canada - that legal presumptions established by the principle of equal authenticity and the practice of legal multilingualism are more congruent than may appear at first glance. In particular, the study reveals that the equality between <b>authentic</b> <b>language</b> versions results not only from legal presumptions and provisions but can also be assured in practice throughout the drafting process. This is evident in the bilingual codrafting process currently applied in Canada at the federal level. But it is also discernible in EU multilingual legislative drafting methods, which combine elements of translation and codrafting. The detailed examination of legal drafting within EU institutions demonstrates that all languages participate in all drafting stages and influence each other. Therefore, although some elements of translation are involved in the drafting of EU multilingual law, {{by the end of the}} drafting process none of the language versions can be identified as a pure original, thus guaranteeing that the equality of all language versions is preserved...|$|R
