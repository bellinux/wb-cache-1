50|$|Cover {{near the}} ground is an {{important}} criterion for white-throated woodrat shelter sites. In northern portions of their range, white-throated woodrats tend to construct houses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of trees; in southern portions of their range, white-throated woodrats tend to construct houses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of shrub-trees, shrubs, or cacti. When available, rocks are preferred by white-throated woodrats for shelter because they provide more protection from variations in ambient temperature than <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of plants.|$|R

5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base.</b> These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

50|$|Diphasiastrum alpinum grows 10 to 20 cm tall from stems which grow {{just under}} the surface of the ground. The leaves are hollow <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b> <b>The</b> female stems produce strobili up to 3 cmlong.|$|R

50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is {{an array}} of coils of flowers. Each flower is just over a centimeter wide with blue to pinkish lobes with white appendages <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b> <b>The</b> fruit is a cluster of prickly nutlets.|$|R
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the tentacles in {{some species}} lie acrorhagi, {{elongated}} inflatable tentacle-like organs armed with cnidocytes, that can flail around and fend off other encroaching anemones; {{one or both}} anemones can be driven off or suffer injury in such battles.|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
5|$|Below the Solsville, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the Otsego {{in eastern}} New York, a coral bed is found; another coral bed {{can be seen}} {{at the top of the}} Marcellus near Berne, New York.|$|E
50|$|The hairy {{inflorescence}} is an {{open array}} of branches, each a coiling panicle of flowers. Each flower is just over a centimeter wide with blue lobes with white appendages <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b> <b>The</b> boom period id May to July.|$|R
50|$|This is {{an annual}} plant. The new leaves are blue, turning green as they mature. They are usually toothed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} bears several {{leaves and}} one or more flowers with hairy leaflike sepals. Each flower has pale pink lobes with fringed or toothed tips and purple spots <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases.</b> <b>The</b> throat of the flower has yellow and white coloration.|$|R
