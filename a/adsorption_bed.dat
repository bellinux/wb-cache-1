40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} work, {{attention}} has been paid to the modeling of the pressure equalization step of pressure swing adsorption cycles. A reliable value of the equilibrium pressure Peq obtained when connecting two <b>adsorption</b> <b>beds</b> is important in modeling pressure swing adsorption cycles so as to assess accurately their performances.

This constant pressure of the pressurized or depressurized bed should be either accurately estimated or obtained experimentally prior to this decomposition. In this way, considerable savings in computation time could be obtained. However, if one wants to obtain accurate simulations for more complicated cases of real PSA processes, decomposing the equalization step into two separate steps ceases to be valid and the simultaneous simulation of the two <b>adsorption</b> <b>beds</b> is inevitable.

CPO- 27 (Ni) (known as MOF- 74 (Ni)), which is a MOF material that has high water adsorption capabilities of 0. 47 gH 2 O gads− 1 and hydrothermally stable and can be supplied in large quantities. Firstly, the material water adsorption isotherms were predicated using Materials Studio software via the material structure information and then compared to the experimentally measured isotherms. The experimentally measured isotherms and kinetics were used to model a double bed adsorption system for energy storage application using Simulink–Matlab software coupled with Nist RefProp thermophysical routines.
