5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin has exerted an {{influence}} equaled by few other novels in history. Upon publication, Uncle Tom's Cabin ignited <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> protest from defenders of slavery (who created {{a number of}} books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. As a best-seller, the novel heavily influenced later protest literature.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{this scheme}} was the {{announcement}} of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, {{which led to the}} discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel's charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller's efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light was only for the wealthy, provided by expensive whale oil. But during the next decade, kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes.|$|E

5000|$|Years ago, I {{looked at}} people and I {{was so full}} of some sort of emotion and I'd say, 'Absolutely not!' ... But I have to admit, people have asked me more recently, and even though I have no idea how such a series of events would come to pass, I can tell that there isn't the bombast in my voice, in the denial, in the refusal. It's more like, 'Well, I dunno.' Never say never is I guess is what people tell you. In this life, all kinds of strange things come to pass. Realizing that it doesn't really kick up <b>a</b> big <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> emotion, it kind of {{suggests}} that at least if someone started talking I'd sit still long enough to listen.|$|R
50|$|The {{heaviest}} bombing {{took place}} during The Blitz between 7 September 1940 and 10 May 1941. During this period, London was subjected to 71 separate raids receiving over 18,000 tonnes of high explosive. One raid in December 1940, which {{became known as the}} Second Great Fire <b>of</b> London, saw <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> engulf much <b>of</b> the City of London and destroy many historic buildings. St Paul's Cathedral, however, remained unscathed; a photograph showing the Cathedral shrouded in smoke became a famous image of the war.|$|R
50|$|The battle raged for a {{time between}} the two heroes, until a nuclear weapon was dropped on the duo while they fought in the Nevada desert. From that debacle arose <b>a</b> new <b>Firestorm,</b> in which Mikhail played a crucial role, along with the {{original}} two members <b>of</b> the <b>Firestorm</b> Matrix, Martin Stein and Ronnie Raymond. He continued as <b>a</b> member <b>of</b> <b>Firestorm</b> in another incarnation, as an Elemental, but was eventually removed from the Firestorm Matrix so that Martin alone could bear the powers. Ronnie and Mikhail returned to their homes, depowered.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> media {{coverage}} ensued, including nationwide coverage {{on television and}} in print, as well as front-page stories in local major dailies.

25|$|The raw and {{undifferentiated}} {{nature of}} Matthews' Appendix IX, which listed communists alongside liberals and even centrists {{in a single}} list, lead to <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> criticism and a quick effort at the document's recall. The U.S. Government Printing Office had already distributed a number of sets {{to members of the}} Dies Committee, government agencies, and private individuals, however, making the volume's complete suppression impossible. Appendix IX remains today a bibliographic rarity. He continued to work for the Committee on Un-American Activities until 1945, at which time he left to become a consultant for the Hearst Corporation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935, {{producers}} approached both McWade and Seddon {{and asked}} them to reprise their roles as The Pixilated Sisters for the 1936 movie Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, starring Gary Cooper and directed by Frank Capra. In the film the two actresses play sisters who believe that Cooper's character is “pixilated”. Reprising these characters set off <b>a</b> brief <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> stage and film performances for the duo. In The Corsicana Daily Sun, McWade is quoted as saying about playing the Pixilated Sisters in the movie, “...it’s a one chance in a million, {{like something out of a}} book. It’s not hard to understand. It wasn’t we who clicked individually or even collectively. It was a grand part. If you recall, we turned the tide by our testimony in favor of Gary Cooper at an insanity hearing. He was a beloved character, and by helping him we- helped ourselves.” ...|$|R
50|$|James McDonald did {{not accept}} the {{conclusions}} of the Condon Report because 30% of the cases studied in the report remained unexplained. The evidence provided in the final report could have substantiated the opposite conclusion (that UFOs warranted much more scientific study) rather than the official conclusion, which was to recommend no further study. <b>Firestorm,</b> <b>a</b> biography <b>of</b> McDonald by UFO researcher Ann Druffel, gives {{a detailed account of}} McDonald's tireless efforts promoting scientific UFO research.|$|R
5000|$|Harris {{edited the}} first {{appearances}} of several new characters {{in their own}} eponymous series including Black Lightning, Shade, the Changing Man, and <b>Firestorm.</b> <b>As</b> editor <b>of</b> the Legion of Super-Heroes title, Harris hired Steve Ditko to draw several issues, a decision which garnered a mixed reaction from the title's readership.

25|$|In 1992, {{he joined}} O'Connor's {{plurality}} opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which reaffirmed in principle (though without many details) the Roe v. Wade decision recognizing {{the right to}} abortion under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plurality opinion, signed jointly by three justices appointed by Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, ignited <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> criticism from conservatives. Kennedy had stated at least as early as 1989 that, in order to uphold precedent, he might not vote to overturn Roe. According to court insiders, Kennedy had reportedly considered overturning Roe, {{but in the end}} decided to uphold restrictions while affirming the Roe precedent.|$|E
25|$|In 1854, Congress {{passed the}} Kansas–Nebraska Act, which opened those territories to slavery if the local {{residents}} voted that way. The antislavery gains made in previous compromises were reversed. <b>A</b> <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> outrage brought together former Whigs, Know-Nothings, and former Free Soil Democrats {{to form a}} new party in 1854–56, the Republican Party. It included a program of rapid modernization involving the government promotion of industry, railroads, banks, free homesteads, and colleges, all to the annoyance of the South. The new party denounced the Slave Power – that is the political power of the slave owners who supposedly controlled the national government for their own benefit and to the disadvantage of the ordinary white man.|$|E
25|$|In May 1999 the Board of Alderman {{selected}} Sansone Development over Landside Resources for redevelopment of McKnight and Manchester. In October Sansone {{withdrew from}} the project. Sansone told Rock Hill later that year it wanted to scale back the development area from 25 acres to 16, just the northwest corner. After the city reopening the bid process Rock Hill agreed in April 2000 to allow Sansone to develop 16 acres, financed by up to $7 million in tax-increment financing. Sansone withdrew its proposal again in September 2000 citing city delays that meant surrounding development projects had progressed so much as to make the 16-acre proposal infeasible. The city re-bid the projects and received 40-acre plans from Regency Realty and THF Realty and an additional 25-acre plan from Regency. In April 2001 both developers retracted their bids amid <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> resident opposition against the proposals.|$|E
50|$|Two {{years on}} from where Obernewtyn ended, Obernewtyn is {{thriving}} as a secret community for Misfits. Rushton {{is now the}} legal owner of the site, spreading the rumour Obernewtyn had been destroyed in <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> (deadly storm <b>of</b> flames). The community is separated into six guilds: Healing, Futuretelling (those who can see the future), Coercing (those who can force others to think or act differently), Beasting (those who can communicate with animals), Farseeking (those {{with the ability to}} send out a mental probe) and Teknoguild (study of the time before the Great White, particularly machines). Each guild has a guildmaster/mistress, a guilden (2IC), and warden (3IC). Elspeth is guildmistress of the Farseekers. The front doors which contained the map of the weaponmachines have been destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Darmstadt {{was first}} bombed on 30 July 1940, and 34 other air raids would follow before the war's end. The old city centre was largely {{destroyed}} in a British bombing raid on 11 September 1944. This attack was <b>an</b> example <b>of</b> the <b>firestorm</b> technique, which was subsequently {{used against the}} historic city of Dresden in February 1945. To create <b>a</b> <b>firestorm,</b> <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> incendiary bombs are dropped around the city before the explosive blast bombs are dropped, thus beginning a self-sustaining combustion process in which winds generated by the fire ensure it continues to burn until everything possible has been consumed. Darmstadt {{was selected as the}} secondary target for the raid, but was promoted to the primary target after clouds were observed over the primary which would have hindered any reconnaissance of the after-effects. During this fire attack an estimated 11,000 to 12,500 of the inhabitants burned to death, and 66,000 to 70,000 were left homeless. Over three quarters of Darmstadt's inner city was destroyed. Post-war rebuilding was done in a relatively plain architectural style, although a number of the historic buildings were rebuilt to their original appearance following the city's capture on 20 March 1945 by American 4th Armored Division.|$|R
5000|$|Wilson's {{decision}} {{touched off}} <b>a</b> <b>firestorm.</b> [...] Secretary <b>of</b> War Lindley Garrison adopted {{many of the}} proposals of the Preparedness leaders, especially their emphasis on a large federal reserves and abandonment of the National Guard.

Specifically, they warned the chief warmongers were New York bankers (such as J. P. Morgan) with millions at risk, profiteering munition makers (such as Bethlehem Steel, which made armour, and DuPont, which made powder) and unspecified industrialists searching for global markets to control.

25|$|Much of Tobin's {{presidency}} was consumed by a long-running and sometimes physically violent jurisdictional {{battle with the}} National Union of United Brewery Workmen. The Teamsters had challenged the Brewery Workmen's right to organize beer wagon drivers in 1903 and 1905. At Tobin's insistence, in 1907 the AFL revoked the Brewery Workers' charter, but <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> protest from local unions around the country led the AFL to reinstate the charter in 1909. In 1933, the AFL Executive Council agreed to strip the brewery workers' union, {{now known as the}} United Brewery Workers, of the beer drivers. The United Brewery Workers filed suit in federal court in 1936 seeking to bar their suspension and the transfer of workers to the Teamsters. As the case worked its way to the Supreme Court of the United States the AFL attempted to mediate the dispute to no avail. The Supreme Court found in the AFL's favor, and the United Brewery Workers were suspended from the AFL.|$|E
25|$|In June 1870, Flagler and Rockefeller formed Standard Oil of Ohio, which rapidly {{became the}} most {{profitable}} refiner in Ohio. Standard Oil grew {{to become one of}} the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads were fighting fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company in collusion with Standard and other oil men outside the main oil centers. The cartel received preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep rebates of up to 50% for their product but also rebates for the shipment of competing products. Part of this scheme was the announcement of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, which eventually led to the discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal.

5000|$|Unlike {{the highly}} {{combustible}} World War II cities that firestormed from conventional and nuclear weapons, fire experts suggest {{that due to}} the nature of modern U.S. city design and construction, <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> is unlikely to occur even after a nuclear detonation. The explanation for this is that highrise buildings do not lend themselves to the formation <b>of</b> <b>firestorms</b> due to the baffle effect of the structures, nor are firestorms likely in areas where modern buildings have totally collapsed, with the exceptions of Tokyo and Hiroshima {{due to the nature}} of their densely packed [...] "flimsy" [...] wooden buildings in World War II. [...] There is also a sizable difference between the fuel loading of World War II cities that <b>firestormed</b> and that <b>of</b> modern cities, where the quantity of combustibles per square meter in the fire area in the latter is below the necessary requirement for <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> to form (40 kg/m²).

500|$|Fire Management {{officials}} in Shoshone National Forest recognize that forest fires are {{a natural part}} of the ecosystem; however, this was not always the case. 20th century fire fighting efforts, especially {{in the first half of}} that century, emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, as fire was seen as completely detrimental to a forest. In 1935, fire management officials established the 10am rule for all fires on federal lands, which recommended aggressive attack on fires and to have them controlled by 10am, the day after they are first detected. This was intended to prevent fires from remaining active into the afternoon when the rising temperatures and more turbulent air caused fires to expand and become more erratic. However, this policy led to an increase in fuels because fires were often extinguished before they had a chance to burn out dead and dying old growth. It was in a stand of old growth fir trees in Shoshone National Forest that the Blackwater fire of 1937 killed 15 fighters during <b>a</b> <b>firestorm</b> [...] west <b>of</b> Cody, Wyoming.
