40|$|AbstractBackgroundAdhesion {{formation}} {{is a major}} problem following abdominal surgery as it creates a considerable economic burden in addition to an increased risk for complications. In the present study, an effort was made to reduce post-operative adhesion formation by creating an <b>artificial</b> <b>atmosphere</b> within and around the abdominal cavity during an open surgical procedure. Methods 82 Wistar male rats (Clr:WI) (200  gr, 7 weeks) were randomized into two groups. The abdominal cavity of the control group was exposed to the normal atmosphere of the operating-theatre during surgery (21 % O 2, 21  °C, 40 – 47 % relative humidity (RH)), while the abdominal cavity of the study group was exposed to an <b>artificial</b> <b>atmosphere</b> during surgery (3 – 6 % O 2, > 75 % CO 2, 95 – 100 % RH, 37  °C). Adhesion induction consisted of a laparotomy along linea-alba, four lesions in the anterior abdominal-wall, blood from the tail vein dripped inside the abdominal cavity and exposure to the atmosphere around the wound by use of self-retaining retractors. In addition, a liquid-sample for quantitative bacteriologic cultivation and bacterial load (CFU/ml) calculation was taken just before closure. After 3 weeks the abdominal cavity was scored for the extent, tenacity and severity of adhesions before the rats were euthanized. The two-sample-Wilcoxon-rank-sum test was used in the analysis. ResultsHighly significant differences in postoperative total adhesion score, extent-, severity- and tenacity-score were found (P    0. 05). ConclusionsThe rats exposed to the warmed and humidified <b>artificial</b> <b>atmosphere</b> consisting of more than 75 % carbon dioxide and 3 – 4 % oxygen during surgery had more severe and more post-operative adhesions compared to the rats that were exposed to the ambient air during surgery...|$|R

50|$|At {{low engine}} speeds the wave {{pressure}} within the pipe network is low. A full oscillation of the Helmholtz resonance occurs before the exhaust valve is closed, {{and to increase}} low-speed torque, large amplitude exhaust pressure waves are artificially induced. This is achieved by partial closing of an internal valve within the exhaust—the EXUP valve—at {{the point where the}} four primary pipes from the cylinders join. This junction point essentially behaves as an <b>artificial</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> hence the alteration of the pressure at this point controls the behavior of reflected waves at this sudden increase in area discontinuity. Closing the valve increases the local pressure, thus inducing the formation of larger amplitude negative reflected expansion waves. This enhances low speed torque up to a speed at which the loss due to increased back pressure outweighs the EXUP tuning effect. At higher speeds the EXUP valve is fully opened and the exhaust is allowed to flow freely.|$|R

40|$|Gravitational {{waves from}} neutron-star and black-hole {{binaries}} carry valuable {{information on their}} physical properties and probe physics inaccessible to the laboratory. Although development of black-hole gravitational-wave templates {{in the past decade}} has been revolutionary, the corresponding work for double neutron-star systems has lagged. Neutron stars can be well-modelled as simple barotropic fluids during the part of binary inspiral most relevant to gravitational wave astronomy, but the crucial geometric and mathematical consequences of this simplification have remained computationally unexploited. In particular, Carter and Lichnerowicz have described barotropic fluid motion via classical variational principles as conformally geodesic. Moreover, Kelvin's circulation theorem implies that initially irrotational flows remain irrotational. Applied to numerical relativity, these concepts lead to novel Hamiltonian or Hamilton-Jacobi schemes for evolving relativistic fluid flows. Hamiltonian methods can conserve not only flux, but also circulation and symplecticity, and moreover do not require addition of an <b>artificial</b> <b>atmosphere</b> typically required by standard conservative methods.

Es zeigt sich für den Fall einer Atmosphäre mit stratiformer Bewölkung eine gute Übereinstimmung mit den Messungen. Eine genaue Berechnung der Extinktion durchWolken mittels Tropfenspektren bringt derzeit keine Vorteile gegenüber einer einfachen Parametrisierung.

A more accurate calculation of the extinction of radiation within the clouds by way of accounting for measured droplet spectra does momentarily not lead to an improvement in comparison with the simple parameterization method.
