5|$|Singers {{and players}} admired Britten's conducting, and David Webster rated it highly enough {{to offer him}} the musical {{directorship}} of the Covent Garden Opera in 1952. Britten declined; he was not confident of his ability as <b>a</b> <b>conductor</b> and was reluctant to {{spend too much time}} performing rather than composing. As <b>a</b> <b>conductor,</b> Britten's repertory included Purcell, Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Schubert, and occasional less characteristic choices including Schumann's Scenes from Goethe's Faust; Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Introduction and Allegro; Holst's Egdon Heath and short pieces by Percy Grainger.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in <b>a</b> <b>conductor</b> {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current {{at one point in the}} material causes changes in currents in other parts of the material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E
5|$|Born {{to a rich}} {{industrial}} family, Beecham {{began his}} career as <b>a</b> <b>conductor</b> in 1899.

Among the works he introduced to England were Richard Strauss's Elektra, Salome and Der Rosenkavalier and three operas by Frederick Delius.|$|E

5|$|As {{a pianist}} and {{conductor}} in other composers' music, Britten made many recordings for Decca. Among his studio collaborations with Pears are sets of Schubert's Winterreise and Die schöne Müllerin, Schumann's Dichterliebe, and songs by Haydn, Mozart, Bridge, Ireland, Holst, Tippett and Richard Rodney Bennett. Other soloists whom Britten accompanied on record were Ferrier, Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya. As <b>a</b> <b>conductor</b> he recorded {{a wide range}} of composers, from Purcell to Grainger. Among his best-known Decca recordings are Purcell's The Fairy-Queen, Bach's Brandenburg concertos, Cantata 151, Cantata 102 and St John Passion, Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius and Mozart's last two symphonies.|$|E

The English music critic Francis Toye wrote that good though Arturo Toscanini's conducting of Pelléas et Mélisande was at La Scala in Milan, Messager's was still better.|$|E

5|$|Born in Cologne, {{the son of}} {{a synagogue}} cantor, Offenbach showed early musical talent. At the age of 14, he was {{accepted}} as a student at the Paris Conservatoire but found academic study unfulfilling and left after a year. From 1835 to 1855 he earned his living as a cellist, achieving international fame, and as <b>a</b> <b>conductor.</b> His ambition, however, was to compose comic pieces for the musical theatre. Finding the management of Paris' Opéra-Comique company uninterested in staging his works, in 1855 he leased a small theatre in the Champs-Élysées. There he presented a series of his own small-scale pieces, many of which became popular.|$|E
5|$|Calcium metal melts at 842°C and boils at 1494°C, {{higher than}} its {{adjacent}} group 2 metals do.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} an alternative procedure to obtain <b>an</b> equivalent <b>conductor</b> from <b>a</b> bundled <b>conductor,</b> {{taking into account}} the distribution of the current in subcondutors of the bundle. Firstly, it is introduced a brief background about the concept of Geometric Mean Radius (GMR) and how this methodology is applied to define <b>an</b> equivalent <b>conductor</b> and its electric parameters. Emphasizing that the classical procedure, using GMR, is limited to premise which the current is equally distributed through subconductors. Afterwards, it is described the development of proposed method and applications for <b>an</b> equivalent <b>conductor</b> obtained from <b>a</b> conventional transmission line bundled <b>conductor</b> and from <b>an</b> equivalent <b>conductor</b> based on <b>a</b> bundle with compressed SF 6 insulation system, where the current is unequally distributed through subconductors...|$|R
