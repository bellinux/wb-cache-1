5|$|Whereas bismuth is most {{available}} today as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct,</b> its sustainability is {{more dependent on}} recycling. Bismuth is mostly <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> of the smelting of lead, and also of tungsten and copper production. Recycling bismuth is difficult in many of its end uses, primarily because of scattering.|$|E
40|$|By using {{lower bound}} {{conditions}} of the Lévy measure, derivative formulae and Harnack inequalities are derived for linear stochastic differential equations driven by Lévy processes.

50|$|Niacin {{is formed}} as <b>a</b> {{metabolic}} <b>byproduct</b> by all mycobacteria, but some species possess an enzyme that converts free niacin to niacin ribonucleotide.

5|$|Hafnium {{reserves}} {{have been}} infamously estimated to last under 10 years by one source {{if the world}} population increases and demand grows.

5|$|Members of the Cucurbitaceae include gourds, melons, pumpkins, and squashes. Seeds {{from these}} plants are noted for their oil content, but little {{information}} is available on methods of extracting the oil.

40|$|Abstract. For skew-symmetric acyclic quantum cluster algebras, we {{express the}} quan-tum F-polynomials and the quantum cluster monomials {{in terms of}} Serre polynomials of quiver Grassmannians of rigid modules. <b>As</b> <b>byproducts,</b> we obtain the {{existence}} of counting polynomials for these varieties and the positivity conjecture with respect to acyclic seeds.

5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct,</b> obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|E
5|$|The {{price for}} pure bismuth metal has been {{relatively}} stable {{through most of the}} 20th century, except for a spike in the 1970s. Bismuth has always been produced mainly as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> of lead refining, and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.|$|E
5|$|According to the United States Geological Survey, {{the world}} mining {{production}} of bismuth in 2014 was 13,600 tonnes, {{with the major}} contributions from China (7,600 tonnes), Vietnam (4,950 tonnes) and Mexico (948 tonnes). The refinery production in 2010 was 16,000 tonnes, of which China produced 13,000, Mexico 850 and Belgium 800 tonnes. The difference reflects bismuth's status as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> of extraction of other metals such as lead, copper, tin, molybdenum and tungsten.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{utilisation}} of known syntactic transformations of Answer Set Programming (ASP) for preprocessing programs written with extended {{rules of the}} smodels format. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>byproduct</b> we also introduce a candidate for a canon-ical form for representing said rules.

40|$|We {{construct}} a lax monoidal Topological Quantum Field Theory that computes Deligne-Hodge polynomials of representation varieties {{of the fundamental}} group of any closed manifold into any complex algebraic group $G$. <b>As</b> <b>byproduct,</b> we obtain formulas for these polynomials in terms of homomorphisms between the space of mixed Hodge modules on $G$.

40|$|We compute {{commutativity}} {{degrees of}} wreath products A o B of finite Abelian groups A and B. When B is fixed of order n the asymptotic commutativity degree of such wreath products is 1 /n 2. This answers a generalized {{version of a}} question posed by P.

5|$|Cadmium {{occurs as}} a minor {{component}} in most zinc ores and is <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> of zinc production. Cadmium was used {{for a long time}} as a corrosion-resistant plating on steel, and cadmium compounds are used as red, orange and yellow pigments, to colour glass, and to stabilize plastic. Cadmium use is generally decreasing because it is toxic (it is specifically listed in the European Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and nickel-cadmium batteries have been replaced with nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion batteries. One of its few new uses is cadmium telluride solar panels.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{thallium}} {{is produced}} not from potassium ores, but as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> from refining of heavy metal sulfide ores. Approximately 60–70% of thallium production {{is used in}} the electronics industry, and the remainder {{is used in the}} pharmaceutical industry and in glass manufacturing. It is also used in infrared detectors. The radioisotope thallium-201 (as the soluble chloride TlCl) is used in small, nontoxic amounts as an agent in a nuclear medicine scan, during one type of nuclear cardiac stress test.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{infection}} causes chronic ongoing {{inflammation and}} production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, the HIV genome may be vulnerable to oxidative damages, including breaks in the single-stranded RNA. For HIV, {{as well as for}} viruses generally, successful infection depends on overcoming host defensive strategies that often include production of genome-damaging reactive oxygen. Thus, Michod et al. suggested that recombination by viruses is an adaptation for repair of genome damages, and that recombinational variation is <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> that may provide a separate benefit.|$|E
40|$|The distal radioulnar ligaments are {{essential}} contributors to wrist joint stability. We present a CT-based model for ligament displacement, in which ligaments are approximated by shortest paths in a 3 D space with bone obstacles. This first model {{allows for the}} study of distal ligaments biomechanics in vivo and non-invasively. We show that our simplified model gives surprising insight into distal ligament and wrist biomechanics. We apply our ligament model to 6 patients with recalcitrant limitation of forearm rotation and present results. <b>As</b> <b>byproducts,</b> <b>a</b> better bone surface reconstruction via manifolds is achieved, and a novel method for automated alignment/comparison of the same bone across different patients is proposed. ...|$|R

40|$|We review {{some recent}} {{theoretical}} results on radiative rare kaon decays. Particular attention {{is devoted to}} the channels K → πll and K → ππγ, where we are (or might be) able to extract the short distance contributions. This is achieved by a careful study of the long distance part. We study also CP violating observables, which are sensitive also to extensions of the SM. <b>As</b> <b>byproduct,</b> we discuss interesting chiral tests. ...|$|R
5|$|Indium {{is a minor}} {{component}} in zinc sulfide ores and is produced as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> of zinc refinement. It is most notably used in the semiconductor industry, in low-melting-point metal alloys such as solders, in soft-metal high-vacuum seals, and {{in the production of}} transparent conductive coatings of indium tin oxide (ITO) on glass. Indium has no biological role, though its compounds are somewhat toxic when injected into the bloodstream. Most occupational exposure is through ingestion, from which indium compounds are not absorbed well, and inhalation, from which they are moderately absorbed.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{could be}} {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} modern Germany. After dissolving the Holy Roman Empire, he reduced the number of German states from 300 to less than 50, prior to the German Unification. <b>A</b> <b>byproduct</b> of the French occupation was a strong development in German nationalism. Napoleon also significantly aided the United States when he agreed to sell the territory of Louisiana for 15 million dollars during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. That territory almost doubled the size of the United States, adding the equivalent of 13 states to the Union.|$|E
5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon {{is by far the}} cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as <b>a</b> <b>byproduct</b> of cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E
