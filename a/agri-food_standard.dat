The objective of this dissertation is to offer perspectives to contextualize sustainable agriculture in relation to two societal contexts beyond farm and watershed: (1) the developing country context, and (2) the fresh fruit and vegetables (FFV) sector (with special reference to the <b>agri-food</b> <b>standard</b> called `Good Agricultural Practices 2 ̆ 7 (GAP) and Thailand). Papers in this dissertation thus aim to identify the social and ecological factors that help to define sustainable agriculture along these broader contexts...|$|E

This article uses a {{responsive}} regulation {{perspective to}} explore relation-ships between standards organizations {{and state agencies}} in ostensibly private sector regulation of food quality and safety. First we will trace some {{of the history of}} the GLOBALG. A. P. private <b>agri-food</b> <b>standard</b> and then, using empirical case studies, highlight how this particular form of responsive regulation has played out in three distinct national contexts: Australia, the Philippines and Vietnam. In each case, the interplay between public and private sector regulation was pivotal in shaping the influence of private standards on social relations of production and on the subsequent evolution of regulation in both spheres. While there is an emphasis within GLOBALG. A. P. on benchmarking and harmonization, the in-terdependency between standards and national regulatory contexts means that neither the standards themselves nor the products that are certified against them are internationally uniform. Private–public sector interdependence creates com-peting imperatives at the international and national levels that are obscured by the language of harmonization but that nevertheless challenge the legitimacy and effectiveness of standards as a particular governance strategy...|$|E

However, as Dunn argues, ‘standards … produce unique regulatory landscapes {{rather than the}} uniform ones standardizers envis-age’. To account for this variation, scholars consider contextual factors such as market institutions, cultural norms, and the structural organization of agriculture. I argue that as standards increasingly overlap, intersect, and even contradict each other, they emerge as significant contextual features in their own right. This arti-cle analyses how producers for Russia’s burgeoning fast-food industry respond to the competing demands of multiple <b>agri-food</b> <b>standards.</b> Drawing on inter-views and site visits with Russian agricultural producers and food processors, I illustrate how the presence of multiple competing standards can both undermine expected standardizing effects and empower producers to adopt and incorporate standards in novel ways. I find that {{in their efforts to}} satisfy both multinational firms and domestic consumers, producers legitimize practices that may only com-ply partially with the various standards they claim to meet...|$|R

The aim of this memorandum is to {{provide insight into the}} question who determines what is'good' in terms of good agricultural practices (GAP) of <b>agri-food</b> <b>standards.</b> It also assesses the extent towhich climate-smart practices are currently incorporated into good agricultural practices and how these could be further integrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Private <b>agri-food</b> <b>standards,</b> {{along with}} {{certification}} and labelling schemes, are rapidly becoming the predominant {{mechanism by which}} global agricultural production and trade are governed. This article examines voluntary private social standards (VPSS) and certification schemes in agri-food system gov-ernance and contends that, while such standards may secure important localized material gains, these are not altogether unproblematic. Furthermore, the potential for voluntary social standards to confront structural injustice in the agri-food sys-tem and {{to contribute to a}} transformation towards just and sustainable agricul-ture and food appear rather limited. It is argued that prominent multi-stakeholder standards are increasingly prone to capture by powerful private interests, and that a central role for decisive public regulation in agri-food system sustainability should therefore not be dismissed...|$|R
40|$|The article explores how {{fair trade}} and {{associated}} private <b>agri-food</b> <b>standards</b> {{are incorporated into}} public procurement in Europe. Procurement law is underpinned by principles of equity, non-discrimination and transparency; one consequence is that legal obstacles exist to fair trade being privileged within procurement practice. These obstacles have pragmatic dimensions, concerning whether and how procurement {{can be used to}} fulfil wider social policy objectives or to incorporate private standards; they also bring to the fore underlying issues of value. Taking an agency-based approach and incorporating the concept of governability, empirical evidence demonstrates the role played by different actors in negotiating fair trade’s passage into procurement through pre-empting and managing legal risk. This process exposes contestations that arise when contrasting values come together within sustainable procurement. This examination of fair trade in public procurement helps reveal how practices and knowledge on ethical consumption enter into a new governance arena within the global agri-food system...|$|R
40|$|Private {{standards}} and certification schemes provide an increasingly significant site of study for scholars {{interested in the}} restructuring of the agrifood sector. In {{the last ten years}} there has been a burgeoning literature on {{standards and}} certification schemes, focusing particularly on organic (Guthman, 2004), fair trade (Renard, 2005) and retailer-led schemes (Campbell et al, 2006; Hatanaka et al, 2005). The rise of private standards schemes has tended to be conceptualized {{as part of a broader}} global shift from public to private forms of governance as large international supermarket chains in particular, and to a lesser extent actors such as civil society organizations and social activists, exert increasing control over agri-food supply chains (Burch and Lawrence, 2007; Fulponi, 2006; Henson and Reardon, 2005) including the production practices of processors and producer-farmers (Hendrickson and James, 2005). This relates to the more general influence of what Cashore (2002, p. 504) terms 'Non-State Market-Driven' forms of governance that 'derive their policy-making authority not from the state, but from the manipulation of global markets and attention to customer preferences'. While this literature is significant in drawing attention to the shifting power relations within agri-food supply chains from producers and processors to supermarkets, it gives little attention to how standards are implemented and adapted, and the role of state agencies, sub-state or regional authorities and producers in this process. Drawing upon insights from the literature on governmentality, this chapter examines the different ways in which a private standards scheme - environmental management systems (EMS), based on the international standard ISO 14001 - has been implemented at a national, regional and industry level in Australian agriculture. We argue that the application of EMS has depended on alliances between a diverse range of agencies and actors - both public and private. Moreover, making EMS work at an industry and regional level has involved the adaptation of this standards scheme so that it accords with sectoral and local priorities rather than striving to meet the full requirements of the international ISO 14001 standard. Prior to elaborating our argument, it is necessary to explore briefly the merits and limitations of the existing literature on <b>agri-food</b> <b>standards,</b> and the ways in which a governmentality perspective might assist in addressing existing gaps in knowledge...|$|R
40|$|When {{talking about}} the {{importance}} of the agri-food production environment and the application of food safety and sanitary measures in it, a list of growing unfortunate related events come to mind such as: the rise of diseases coming from farming production, the rocketing of environmental degradation and overexploitation of genetic farmed pools, the economically important agri-food scares and overall, the opacity of agri-food production and regulation. This thesis examines the divergence between legal measures and legal application of global <b>agri-food</b> <b>standards</b> as a legitimacy crisis and has a twofold aim. First it aims to illustrate the role that regulatory legitimacy plays in effective compliance by studying the construction of regulatory legitimacy as a discursive practice. Second, and as a result of this the thesis asks how South Indian animal farming systems and international safety and sanitary measures construct their environmental normative legitimacy and introduce some implications for the animal farming/public health international debate. In this social constructivist approach, the thesis applies a combination of environmental discourse and framing analysis –discursive framings- to empirically study the construction of (non) formally binding norms in agri-food environments. These ´discursive framings´ it is argued, help represent the architectures of green compliance embedded in agro-environmental narratives, uncovered through the uses of language. In this way, framings help detect a variety of forms of (non) endorsement of safety and sanitary measures by regulatory stakeholders and with it, their role in ´racing standards to the top or to the bottom´ in agri-food regulation. An exploratory study comparing documents about safety and sanitary measures (believed to reinforce levels of safety and sanitary compliance in trade conflicts) in international dispute resolutions and interviews of key stakeholders in the field (believed to reflect safety and sanitary compliance in animal farming practice) in South India are conducted. The comparison of expected compliance between dispute formal documents and transcripts of actors under potential regulation provides insight into the discursive constitutions of legal and social safety and sanitary standards. It also informs on a number of counterproductive effects (cooptation, substitution or dilution of regulatory measures) when poor translation of normative preferences from global sanitary provisions of market access into the subnational agri-food environment begins to take place. The thesis empirically demonstrates how present public understandings of WTO-SPS Agreements in India have the potential to induce existent food safety and sanitary compliance into a race to the bottom increasing diseases from farmed animals in this country: given the consistent constellation of discursive voids that have left scientific knowledge out of agro-ecological and animal health present concerns, subnationally and internationally. The conceptual framework, the primary and secondary data and the analyses account for this complexity, namely, the convergences and voids left among discursive constellations of green compliance and their roles in existing models of agri-food regulation. Finally, the thesis presents the contributions to the study of Dryzek´s environmental discourses that a constructivist research like this can make to the study of legitimacy crises and efficacious regulation in general and between international market access, public health and the ago-environment in India (the case studied here) in particular...|$|R
