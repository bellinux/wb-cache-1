5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have a blood–brain {{barrier that}} allows metabolism inside {{the brain to}} operate differently from metabolism {{in other parts of}} the body. Glial cells play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons, including levels of ions <b>and</b> <b>nutrients.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, they will need to be supplied with oxygen <b>and</b> <b>nutrients</b> and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen <b>and</b> <b>nutrients</b> would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
5|$|Maine Coons require ample protein <b>and</b> <b>nutrients</b> {{in their}} diets. Since {{they are a}} large cat breed {{with high levels of}} energy, it is best to feed them quality food. Food that lists meat as the first {{ingredient}} is best for the Maine Coon.|$|E
30|$|Cushion {{plants are}} {{important}} facilitator species in alpine ecosystems. Across a seven-year period, the cushion plant S. acaulis showed differing short- and medium-term responses to warming <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> addition, with the strongest responses often {{coming in the}} combined warming <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> treatment. For example, over a three-year period, both <b>nutrient</b> addition <b>and</b> the combined warming <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> manipulation significantly increased stem elongation, with the combined treatment having a stronger effect. For leaf elongation, only the combined warming <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> manipulation had a significant positive effect. Temperature, <b>nutrient,</b> <b>and</b> the combined treatment initially increased cover of S. acaulis, but by the seventh year of manipulations, the combined warming <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> treatment {{had a very strong}} and significant negative effect on cover.|$|R

40|$|In an 8 -week {{aquarium}} experiment, {{we investigated}} {{the interactive effects}} of waves (present vs. absent) <b>and</b> water-column <b>nutrient</b> level (high vs. low) on the survival, growth, morphology, and biomechanics of the seagrass, Zostera noltii. Survival was reduced when plants were exposed to both waves <b>and</b> high <b>nutrient</b> levels. Wave <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> interaction significantly reduced aboveground biomass and leaf lengths, whereas waves independently reduced growth rate, internode abundance, elongation, <b>and</b> appearance rates. <b>Nutrient</b> supply significantly reduced the strength of the leaves. Wave <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> interaction was the main driving force affecting survival and morphological properties of seagrass, whereas dynamical characteristics were independently affected by waves, <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> supply affected mainly biomechanical properties. In conclusion, this experiment revealed that the combination of exposure to waves <b>and</b> high <b>nutrient</b> levels was detrimental for Z. noltii, which indicates that this could be an important unexplored force involved in seagrass declines...|$|R
5|$|Some {{physiological}} carnivores consume plant {{matter and}} some physiological herbivores consuming meat. From a behavioral aspect, {{this would make}} them omnivores, but from the physiological standpoint, {{this may be due}} to zoopharmacognosy. Physiologically, animals must be able to obtain both energy <b>and</b> <b>nutrients</b> from plant and animal materials to be considered omnivorous. Thus, such animals are still able to be classified as carnivores and herbivores when they are just obtaining nutrients from materials originating from sources that do not seemingly complement their classification. For example, it is well documented that some ungulates. such as giraffes, camels, and cattle, will gnaw on bones to consume particular minerals <b>and</b> <b>nutrients.</b> Also, cats, which are generally regarded as obligate carnivores, occasionally eat grass to regurgitate indigestible material (such as hairballs), aid with hemoglobin production, and as a laxative.|$|E

40|$|A 72 -day {{greenhouse}} {{pot experiment}} {{was conducted with}} a sandy loam or a silt loam soil {{to examine the effects}} of farmyard manure (FYM), poultry litter (PL) and biogenic waste compost (BWC) at 10 g dw kg- 1 soil on microbial biomass and activity <b>and</b> growth <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake by wheat. Soil samples were collected at days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56 and 72 after planting. Growth <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake by wheat were determined on day 72. All three amendments increased microbial biomass C, N and P, dehydrogenase activity, plant growth <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake with a greater effect by FYM and PL than by BWC. All amendments increased microbial biomass C, N and P and enzyme activity particularly on day 0. These microbial parameters decreased after day 0 indicating microbial biomass turnover. All amendments increased plant growth <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake. It is concluded that organicamendments can stimulate microbial growth <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake as well as plant growth <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> uptake. Microbes can increase plant nutrient availability by nutrient mobilisation but also because nutrients taken up by the microbial biomass initially could become available to plants when the microbial biomass turns over as the easily available C is depleted.

5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of {{different species of}} plants in ecological communities including forests and grasslands may be determined {{in part by the}} level of defensive compounds in the different species. Since the cost of replacement of damaged leaves is higher in conditions where resources are scarce, it may also be that plants growing in areas where water <b>and</b> <b>nutrients</b> are scarce may invest more resources into anti-herbivore defenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water <b>and</b> <b>nutrients</b> to {{transfer}} to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water <b>and</b> <b>nutrients</b> such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, {{from which they}} obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals <b>and</b> <b>nutrients.</b> In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and {{studies have suggested that}} the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.|$|E

40|$|We {{calculate}} {{values of}} forest carbon sequestration <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> recycling applying the replacement cost method. The value is then determined as the savings in costs by {{the replacement of}} more expensive abatement measures with these ecosystem services in cost-effective climate <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> programs. To this end, a dynamic optimization model is constructed, which accounts for uncertainty in sequestration. It {{is applied to the}} Stockholm-Mälar region in southeast Sweden where the EU 2050 climate policy for carbon emissions and the Baltic Sea action plan for nutrient discharges are applied. The results show that the value of carbon <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> sequestration can correspond to approximately 0. 5 % of the region’s gross domestic product, or 40 % of the value of productive forest. The largest part of this value is attributed to carbon sequestration because of the relative stringency in targets and expensive alternative abatement measures. However, sequestration is uncertain because of stochastic weather conditions, and when society has a large risk aversion for not attaining climate <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> targets, the values of the forest carbon <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> sequestration can approach zero...|$|R
5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} tree. As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in {{the canopy of}} a host tree and begin life as an epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since it effectively girdles the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for light, water <b>and</b> <b>nutrients.</b> Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{strangler}} figs (Ficus aurea) {{are common}} in hammocks, and find particular ease in rooting at the heads of cabbage palms (Sabal palmetto). After taking root into the ground, they build complex frameworks around the host tree, eventually squeezing out light <b>and</b> <b>nutrients,</b> and essentially taking its place. A variety of invertebrates including beetles, ants, spiders, and tree snails support a food chain that includes frogs, owls and other birds of prey, snakes, rodents, bobcats, and raccoons. There are more than 50varieties of tree snails in the Everglades; the color patterns and designs unique to single islands may {{be a result of}} the isolation of certain hammocks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the left}} heart, oxygenated blood is {{returned}} to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped into the left ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen <b>and</b> <b>nutrients</b> from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.|$|E

LFA calculates these parameters using 11 soil surface indicators. Results showed that stability, infiltration <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> cycle were higher in Karkaboud than the other locations because of low grazing pressure and non-accessibility conditions. As grazing pressure increased we witnessed less stability, infiltration <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> cycling in Karkaboud cascade, Kouin and Kouin-Marjan. Main causes of decline in stability, infiltration <b>and</b> <b>nutrient</b> cycling are perennial vegetation removal, soil trampling and decrease in soil organic matter and subsequent increase in erosion and soil instability...|$|R
5|$|T. oreades has a swollen woody base largely {{under the}} soil {{known as a}} lignotuber, which stores energy <b>and</b> <b>nutrients</b> as a {{resource}} for rapid growth after a bushfire. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire. When they do, the plant community becomes a more open sclerophyll woodland until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots grow from the lignotuber, which survives bushfire {{as the rest of the}} plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants.|$|E
5|$|Telopea speciosissima is a pyrogenic-{{flowering}} species, {{relying on}} post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds {{to take advantage}} of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire. Of the woody resprouter species of southeastern Australia, {{it is one of the}} slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires, taking at least two years. The species resprouts from a lignotuber, a swollen woody base largely under the soil, that stores energy <b>and</b> <b>nutrients</b> as a resource for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire. Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing banksias (Banksia) and wattles (Acacia). Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests. Flowering may be prolific at this time.|$|E
