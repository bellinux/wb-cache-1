5|$|Shortly after {{publication}} of Preface to Plato, Havelock accepted {{a position as}} chair of the Classics Department at Yale University. He remained in New Haven for eight years, and then taught briefly as Raymond Distinguished Professor of Classics at the State University of New York at Buffalo. He retired in 1973 and moved to Poughkeepsie, New York, where his wife Christine Mitchell, whom he had married in 1962, taught at Vassar College. He was a productive scholar after his retirement, writing three books as well as numerous essays and talks expanding the arguments of Preface to Plato to a generalised argument <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> literacy on Greek thought, literature, culture, society, and law.|$|E
5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E

5|$|When the {{calutron}} {{was first}} operated on 2 December 1941, {{just days before}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, a uranium beam intensity of 5 microamperes (μA) was received by the collector. Lawrence's hunch <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the air molecules in the vacuum chamber was confirmed. A nine-hour run on 14 January 1942 with a 50 μA beam produced 18 micrograms (μg) of uranium enriched to 25% uranium-235, about ten times as much as Nier had produced. By February, improvements in the technique allowed it to generate a 1,400 μA beam. That month, 75 μg samples enriched to 30% were shipped to the British and the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Revival {{started in}} earnest in 1595 when Ferdinand III, who was Jesuit-educated came of age. He had succeeded his father, Charles II in Inner Austria in 1590 and was {{energetic}} in suppressing heresy {{in the provinces}} which he ruled. Reformation Commissionms initiated a process of forced recatholicisation and by 1600 was being imposed on Graz and Klagenfurt. Unlike previous Austrian rulers, Ferdinand III was unconcerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> religious conflict {{on the ability to}} withstand the Ottomans. The Counter-Reformation was to continue {{to the end of the}} Thirty Year War in 1648.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis of the {{syndrome}} is clinical {{since there are}} no laboratory tests to confirm it. For diagnosis a person with documented responsiveness to medication has to increase medication intake beyond dosage needed to relieve their parkinsonian symptoms in a pathological addiction-like pattern. A current mood disorder (depression, anxiety, hypomanic state or euphoria), behavioral disorder (excessive gambling, shopping or sexual tendency, aggression, or social isolation) or an altered perception <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> medication also have to be present. A questionnaire on the typical symptoms of DDS has also been developed and can help in the diagnosis process.|$|E
25|$|HPV is most {{commonly}} transmitted through penetrative sex. While HPV {{can also be}} transmitted via non-penetrative sexual activity, it is less transmissible than via penetrative sex. There is conflicting evidence <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> condoms on transmission of low-risk HPV. Some {{studies have suggested that}} they are effective at reducing transmission. Other studies suggest that condoms are not effective at preventing transmission of the low-risk HPV variants that cause genital warts. The effect of condoms on HPV transmission may also be gender-dependent; {{there is some evidence that}} condoms are more effective at preventing infection of males than of females.|$|E
25|$|Concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> {{the continual}} {{maternal}} criticism on Victoria's psychological health, Baron von Stockmar asked Prince Albert {{to intervene and}} ask the Queen to moderate her demands. However, the Baron was unable to reduce the attacks that the princess suffered from the Russophilic and Anglophobic circles of the Berlin court. For most of the 19th century, Russia and Britain were not just geopolitical rivals in Asia, but also ideological opponents as many in both nations believed autocratic Russia and democratic Britain were destined to battle each for world domination. In Prussia, the Junkers tended to see {{much in common with}} the ordered society of Imperial Russia, and disliked British democracy.

On arrival in New York the neutral Spanish owners of part of Concords cargo of wine sued Florye Charretton and Ordronaux for the loss of their property and the 190 or so pages of court documents that have survived in the US archives provide much information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> privateering on mercantile trade in this period.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that it was {{responsible}} for their own home, the Cornishes grew concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> quarrying on the Highlands. The mass of Bull Hill was not enough to prevent them from feeling the vibrations when explosives were used to loosen stone at the quarry on the mountain's other side. In 1936 Cornish offered to donate the entire estate to the state for use as a park upon his death to prevent it from being used for quarrying. Robert Moses, the state parks commissioner at the time, rejected the offer as Cornish had already put in place deed restrictions that would have forbidden any commercial exploitation of the property, and in any event he considered the land too rugged and unsuited to the intensive use the parks he had developed were intended for.|$|E
25|$|The Cochrane review {{suggests}} cannabinoids {{be reserved}} for people with symptoms that are not controllable by other means, who have been evaluated by EEG-video monitoring to confirm diagnosis, and {{are not eligible for}} better established treatments such as surgery and neurostimulation. A second review described four placebo-controlled trials of cannabadiol including 48 people with a disease that was not manageable by other means. Three out of four trials reported some reduction in seizures, but no comparison with placebo was possible due to the small {{number of people in the}} trials. The drugs were well tolerated. A third review found that no reliable conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> cannabis on epilepsy could be drawn due to the poor quality of available data, but further research may be warranted because of the good safety profile observed in small clinical trials.|$|E

25|$|Eisenhower {{had warned}} Eden {{not to do}} it, saying the American people would never approve of a {{military}} solution to the crisis. He threatened to use financial pressure unless the British withdrew from Egypt. Eden had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} World War II, and was forced to bow to American pressure to withdraw. Eden had poor staff support because the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office, and Colonial Office had been slow to realize the need for change in Britain's world role. After Suez they started to heed Treasury warnings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> high defence expenditure on the economy, and the slow growth of the British population compared with the United States and the Soviet Union. Historians often use the crisis to mark the end of Britain's status as a superpower, being able to act and control international affairs without assistance or coalition.|$|E
25|$|With {{the failure}} to {{establish}} a political consensus after the January 1910 general election, the Liberals called a second general election in December. The Conservative leadership decided that a good test of {{the popularity of the}} tariff reform programme would be to have a prominent tariff reformer stand for election in a disputed seat. They considered Law a prime candidate, and after debating it for a month he guardedly agreed, enthusiastic about the idea but worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> a defeat on the Party. Law was selected as the candidate for Manchester North West, and became drawn into party debates about how strong a tariff reform policy should be put in their manifesto. Law personally felt that duties on foodstuffs should be excluded, something agreed to by Alexander Acland-Hood, Edward Carson and others {{at a meeting of the}} Constitutional Club on 8 November 1910, but they failed to reach a consensus and the idea of including or excluding food duties continued to be something that divided the party.|$|E
25|$|The Red Flag riots {{occurred}} {{as a result}} of a number of changes within Australian society at the time. By 1918 there had been a growing anti-war and trade union movement. Additionally, {{as a result of}} the 1917 Russian revolution and the subsequent Brest–Litovsk Treaty in March 1918, there was a climate of mistrust and fear within maintstream Australia towards the Russian community and a concern that certain elements might attempt to institute a similar type of revolution in Australia. These fears were compounded by increased industrial action and an almost xenophobic fear of non Anglo-Australians, which was in part due to the tensions caused by the war, but also partly due to the prevailing national psyche at the time. As a result of these fears, and concerns within the government <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the trade union movement upon wartime production, the War Precautions Act had increasingly been used to settle labour disputes and although in some cases it could be seen that this was necessary to maintain wartime production, there were others that saw it as an attempt to suppress the trade unions.|$|E
