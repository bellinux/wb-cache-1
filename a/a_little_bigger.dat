The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models look <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bigger</b> than their 1977–79 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little.|$|E

Powell said that [...] "It's quite interesting to have two people's viewpoints within the same song. I'm not sure how many bands actually do that. In most bands, the guitarist writes the music and the singer writes the lyrics. We tend to share things out more evenly." [...] He also criticised the attachment of an indie pop label to the band, saying [...] "We're seen as one of the indie bands. But we've always just tried to make pop music. Even if it is pop music with a hard edge and quite a twisted little view of life. We've always seen ourselves as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bigger</b> than an indie band." ...|$|E

50|$|We {{have learned}} a lot from {{experience}} about how to handle some of the ways we fool ourselves.

40|$|Antipoverty {{movements}} have generated many little or near basic income guarantee (BIG) proposals. Most theorists discussing BIG posit a full-fledged universal grant that entirely satisfies the core value guiding their theory. Debates are conducted about feasibility, desirability and rival values. This article looks into particular considerations {{that need to}} be made when debating <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>BIG.</b> If <b>a</b> status value, meaning all or nothing, is the core value under debate, then a grant falling short of securing this status will need some other justification. If the core value is scalar, meaning there can be more or less of it, then a lower grant can be justified if it is an efficient way to add to that value. I offer two reasons that <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>BIG</b> can have merit: 1. Organizations will benefit because the grant provides a clear target for citizen action. 2. There are reasons to think that a BIG of whatever size will promote organizational capabilities more efficiently than money coming from an employer, family member or conditional public entitlement. ...|$|R
