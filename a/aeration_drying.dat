40|$|The Brazil-nut, {{also known}} as Para-nut, is widely used as food and in {{cosmetic}} industries. The seeds are rich in lipids and protein, and also present {{a considerable amount of}} selenium. Limited research has been conducted on postharvest of the Brazil nut, being an important information to design equipment related to <b>aeration,</b> <b>drying,</b> storage and transportation steps. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine the physical properties of the Brazil-nut with and without tegument. The dimensions found for the almonds with tegument were 39. 35 mm in the X axis, 24. 19 mm in the Y axis, and 17. 88 mm in the Z axis. However for the almond without tegument the values were 31. 05 mm in X, 14. 38 in Y and 15. 91 mm in Z axis. The sphericity was 66. 40 % and 51. 59 % for the kernels with and without seed tegument respectively. The kernels with and without tegument presented sphericity of 63. 00 % and 47. 72 % respectively. The mass of 1000 almonds was 6. 13 kg for almond with teguments and 3. 18 kg for almonds without teguments. Specific mass of 0. 947 g. cm- 3 and 1. 003 g. cm- 3 for the kernels with and without tegument, coupled with a porosity of 46. 88 % and 37. 60 % and, resulting on a bulk density of 0. 504 g. cm- 3 and 0. 626 g. cm- 3 for almonds with and without teguments respectively. Finally, the angle of repose for the kernels with teguments was 36. 37 °. 201...|$|E

Vigna angularis (Azuki), V. unguiculata (Cowpea) and V. radiata (Mungbean) were cultivated using Kimura A solution at pH 6. 5 with aeration and non-aeration. Measurement was determined at 30 days after transplanting. Aeration condition had effect to Vigna species with non-aeration had significantly greater height and leaf area than with aeration while the reverse results were got for the root length and leaf number.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and to compare the performance of three aeration strategies for stored corn as for occurrence of molds and electrical conductivity of grain: continuous aeration; night aeration and aeration under equilibrium moisture content conditions between the grains and the ambient air. Two tests of <b>aeration</b> with <b>dry</b> corn grain (11 % w. b.) and wet corn (17 % w. b.) were done. Grain samples were taken during testing for counting of molds and measuring of electrical conductivity of grains. Wet corn stored had increased incidence of molds more than dry corn stored. It was observed that the Fusarium spp. showed higher scores, Penicillium spp. showed development and Aspergillus spp. occurred with lesser frequency. Aeration strategies employed did not affect the electrical conductivity of corn stored because there was no significant difference in electrical conductivity values between the aerated grain and non-aerated grains...|$|R
40|$|An {{axisymmetric}} {{finite element}} model was developed {{that takes into account}} the heat, mass, and momentum transfer that occurs in upright corrugated steel storage structures due to conduction, diffusion, and natural convection. Periods of <b>aeration,</b> <b>dry</b> matter loss distribution, and maize weevil density in corn were estimated. Heat and mass balances were used to calculate the temperature and relative humidity in the headspace and plenum assuming permeable grain surfaces. Two seasons of pilot bin experiments validated the model. The average standard error between the experimental and predicted temperatures was 2. 4 °C (1. 8 to 3. 1 °C range) and the moisture content was 1. 0 percentage point. Non-aerated, automatic ambient aeration, and automatic chilled aeration were evaluated in the replicated pilot bins as alternative methods to control insect development during summer storage. Ambient and chilled aeration reduced development of red flour beetles and maize weevils by 34 % and 70 % over non-aerated storage, respectively. Two locations were investigated (Indianapolis, IN and Minneapolis, MN) to demonstrate the application of the model to control insects in conventionally sized steel bins that were cooled during the fall and winter. The non-aerated and ambient aerated strategies behaved similarly until late summer when the maize weevil density increased dramatically in the non-aerated bins. Chilled aeration controlled maize weevil density at its initial population, but at an energy consumption of fourteen to sixteen times greater than ambient aeration. The simulation results indicated that automatic aeration increased the average bin temperature relative to non-aerated storage, which negated most of the benefits observed in the pilot bins. An optimal scenario includes ambient aeration during the fall, winter, and early spring with non-aerated storage during the summer. Moisture “migration” in the traditional sense did not occur in a cooled grain mass stored into the summer. Instead a more realistic theory of moisture exchange between the grain mass and headspace and plenum was developed. Permeability had a major influence on the magnitude of moisture accumulation. Moisture accumulation occurred primarily due to natural convection currents that entered and exited the headspace, which can be minimized by proper ventilation. ...|$|R

30|$|In this study, the {{processes}} of harvesting of seeds and oil extraction methods were developed and optimized. Brebra is a name given to Millettia ferruginea in Amharic. This Amharic name was literally inherited from behavior of the mechanism of seed dispersal nature, which is the seed mechanically dispersed about 20 meters in average far from the tree in explosive manner. This nature of seed dispersal mechanism poses a problem for seed harvesting. To overcome harvesting problem, the matured pale yellow pods were collected from the tree and covered with teff straw for {{certain period of time}} to accomplish its maturity. After maturation, the pods were put into a fiber sac to facilitate <b>aeration</b> and <b>dried</b> there in the sac and lastly released seeds collected in the sac. Fiber sac can provide free ventilation of air in order to avoid deterioration of seed quality by fungi. This method was originally adopted from the society. It is well known that Millettia ferruginea contains a chemical compound that is found to be toxic for fish is known as rotenone (Dagne et al. 1990), which is widely used by the society for fishing. The society was collected the seeds and pods of the tree for fishing by the method already mentioned above.|$|R

40|$|Samples of Various {{industrial}} or {{pilot plant}} spray-dried materials {{were obtained from}} manufacturers together with details of drying conditions and feed concentrations. The samples were subjected to qualitative and semi-quantitative examination to identify structural and morphological features. The results were related to measured bulk physical properties and to drying conditions. Single particles were produced in a convective drying process Analogous to spray drying, in which different solids or mixtures of solids were dried from solutions, slurries or pastes as single suspended droplets. The localized chemical and physical structures were analysed {{and in some cases}} the retention of volatiles monitored. The results were related to experimental conditions, viz.; air temperature, initial solids concentration and the degree of feed aeration. Three distinct categories of particle morphology were identified, i. e.; crystalline, skin-forming and agglomerate. Each category is evidence of a characteristic drying behaviour which is dependent on initial solids concentration. the degree of feed <b>aeration,</b> and <b>drying</b> temperature. Powder flow ability, particle and bulk density, particle-size, particle friability, and the retention of volatiles bear a direct relationship to morphological structure. Morphologies of multicomponent mixtures were complex, but the respective migration rates of the solutes were dependent on drying temperature. Gas-film heat and SDSS transfer coefficients of single pure liquid droplets were also measured over a temperature range of 50 •C to 200 •C under forced convection. Balanced transfer rates were obtained attributed to droplet instability or oscillation within the airflow, demonstrated in associated work with single free-flight droplets. The results are of relevance to drier optimisation and to the optimisation of product characteristics, e. g.; particle strength and essential volatiles-retention, in convective drying...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{temporal}} variability of the conditions for the microbial oxidation of methane in landfill cover soils and their driving variables, gas composition at non-emissive and strongly emissive locations (hotspots) was monitored on a seasonal, daily and hourly time scale on an old, unlined landfill in northern Germany. Our study showed {{that the impact of}} the various environmental factors varied with the mode of gas transport and with the time scale considered. At non-emissive sites, governed by diffusive gas transport, soil gas composition was subject to a pronounced seasonal variation. A high extent of aeration, low methane concentrations and a high ratio of CO(2) to CH(4) were found across the entire depth of the soil cover during the warm and dry period, whereas in the cool and moist period aeration was less and landfill gas migrated further upward. Statistically, variation in soil gas composition was best explained by the variation in soil temperature. At locations dominated by advective gas transport and showing considerable emissions of methane, this pattern was far less pronounced with only little increase in the extent of <b>aeration</b> during <b>drier</b> periods. Here, the change of barometric pressure was found to impact soil gas composition. On a daily scale under constant conditions of temperature, gas transport at both types of locations was strongly impacted by the change in soil moisture. On an hourly scale, under constant conditions of temperature and moisture, gas migration was impacted most by the change in barometric pressure. It was shown that at diffusion-dominated sites complete methane oxidation was achieved even under adverse wintry conditions, whereas at hotspots, even under favorable dry and warm conditions, aerobic biological activity can be limited to the upper crust of the soil.

40|$|Extra virgin {{avocado oil}} (EVAO) is {{extracted}} from avocado fruit with minimal processing. It contains {{a wide range}} of non-lipid compounds that have a profound affect on oil stability. The deterioration of oil quality is due to autoxidation and photooxidation reactions that occur during oil storage. The objectives of this research were to determine the effect of prooxidant factors (light, temperature, oxygen level) on oil oxidation and quality; make recommendations for oil processing and packaging procedures to minimise oxidation; predict the shelf life of the oil and to determine the effect of commercial antioxidants on oil oxidation. An accelerated oxidation reactor was developed to test the effects of fluorescent light, elevated temperature and varying oxygen levels on the peroxide value (PV) (initially 0. 96 ± 0. 03 meq/kg oil) and chlorophyll content (initially 16. 2 ± 0. 1 ppm) of EVAO. The production and packaging processes of Olivado NZ. were analysed for exposure to oxidation promoting factors. EVAO was exposed to dark storage at 50 °C and 60 °C in order to determine Q 10 values for oil oxidation. Several commercial antioxidants were evaluated by examining their affect on EVAO using the Rancimat oil stability index analysis and hot air oven testing. It was found that fluorescent light at 4500 lux and <b>aeration</b> with <b>dry</b> air strongly accelerated the oxidation (determined by PV) and reduced the chlorophyll content of EVAO. The average effect of 4500 lux fluorescent light compared to 0 lux over seven hours was a PV increase of 4. 5 ± 1. 4 meq/kg oil and decrease in chlorophyll content by 0. 9 ± 0. 3 ppm. The average effect of aerated EVAO compared to EVAO stored at ambient oxygen levels over seven hours was a PV increase of 3. 5 ± 1. 7 meq/kg oil and a chlorophyll content decrease of 0. 3 ± 0. 2 ppm. Exposure to an elevated temperature of 60 °C for seven hours did not cause a significant increase in PV. Recommendations were made to minimise the exposure of the oil to light, aeration, water and fruit sediment during production and packaging in order to minimise oxidation of the oil. Due to the breakdown of natural antioxidants and alternative side reactions that occurred at elevated test temperatures but not at ambient temperatures, the shelf life of the oil could not be defined. EVAO containing ascorbyl palmitate at a level of 100 ppm had a peroxide value 80 % less than control EVAO with no antioxidants after 500 hours storage at 60 °C. Ascorbyl palmitate has GRAS status and was concluded to be the most effective antioxidant of those tested in EVAO...|$|R

The studies demonstrate {{that there is a}} gradual process of an increase of the number of components, which virtually exclude the significance of positive results of self-purification by natural way, in water mass of transformed riverine systems. Spontaneous fluctuation of water level, which is caused by volumes of daily discharges, often instantly changes water levels on spawning areas. Fertilized fish eggs is periodically flooded or periodically <b>dried,</b> <b>aeration</b> regime changes that results in mass fish kills at different stages and phases of embryogenesis. Ecological situation of transformed hydroecosystems demonstrates coupling of negative effect of hydrological regime autostaticity in time and space, deterioration of water chemical composition. There is a permanent trend of saturation of water with components, which are not natural that results in doubtfulness of effective reproduction puts in question the possibility of stable state of valuable commercial fish stocks. At the same time, transformed water areas of riverine hydroecosystems have high bioproductive potential, which having its own food resource, is ineffectively transformed into food base for valuable commercial fish species. Against the background of noted changes, the considered water areas lost their suitability of providing effective reproduction. As a consequence, primary valuable fish species form low-yield generations and this is reflected on qualitative indices of commercial fishing. There was found a permanent trend of sufficiently fast change of the ratio of valuable and low-valuable species in favor of low-valuable ones. Originality.
