5000|$|<b>Assigned</b> <b>risk</b> means {{a driver}} of a motor vehicle, or {{a class of}} such drivers, who would be denied {{insurance}} coverage by insurance companies, but are required to be covered under U.S. state law.

5000|$|A {{common problem}} with <b>assigned</b> <b>risk</b> {{is that some}} states' <b>assigned</b> <b>risk</b> plans only provide {{coverage}} for that state, causing businesses whose employees travel to other states to have various issues, including {{but not limited to}} the possibility of an uncovered claim from an employee claiming another state's benefits. If unable to secure a voluntary policy providing multiple state coverage, it is always possible to purchase a separate state's Worker's Compensation fund or NCCI <b>assigned</b> <b>risk</b> to fill the coverage gap, but this can be unfairly cost inefficient as some payroll is inevitably rated for in more than one policy - causing the premium to be much higher than if a voluntary coverage had been obtained.|$|E

40|$|Electronic version {{does not}} contain {{associated}} previously published materialDespite there being pragmatic national guidelines for <b>assigning</b> <b>risk</b> to women with {{a family history of}} breast cancer, the evidence base is still sparse. There are three major questions: First, how can an assignment of "low" risk be made most efficiently? Second, what are the actual outcomes for higher-risk women enrolled in special surveillance programmes? Third, what are {{the costs and benefits of}} current management of members of breast cancer families? My thesis reviews the evolution of clinical services for familial breast cancer and the existing literature in the field. I describe the gathering of information from the service records of the Tayside Breast Cancer Family History Clinic and from specific research exercises that involved collaboration with other centres in the UK and abroad. My findings are as follows: 1. Histories provided by the families are not sufficient to <b>assign</b> <b>risk</b> accurately. They must be extended and verified from other records by clinical geneticists. Women <b>assigned</b> a low <b>risk</b> can be informed by post, but some may require further support. The 2004 NICE guidelines for <b>assigning</b> <b>risk</b> are fairly accurate, but may under-estimate it for some women aged 45 [...] 55 years. 2. Annual screening of young women at increased risk results in detection of most cancers at a curable stage. Women who carry BRCA 1 mutations fare less well, even when tumours are detected at an apparently early stage. 3. Costs of accurate risk assessment are outweighed by savings from the better targeting of surveillance programmes. Early cancer detection in young women enrolled in these programmes achieves a substantial gain in life expectancy at a cost of £ 3, 700 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Prophylactic surgery for carriers of BRCA 1 mutations is highly cost-effective. The thesis concludes with a discussion as to how these findings might be extended and clinical practice improved in the future...|$|R

50|$|Several {{states in}} the U.S. have such <b>assigned</b> <b>risk</b> systems. New York is a typical system. The MVAIC, or Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnity Company, may assign high-risk drivers, and pays for victims of uninsured or underinsured motorists.

40|$|AbstractHealth care {{practitioners}} {{utilize the}} United States-Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) pregnancy categorization (A, B, C, D, X) for making {{decision on the}} appropriateness of certain medications during pregnancy. Many non US-FDA approved medications are registered and marketed in Saudi Arabia. However, these medications {{do not have an}} <b>assigned</b> pregnancy <b>risk</b> categorization like those approved in the US. The objective of this review is to evaluate, report, and categorize the foetal risk associated with non-US-FDA approved medications registered by the Saudi Food and Drug Authority (S-FDA) according to the US-FDA pregnancy risk categorization system. We identified 109 non-US-FDA approved medications in the Saudi National Formulary (SNF) as of October 2007. We searched for data on functional or anatomical birth defects or embryocidal-associated risk using different databases and references. An algorithm for risk assessment was used to determine a pregnancy risk category for each medication. Out of 93 eligible medications, 73 % were <b>assigned</b> category <b>risk</b> C, 10 medications (11 %) were <b>assigned</b> category <b>risk</b> D, and 12 medications (13 %) were <b>assigned</b> category <b>risk</b> B. Only three medications were judged to be safe during pregnancy based on the available evidence and were <b>assigned</b> category <b>risk</b> A. Inconsistencies in defining and reporting the foetal risk category among different drug regulatory authorities could create confusion and affect prescribing. We believe that standardization and inclusion of this information in the medication package insert is extremely important to all health care practitioners...|$|R

He considered the abolition of <b>assigned</b> <b>risk</b> for young drivers to be the highlight of his career as Commissioner. Throughout his tenure, he consistently rejected insurance rate increases, although these were overturned by appellate courts in 32 of 33 cases. This brought him into conflict with the General Assembly, which, in 1977, stripped the Commissioner's office of its rate-capping powers.|$|E
50|$|The {{focus of}} the Trike {{methodology}} is using threat models as a risk-management tool. Within this framework, threat models are used to satisfy the security auditing process. Threat models {{are based on a}} “requirements model.” The requirements model establishes the stakeholder-defined “acceptable” level of risk assigned to each asset class. Analysis of the requirements model yields a threat model form which threats are enumerated and <b>assigned</b> <b>risk</b> values. The completed threat model is used to construct a risk model based on asset, roles, actions, and calculated risk exposure.|$|E
50|$|A {{change to}} any of this {{information}} might result in a different premium being charged if the change resulted in a different actuarial class or risk level for that variable. For instance, {{a change in the}} drivers' age from 38 to 39 may not result in a different actuarial class because 38- and 39-year-old people may be in the same actuarial class. However, a change in driver age from 38 to 45 may result in a different premium because the records of the insurer indicate a difference in risk associated with those ages and, therefore, the age difference results in a change in actuarial class or <b>assigned</b> <b>risk</b> level.|$|E

The main document describes the risk binning process and the technical basis for <b>assigning</b> <b>risk</b> bins to the representative accidents involving the release of dried radioactive waste materials from the Demonstration Bulk Vitrification System (DBVS) and to the associated represented hazardous conditions. Appendices D through F provide the technical basis for <b>assigning</b> <b>risk</b> bins to the representative dried waste release accident and associated represented hazardous conditions for the Contact-Handled Transuranic Mixed (CH-TRUM) Waste Packaging Unit (WPU). The risk binning process uses {{an evaluation of the}} frequency and consequence of a given representative accident or represented hazardous condition to determine the need for safety structures, systems, and components (SSC) and technical safety requirement (TSR) -level controls. A representative accident or a represented hazardous condition is <b>assigned</b> to a <b>risk</b> bin based on the potential radiological and toxicological consequences to the public and the collocated worker. Note that the risk binning process is not applied to facility workers because credible hazardous conditions with the potential for significant facility worker consequences are considered for safety-significant SSCs and/or TSR-level controls regardless of their estimated frequency. The controls for protection of the facility workers are described in RPP- 23429 and RPP- 23479.
