40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the last}} decades animal {{production}} has considerably increased worldwide to sustain an ever-growing human population. Among <b>animal</b> <b>reared</b> <b>for</b> consumption purposes, chickens are undoubtedly {{one of the most}} successful, mainly due to their rapid growth rate. The development of broiler farming has been accompanied in recent years by a substantial attention to animal welfare. This study is aimed at assessing the effects of different housing conditions on both feed conversion ratio and mortality of male broiler flocks through a large-scale study (more than 100 million birds) involving 977 farms belonging to one major producer. For this, we evaluated nine features of the housing system using a linear model with random effect. The features were: roofing, floor, drinkers, feeders, water source, color curtain color, management, light and ventilation. A total of 3516 poultry flocks were assessed. Positive ventilation, metal and clay roof, dirt floor and owner management were shown to reduced mortality. Concrete floor, negative ventilation, blue curtains, fluorescent lightening, owner management, tap water and well water significantly improved FCR. We discuss our findings in relation with economic constraints and provide advices to encourage farmers using simple devices that will improve both production and chicken survival...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} livestock as culprits {{and victims}} of climate change. The farm animal sector {{is the single}} largest anthropogenic user of land, contributing to many environmental problems, including global warming and climate change. It is now an established fact that livestock are largely responsible for climate change through belching, flatulence, degradation of plant covers that act as carbon sink. It is estimated that this sector caused 37 % methane emission and 9 % of carbon dioxide (Co 2) output and that it also used 8 % of the world‟s water.

The paper further emphasizes that climate change cause water shortages due to rainfall decrease and shift in timing of rainfall which could be very important to livestock because animals have varying water needs for their and development. Also, climate change has the potential to increase several vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. These are evidences to show that farm animals are also victims of global warming and climate change.

Strontium chloride produced narrow bright bands only at concentrations of 2, 880 [mg x [l. sup. - 1] and 24 h exposure. Calcein markings produced fluorescent bands detectable in all treatments (50 and 100 mg x [l. sup. - 1], 3 and 6 h) whereas alizarin red only yielded irregular bands with 50 - 100 mg x [l. sup. - 1] and 6 h exposure. Our results show that growth rates of C. concholepas are significantly affected by the stains factor: Strontium chloride showed the lowest growth rates whereas that of alizarin red and calcein was similar to the control group. High concentrations of strontium chloride negatively affected (P < 0. 05) the body condition of the gastropod. Although no statistical differences were found, BCI of M. donacium followed the same trend as observed for C. concholepas.
