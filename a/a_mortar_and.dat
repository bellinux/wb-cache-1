5|$|Among the {{agricultural}} activities practised {{during the dry}} season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: palm oil and palm wine. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in <b>a</b> <b>mortar,</b> <b>and</b> boiled by women.|$|E
5|$|By day six, 22 September, {{the battle}} {{had settled into}} a routine of mortaring and small probing attacks at times {{supported}} by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of {{the pressure on the}} division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them. The following day began in a similar way to previous days with <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company who were all defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, food and water shortages also took their toll on the men, with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire. On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force. This broke up most assaults before they got started.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} day, Grodno was finally cleared of Polish troops. The 27th Brigade had lost two burned and 12 damaged BT-7 light tanks in the battle, some to Molotov cocktails thrown by the {{defenders}} from attics and trenches, and its casualties totaled 19 killed and 26 wounded. The 20th Brigade lost a BA-10 to Molotov cocktails, suffering casualties of 3 killed and 20 wounded. The 16th Rifle Corps' motorized detachment lost 25 killed, 110 wounded, and a burned tank. During the battle, the corps killed 320 officers, 20 non-commissioned officers, and 194 soldiers, {{many of whom}} were crushed by tanks {{in the eastern part of}} the city. Between 20 and 21 September, they had captured 38 Polish officers, 20 non-commissioned officers, and 1,477 enlisted men, as well as 514 rifles, 146 machine guns, <b>a</b> <b>mortar,</b> <b>and</b> an anti-aircraft gun.|$|E

5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hill led {{the rest}} of the battalion, {{approximately}} 525 strong, in some commandeered trucks towards the town of Béja, an important road and railway centre approximately forty miles from the airfield. The battalion arrived at approximately 18:00 and was welcomed by the local French garrison, 3,000 strong, which Hill persuaded to cooperate with the paratroopers; in order to give the garrison and any German observers the impression that he possessed a larger force than he actually did, Hill arranged for the battalion to march through the town several times, wearing different headgear and holding different equipment each time. A short time after the battalion entered Béja, German aircraft arrived and bombed the town, although they caused little damage and no casualties. The next day, 'S' Company was sent with a detachment of engineers to the village of Sidi N'Sir, about twenty miles away; they were to contact the local French forces, believed to be proBritish, and harass German forces. The detachment found the village and made contact with the French, who allowed them to pass through towards the town of Mateur; by nightfall the force had not reached the town, and decided to encamp for the night. At dawn a German convoy of armoured cars passed the detachment, and it was decided to set an ambush for the convoy if it returned, with anti-tank mines being laid on the road and <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> Bren guns being set up in concealed positions. When the convoy returned at approximately 10:00 the leading vehicle struck a mine and exploded, blocking the road, and the other vehicles were disabled with mortar fire, Gammon bombs and the remaining antitank mines. A number of Germans were killed and the rest taken prisoner, with two paratroopers being slightly wounded. The detachment returned to Béja with prisoners and several slightly damaged armoured cars. After the success of the ambush, Hill sent a second patrol to harass local German forces, but it was withdrawn after it encountered a larger German force that inflicted several British casualties; Béja was also bombed by Stuka divebombers, inflicting civilian casualties and destroying a number of houses.|$|E

25|$|William Gossage {{produced}} low-priced, good-quality soap {{from the}} 1850s. Robert Spear Hudson began manufacturing a soap powder in 1837, initially by grinding the soap with <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> pestle. American manufacturer Benjamin T.

William Hesketh Lever and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in Warrington in 1886 and founded what {{is still one of}} the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called Unilever. These soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale advertising campaigns.|$|E
25|$|By June 1806 Owen was a Commodore and Clyde was at The Downs, {{and in the}} Walmer Roads. On 25 August 1807, Owen sent Clydes {{boats to}} capture a French sloop near Yport. The sloop ran on shore and the boats had to come in under fire from small arms, a field piece, <b>a</b> <b>mortar,</b> <b>and</b> the guns of {{batteries}} at Fécamp. The boats succeeded in recovering the sloop Trois Soeurs, of Caen, which had been carrying Plaster of Paris, possibly to Boulogne. The exploit was free of casualties on either side.

On 1 October 1967, some Indian and Chinese {{soldiers}} had an argument over the control of a boulder at the Chola outpost in Sikkim (then a protectorate of India), triggering a fight that escalated to <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> heavy machine gun duel. On 10 October, both sides again exchanged heavy fire. While Indian forces would sustain eighty-eight troops killed in action with another 163 troops wounded, China would suffer greater casualties, with 300 killed and 450 wounded in Nathu La, as well as forty in Chola.|$|E
25|$|While the Communist {{battalion}} tied up {{the guerrilla}} regiment, 1st Company of the 27th Dac Cong Battalion infiltrated past those Royalists. Beginning at midnight 13 February, Dac Cong commandos took the major guerrilla base at Long Tieng under {{fire with a}} DK-82 recoilless rifle. This threat to the vital Royalist stronghold was diversion for another element of Dac Cong. This latter element had circled to move in from the south, headed toward the King's villa; they destroyed a 105mm howitzer near it. The Dac Cong set up <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> began shelling Long Tieng. For the first time ever, the PAVN fired 122mm and 140mm rockets at the base. The chaotic situation was not helped by Vang Pao's overnight absence in Udorn, Thailand; the Hmong partisans of L'Armee Clandestine depended upon his orders.|$|E
25|$|Charles Harrison {{was born}} about 1740 in Charles City, Virginia of parents Benjamin Harrison IV and Anne Carter. On 1 December 1775, the Virginia Convention {{authorized}} a state artillery company, including a captain, three lieutenants, one sergeant, four corporals, four bombardiers, eight gunners, and 48 matrosses. A committee appointed James Innis captain while Harrison, Edward Carrington, and Samuel Denney became lieutenants on 13 February 1776. The company {{was accepted by}} the Second Continental Congress on 19 March. A second company was formed and the French volunteer Dohickey Arundel appointed to lead it. The Frenchman was killed while test-firing <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> Innis transferred to the infantry.

The battery provided support to the 2nd Battalion of the 916th Rifle Regiment during the capture of the heights. On the night of 3 August and the morning of 4 August German troops launched a counterattack, which caught Guliyev's battery in an exposed position. The 4th Battery reportedly repulsed the counterattack at close range, inflicting heavy losses. In the battles to hold the bridgehead, the battery reportedly helped repulse fifteen counterattacks. The battery reportedly destroyed a 75mm gun battery, <b>a</b> <b>mortar,</b> <b>and</b> two heavy machine guns. They also reportedly dispersed a company of German soldiers. During these battles the battery reportedly suffered casualties of two wounded. On 17 August Guliyev was slightly wounded.|$|E
25|$|By June 1941, Taranchiev {{had joined}} the Red Army. In 1943, he {{graduated}} from the 3rd Chkalovsky Pilots Military Aviation School. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1944 and fought in combat from January of the year. He became a pilot in the 566th Attack Aviation Regiment, which was assigned to the 277th Assault Aviation Division. A month later, he had made 11 combat sorties, destroying or damaging 13 vehicles, 12 freight carriages, and a motorcycle. He also reportedly suppressed the fire of a machine gun, <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> an artillery gun, as well as killing up to 50 German soldiers.

25|$|At 3.30 am on 7 January 1942, {{in heavy}} rain, Shimada's force started <b>a</b> <b>mortar</b> <b>and</b> {{artillery}} bombardment {{on the first}} of the British positions (occupied by the 4/19th Hyderabad Regiment under Major Alan Davidson Brown, the Hyderabads commanding officer, Lt.Col Eric Wilson-Haffenden, had been wounded in an air attack earlier). The tanks began manoeuvering through the British defensive obstacles under fire from the Hyderabads, who were able to call in some artillery fire which destroyed one tank. The Hyderabads lost contact with their artillery support and without any anti-tank weapons to defend against the Japanese tanks, Ando's infantry from his 3rd Battalion, 42nd Regiment, were able to force a breach in the Hyderabads roadblock. Within fifteen minutes Japanese engineers were dismantling the road block and Ando's infantry were pushing back the Hyderabads who were now reduced to scattered groups. The infantry were immediately followed by Shimada's tanks, which easily broke through the remaining Hyderabads, scattering them into the jungle and by 4 am were headed toward the next British unit.|$|E
