5|$|Andy Hawkins lost a game on July 1, 1990 to the Chicago White Sox {{while on}} the road by the score of 4–0 without {{allowing}} <b>a</b> <b>hit.</b> Because the White Sox were winning entering the ninth inning at home, they did not bat, and thus Hawkins pitched only 8 innings, but the game was considered a no-hitter at the time. However, following rules changes in 1991, the game is no longer counted as a no-hitter. Additionally, Tom L. Hughes held the Cleveland Indians without <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> through the first nine innings of a game on August 6, 1910 but the game went into extra innings and he lost the no-hitter in the tenth inning and ultimately lost the game 5–0.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases where}} a batter indisputably gets <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> {{and is able}} to safely advance past first base on the play, the value of that hit may be {{adjusted}} by the official scorer because of an error or a fielder's choice.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E

5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult judgment call where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E
