30|$|The ATR-FTIR imaging on the priming in the {{cross-section}} from Titian’s Portrait of a Man gave two distinct FTIR spectra. One of these exhibits a complex sulphate infrared absorption band with the maximum centred around 1040  cm− 1 together with additional small sharp bands at c. 1157 and 966  cm− 1, and correlates with areas found by SEM–EDX to contain only Zn, S and O; the other, {{with a single}} broad band at c. 1060 ‒ 70  cm− 1, corresponds to areas containing some potassium in addition [23]. The spectra from the potassium-containing areas are not an exact match to published data for known potassium zinc sulphates such as K 2 Zn(SO 4) 2 · 6 H 2 O [30], and further work is needed to fully identify these species. Nevertheless similar results were obtained from two other paintings by Titian where {{it was possible to}} carry out ATR-FTIR imaging, and from the painting by François Quesnel (Table  3 and [23]). The samples from the other paintings in the table were either not suitable for ATR-FTIR imaging, or where this was possible the spectra were not sufficiently distinct. Reassessment of the SEM–EDX results did, however, confirm the presence of potassium in conjunction with the zinc sulphate in every case, at least where no potassium-containing pigments such as red lake or ultramarine were present to interfere with the analyses, including in the portrait by François Quesnel, as illustrated in Fig.  2. The source of white vitriol was the mineral goslarite (ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O), and although potassium could be present as an impurity {{it is also possible that}} it was introduced through some sort of processing before use. Zinc acts as a secondary or <b>auxiliary</b> <b>drier,</b> but it may be that its effectiveness is dependent on its preparation, since the experiments using pure zinc sulphate in the heptahydrate form published so far have shown rather variable results [31]. Comments in the historical literature also seem to indicate it might not always be reliable for this purpose. Laurie (1895, [32]) states that it is ineffective, but that the sulphate of zinc mentioned in early treatises worked as a drier because it was not pure (although he speculates that this was because manganese was present as an impurity), and Church (1915, [33]) comments that ‘Another dryer in common use is white vitriol or sulphate of zinc. Its siccative character is very slight.’ Interestingly, given the potassium content in the zinc sulphate found in paintings, Samuel Frederick Gray (1830), under the heading ‘boiled oil’ states: ‘The pure sulphate of zinc made in England has not the same drying quality as the common white vitriol imported from Germany’ [34].|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis explores {{the capabilities of}} ordnance movements into the Asian Pacific Theater. Through simulation, logistics modeling, and data analysis, this thesis identifies critical factors and capabilities {{that are important to}} the effective movement of ordnance by combat logistics ships through Guam during a military contingency. The experimental design incorporates the effects of competing requirements on the ordnance resupply process in Guam. The objective is to facilitate an evaluation of systems, identify possible improvements to fully exploit capabilities, and gain insights into the process methodology. Results indicate that the inclusion of competing requirements to the system degrades both <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Dry</b> Cargo/Ammunition Ship (T-AKE) service level and the overall throughput of the system by nearly 25 %. Analysis of critical factors contributing to this degradation indicates that the T-AKE arrival cycle is the largest contributing factor to the system's effectiveness. The results also indicate that competition is a contributor to the effects on the system, but is never the most influential aspect, and the decision of where to process ordnance is significant for the best-performing scenarios in the experiments. Lastly, the analysis clearly shows that improving the system's performance is not dependent on the distance of ordnance storage facilities from the wharf.

After completion of the necessary work, the Gold Crew took the boat out for Patrol 60, with the crew passing an ORSE. The Blue Crew then completed a refit and got underway for Patrol 61, and following this, completed a Tactical Readiness Evaluation and a Navy Technical Proficiency Inspection. By July, the Gold Crew was again on board, undertaking Patrol 62, and thereafter, conducted an unscheduled ORSE and a Tactical Readiness Evaluation. Relieving them in November, the Blue Crew, after completion of a refit, commenced Patrol 63.|$|R

5000|$|The voyage west brought {{stops at}} Guam and Subic Bay - where Abnaki {{delivered}} floating crane YD-127 - before she reentered the combat zone off Vietnam. The tug arrived at Danang {{on the last}} day of 1968. On the morning of New Year's Day 1969, she departed Danang to pick up garbage lighter YG-52 at Subic Bay. The ship arrived there on the 3rd, departed the next morning with her charge in tow, and delivered it at Danang on the 8th before heading back toward Subic Bay that same day. En route, she received orders to Naha, Okinawa, to assist in the salvage of a grounded tank landing ship. She completed that mission on 19 January, reentered Subic Bay on the 24th, and headed back toward Danang on the 29th. The ship arrived there on the 31st and, on 1 February, put to sea for a 21-day tour of duty on Yankee Station. Late in the month, she towed [...] from Camranh Bay to Yokosuka. In March, she visited Tsoying, Taiwan, to train members of the Taiwanese Navy in salvage techniques. After a liberty call at Hong Kong early in April, the ship returned to Subic Bay until late in the month. She got underway on the 26th bound for Guam with the medium <b>auxiliary</b> floating <b>dry</b> dock USS Resourceful (AFDM-5) in tow. She and her charge reached Apra Harbor on 15 May; and, on the 16th, Abnaki continued on toward Hawaii.|$|R
40|$|Vehicle payload {{benefits}} of scavenging {{hydrogen and oxygen}} propellants are addressed. The approach used is to select a vehicle and a mission and then select a scavenging system for detailed weight analysis. The Shuttle 2 vehicle on a Space Station rendezvous mission was chosen for study. The propellant scavenging system scavenges liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen from the launch propulsion tankage during orbital maneuvers and stores them in well insulated liquid accumulators {{for use in a}} cryogenic auxiliary propulsion system. The fraction of auxiliary propulsion propellant which may be scavenged for propulsive purposes is estimated to be 45. 1 percent. The <b>auxiliary</b> propulsion subsystem <b>dry</b> mass, including the proposed scavenging system, an additional 20 percent for secondary structure, an additional 5 percent for electrical service, a 10 percent weight growth margin, and 15. 4 percent propellant reserves and residuals is estimated to be 6331 kg. This study shows that the fraction of the on-orbit vehicle mass required by the auxiliary propulsion system of this Shuttle 2 vehicle using this technology is estimated to be 12. 0 percent compared to 19. 9 percent for a vehicle with an earth-storable bipropellant system. This results in a vehicle with the capability of delivering an additional 7820 kg to the Space Station...|$|R
