5|$|Horseback {{riding and}} {{mountain}} biking are popular but are only allowed on certain trails.

Fishing for salmon and steelhead, a highly prized anadromous form of rainbow trout over , is best in the Smith and Klamath rivers. A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers <b>and</b> <b>streams.</b> Hunting is not permitted anywhere in the parks, but is allowed in nearby National Forests.|$|E
5|$|Most of the salts {{dissolved}} {{in the lake}} and deposited in the desert flats around it reflect the concentration of solutes by evaporation; Lake Bonneville itself was fresh enough to support populations of fish.

5|$|The ice trade {{began in}} 1806 {{as the result}} of the efforts of Frederic Tudor, a New England entrepreneur, to export ice on a {{commercial}} basis. In New England, ice was an expensive product, consumed only by the wealthy who could afford their own ice houses. Nonetheless, icehouses were relatively common amongst the wealthier members of society by 1800, filled with ice cut, or harvested, from the frozen surface of ponds <b>and</b> <b>streams</b> on their local estates during the winter months. Around the neighbouring New York City area, the hot summers and rapidly growing economy had begun to increase local demand for ice towards the end of the 18th century, creating a small-scale market amongst farmers who sold ice from their ponds <b>and</b> <b>streams</b> to local city institutions and families. Some ships occasionally transported ice from New York and Philadelphia for sale to the southern U.S. states, in particular Charleston in South Carolina, laying it down as ballast on the trip.|$|E

5|$|Americium is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is harmful to life. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers <b>and</b> <b>streams.</b> Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria and fungi.|$|E

It lives in riverine forests, flooded forests near lakes, and near fast-flowing rivers <b>and</b> <b>streams.</b> It can traverse dry land to reach temporary pools and tolerates colder water than other species of alligator. Other common names for this species include the musky caiman, the dwarf caiman, Cuvier's caiman and the smooth-fronted caiman. It is sometimes kept in captivity as a pet and may {{be referred to as}} the wedge head caiman by the pet trade.|$|E

5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay {{at the bottom of}} a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers <b>and</b> <b>streams.</b> The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E
5|$|Giganotosaurus was {{discovered}} in the Candeleros Formation, which was deposited during the Early Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 98 to 97 million years ago, although Holtz provided an earlier lower bound for its age of 99.6 million years. This formation is the lowest unit in the Neuquén Group, wherein {{it is part of}} the Río Limay Subgroup. The formation is composed of coarse and medium-grained sandstones deposited in a fluvial environment (associated with rivers <b>and</b> <b>streams),</b> and in aeolian conditions (effected by wind). Paleosols (buried soil), siltstones, and claystones are present, some of which represent swamp conditions.|$|E
