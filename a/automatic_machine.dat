25|$|The {{long-term}} effects of the mitrailleuse's poor performance {{have been the subject}} of some dispute among historians. In Machine Guns: An Illustrated History, J. Willbanks argues that the weapon's ineffectiveness in the Franco-Prussian War resulted in long-standing opposition among European armies to adopting machine gun weapons, particularly in Continental Europe. It is true that the French Army did not adopt an <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> gun until 1897, when they chose the Hotchkiss machine gun, later to be followed by the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. The French armed forces also adopted another <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> gun, the St. Étienne Mle 1907. It has been suggested that the relative slowness displayed by the French services to adopt machine guns was the result of wariness occasioned by the failure of the mitrailleuse. There is some evidence for that suggestion, as the Maxim gun had repeatedly been tested by the French armed services ever since its inception.|$|E
25|$|The Lewis gun (or Lewis <b>{{automatic}}</b> <b>machine</b> gun or Lewis automatic rifle) is a First World War-era {{light machine}} gun of US design that was perfected and mass-produced in the United Kingdom, and widely used by British and British Empire troops during the war. With its distinctive barrel cooling shroud and top-mounted pan magazine, the Lewis served {{to the end of}} the Korean War. It was also widely used as an aircraft machine gun, almost always with the cooling shroud removed, during both world wars.|$|E
25|$|Sixteen {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Hells Angels' South Carolina Nomads chapter, which operated from clubhouses in Lexington and Rock Hill, {{were convicted of}} crimes related to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act following a two-year cooperative investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and four local police departments. The investigation revealed that the group engaged in drug dealing, money laundering, firearms trafficking, violent crimes, attempted armed robbery, arson, and other offenses. In excess of one hundred guns (including fully <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> guns, silencers, assault rifles with high-capacity magazines, pistols, and sawed-off shotguns) were trafficked by the group and recovered during the execution of search warrants, {{and members of the}} organization also supplied methamphetamine, cocaine, bath salts and prescription pain pills.|$|E

500|$|Things did improve for Churchill-Redman and {{the sales}} rose {{dramatically}} from £200,000 in 1946 to £1M by 1955. This {{was in part}} because of innovative product development at the Halifax site which ultimately produced the CR P5 and P6 profiling lathes: the conclusion of this development is described by Jeremy as being a range of [...] "fully automatic, multi-tool and profiling lathes. A lathe with an automatic feed and delivery heralded an <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> tool production line." [...] The expansion of the motor vehicle industry once again was a significant factor, driving demand for machine tools much as the bicycling boom of the 1890s had done. In 1957 the Scotswood operation moved across the River Tyne to Blaydon, where a factory was built especially for the manufacturing purpose intended. Among other products from that site was the Vertimax lathe, which used a vertical spindle and was of interest to motor vehicle manufacturers. This particular design originated from James Anderson, a garage owner in Glasgow, during the war and whose business was brought into the Churchill group of companies. Churchill Gear Machines Ltd was part of the group, having been established in Blaydon since 1956: the cause of its origin and the nature of its products is uncertain.|$|E
500|$|These {{facilities}} were updated in both World War I and World War II. From 1915 to 1919 {{the island was}} requisitioned by the Admiralty as a coastguard station. After the war the Sleemans returned to carry out farming and fishing and played host to occasional tourists. In World War II, search light batteries were built on Steep Holm. In 1940 the island's warden, Harry Cox, who had developed the island into a bird sanctuary since 1931, was appointed as a coastguard and was supported by Local Defence Volunteers from Weston-super-Mare. In 1940 and 1941 the battery was refortified by soldiers from the Indian Army Service Corps using mules to transport guns and equipment up the steep cliffs. The armament included MarkVII6-inch breech-loading guns taken from World War I naval vessels which had been scrapped, and also included Lewis <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> guns against air attack. The Garden Battery was built over two Victorian stone gun emplacements. Engineers from the Royal Pioneer Corps improved the infrastructure including importing sheep to feed the soldiers and, after a case of typhoid fever, shipping drinking water from south Wales. To enable the movement of equipment, the engineers built a new jetty. This {{was linked to the}} plateau with a cable-operated winched switchback railway using prefabricated [...] gauge lines which had been captured from the Germans in World War I. The Steep Holm batteries were also connected, by underwater telegraph cable, to the Brean Down Fort batteries, but parts of the cable were stolen for scrap after the end of World War II.|$|E

2500|$|Its {{failure to}} have much effect in the field led to a belief that rapid-fire weapons were useless. United States Army General William Babcock Hazen, who {{observed}} the war, commented that [...] "The French mitrailleuse had {{failed to live up}} to expectations. [...] The Germans hold it in great contempt, and it will hardly become a permanent military arm." [...] Strictly speaking, manually operated volley guns such as the Reffye mitrailleuse were a technological dead-end, and they were soon replaced by fully <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> guns.|$|E
2500|$|Under a {{contract}} with the U.S. Army, Colt Arms built the Model 1895 ten-barrel variant of the Gatling Gun, capable of firing 800-900 [...]30 Army rounds per minute, and used with great effect at the Battle of San Juan Hill. The M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun or [...] "Potato Digger" [...] was built by Colt. The Colt–Browning {{was one of the first}} gas-operated machine guns, originally invented by John Browning. It became the first <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> gun adopted by the United States and saw limited use by the U.S. Marine Corps at the invasion of Guantánamo Bay and by the 1st Volunteer Infantry in the Santiago campaign during the Spanish–American War. In 1901, Elizabeth Jarvis Colt sold the company to a group of outside investors based in New York and Boston.|$|E

Although more of a tugboat than a combat vessel, Hudson was equipped at Norfolk Naval Shipyard with two six-pound rapid fire guns fore and aft and a Colt <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> gun on the aft deckhouse. She also received 5/8 inch (16mm.) armor plating around the pilothouse and deckhouse. On 23 April, Hudson departed Norfolk with orders to report to the staging area for Cuban operations at Key West, Florida.

2500|$|Despite such {{improvements}} in longer-range artillery, there still remained {{a need to}} develop better short- and medium-range infantry support weapons. During the period from 1871 to the 1890s, {{a variety of new}} European- and American-designed manual machine guns were adopted by many European armies. Large numbers of Gatling guns were purchased from the United States and were used by Western European powers in colonial wars in Africa, India, and Asia. Twenty-five Gatling guns also saw active service in French hands during the Franco-Prussian war, in early 1871. They performed particularly well at an engagement at Le Mans in western France. Furthermore, the French armed services purchased, for their navy and eastern fortifications, a large number of manual, rapid fire 37mm multi-barrel guns (so-called Hotchkiss [...] "canon-revolvers") made in France after 1879 by the firm of American expatriate Benjamin B. Hotchkiss. By the 1890s however, European armies begun to retire their Gatling guns and other manual machine guns in favor of fully <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> guns, such as the Maxim gun, the Colt–Browning M1895, and, in 1897, the Hotchkiss machine gun. Such weapons became universal—and notorious—with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.|$|E
2500|$|Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) {{praised the}} novel in the 8 December 1961 issue of The Guardian: [...] "Mrs Agatha Christie is our nearest {{approach}} to perpetual motion. And {{not only does}} she never stop, but she drops {{the ball into the}} cup nearly every time; and if one is sometimes reminded of those automatic machines where one pulls a handle and out pops the finished product, that is a compliment to the <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> and not by any means a reflection on Mrs Christie. For the latest tug on the Christie handle produces a product which is not only up to the standard but even above it. The Pale Horse is in fact the best sample from this particular factory for some time, and that is saying plenty. The black magic theme is handled in a masterly and sinister fashion, and to give away what lay behind it would be unforgivable. This is a book which nobody (repeat, nobody) should miss." [...] Iles further named the novel as his favourite in the paper's Critic's choice {{for the end of the}} year, published one week later, writing that [...] "It has not been an outstanding year for crime fiction, but as usual there have been one or two first-class items. The best puzzle has certainly been Agatha Christie's The Pale Horse." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 5pm, the {{authorities}} had not delivered {{any amount of}} fuel to the A300. Yahia entered the cabin to choose a fourth person to kill. He selected {{the youngest member of}} the Air France crew, who had told the hijackers that he was an atheist. Yahia felt reluctant to kill a fourth passenger at that point, saying [...] "I don't want to do this. But I have no choice.". Burgniard stated in an interview that she did not know whether Yahia had decided not to execute the crew member; she knew that he kept delaying the execution. Instead, the hijackers opened the door and fired around the aircraft. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, recalled that the hijackers began reciting verses from the Quran on the public address system. The verses were prayers for the dead. According to Kakachi, the passengers were silent and began to feel panicked. The hijackers knew the negotiators were in the control tower, so through the side window of the cockpit, they began to fire <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> guns towards the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, who at the time was the airline's security adviser, recalled that glass shattered all around the negotiators. Captain Delhemme said that throughout the time in Marseille, there had been tension, but [...] "nothing like what seemed to be about to happen." [...] French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur allowed Favier to take whatever actions he felt were necessary; after the hijackers fired at the control tower, Favier decided to begin the raid.|$|E

2500|$|Hudson was {{assigned}} on 24 March 1898 to duty with the U.S. Navy for the Spanish–American War. On 3 April {{she arrived at}} the Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Norfolk, Virginia and was outfitted with two six-pound rapid-fire guns and a Colt <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> gun. Additionally, the pilothouse was armored with 5/8 inch (16 millimeter) steel plate. [...] On 11 May 1898 Hudson, along with the U.S. Navy warships , , and , had pursued three Spanish gunboats into the Bay of Cardenas, Cuba. [...] There, shore batteries fired on the U.S. vessels and disabled Winslow, knocking out her steering and a boiler, thereby putting Winslow adrift. [...] The accurate Spanish fire wounded Winslows commanding officer and killed Ensign Worth Bagley and three crewmen. Although under fire from the Spanish guns for over thirty minutes, the Hudson, commanded by First Lieutenant Frank H. Newcomb, sailed into the bay to save the disabled Winslow. [...] Newcomb kept Hudson positioned in shoal waters near the Winslow, until a line was passed to Winslow and made fast. Hudson then towed the Winslow out of danger. [...] During the time in the bay, both vessels continually fired on the Spanish positions. Hudson carried the bodies of those killed as well as the wounded, along with the dispatches of the squadron off Cardenas, to Havana, Cuba, arriving there on 14 May 1898. She remained there on blockade duty for a short time before departing to Key West, Florida. [...] Another period of patrol ended 10 July as she returned to the blockading fleet with further dispatches. Hudson captured two fishing vessels that attempted to run the blockade off Havana. On 17 August Hudson was returned to Treasury Department control and she then departed for Norfolk, via Key West and Savannah, and arrived there on 21 August 1898.|$|E
2500|$|On November 8, 2000, the Florida Division of Elections {{reported}} that Bush won with 48.8% {{of the vote}} in Florida, a margin of victory of 1,784 votes. The margin of victory was less than 0.5% of the votes cast, so a statutorily-mandated <b>automatic</b> <b>machine</b> recount occurred. On November 10, with the machine recount finished in all but one county, Bush's margin of victory had decreased to 327. According to legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, later analysis showed that a total of 18 counties—accounting for a quarter of all votes cast in Florida—did not carry out the legally mandated machine recount, but [...] "o one from the Gore campaign ever challenged" [...] the notion that the machine recount had been completed. Florida's election laws allow a candidate to request a county to conduct a manual recount, and Gore requested manual recounts in four Florida counties: Volusia, Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade, which are counties that traditionally vote Democratic and would be expected to garner more votes for Gore. Gore did not, however, request any recounts in counties that traditionally vote Republican. The four counties granted the request and began manual recounts. However, Florida law also required all counties to certify their election returns to the Florida Secretary of State within seven days of the election, and several of the counties conducting manual recounts did not believe they could meet this deadline. On November 14, the statutory deadline, the Florida Circuit Court ruled that the seven-day deadline was mandatory, but that the counties could amend their returns at a later date. The court also ruled that the Secretary, after [...] "considering all attendant facts and circumstances," [...] had discretion to include any late amended returns in the statewide certification. [...] Before the 5pm deadline on November 14, Volusia County completed its manual recount and certified its results. At 5pm on November 14, Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris announced that she had received the certified returns from all 67 counties, while Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade counties were still conducting manual recounts.|$|E
