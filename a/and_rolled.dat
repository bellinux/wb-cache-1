5|$|Employees of ANA {{believed}} the container had last {{been used to}} drain fuel from the cross-feed drain cock, the fuel cock that serves the pipe in the wing centre-section for cross-feeding of fuel from tanks in one wing to engines in the other wing.

With the cross-feed selector valves closed, little fuel ran out when the drain cock was opened. Some employees believed that because no fuel was running out neither the staff member nor anyone else noticed the drain cock was still open. Due either to the wind or the slipstream from Amana's propellers as it began to taxi prior to take-off, the almost-empty container was blown over <b>and</b> <b>rolled</b> some distance along the apron where it was found the next morning.|$|E
5|$|MD32 was {{constructed}} {{as the original}} state road from West Friendship north to Westminster and from Westminster west to Taneytown in the early 1910s.

The portion of MD32 from Glenelg to US1 in Savage was built as MD106 in the 1920s and early 1930s. MD32 was extended south from West Friendship and assumed all of MD106 in the mid-1940s. In the mid-1950s, the section of MD32 from Westminster west to Emmitsburg was renumbered {{as an extension of}} MD97. MD 32 would later be restored to its old route through Westminster and west toward Taneytown when MD97, which is now MD140 west of Westminster, was relocated in the early 1960s.

5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes {{some of the}} sap, essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances {{the taste of the}} tea. The strips of tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded <b>and</b> <b>rolled</b> into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E
