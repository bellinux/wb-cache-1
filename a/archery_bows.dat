The Turkish composite bow, made of wood, horn, sinew and glue {{is one of the}} most famous and powerful bows in the world. Because of its high draw weight and mechanical efficiency, the Turkish composite bow became a powerful weapon in the Seljuk and the Ottoman empire. In addition to being a powerful weapon of war, at the same time the bow and arrow (archery) continued to be a sport of Ottoman (sultans, state officials, janissaries) until the late Ottoman period. In this study of the Ottoman composite <b>archery</b> <b>bows</b> in the collections of Izmir Ethnography Museum, a small wood sample was investigated on the basis of its wood anatomy. The results showed that it was made of maple wood (Acer sp.) and some of its qualitative and quantitative anatomical properties are presented here.

Helical thickenings in vessel elements in cutting surfaces of maple-wooden core increase the bonding surface between the wood and sinew-horn. In most of the woods preferred traditionally for bow-making, helical thickenings in tracheids, vessel elements or ground tissue fibres should be taken into account at a hierarchy of cellular structures for elucidating the efficiency of Ottoman composite-wooden bow...|$|E
40|$|In {{terms of}} Archer, {{it has been}} a well known sport worldwide. Basically, a bow {{consists}} of 3 main parts which is the riser, limb and the string. In improving the performance of the bow, it is crucial to research each and every part of the bow. There are many mathematical modelling has been done to improve the performance of the bow but only few analysis and experiments are done. Therefore, the objective of the study is to analyse the <b>Archery</b> <b>Bow</b> using Finite Element Method and to develop the <b>Archery</b> <b>Bow.</b> Two different methods were used before fabricating the bow which is to analyse the stress and strain of the bow drawn in CAD software using FEM software and to test experimentally using the strain gauge method. Validation between the results was used as a reference for fabrication. The best material was chosen by doing a simulation analysis on the composite materials which shows that E fibreglass have the best properties compared to the other fibreglass. Therefore, as for the results, E fibreglass is used to fabricate the limb of the bow so that it will be highly in strength and also in elasticity which is up to 72. 4 GPa. The results shows that the fabricated bow have a lower strain which are 0. 00244 compared to the current bow which is 0. 004694. This shows that the fabricated bow have a higher potential to withstand much higher force compared to the current bow which makes the new bow to have a better quality. As for the error analysis, it shows that the higher force applied to the bows makes the error to increase to the increase in vibration and the damping force...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study is to develop and optimized new design of bow based on the current design used in the competition. It leads to the comparison of the previous and the optimized designs have been developed. The bow was simulated under static and maximum condition of bow using finite element analysis software. During shooting an arrow, full draw stage is the most critical point of shooting and sustains the maximum load applied on the bow. In this analysis, the maximum draw length was considered is 660 mm and 710 mm which exerted in two different forces behaviour. Modelling software was performed 3 D image <b>archery</b> <b>bow</b> before analyzing in commercial finite element software. Aluminium alloy 6061 T 6 was applied for the material properties similar to the current bow, in order to optimise the designs that have been proposed in the first place. Furthermore, isotropic material and the tetrahedral meshing element were selected for acceptable results. The results reveal that the current design can sustain both set of forces with maximal deflection of 0. 29 mm with factor of safety (FOS) is 10. 6. Hence, to optimize the design, the material was removed about 16 % from the total mass to get the final weight approximately 0. 92 kg. However, this method will increase the maximum deflection and reduced the FOS to the optimum number. Then, the optimum design was fabricated using 3 -axis CNC machining to compared with the previous design. This approach considered the basic method of design to reduce the time and cost taken in fabricating products.

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Most {{improvements}} and re-designs of compound bows apparently use or partly apply empirical methods to determine bow performance characteristics. A kineto-elastic analysis procedure of a compound bow which in {{each side of}} the limbs has two stacked eccentric cams connected by two inextensible cables and one inextensible string is presented in this thesis. With the principle of finite element method, a large deformation cantilever beam model was created by combining small deflections of segmented cantilever beam elements to determine the trajectories of limbs, end points where the cams are installed. A quasi-static model was constructed to simulate the draw process. The displacements of cams, cables and string were analyzed and the required draw force as a function of draw length was obtained by gradually drawing the bow string. A commercial finite element analysis software was employed to verify the precision of the elastic limb model. The other arbitrary cam system was simulated by the revised kineto-elastic model. Three cases of optimal cam profile designs were studied by this integral model. Several design variables were discussed in the optimization to accomplish three different objectives, which are interesting to archers. The modeling, simulation and optimization procedure used for combining elastic components, flexible but inextensible string-cable components, and rigid component in a precision dynamic model of a mechanical system can also be applied to <b>archery</b> <b>bows</b> with more complex configuration, and to other similar mechanical systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Increasing {{demands for}} Pacific yew bark, {{a source of}} an anticancer agent, have {{generated}} interest in defining the yew resource and in exploring strategies to conserve this species. The distribution, riparian requirements and ecosystem functions of yew populations in coastal and inland forests of northern California are outlined and alternative approaches to conserving this resource are identified. Efforts to obtain additional information on genetic diversity of yew populations and to insure careful management of the species are essential {{for the protection of}} this resource. selective harvesting of the Pacific yew in California, Oregon and Washington. In 1988, 60, 000 pounds of bark were harvested from 12, 000 trees in western Oregon; another harvest of the same magnitude is scheduled for 1989 (C. Bolsinger, personal communication). This paper briefly outlines the current status of the Pacific yew as a facultative component of riparian forest communities in northern California and other Western states, and addresses questions that bear on possible strategies to conserve the yew resource without intervening with ongoing cancer research. Yews represent a genetic resource at risk. At least three species–the English yew (T. baccata), Florida yew (Taxus floridana), and Pacific yew (T. brevifolia) – have evolved an unique assemblage of characteristics that confer upon these trees and shrubs unprecedented vulnerability. The English yew, native to Europe, north Africa and parts of the Middle East, was valued for centuries as a strategic resource. The Florida yew, restricted to bluffs and ravines on the eastern bank of the Apalachicola River in northern Florida (Sargent 1961), is classified as a rare and endangered conifer (Barnes 1983). Now the survival of Pacific yew populations in western states may be threatened by the discovery that yew bark is an important source of an antitumor drug. The yew has the longest tradition as a protected tree. In the 15 th century, English yew populations were severely depleted; their fine-grained elastic wood was valued for <b>archery</b> <b>bows.</b> Laws mandating protection of this species date from 1423, (Szafer, W. 1965, cited in Bialobok, 1975).
