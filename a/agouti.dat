5|$|Evolutionary {{developmental}} biology ('Evo Devo') has assembled evidence from embryology and genetics {{to show how}} evolution has acted at all scales from the whole organism down to individual genes, proteins and genetic switches. In the case of countershaded mammals with dark (often brownish) upper parts and lighter (often buff or whitish) under parts, {{such as in the}} house mouse, it is the <b>Agouti</b> gene which creates the difference in shading. <b>Agouti</b> encodes for a protein, the <b>Agouti</b> signalling peptide (ASP), which specifically inhibits the action of the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). In the absence of the <b>Agouti</b> protein, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone stimulates the cells bearing MC1R, melanocytes, to produce dark eumelanin, colouring the skin and fur dark brown or black. In the presence of the <b>Agouti</b> protein, the same system produces the lighter-coloured, yellow or red phaeomelanin. A genetic switch active in the cells of the embryo that will become the belly skin causes the <b>Agouti</b> gene to become active there, creating the countershading seen in adult mammals.|$|E
5|$|While some pet rats {{retain the}} <b>agouti</b> {{coloring}} {{of the wild}} brown rat (three tones on the same hair), others have solid colors (a single color on each hair), a trait derived from rats with black coats. Agouti-based colors include <b>agouti,</b> cinnamon, and fawn. Black-based colors include black, beige, and chocolate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Agouti</b> {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the <b>agouti</b> carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the <b>agouti</b> fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-tailed {{squirrels}} {{and flying}} squirrels, although not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The <b>agouti</b> is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} {{have revealed that}} the diet of the inhabitants of Motul de San José included dogs (Canis familiaris), turtles including pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) and Mesoamerican river turtles (Dermatemys mawii), freshwater snails (mostly Pomacea flagellata but also jute snails (Pachychilus spp.)), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red brocket (Mazama americana, a species of small deer), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), lowland pacas (Cuniculus paca), Central American <b>agouti</b> (Dasyprocta punctata) and nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus). Only the dog had been domesticated by the Late Classic Maya so the majority of protein in the diet of the inhabitants came from hunting and fishing within the catchment area around the city. The most common food animals were the white-tailed deer, river clam and river turtle. Some animal remains were recovered that were clearly associated with elite status occupation, {{such as those of}} the jaguar, the ocelot or other small feline and the crocodile (crocodilus spp.). These latter three appear more related to ritual and economic activity than nutritional needs. Freshwater snails were more an ingredient in the diet of lower status families while deer remains were associated with the elite residents of the city.|$|E
5|$|Most mammals have <b>agouti</b> hair, {{with each}} {{individual}} hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to {{two different types}} of melanin pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.|$|E

25|$|Dasyprocta punctata - Central American <b>agouti,</b> a Central and South American <b>agouti</b> {{introduced}} {{to both the}} Cayman Islands and Cuba.|$|E
25|$|Dasyprocta leporina, an {{introduced}} northern South American <b>agouti.</b> The subspecies on Grenada is D. l. albida. An unidentified <b>agouti</b> {{has been}} recorded from archeological deposits on Carriacou.|$|E
25|$|Dasyprocta leporina, an {{introduced}} northern South American <b>agouti.</b> The subspecies on Saint Kitts is D. l. noblei. This <b>agouti</b> {{has also}} been round in an archeological site.|$|E
25|$|This {{theory was}} {{discarded}} when the equine <b>Agouti</b> gene (ASIP) was sequenced in 2001, and all horses fitting the seal brown phenotype did not possess the homozygous recessive a/a <b>Agouti</b> genotype.|$|E
25|$|Human-directed {{artificial}} selection in fancy mice {{has created a}} variety of colors and patterns. These include black, chocolate, blue, white, cream, lilac, red, fawn, champagne, cinnamon, golden <b>agouti,</b> silver <b>agouti,</b> silver and dove. Depending on the club the standards may differ slightly.|$|E
25|$|Dasyprocta punctata, an <b>agouti</b> {{that was}} {{introduced}} to the island.|$|E
25|$|Dasyprocta leporina, an {{introduced}} <b>agouti.</b> It {{has been}} recorded only from an archeological site.|$|E

25|$|Dasyprocta ruatanica, an <b>agouti</b> {{known only}} from Roatán in the Bay Islands. It resembles the {{mainland}} Dasyprocta punctata, but is smaller.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} {{of black and}} pangaré was dismissed {{as the cause of}} brown in 2001, when a French research team published Mutations in the <b>agouti</b> (ASIP), the extension (MC1R), and the brown (TYRP1) loci and their association to coat color phenotypes in horses (Equus caballus). This study used a DNA test to identify the recessive a allele on the <b>Agouti</b> locus, and found that none of the horses fitting the phenotype of seal brown were homozygous for the a allele.|$|E
25|$|Dasyprocta leporina, an {{introduced}} northern South American <b>agouti.</b> The subspecies on Guadeloupe is D. l. noblei. It {{has also}} been recorded from archeological deposits.|$|E
25|$|The Rainforest – Full of naturalistic {{exhibits}} {{this area}} boasts tarantulas, <b>agouti,</b> and primate species namely; spider monkeys, siamang gibbons, Bolivian squirrel monkeys and capybara.|$|E
25|$|Dasyprocta leporina, a South American <b>agouti</b> {{introduced}} {{over much}} of the Lesser Antilles. The Virgin Islands population derives from a Brazilian form of D. leporina.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, if a horse {{does not}} possess a functional, {{dominant}} {{copy of the}} A-allele at the <b>Agouti</b> locus, then Asip cannot be produced. Without Asip, eumelanin is unregulated and the coat is wholly black. The regulation of black pigment, though, is dependent on its presence in the first place; a horse with the recessive <b>Agouti</b> genotype aa is indistinguishable from any other genotype in a horse with a eumelanin-free coat. When eumelanin is present, it is restricted in varying degrees {{by the action of}} Asip.|$|E
25|$|Dasyprocta leporina, a {{northern}} South American <b>agouti.</b> It was recorded {{on the basis}} of remains from several archeological sites ranging in age from 100 BCE to 1200 CE.|$|E
25|$|Dasyprocta leporina, an <b>agouti</b> from {{northern}} South America that occurs on Trinidad, {{as well as}} on Tobago; it has also been introduced to much of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
25|$|A {{long-haired}} mutation, a grey <b>agouti</b> or chinchilla mutation, white spotting, {{and possibly}} a dilute mutation have also appeared in Shaw's jirds, and white spotting and a dilute mutation have shown up in Bushy-tailed Jirds.|$|E
25|$|Epigenetic {{changes can}} occur in {{response}} to environmental exposure—for example, mice given some dietary supplements have epigenetic changes affecting expression of the <b>agouti</b> gene, which affects their fur color, weight, and propensity to develop cancer.|$|E
25|$|They {{include the}} tufted {{capuchin}} (Sapajus apella), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), red brocket (Mazama americana), Azara's <b>agouti</b> (Dasyprocta azarae), dusky-legged guan (Penelope obscura), the frog Vitreorana uranoscopa and snakes such as Bothrops neuwiedi and Spilotes pullatus.|$|E
25|$|An early {{version of}} the currently-accepted equine <b>Agouti</b> gene theory was first {{presented}} in 1951 by Miguel Odriozola in A los colores del caballo, subsequently reviewed by William Ernest Castle in Genetics. This theory prevailed until the 1990s, when discoveries of similar conditions in other species provided alternate explanations.|$|E
25|$|In the {{southeast}} corner of the zoo are enclosures housing assorted animals including bush dogs, red pandas, southern pudu, dusky pademelons, Azara's <b>agouti,</b> Red-Billed Blue Magpies and the wetland bird nursery. The former cassowary exhibit next to the pademelons is currently empty. The pademelons are set to move to Islands in 2018.|$|E
25|$|Agoutis, {{members of}} a {{mainland}} American hystricognath genus that is also indigenous to some Caribbean islands, have also been widely introduced, resulting, among others, {{in the presence of}} the red-rumped <b>agouti</b> (Dasyprocta leporina) on most of the Lesser Antilles. Several other hystricognaths have also been introduced in parts of the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|However, a {{recessive}} black gene also {{occurs in}} a few domestic dog breeds (notably in all black German Shepherds, but also in some black Border Collies, Australian Shepherds, and Belgian Shepherds). This recessive allele is a recessive allele in the <b>Agouti</b> gene in dogs (R96C arginine to cysteine mutation at codon 96).|$|E
25|$|Among the fauna {{that can}} be {{observed}} on the páramo are Andean condor, black <b>agouti,</b> eastern cottontail, frogs, mountain paca, spectacled bear, white-tailed deer. The spectacled bear is very rare and possibly extinct. The white tailed deer, the main ingredient of the diet of the Muisca and pre-Muisca, has been extensively hunted and captured over time.|$|E
25|$|The Working Kelpie {{comes in}} three coat types: smooth, short, and rough. The coat can be almost every colour from black through light tan or cream. Some Kelpies have a white blaze on the chest, {{and a few}} have white points. Kelpies {{sometimes}} have a double coat, which sheds out in spring in temperate climates. <b>Agouti</b> is not unusual, and can look like a double coat.|$|E
25|$|The A and At alleles {{cannot be}} {{distinguished}} by DNA testing. a test had been developed, but the underlying studies were not peer-reviewed {{and the test}} was pulled from the market due to inconsistent results Equine geneticists have mapped ASIP and found only two forms, dominant A and recessive a. While {{there may be a}} genetic reason behind the seal bay or brown and wild bay phenotypes, the cause is not located at <b>Agouti.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common fauna in the APA include spiders such as tarantulas, Brazilian {{wandering}} spiders, recluse spiders and Sibynomorphus mikanii; snakes such {{as water}} snakes, Coral snakes, false corals, Bothrops jararaca, boa constrictors, anacondas, Corallus hortulanus, Oxybelis fulgidus, Chironius and Sibynomorphus mikanii; amphibians such as Hylomantis granulosa, Rhinella, Leptodactylus labyrinthicus and Tropidurus semitaeniatus, reptiles such as iguana and spectacled caiman; primates such as robust capuchin monkeys, common squirrel monkey, pale-throated sloth; and other mammals such as coatis, paca, common <b>agouti</b> and capybara.|$|E
