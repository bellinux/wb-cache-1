It was extended southerly in 1931 into the city of Ludington to US10. There was a new alignment closer to the lakeshore opened in early 1933. The northern end was extended in late 1935 to encompass the Big Sable River bridge. The last change to the routing was made in 1998 when US10 was shifted to follow James Street instead of William Street to the car ferry docks. At that time, M-116 was extended east along Ludington Avenue to end at James Street.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{enclosures}} {{accounted for}} about 4.5 million acres {{of what had been}} open fields, not counting the enclosure of common land and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; {{by the end of the}} enclosure process, almost <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.|$|E
5|$|The dispute {{concerned}} property bequeathed in {{the will}} of Alfred's father, Æthelwulf. This does not survive, but Alfred described some of its provisions in a preamble to his own will. Æthelwulf had left property jointly to three of his four surviving sons, Æthelbald, Æthelred and Alfred, stipulating that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be inherited by the brother who lived the longest. When Æthelred inherited the throne in 865, Alfred asked for the property to be divided between them. Æthelred refused, offering instead to leave it to Alfred on his death, together with any further property he acquired, and Alfred agreed. The Viking invasion of Wessex, {{and the need to}} provide for their children, led to a revision of the terms. Under an agreement in late 870 or early 871, the survivor was still to keep the property bequeathed jointly to the three brothers, but he would give his brother's children any lands which he had received separately from his father, and any he had acquired later.|$|E

McElroy struck the nearly completed light carrier , delaying her launch until November. Six schools and an army hospital were also hit. Japanese officials reported the two aircraft whose crews were captured had struck their targets.|$|E
25|$|After the verdict, the {{question}} was how to collect. The former monarchy of Iran had {{billions of dollars in}} assets within the United States that were frozen after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. However, in order to secure an end to the Iranian Hostage Crisis, the assets were unfrozen and most if not <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> collected by 1982 due to the Iran–Iraq War. Rhode Island attorney David J. Strachman, along with other attorneys, representing the plaintiffs, found that the late Shah had purchased a home in Lubbock, Texas for his son, which was sold for $400,000;. After that, they attempted to go after assets of Iranians who had previously worked for the former monarchy, but the U.S. courts would overturn all their attempts to seize their assets, as they were not found to be liable for the damages. They then went after Iranian-owned objects held by U.S. museums in Illinois, Massachusetts and Michigan. The Oriental Institute and its holdings from Persepolis became a primary target. Strachman said collectors are interested in the antiquities, potentially for tens of millions of dollars.|$|E

500|$|While the Paraguayans were {{familiar}} with the ground, maps of the territory were, for the Allies, non-existent. [...] The area lay in the province of Ñeembucú, which is flat, low-lying and obscured by swamp or carrizal. [...] For example, when they established their main camp at Tuyutí in southern Paraguay the Allies did not realise they were placing it within earshot of the southwestern line of the Quadrilateral: the Sauce trench. They did not even know Humaitá was protected by the Quadrilateral: In his 5-volume work on the Paraguayan war the Brazilian historian Tasso Fragoso insists that a Brazilian high command letter of April 1867 does not leave the slightest doubt that the allies were completely ignorant not only of the topography of the terrain , but that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> protected by lines of [...] entrenchments.|$|E
500|$|In 1643 {{a general}} {{obligation}} was imposed on Oxford colleges {{to support the}} Royalist cause in the English Civil War.

In the same year the College was assessed at £1 of the weekly sum of £40 charged on the colleges and halls for the fortification of the city. When the Oxford Parliament was assembled during the Civil War in 1644, Oriel housed the Executive Committee of the Privy Council, Parliament being held at neighbouring Christ Church. Following {{the defeat of the}} Royalist cause, the University was scrutinised by the Parliamentarians, and five of the eighteen Oriel Fellows were removed. The Visitors, on their own authority, elected Fellows between 1648 and October 1652, when without reference to the Commissioners, John Washbourne was chosen; the autonomy of the College in this respect seems to have been restored.|$|E
500|$|Kaiapit did {{not become}} an {{important}} airbase. By the time engineering surveys of the area had been completed, as {{a direct consequence of}} the victory at Kaiapit, Dougherty's men had captured Gusap. There, the engineers found a well-drained area with soil conditions suitable for the construction of all-weather airstrips, an unobstructed air approach and a pleasant climate. It was therefore decided to limit construction at the swampy and malarial Kaiapit and concentrate on Gusap, where the US 871st, 872nd and 875th Airborne Aviation Engineer Battalions constructed ten airstrips and numerous facilities. Although some equipment was carried on the trek overland, most had to be flown in and nearly <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worn out by the time the work was completed. The first P-40 Kittyhawk fighter squadron began operating from Gusap in November and an all-weather fighter runway was completed in January 1944.

500|$|... "Mannenberg" [...] has a [...] "lilting melody" [...] with a [...] "gentle, {{hypnotic}} groove". The song {{has been}} described {{as an example of the}} use of purely musical techniques to convey subversive messages. The piece has no lyrics, but drew on a number of aspects of black South African culture, including church music, jazz, marabi, and blues, to create a piece that conveyed a sense of freedom and cultural identity. It includes a saxophone solo by Coetzee, whose role in the song earned him his nickname [...] "Manenberg". During the recording, the piano played by Ibrahim had thumbtacks attached to the hammers; the instrument thus had a [...] "metallic timbre" [...] that was generally associated with marabi music. Jazz pianist Moses Molelekwa would later state that [...] "Mannenberg" [...] was [...] "a dance song, a party song [...] most of the jazz that was coming out at that period." [...] Commentator John Edwin Mason would write that [...] "It had an irresistible hook—its beautiful melody. It was driven by an infectious, danceable beat." [...] The popularity of the piece was also attributed to the fact that it contained elements of many musical styles, thus sounding familiar to a large number of listeners: the groove of the piece incorporated elements of marabi, the beat was similar to that of ticky-draai, and the saxophone melody drew from langarm, while <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> based on a [...] "underlying aesthetic" [...] of jazz. The piece also had similarities to [...] "Jackpot", a 1960 mbaqanga tune by Zacks Nkosi, who believed that [...] "Mannenberg" [...] was a rip-off of his piece. The various African genres that were incorporated into the song came from the Coloured and the black communities of the country. Ibrahim stated that to the musicians the piece was an [...] "affirmation... that our inherent culture is valid." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scholars {{who accept}} the general {{scenario}} of Indo-European migrations follow Gimbutas in her {{observation that the}} transition was probably more gradual than suggested by Gimbutas.
