5|$|Walton {{was a slow}} worker, {{painstakingly}} perfectionist, and his complete body of work <b>across</b> <b>his</b> {{long career}} is not large. His most popular compositions continue to be frequently performed in the twenty-first century, and by 2010 almost all his works had been released on CD.|$|E
5|$|Craig Conway as Sol, Kane's son and {{the leader}} of the marauders. He has a {{biohazard}} sign tattooed on his back and a large scar <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest. Even though he is Kane's son, he distanced himself from him and formed his own army. He was a young child in the original 2008 quarantine.|$|E

The coffins was very much broken, an' we could see 'im as clear us I can see you. When we first looked in I saw 'im lying quite plain--a short thick figure of a man--with <b>'is</b> 'ands <b>across</b> <b>'is</b> chest. And then, just as we looked at 'im, 'e crumbled in, as you might say, <b>across</b> <b>'is</b> breast bone, an' just quietly settled down into a 'uddle of dust.

5|$|During oral {{argument}} before the Court, Scalia asked more questions and made more comments {{than any other}} justice—and a 2005 study found that he provoked laughter more often {{than any of his}} colleagues did. His goal during {{oral argument}}s was to get <b>across</b> <b>his</b> position to the other justices.|$|E
5|$|In general, Greece {{enjoyed a}} period of peace and {{prosperity}} during Alexander's campaign in Asia. Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade <b>across</b> <b>his</b> empire. However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's manpower, greatly weakening it {{in the years after}} Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC).|$|E
5|$|Morales had {{not taken}} {{a leading role in}} these protests, but did use them to get <b>across</b> <b>his</b> message that the MAS was not a single-issue party, and that rather than simply {{fighting}} for the rights of the cocalero it was arguing for structural change to the political system and a redefinition of citizenship in Bolivia.|$|E

5|$|Nandanar {{entered the}} holy fire {{chanting}} {{the name of}} Shiva and reappeared in a new purified form. He looked like a Brahmin sage, wearing matted hair (characteristic of a Shaiva) and the sacred thread worn by Brahmins <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest. His body was smeared with sacred ash. The gods showered flowers on the Nayanar from heaven and the Brahmins cheered. With the Brahmins, Nandanar went in the garbhagriha and saw Nataraja. The Nayanar disappeared {{in the image of}} Nataraja and became one with Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} of a powerful and alert patriarch. The painting is set at a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid <b>across</b> <b>his</b> upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was on {{the line}} in the {{encounter}} between the champions, America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), and Kid Kash and Lance Hoyt. The match ended when America's Most Wanted performed their finishing maneuver the Death Sentence, which saw Storm wrap his arms around Hoyt and squeeze tightly while Harris jumped off the top turnbuckle and performed a legdrop <b>across</b> <b>his</b> neck and head. America's Most Wanted followed by covering Hoyt to retain the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

5|$|Zampanò {{makes his}} living as an {{itinerant}} street performer, entertaining crowds by breaking an iron chain bound tightly <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chest, then passing the hat for tips. In short order, Gelsomina's naïve and antic nature emerges, with Zampanò's brutish methods presenting a callous foil. He teaches {{her to play}} the snare drum and trumpet, dance a bit, and clown for the audience. Despite her willingness to please, he relies on intimidation and even cruelty at times to maintain his domination.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the DNC speech, another case of {{shingles}} left scars <b>across</b> <b>his</b> head; within weeks he was hospitalized with cryptosporidiosis causing cryptococcal meningitis. At noon on August 15, 1984, exactly a month after his DNC speech and after 2 days on life support in intensive care, Campbell died at San Francisco General Hospital when his blood pressure dropped rapidly. His parents and his partner Bobby Hilliard were by his side. Campbell was 32 years old and had lived for over 3½ years with what was, by then, called AIDS.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} flashbacks reveals that an oracle had foretold that {{the demise of}} Olympus would come not by the revenge of the Titans, who had been imprisoned after the Great War, but by a marked warrior. The Olympians Zeus and Ares {{believed}} this warrior to be Deimos, the brother of Kratos, due to his strange birthmarks. Ares interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos, with Athena on hand, and kidnapped Deimos. Kratos attempted to stop Ares, but was swept aside and subsequently scarred <b>across</b> <b>his</b> right eye by the Olympian. Athena stopped Ares from killing Kratos, knowing his eventual destiny. Taken to Death's Domain, Deimos was imprisoned and tortured by Thanatos. In honor of his sibling, Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo, identical to his brother's birthmark.|$|E

5|$|After his selection, Hextall {{remained}} with Brandon for two further seasons. He played 44games in 1982–83, recording a GAA of 5.77 during {{a season in}} which the Wheat Kings did not qualify for the playoffs. The following year was his most successful in the WHL: a GAA of 4.29 <b>across</b> <b>his</b> 46regular season games, which included 29wins – {{more than in the}} previous two seasons combined. He played in ten of the twelve playoff games, recording five wins and five losses, with a GAA of 3.75. During the 1983–84 season, Hextall set a record for the most penalty minutes accumulated by a goaltender, being assessed for 117 minutes during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception as the time of day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood <b>across</b> <b>his</b> nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{tried to}} {{maintain}} a sophisticated household that combined hunting and drinking with cosmopolitan literary discussion and courtly values. Nonetheless, Henry's passion was for hunting, for which the court became famous. Henry {{had a number of}} preferred royal hunting lodges and apartments <b>across</b> <b>his</b> lands, and invested heavily in his royal castles, both for their practical utility as fortresses, and as symbols of royal power and prestige. The court was relatively formal in its style and language, possibly because Henry was attempting to compensate for his own sudden rise to power and relatively humble origins as the son of a count. He opposed the holding of tournaments, probably because of the security risk that such gatherings of armed knights posed in peacetime.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with the Church varied considerably <b>across</b> <b>his</b> lands and over time: as with other aspects of his rule, there was no attempt to form a common ecclesiastical policy. Insofar as Henry had a policy it was to generally push back on papal influence, increasing his own local authority. The 12th century saw a reforming movement within the Church, however, advocating greater autonomy from royal authority for the clergy and more influence for the papacy. This trend had already caused tensions in England, for example when King Stephen forced Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, into exile in 1152. There were also long-running concerns over the legal treatment {{of members of the}} clergy.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, thirteen-year-old Indiana Jones is {{horseback riding}} with his Boy Scout troop at Arches National Park in Utah. While {{scouting}} caves, Indy discovers {{a group of}} grave robbers who have found a golden crucifix belonging to Coronado and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum. The men give chase through a passing circus train, leaving Indy with a bloody cut <b>across</b> <b>his</b> chin from a bullwhip and a new phobia of snakes. Indy escapes, but the local sheriff makes him return the cross to the robbers. Impressed with Indy's bravery, {{the leader of the}} robbers gives Indy his fedora, and encourages him to not give up.|$|E
5|$|Merrick's {{condition}} gradually deteriorated {{during his}} {{four years at}} the London Hospital. He required {{a great deal of}} care from the nursing staff and spent much of his time in bed, or sitting in his quarters, with diminishing energy. His facial deformities continued to grow and his head became even more enlarged. He died on 11 April 1890, at the age of 27. At around 3:00p.m., Treves's house surgeon visited Merrick and found him lying dead <b>across</b> <b>his</b> bed. His body was formally identified by his uncle, Charles Merrick. An inquest was held on 15 April by Wynne Edwin Baxter, who had come to notoriety conducting inquests for the Whitechapel murders of 1888.|$|E
