5000|$|Even when {{we ignore}} {{possible}} world semantics {{and stick to}} axiomatic systems, this peculiar feature holds. With K and N (the Distribution Rule and the Knowledge Generalization Rule, respectively), which are axioms that are minimally true of all normal modal logics, we can prove that we know all the logical consequences of our beliefs. If [...] is a logical consequence of , then we can derive [...] with N and the conditional proof and then [...] with K. When we translate this into epistemic terms, this says that if [...] is a logical consequence of , then <b>a</b> <b>knows</b> that it is, and if <b>a</b> <b>knows</b> , <b>a</b> <b>knows</b> [...] That is to say, <b>a</b> <b>knows</b> all the logical consequences of every proposition. This is necessarily true of all classical modal logics. But then, for example, if <b>a</b> <b>knows</b> that prime numbers are divisible only by themselves and the number one, then <b>a</b> <b>knows</b> that 8683317618811886495518194401279999999 is prime (since this number is only divisible by itself and the number one). That is to say, under the modal interpretation of knowledge, when <b>a</b> <b>knows</b> {{the definition of a}} prime number, <b>a</b> <b>knows</b> that this number is prime. It should be clear at this point that a is not human. This shows that epistemic modal logic is an idealized account of knowledge, and explains objective, rather than subjective knowledge (if anything).|$|R

5|$|Although many natural toxins are {{secondary}} metabolites, these poisons {{also include}} peptides and proteins. An {{example of a}} toxic peptide is alpha-amanitin, which is found in relatives of the death cap mushroom. This is a potent enzyme inhibitor, in this case preventing the RNA polymerase II enzyme from transcribing DNA. The algal toxin microcystin is also a peptide and is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases. This toxin can contaminate water supplies after algal blooms and is <b>a</b> <b>known</b> carcinogen that can also cause acute liver hemorrhage and death at higher doses.|$|E

Twelve different isotopes of bohrium have been reported with atomic masses 260–262, 264–267, 270–272, 274, and 278, one of which, bohrium-262, has <b>a</b> <b>known</b> metastable state.

Information uploaded to these databases can be used to track gun crimes and to link crimes together. Maintainers of these databases recommend that every recovered firearm be test fired and the resulting known exemplar be uploaded into the database.|$|E
