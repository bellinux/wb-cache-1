2500|$|The WTO oversees {{about 60}} {{different}} agreements {{which have the}} status of international legal texts. Member countries must sign and ratify all WTO agreements on accession. A discussion {{of some of the}} most important agreements follows. The <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Agriculture</b> came into effect with the establishment of the WTO at the beginning of 1995. The AoA has three central concepts, or [...] "pillars": domestic support, market access and export subsidies. The General Agreement on Trade in Services was created to extend the multilateral trading system to service sector, in the same way as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) provided such a system for merchandise trade. The agreement entered into force in January 1995. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights sets down minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP) regulation. It was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1994.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Almost {{every country}} is {{spending}} {{a large proportion}} of its income on agricultural subsidies; still the agricultural farmers of developing countries are unable to compete globally. There is increase in dependence on food imports, and a decline in food self-reliance. The aim and objectives {{of this study is to}} highlight the multiplex nature and enormity of the trade externalities of agricultural subsidies. Approach: To understand the issues and process clearly, reference has been made to GATT <b>Agreements,</b> WTO <b>Agreements</b> <b>on</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and Subsidies, policies of different countries in this regard, scholarly writings on the subject and the cases related to it. Doctrinaire methodology, which includes analytical, descriptive and comparative method, has been followed in this study. Results: Agricultural subsidies are cardinal facet of agriculture and have a major role to play in international trade. Even after separate <b>Agreements</b> <b>on</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and Subsidies, the World Trade Organization still failed in minimizing agricultural subsidies.

The analysis also reveals that agricultural protection levels increase when market conditions are unfavorable to agriculture, and in countries with a comparative disadvantage in agriculture. The post-UR dummy variables suggest that the Uruguay Round <b>agreements</b> <b>on</b> <b>agriculture</b> have not decreased international agricultural protection levels.

40|$|It is a {{fact that}} the {{unilateral}} trade liberalization of 1986 did not produce any sustainable impact on the development of agriculture in Nigeria. It is however, not clear whether the Uruguay Round <b>Agreements</b> <b>on</b> <b>Agriculture</b> (URAA) and the optimism of the Doha Round and its Agenda (DRA) has done any better. Even then Nigeria’s external trade has been conducted within the framework of neutrality or open trade, consistent with the WTO provisions.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the environment within which West African countries are designing their regional self-reliance food security strategy following the Uruguay Round <b>Agreements</b> <b>on</b> <b>Agriculture</b> (URAA). The self-reliance strategy combines regionally-coordinated domestic food production with food imports. Three {{aspects of the}} URAA-food security linkages were emphasized in this study. First, while the regional model may increase efficiency in regional food production and distribution systems, it may also restrain the flexibility and/or the effectiveness of using tariff protection when needed. Second, a formal test of structural change in food availability suggests {{that there have been}} increases in average per capita food supply in the post-URAA period. Third, under a scenario of URAA-led increases in food prices, food access may be weakened in West African net-food purchasing households, even when regional food production responded to price incentives. Besides the macro linkages emphasized in this study, microeconomic and anthropometric linkages between food security and URAA are equally important and should be addressed in subsequent studies.

40|$|The Uruguay Round <b>agreements</b> <b>on</b> <b>agriculture</b> were {{intended}} to move member countries toward a fair and market-oriented agricultural trading system. By progressively reducing domestic government support and export subsidies, converting nontariff barriers to tariffs, and reducing barriers to market access, members were committed to reducing distortions in world agricultural trade and in preventing new distortions from arising. But state trading enterprises with monopoly power or exclusive rights in agricultural trade in major products are still prevalent in both industrial and developing countries. In many countries, the operations of these state trading agencies tend in practice to nullify the intended objectives of the concessions on market access reached in the Uruguay Round. And there are still significant price distortions in trade in products subject to state trading.

40|$|Because of the <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> <b>Agriculture’s</b> (AoA) Article 13, {{dubbed the}} “Peace Clause,” the challengeability of {{agricultural}} subsidies has been limited; Article 13 {{had the power}} to prevent several types of legal challenges. The Peace Clause has expired, and now many agricultural subsidies can be challenged under substantive provisions of the General <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994) and the <b>Agreement</b> <b>on</b> Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement). However, there has been some uncertainty, because the new arrangement of agricultural subsidies’ challengeability is being defined by the interpretation and correlation of three different WTO agreements. This study verified, using a two-pronged method, that there is no conflict among the GATT 1994, the SCM Agreement and the AoA, and for this reason, they have to be applied together to regulate agricultural subsidies. This does not mean that all SCM Agreement provisions are automatically applied to agricultural subsidies, with a consequent free ride for challenges to agricultural subsidies. A successful challenge still has to overcome the SCM Agreement’s higher thresholds for challengeability compared with those of the GATT 1994 period. This condemnation became more difficult after the implementation of the WTO. Consequently, the goals established in the AoA of substantial and progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection still have to be accomplished...|$|R
