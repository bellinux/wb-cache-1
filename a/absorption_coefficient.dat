5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E
25|$|EXAFS spectra are {{displayed}} as graphs of the <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{of a given}} material versus energy, typically in a 500 – 1000 eV range beginning before an absorption edge of an element in the sample. The x-ray <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> is usually normalized to unit step height. This is done by regressing a line to the region {{before and after the}} absorption edge, subtracting the pre-edge line from the entire data set and dividing by the absorption step height, which is determined by the difference between the pre-edge and post-edge lines at the value of E0 (on the absorption edge).|$|E
25|$|Nd:YAG lasers are {{frequently}} {{used to build}} optical tweezers for biological applications. This is because Nd:YAG lasers mostly emit at a wavelength of 1064nm. Biological samples have a low <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> at this wavelength, as biological samples are usually mostly made up of water.|$|E
40|$|Based on the Schrödinger {{equation}} for envelope {{function in}} the effective mass approximation, linear and nonlinear optical <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> in a multi-subband lens quantum dot are investigated. The effects of quantum dot size on the interband and intraband transitions energy are also analyzed. The finite element method {{is used to calculate}} the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Strain and In-mole-fraction effects are also studied, and the results reveal that with the decrease of the In-mole fraction, the amplitudes of linear and nonlinear <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> increase. The present computed results show that the <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> of transitions between the first excited states are stronger than those of the ground states. In addition, it has been found that the quantum dot size affects the amplitudes and peak positions of linear and nonlinear <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> while the incident optical intensity strongly affects the nonlinear <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients...</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{absorption}} spectroscopy of cylindrical flames or plumes, the forward Abel transform is the integrated absorbance along a ray with closest distance y {{from the center}} of the flame, while the inverse Abel transform gives the local <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> at a distance r from the center. Abel transform is limited to applications with axially symmetric geometries. For more general asymmetrical cases, more general-oriented reconstruction algorithms such as Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART), Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM), Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) algorithms should be employed.|$|E
500|$|Brode {{graduated}} from Whitman College with his Bachelor of Science degree in 1921, and then entered the California Institute of Technology. He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in physics in 1924, {{the first year}} in which Caltech awarded this degree, for his thesis on [...] "the <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> for slow electrons in gases". He showed that molecules with similar arrangements of their external electrons have similar cross sections for collisions with slow electrons. These results could not be readily explained with classical physics, and their importance would not be realised until 1966.|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{was born}} to Emory Fortson and Rosa Lee (née Wright) Boyd on July 18, 1906 in Tignall, Georgia, a small town near the eastern border {{of the state of}} Georgia. He had two brothers, John and Ellis, and a sister, Sophia. In 1927, he {{received}} a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Georgia, where {{he was a member of}} the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. In 1928, he received a Master of Arts in mathematics from Duke University. From 1928 to 1930, Boyd was an instructor of physics at the University of Georgia. He entered graduate school at Yale University in 1930, and was a graduate assistant there from 1930–1931 and a Loomis Fellow from 1931–1933. He received his PhD in physics from Yale in 1933, with a thesis entitled Scattering of X-Rays by Cold-Worked and by Annealed Beryllium. In his thesis, Boyd described the effects of reflecting radiation through samples of powdered, cold-worked and annealed beryllium with differing particle sizes. The experiment showed that beryllium crystals are [...] "rather imperfect", that annealing caused [...] "no appreciable change" [...] in beryllium's lattice structure, and that the mass <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of beryllium found in the experiment was reasonably close to the theoretical value calculated using Compton's empirical formula.|$|E

40|$|The {{apparent}} spectral <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the H_ 20 infrared {{bands in}} the vicinity of 2 · 7 µ were measured in a shock tube behind reflected shock waves in an Ar-H_ 20 mixture. By interrupting an infrared beam at a 60 kc rate and projecting this beam across the shock tube to a monochromator, it was possible to measure simultaneously both emission and absorption of H_ 20 at 1000 °K. The spectral <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> obtained from emission measurements averaged 9 · 8 per cent higher than <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> obtained from <b>absorption</b> measurements, probably due to experimental errors (smaller than usually encountered in shock tube measurements). At 1933 °K experimental difficulties precluded simultaneous measurement of infrared emission and absorption, so measurements were restricted to emission. The apparent <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> were integrated to give the integrated <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the collection of bands near 2 · 7 µ. Integrated <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> were 49 · 8 cm^(- 2) atm^(- 1), 54 · 7 cm^(- 2) atm^(- 1), and 31 · 6 cm^(- 2) atm^(- 1) for absorption at 1000 °K, emission at 1000 °K, and emission at 1933 °K, respectively. The two values at 1000 °K were in good agreement with those of Goldstein, who made no measurements above this temperature...|$|R
