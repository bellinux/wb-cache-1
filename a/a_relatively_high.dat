5|$|Hurricane Michael of the 2000 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season caused moderate damage in Atlantic Canada.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} of pressure drop and leakage in the refrigerant circuit, a novel continuous adsorption system suited to use low heat source (75 - 85 o C) was designed and set up. To analyze and compare with the conventional system to reveal the similarity and difference, this paper sets up the mathematical models for these two systems. The adsorbers, condensers and evaporators in these two systems are exactly the same and the two systems are compared by working at the identical conditions, which is not feasible in real experimental lab. All the parameters and models used in this calculation are based on experimental results. Analysis demonstrates that the two kinds of system have very close performances, that is, the novel system has <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> cooling capacity while the conventional system has <b>a</b> <b>relatively</b> <b>higher</b> COP...|$|R
