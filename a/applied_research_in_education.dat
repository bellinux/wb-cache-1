40|$|Abstract and Outline of Paper Presented at European Association for Research on Learning and Instruction, August 2007. This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} research and development projects into teaching and learning practices in Higher Education which have been undertaken at the University of Cambridge {{under the auspices of the}} Pedagogy Programme of the Cambridge-MIT Institute (CMI). These have involved a collaboration between groups of staff and students in participating departments and a team of education researchers based at the Centre for <b>Applied</b> <b>Research</b> <b>in</b> <b>Education</b> Technologies (CARET). We describe the evolution, over a period of about two years, of an organisation (CARET), of research processes, of educational practices and resources, and of roles and relationships of researchers and participants. Most critically there has been a negotiation of norms and expectations on the part of participants and the legitmization of discourses in a shared 'problem space'. The research and development process can be conceptualised as one of 'co-configuration' with continual renegotiation of requirements and solutions. Roles and approaches have developed as researchers have gained better understanding of the priorities and 'ways of thinking and practicing' of other participants and those participants have in turn become familiar with the techniques and theoretical perspectives of education researchers. The importance of 'boundary-crossing' objects which provide points of focus for discourse and development is discussed, and what these might be in the context of education research and development projects. The paper concludes with a description of a new initiative informed by this view {{of research and development}} as co-configuration: the Teaching for Learning Network (TfLN), designed to support further pedagogical interventions across a variety of disciplines and institutions...|$|E
40|$|This <b>applied</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>education</b> was {{undertaken}} {{within the context}} of a school mentoring programme, where my role as a mentor researcher is directed at promoting change in teacher pedagogy consistent with junior-high school educational reforms in Israel. The purpose of this study has been twofold: 1) to confront conflicting issues that exist between the need for change in teacher pedagogy and the resistance felt by many of them toward ‘never ending’ new reforms and: 2). to investigate the impact of the mentoring model (MM) on learning processes that foster teacher empowerment. Assessment of empowerment, as both a process and a product, drew on the teachers' metacognitive development, growing sense of satisfaction and self-efficacy as mediators of their pupils' thinking/learning skills. This study presents a unique approach to teacher empowerment through its theoretical and methodological perspectives. Socio-cultural perspectives serve as an over-arching framework through which various theoretical perspectives for learning and development may be integrated. Action research and discourse analysis were found to be compatible with the researcher’s philosophical approach, whereby educators engage in a collaborative learning process that promotes shared visions and goals. Promoting the characteristics of a learning organisation within the school shed light on ways that can provide teachers with a nurturing environment within the complex dynamics of the school. The detailed account and interpretation of the multi-level reciprocal interactions that occur between teachers, mentor and the school organisation presented in this study is especially significant for understanding multidimensional developmental processes. It illustrates the evolution of inventive methodological tools (such as skills rubrics and discourse analysis techniques), which assume to provide new perspectives for fostering the teachers’ trust in their own judgement when mediating higher order thinking skills. These findings are of particular relevance as contemporary research indicates that teachers often experience difficulties in practicing metacognitive pedagogy...|$|E

Assistant Professor Centre for Distance Education Athabasca University, CANADA ABSTRACT The {{growth of}} basic and <b>applied</b> <b>research</b> {{activity}} <b>in</b> distance <b>education</b> requires redirection on several fronts, including {{the instruction of}} <b>research</b> methods <b>in</b> the <b>education</b> of graduate students. The majority of graduate students <b>in</b> distance <b>education</b> are practitioners whose goals range from carrying out original research to acquiring the concepts and skills necessary to become a practitioner. We argue that the best foundation for achieving both of those goals <b>in</b> distance <b>education</b> is developed {{by means of an}} understanding and internalization of sound research design methodologies, primarily acquired by formal instruction, and that an emphasis on <b>research</b> <b>in</b> graduate programs <b>in</b> distance <b>education</b> will encourage theory development.

A two-level dataset (about 900 students nested under 20 schools) extracted from the High School and Beyond (HSB) was used for illustration.

Nanobiotechnology ― the interface of nanotechnology and the life sciences ― {{is one of the}} most active and promising application frontiers in nanotechnology. To assess the productivity of basic and <b>applied</b> <b>research</b> and <b>education</b> <b>in</b> this field, I construct a structural model composed of a system of three equations which respectively represent the productions of a university’s scientific publications, patents, and graduate training outputs. The model is estimated using a unique data set on thirty universities that participated in nanobiotechnology during the 1990 - 2005 period. Ten of them are private universities, ten are public land-grant universities, and ten are public non-land-grant universities. Universities indeed serve as a principal seedbed for future development of the cutting-edge nanobiotechnology. NSF investment in nanobiotechnology strongly affects the university’s basic science research and graduate education. The university’s <b>research</b> expenditures <b>in</b> life sciences, engineering, and physical sciences contribute to its nanobiotechnology fields. Importantly, there is no evidence that science and graduate training compete strongly with one another.

40|$|Following 8 {{years of}} student evaluation, this paper {{presents}} the rationale for introducing AI as an added concept to the traditional application of PBL on an Occupational Therapy (OT) undergraduate programme. Whilst PBL is extensively used on the full-time OT programme at Cardiff University, it is noted from course evaluation that the traditional approach to problem solving {{is to look for}} the problem, do a diagnosis, and find a solution. The primary focus therefore is on what is wrong or broken; since we tend to look for problems, we find them (Cooperider & Strivastva. 1987). This approach is consistent with a historical attitude to the medical model that sees human systems as machines and parts (people) as interchangeable. There is often a belief that we can fix anything and there is a right answer or solution to any problem or challenge. When evaluating students perceptions of PBL concerns were identified that the focus on problem solving inhibits creativity amongst students and creates excessive levels of anxiety around the need to always solve the problem. This is particularly important when the excessive focus on the problem often creates anxiety when a problem cannot be solved – (fear of failure) The aim of introducing AI as an added concept to PBL is to challenge this belief. AI suggests that students not only look for the challenges and problems, but also look for what works with clients and systems within health and social care. The same notion will apply to the student learning experience (Roberts: 2010). Students following a PBL approach will have practice in the art of problem solving and in being part of the solution. However it is felt that they often have little practice looking for what works and finding ways to do more of that. Approaching PBL with an appreciative eye will give students much more of a positive, openly creative, holistic, person centred approach to their challenges (Hammond and Royal 1998). The idea then in a PBL trigger/scenario is to approach problems/challenges with an appreciative eye. Cooperider. D & Strivastva. R (1987).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 213 - 231) While {{studies of}} the gifted are numerous, until recently, they have {{tended to focus on}} identification and special educational issues. Social and emotional issues have been explored as adjuncts to education. Except for a few longitudinal follow-ups of classical studies (Terman's and Hollingworth's), once the gifted individual has left school, he/she has been of little interest to researchers. Studies of adult giftedness have focused primarily on historically eminent individuals. There have been two traditional views of the gifted in terms of emotional and social stability. The gifted are either viewed as too well adjusted to require assistance, or they are regarded as inherently neurotic, or even insane. The former view seems to <b>apply</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> and <b>education,</b> while the latter is prevalent in society at large. Both positions tend to treat the gifted individual as if he/she were an essentially closed system, as if the effects of social interactions and responses have been excluded from consideration as factors in their lives. This paper describes six personality types, and five personality traits ascribed to gifted individuals in terms of the issues they present for gifted adults. Developmental aspects are also delineated. The gifted adult has grown up expressing traits that characterise giftedness, experiencing feedback from others, and has made choices for expression of excellence or satisfaction of intimacy needs based on this feedback. This forced choice creates internal stressors, while the overt expression of the traits of giftedness creates external stressors. These stressors lead to counseling needs unique to the gifted...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{modeling}} using {{longitudinal data}} {{seems to be}} a promising direction for improving the methodology associated with the accountability movement. Longitudinal modeling requires that the measurements of ability are comparable over time and on the same scale. One way to create the vertical scale is through concurrent estimation with identification of groups (Bock & Zimowski, 1997). However, there are concerns about how well this vertical scale will function using longitudinal data with few common items between years (Briggs et al., 2008). Other concerns about the adequacy of this and other vertical scaling strategies arise when the common items shift over time. This study explores these two practical issues in application of a Latent Growth Item Response model (LG-IRM). To illustrate how psychological constructs could be tracked over time, an application to psychological data is also included. Since the number of common items between years can be few, it is important to ensure that the growth modeling procedure can produce good estimations in this situation. A concurrent estimation procedure of the scales is examined. To verify the estimability of the growth model using concurrent estimation, a simulation study is conducted. The LG-IRM is then applied to real data from the LSAY. A study of item shifts over time is also included. Models that do not consider item shifts are compared to those that do. An extended version of the Latent Growth Item Response Model is proposed in which estimates growth parameters are produced while allowing for item shift over time. Item Response Theory (IRT) has been <b>applied</b> extensively to <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>education.</b> Its use <b>in</b> modeling achievement and student ability has been demonstrated using various IRT model formulations. To a lesser degree IRT has also been <b>applied</b> to personality <b>research.</b> Although the conceptualization of the domain, the item types, and the measurement goals are often different <b>in</b> personality <b>research,</b> IRT tools can still provide valuable information. The LG-IRM also provides a way to explore questions <b>in</b> personality <b>research.</b> For instance, it can provide information on the stability of self-esteem in the Black population over time.

In the final part of the paper the practical steps are considered to enhance the population policy in the USSR in the early 80 s, regional peculiarities of the phased introduction of new measures to provide state support for families with children in 1981 – 1983, as well as approaches to development of regional programmes of population policies in the late 70 ’s and 80 ’s. The research has received a new analytical material that reveals the attitude on the definition and content of the basic concepts (demographic policy and population policy), the formulation of goals, objectives, principles and approaches to assessment of the effectiveness of demographic policy. This study shows the difficulties facing the practical implementation of theoretical notions about population policy, the dependence of the population policies on specific historical and socio-economic conditions. The collapse of the Soviet Union has put the issue of developing conceptual frameworks and mechanisms for the implementation of demographic policies in the new economic and socio-political conditions. At the same time, theoretical and <b>applied</b> <b>researches</b> <b>in</b> the field of population policy during the USSR epoch largely retained their relevance, including the field of new support measures for families with children, the development of criteria and indexes for assessing the impact of demographic policies, improving the implementation methods of demographic programmes with regional peculiarities of the demographic situation. We still, as 50 years ago, are looking for the ways to increase fertility, to counter the threats of depopulation, and the ways to reduce the backlog in the life expectancy and optimize migration. Critical thinking on the theory and practice of population policies will help today in searching the opportunities to intensify the demographic policy and enhance its effectiveness, at both the federal and regional levels.  </p...|$|R
