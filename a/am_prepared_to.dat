25|$|There {{were really}} no {{actions on the}} part of the missionaries there that were not entirely justified. There was no government, no organization. There were houses of men who had been firing on the foreign quarter; their {{property}} had been abandoned as a result of a state of war, and it was taken in order to succor hundreds of suffering and destitute Chinese whose lives the original owners had been laboring to destroy. Winter was coming on, measures of some kind were imperative, and the appropriation of property for the ends in view was unquestionably justified. I <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> justify the conduct of the American missionaries before the siege, during the siege and after the siege.|$|E

500|$|Although four of {{the accused}} denied {{involvement}} with MK, Mandela and the other five accused admitted sabotage but denied that they had ever agreed to initiate guerrilla war against the government. They used the trial to highlight their political cause; {{at the opening of}} the defence's proceedings, Mandela gave his three-hour [...] "I <b>Am</b> <b>Prepared</b> <b>to</b> Die" [...] speech. That speech—which was inspired by Castro's [...] "History Will Absolve Me"—was widely reported in the press despite official censorship. The trial gained international attention; there were global calls for the release of the accused from the United Nations and World Peace Council, while the University of London Union voted Mandela to its presidency. On 12 June 1964, justice De Wet found Mandela and two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied, the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment.|$|E

She also helped Mandela edit his famous speech [...] "I <b>Am</b> <b>Prepared</b> <b>to</b> Die", given from the defendant's dock at the trial.

The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation, and the same may be said of Lawrence and Lady Chatterley's Lover." [...] Burgess has also dismissed A Clockwork Orange as [...] "too didactic to be artistic".|$|E
2500|$|On November 6, 2007, Pickens {{offered a}} million dollars to anyone able to dispute any claims made in {{political}} ads by the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth (SVPT), a group he had supported during the 2004 presidential election. John Kerry, whose military record and anti-war activism during Vietnam was the target of the group's book and media campaign, sent Pickens a letter on November16, 2007, accepting the challenge, requesting that Pickens donate the money to the Paralyzed Veterans of America should he succeed in disproving any of the SVPT claims. In response to Kerry's acceptance of the challenge, Pickens issued a letter the same day, narrowing the original challenge to the SVPT ads, and requiring Kerry to provide his Vietnam journal, all of his military records, specifically those covering the years after his active duty service, and copies of all movies and tapes made during his service. Pickens' letter also challenged Kerry to agree to donate $1 million to the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, if Kerry [...] "cannot prove anything in the Swift Boat ads to be untrue." [...] Kerry later accused Pickens of [...] "parsing and backtracking" [...] on his initial offer and wrote that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> prove the lie and marshal all the evidence, the question is whether you are prepared to fulfill your obligation." ...|$|E

In an interview with National Review, Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: [...] "Cooper's lawyer called us and said, 'Can you confirm that the waiver [...] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed...So I said, 'Look, I understand that you want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl to provide you with some other assurances, we will.'"

Cooper told the grand jury his sources for his article, [...] "A War on Wilson?", were Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.|$|E
