5|$|Earned runs are runs {{that are}} {{directly}} attributable to a pitcher's efforts without a lapse by the defense. An unearned run does not adversely impact a pitcher's {{earned run average}} (ERA), and is only possible when an error (including catcher's interference) or a passed ball occurs earlier in the inning. Unearned runs are primarily discussed in rule 10.16 and often require <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> by the official scorer.|$|E
5|$|Henry Chadwick is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} invention of scorekeeping in baseball. Chadwick was also {{the inventor of the}} modern box score and the writer of the first rule book for the game of baseball. Since baseball statistics were initially a subject of interest to sportswriters, the role of the official scorer in Major League Baseball (MLB) {{in the early days of}} the sport was performed by newspaper writers. <b>A</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> that is required by the official scorer does not alter the outcome of a game, but these judgments impact the statistical records of the game. As the subjective scoring decisions which are used to calculate baseball statistics began to be used to determine the relative value of baseball players, MLB began to require approval from the league before a writer-scorer could be assigned to produce the scoring report for a game. By the 1970s, writers who were willing to score games for MLB were required to have attended 100 or more games per year in the prior three years and to be chosen by the local chapter chairman of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Qualified candidates for scoring were submitted to the leagues for approval.|$|E

500|$|Rule 10.01 {{states that}} the scorer is never allowed to make scorekeeping {{decisions}} that conflict with the official rules governing scorekeeping. The official scorer is permitted to view available replays and to solicit the opinions of others, but the official scorer is given the sole authority to make the judgment calls that are required in the score report. When <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> is made, the official scorer is obligated to immediately communicate that decision to the media in the press box and to the broadcasters, usually through a microphone. The official scorer has up to 24 hours to reconsider or reverse <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> that was made during the game. In rare circumstances, MLB's scoring committee may reverse a scoring decision that is [...] "clearly erroneous".|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{judgment}} call involving an error {{occurs when the}} defense fails {{to put out a}} batter-runner who puts the ball in play. If the out is not recorded and the official scorer believes that an [...] "ordinary effort" [...] by the defense would have resulted in an out, the defense is charged with an error, and the batter is not credited with a hit. Other common situations requiring <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> include unintentionally dropped foul balls that allow the batter to continue his at-bat, and poor throws to the next base when a runner attempts to advance.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} to charge an error {{to the defense}} is the most well-known responsibility of the official scorer. Some situations automatically call for an error to be charged to the defense by rule, but most charged errors {{are the result of}} a play that requires <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>call.</b> Broadly speaking, an error is charged to the defense when an [...] "ordinary effort" [...] by the defense would have either recorded an out or prevented a runner from advancing, but the defense fails to do so. When an error is charged, the official scorer must charge the error to one of the fielders {{who were involved in the}} play. Errors are primarily discussed in rule 10.12.|$|E

500|$|The {{goal was}} not {{reviewed}} immediately, so {{officials did not}} notice Hull's foot in the crease until minutes later.

Maybe he doesn't know the rule." [...] The following season, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced that video replays {{would no longer be}} used to judge if players are in the crease or not, {{and that it would be}} <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> by the officiating crew. After the season ended, Hašek contemplated retirement because of a combination of injuries and a desire to become more involved in his family life. The announcement stunned many of his teammates, particularly Mike Peca and Jason Woolley.|$|E

50|$|A {{standing}} eight count, {{also known}} as a protection count, is <b>a</b> boxing <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> made by <b>a</b> referee during a bout. When invoked, the referee stops the action and counts to eight. Typically, a boxer can take 3 standing eight counts in a round. During that time the referee will determine if the boxer can continue. When the count reaches eight, the referee often moves back two steps and instructs the boxer to walk towards them and hold their arms out. This helps the referee determine if the boxer is functioning and alert enough to continue. If the boxer is unsteady on his feet, or seems unable to focus on the referee, the bout is ended on account of a TKO.|$|R
50|$|Wally was {{inspired}} by a coworker of creator Scott Adams at Pacific Bell. In Seven Years of Highly Defective People and What Would Wally Do, Adams explained that his co-worker at Pacific Bell had made <b>a</b> bad <b>judgment</b> <b>call,</b> so management froze him at his position and pay scale rather than fire him. Then Pacific Bell started offering a generous severance package for the lowest ten-percent of workers, so the coworker, knowing management had hinted that he should leave the company and knowing it was better to leave with money than without, had an incentive to become a low performing worker. Adams {{was inspired}} by this co-worker's serious dedication toward this goal, and the concept of a completely shameless employee with no sense of loyalty became Wally.|$|R
5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In <b>a</b> similarly difficult <b>judgment</b> <b>call</b> where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|R

5000|$|Damnation (from Latin damnatis) is {{the concept}} of divine {{punishment}} and torment in an afterlife for actions that were committed on Earth. In Ancient Egyptian religious tradition, citizens would recite the 42 negative confessions of Maat as their heart was weighed against the feather of truth. If the citizen's heart was heavier than a feather they would face torment in a lake of fire. Zoroastrianism developed an eschatological concept of <b>a</b> Last <b>Judgment</b> <b>called</b> Frashokereti where the dead will be raised and the righteous wade though a river of milk while the wicked will be burned in a river of molten metal. Abrahamic religions such as Christianity have similar concepts of believers facing judgement on a last day to determine if they will spend eternity in Gehenna or heaven for their sin [...] A damned human [...] "in damnation" [...] is said to be either in Hell, or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God's favor. In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules Hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{in this research}} were to introduce the concept of team role knowledge and to investigate its potential usefulness for team member selection. In Study 1, the authors developed <b>a</b> situational <b>judgment</b> test, <b>called</b> the Team Role Test, to measure knowledge of 10 roles relevant to the team context. The criterion-related validity of this measure was examined in 2 additional studies. In a sample of academic project teams (N 93), team role knowledge predicted team member role performance (r. 34). Role knowledge also provided incremental validity beyond mental ability and the Big Five personality factors in the prediction of role performance. The results of Study 2 revealed that the predictive validity of role knowledge generalizes to team members in a work setting (N 82, r. 30). The implications of the results for selection in team environments are discussed...|$|R
