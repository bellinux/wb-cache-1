5000|$|In {{the stove}} metaphor {{there is an}} {{illustration}} of placement {{in relation to the}} controls; however, the effect of the control in relation to its operation is Heat as a result of Rotation. Rotation does not naturally relate to heat, therefore the relationship is <b>artifical,</b> and a social construction. A better example would the the simple one of a privacy bolt on a toilet stall. A simple slide bolt with a knob has a very direct mapping, whereas, one with a rotating lever requires the understanding of the transformation of the rotation translated into the movement of the bolt horizontally. From this perspective, mapping is a characterstic of affordance. A deeper understanding of many our perceived 'natural' mapping relationships uncovers a predominately socially constructed, or cultural, underpinning. Such as rotating a volume knob to make the music volume go 'up'.|$|E

The present paper deals with the <b>artifical</b> crossing between U. peterseniana and U. pinnatifida. The results of studies are summarized as follows: <b>Artifical</b> crossing between U. peterseniana ♀ and U. pinnatifida ♂ were successful and many hybrids were obtained at the cultivation in the sea. The hybrids are intermediate between their parental species not ohly morphologically but also ecologically. All grown-up hybrids produced sporangial sori mainly on the sporophyll at the lowest margin of blade. Morphological and ecological aspects of the gametophytes from the hybrids are almost {{similar to those of the}} parental species. At the first nuclear division in the zoosporangia of U. pinnatifida, U. peterseniana and the hybrids, thirty chromosomes each were counted. アオワカメとワカメの交雑実験を行ない,その結果えられた雑種の形態や生長,成熟などについて調査した. 1 アオワカメ♀とワカメ♂の交雑で多くの雑種が発生した. 2 雑種の形態はアオワカメとワカメの中間的な特徴を示す. すなわち,雑種の体長はワカメより長くアオワカメより短かく,葉幅が広いのでアオワカメの重量の軽い欠点は雑種ではかなり改善された. 3 雑種の遊走子嚢は茎の上部で葉に連続して形成される成実葉につくられる場合が多い. 4 雑種の遊走子放出時期はワカメより遅くアオワカメより早期である. 5. 雑種の配偶体の形態や生態はワカメ,アオワカメとほとんど同様である. 6 実験に供したアオワカメ,ワカメおよび雑種の半数染色体数はいずれも 30 であった...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to follow growth and survival of the Japanese sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus juveniles released into artificial reefs, and to verify practical effectiveness of the <b>artifical</b> reef to reduce early disapperance of released juveniles and an overall effect of the juvenile release to enhance the sea cucumber stock. We set up the <b>artifical</b> reefs near a breakwater in Esashi, sowthwestern coast of Hokkaido, where juveniles of sea cucumber were almost unoberved. To examine effective size of the reef, we prepared four types of the artificial reefs on the basis of size, and released 1 -year old juveniles into them. The censuses were conducted ten times from June 2008 to July 2011 by SCUBA diving. The juveniles grew in average from 16 mm to 77 mm in standard body length during three years of the survey, and the growth rate became lower inversely depending on size of the <b>artifical</b> reefs. The number of juveniles decreased by about 36 % after a month from the release and remained until 16 months after that. It then declined to 17 % over the next 18 months. The juveniles in the larger artificial reefs showed better survival rates but lower growth rates comparing with those in the smaller ones. Considering increase in the number of the larger sea cucumber around the breakwater after 3 years of the release, it seems more likely that grown-up juveniles moved from the artificial reefs toward an offshore natural habitat, and they might keep about 30 % survival rate during the 3 years. These results suggest that the release with <b>artifical</b> reefs makes a certain level of effect to increase the sea cucumber stocks...|$|E
