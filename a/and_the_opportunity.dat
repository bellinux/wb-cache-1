5|$|Darlington {{were the}} first to settle with Gary Bannister a {{prominent}} player in midfield, but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the first real goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes. Adrian Littlejohn found space after a one-two with Michael Evans, but his first touch let him down <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> was not taken. Darlington's main threat was coming from attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match midway through the first half. He carved out the initial chance, having carried the ball half the length of the pitch, but team-mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert. The hasty clearance from Argyle found its way back to Appleby but he sent his shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed.|$|E

5|$|In 1847, Queen Victoria issued new {{statutes}} eliminating all {{references to}} an exclusively military Order.

New numerical limits were imposed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> also taken to regularise the 1815 expansion of the Order. The 1847 statutes also abolished all the medieval ritual, however they did introduce a formal Investiture ceremony, conducted by the Sovereign wearing the Mantle and insignia of the Order, attended by the Officers and as many GCBs as possible, in their Mantles.|$|E

During the Kerch-Feodosiya Operation the ship sailed {{into the harbor}} of Feodosiya on 29 December 1941, landed reinforcements, and provided gunfire support for Soviet troops already ashore. In early January 1942, she was severely damaged by German dive bombers. She made it to Novorossiysk, escorted by the destroyer Sposobnyi, where she was patched up enough to make to Poti where more permanent repairs could be made.

On 29 April, the first bombings of Operation Patio took place. Like Menu, these tactical airstrikes were held in close secrecy. Although they were initially an anti-infiltration measure, they quickly expanded as targets deeper in Cambodia became the norm. The program was quickly superseded by Operation Freedom Deal, the overt support of FANK troops by B-52 and tactical airstrikes by American and South Vietnamese aircraft.|$|E

If at AA, the marginal opportunity cost of butter in terms of guns is equal to 0.25, the sacrifice of one gun could produce four packets of butter, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> cost of guns in terms of butter is 4.|$|E

5|$|Between 2011–12, {{they met}} in four {{consecutive}} Grand Slam tournament finals, just {{the second time in}} tennis history this has happened. In doing so, they also became the second pair in history, after Venus and Serena Williams, to meet in the finals of each of the four different Grand Slam events. Djokovic defeated Nadal in the first three (from Wimbledon to the Australian Open), making Nadal the first player in history to lose three consecutive Grand Slam event finals. However, Nadal defeated Djokovic in the French Open final, denying him a Career Grand Slam <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> to become the first man since Rod Laver to hold all four Majors at once. The two also share the record for the longest Australian Open and Grand Slam tournament final match ever played (5 hours and 53 minutes), at the 2012 Australian Open final. This and the 2013 French Open semifinal they contested, are considered two of the greatest matches of all time. At ATP Masters 1000 level, they have met 26 times, 12 of which were in the final (a record), including the 2013 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, where Djokovic ended Nadal's 47-match winning run and eight-year winning streak at the event.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a {{full-scale}} mockup {{was completed in}} June 1945 by Factory No. 81, but the order for five prototypes was given to Factory No. 381 as Factory No. 81 was already fully committed to other programs. Manufacturing drawings were delivered to Factory No. 381 {{by the end of}} August, but the prototypes were delayed because the plant had no experience building metal aircraft and lacked the necessary tooling. By the end of the year, the factory had only managed to complete a single airframe for static load testing. This showed that the rear fuselage, wings and tail needed to be reinforced, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> was taken to enlarge the vertical stabilizer as well. These tests and modifications required six months of work so that the first flying prototype was not completed until July 1946. Manufacturer's testing of the first prototype began on 27 August, after ground testing had required replacing the engine twice, and the first flight was made on 11 September.|$|E
5|$|Following the takeover, a new {{stationmaster}}'s {{house was}} built at Sea Mills, {{at a cost of}} £240. The stationmaster is recorded as having kept a variety of farm animals and sold eggs to passengers. Increased levels of traffic saw the line through Sea Mills doubled in the early 1900s, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> was taken to rebuild the station. A second platform opened on 6 January 1907 {{to the west of the}} tracks to serve northbound trains. The original platform now exclusively served southbound trains, and was lengthened to , the same length as the new platform. A station building was constructed on the original platform in a domestic style, with an arched terracotta entrance, spar-covered walls and a high-pitched tiled roof. The building contained a booking hall, booking office, toilets and a ladies' waiting room. A smaller building on the northbound platform contained a general waiting room. The subway under the bridge over the River Trym was also built at this time, with the porter's job being expanded to include washing the rubbish out of the subway after high tide, for which the railway provided a hosepipe and Wellington boots. By 1910 there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth and 15 back, increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920, though not all stopped at Sea Mills. The station was completely closed on Sundays.|$|E
