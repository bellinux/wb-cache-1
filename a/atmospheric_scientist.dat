500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the relatively recent appearance of noctilucent clouds, and their gradual increase, {{may be linked to}} climate change. The author of the first cited study, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>scientist</b> Gary Thomas of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, has pointed out that the first sightings coincide with both Krakatoa and the nascent Industrial Revolution, and they have become more widespread and frequent throughout the twentieth century, including an uptick between 1964 and 1986. The connection of global warming to noctilucent clouds remains controversial, however. Gary Thomas may have penned his paper after Wilfried Schröder, who might hold the distinction of being the first to explain noctilucent clouds as [...] "indicators" [...] for atmospheric processes (Gerlands Beiträge zur Geophysik, 1971, Meteorologische Rundschau 1968–1970). Most recently in 2012 Lonnie Cumberland's physics PhD work supported viewing noctilucent clouds as a possible Miner's Canary for climate change as her third conclusion as a sign of increasing the presence of water in the high atmosphere. NASA scientists speculate that methane may be driven higher into the mesophere where noctilucent clouds form by climate change and through reactions that end up producing water at such altitudes.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a series of unusually cold winters in {{northern}} mid-latitudes, including the eastern United States, {{where they have been}} accompanied by extremely heavy snowfalls. Some <b>atmospheric</b> <b>scientists</b> have argued that such cold events may be associated with the rapid warming of the Arctic that has been observed over recent decades and that is manifested in the precipitous decline of Arctic sea-ice extent since the early 1990 s. Others have argued that the cold events merely reflect the chaotic variability of the climate system and are becoming less likely under climate change.

2500|$|After {{reading a}} paper by N. P. Bochkov and E. I. Chazov, {{published}} in the same edition of Ambio that carried Crutzen and Birks's paper [...] "Twilight at Noon", Soviet <b>atmospheric</b> <b>scientist</b> Georgy Golitsyn applied his research on Mars dust storms to soot in the Earth's atmosphere. The use of these influential Martian dust storm models in nuclear winter research began in 1971, when the Soviet spacecraft Mars 2 arrived at the red planet and observed a global dust cloud. The orbiting instruments together with the 1971 Mars 3 lander determined that temperatures {{on the surface of}} the red-planet were considerably colder than temperatures at the top of the dust cloud. Following these observations, Golitsyn received two telegrams from astronomer Carl Sagan, in which Sagan asked Golitsyn to [...] "explore the understanding and assessment of this phenomenon." [...] Golitsyn recounts that it was around this time that he had [...] "proposed a theory to explain how Martian dust may be formed and how it may reach global proportions." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1970 Paul Crutzen {{pointed out}} that {{emissions}} of nitrous oxide (...) , a stable, long-lived gas produced by soil bacteria, from the Earth's surface could affect the amount of nitric oxide (NO) in the stratosphere. Crutzen showed that nitrous oxide lives long enough to reach the stratosphere, where it is converted into NO. Crutzen then noted that increasing use of fertilizers might have led {{to an increase in}} nitrous oxide emissions over the natural background, which would in turn result in an increase in the amount of NO in the stratosphere. Thus human activity could affect the stratospheric ozone layer. In the following year, Crutzen and (independently) Harold Johnston suggested that NO emissions from supersonic passenger aircraft, which would fly in the lower stratosphere, could also deplete the ozone layer. However, more recent analysis in 1995 by David W. Fahey, an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>scientist</b> at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that the drop in ozone would be from 1–2 percent if a fleet of 500 supersonic passenger aircraft were operated. This, Fahey expressed, would not be a showstopper for advanced supersonic passenger aircraft development.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The eponym “Walker Circulation ” {{refers to}} a concept used by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>scientists</b> and oceanographers in {{providing}} a physical explanation for the El Niño–Southern Oscillation phenomenon, whereas the eponym “Yule–Walker equations ” refers to properties satisfied by the autocorrelations of an autoregressive process. But how many statisticians (or, for that matter, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>scientists)</b> are aware that the “Walker ” in both terms refers to the same individual, Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker, and that these two appellations arose {{in conjunction with the}} same research on the statistical prediction of climate? Like George Udny Yule (the “Yule ” in Yule– Walker), Walker’s motivation was to devise a statistical model that exhibited quasiperiodic behavior. The original assessments of Walker’s work, both in the meteorology and in statistics, were somewhat negative. With hindsight, it is argued that his research should be viewed as quite successful...|$|R
