5|$|The incumbent, 4th {{president}} of the Republic, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, is eligible to run for reelection to <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> final term. Another eligible candidate is the former 3rd {{president of}} Croatia, Ivo Josipović. He narrowly lost the 2015 election to Grabar-Kitarović after serving one 5-year term and can therefore also run for reelection to <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> final term.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> third {{volume to}} the Huolongjing known as Huolongjing Erji (Fire Dragon Manual Volume Two) and Huolongjing Sanji (Fire Dragon Manual Volume Three) were {{published}} in 1632 with content describing weapons such as the musket and breech-loading cannons. After {{the end of the}} Ming dynasty, the Qing dynasty outlawed reprinting of the Huolongjing for using expressions such as 'northern barbarians,' which offended the ruling Manchu elite.|$|E

5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Edwards' actions alienated those Native Americans {{friendly}} to the U.S. in the region. Ninian Edwards, having lost {{the confidence of the}} Madison administration, waited out the war in Kentucky. However, he was reappointed to <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> then a third term as territorial governor in 1812 and 1815, and he was also named one of the three U.S. negotiators of the Treaties of Portage des Sioux in 1815.|$|E
5|$|He claimed three Spitfires in two {{missions}} for {{his final}} victories (victories 171–173) on 26 August. His victims most likely belonged to 421 and 341 Squadron RAF. Between 24 May and 28 August 1944, Lang had claimed 29 aerial victories on the Western Front, including nine P-51 Mustangs. On 6 June 1944, his group {{was the first}} to reach 100 aerial victories over Normandy, earning him and his group <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> final reference in the Wehrmachtbericht on 30 August.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Mayawati launched, Manyawar Shri Kanshiram Ji Shahri Garib Awas Yojna, {{a scheme}} for {{building}} low-cost housing colonies for urban poor with 90,000 low-cost homes {{under the first}} round of construction in different towns and cities across the state while <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> a third round were still underway when government ended in 2012 and next government scrapped the scheme including cutting down electricity of these colonies.|$|E
5|$|In Haydn's {{previous}} {{two sets of}} quartets, the Opus 20 ("Sun") and Opus 33 ("Russian"), he adopted a variety of cyclical structures, particularly in the alternate placement of the slow movement as {{the second or third}} movement. But in the Opus 50 set, each quartet follows the same fast–slow–minuet–fast sequence. The set is also characterised by a high degree of monothematicism (the use of a single theme within a movement). In a number of movements, including sonata form movements and minuets and trios, Haydn eschews presenting <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> contrasting theme and instead elects to explore the full potential of the primary theme.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} Jamaican High School Championships, in 2003, he broke both the 200 m and 400 m records with times of 20.25 s and 45.35 s, respectively. Bolt's runs were a {{significant}} improvement upon the previous records, beating the 200 m best {{by more than half}} <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> the 400 m record by almost a second. While Bolt improved upon the 200 m time three months later, setting the still-standing World youth best at the 2003 Pan American Junior Championships. The 400 m time remains No. 6 on the all-time youth list, surpassed only once since, by future Olympic champion Kirani James.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe was the wettest {{tropical}} cyclone on record worldwide. The eighth named storm of the season, Hyacinthe formed on January15, 1980, {{to the northeast}} of Mauritius in the southern Indian Ocean. Initially it moved to the west-southwest, and while slowly intensifying it passed north of the French overseas department of Réunion. On January19, Météo-France estimated that the storm had intensified to a {{tropical cyclone}}. Hyacinthe looped {{to the south of}} eastern Madagascar and weakened, although it restrengthened after turning to the east. The storm executed another loop to the southwest of Réunion, passing near the island for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> later third time. Hyacinthe became extratropical on January29 after turning southward, dissipating two days later.|$|E
5|$|Variation of {{the wing}} beat may also occur, not just amongst {{different}} species, but even among individuals at different times. In general, the frequency is dependent upon the ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing beat frequency of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, heavy-bodied flies and bees beat their wings more than 100 times <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> mosquitoes can beat up to 988–1046 times a second. The same goes for flight; though it is generally difficult to estimate the speed of insects in flight, most insects can probably fly faster in nature than they do in controlled experiments.|$|E
5|$|As {{temperatures}} cooled in {{the final}} qualifying session, {{over a third of}} the field improved their fastest laps, but Jani's pole position time was unchallenged. Audi No. 7 led the session with a three minutes and 20.967 seconds lap time, still over four seconds shy of pole position. Nissan improved all three of their cars during the session, closing to within a second of the closest LMP1 competitor. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier-Nissan closed to within a second of KCMG to take the second grid position in LMP2, while Greaves remained in third. In LMGTE Pro the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari rebounded from the loss of their qualifying times in the first session to lead the final session and come within a tenth of a second of Aston Martin. The sister AF Corse Ferrari also improved to fourth in the category to split the top of the grid in the class amongst the two manufacturers. The lead in LMGTE Am remained with the No. 98 Aston Martin, <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> a half ahead of the No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari. SMP Racing improved their time by leading both of the day's qualifying sessions to take second place on the grid, splitting the Aston Martin cars. The No. 67 AAI Porsche suffered a fire during the session which halted qualifying for nearly half an hour.|$|E

5|$|DRS was enabled on the 24th lap. Although Hamilton {{had closed}} Rosberg's lead to half <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> used the system, {{he could not}} pass his teammate. Räikkönen made a {{problematic}} pit stop that lap, as his mechanics struggled to install a right-front wheel nut correctly. Hamilton tried to pass Rosberg again the following lap by running in his slipstream, but Rosberg held the line and had enough acceleration to defend first place. Hamilton held a tighter line, while Rosberg complained of more oversteer on lap 26. On the 27th lap, Hamilton forgot to deactivate his DRS system and lost control of his rear end; his brakes locked, and {{he went into the}} turn one run-off area. However, he caught up to Rosberg and ran closely behind his teammate into the hairpin without trying to pass. Hamilton moved across the track during the lap in an attempt to pass; Rosberg's car shuddered, and Hamilton got a better run onto the pit-lane straight. He was in Rosberg's slipstream before passing him on the outside heading into the first turn to take the lead on lap 29. Hamilton pushed hard and pulled away from Rosberg, who lost control heading into the pit-lane straight.|$|E
5|$|Flora Duffy {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in the Beijing Olympics based on her performance in the qualification competitions. Participating on the August 18 event, Duffy competed in the women's triathlon. Duffy swam the 1.5kilometers portion of the distance in 20:26minutes, ranking 41st out of 55 in that portion of the event, behind Luxembourg's Liz May (40th) by under <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> ahead of Hungary's Zita Szabó by two seconds. In this portion of the event, Duffy was 37 seconds behind the United States' Laura Bennett, who finished the swimming portion of the event first at 19:49. Duffy took 33 seconds to make the transition from swim to cycling, the second part of the event, tying with Mak So Ning of Hong Kong at 52nd place out of 55. Duffy, however, was lapped on the bike leg and was disqualified before reaching the running portion or completing the event.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{freshman}} college season, McKee {{qualified for the}} 1972 U.S. Olympic team despite recovering from a bout of mononucleosis. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he represented the United States in three different events. Most memorably, McKee won a silver medal in the men's 400-meter individual medley in the closest swimming decision in Olympic history, losing {{by a margin of}} two one-thousandths (0.002) of a second to Sweden's Gunnar Larsson. Initially, the scoreboard showed that Larsson and McKee had tied with an official time of 4:31.98, but in a controversial decision, the event judges named Larsson the eventual gold medal-winner ten minutes after the race was over—Larsson's electronic clock time was 4:31.981, McKee's 4:31.983. The time difference was variously calculated as one-tenth of the time of a typical blink of a human eye, and the distance as the thickness of a coat of paint, a sheet of paper, or the minor imperfections in the individual lanes of the Olympic pool. As a result of the controversy, the international swimming federation, FINA, subsequently clarified the timing rules for competition swimming; international races are now required to be timed to the hundredth of <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> timing to the thousandth of a second is prohibited for tie-breakers. It was the first and only Olympic swimming event ever decided on the basis of thousandths of a second. Afterward, McKee attributed his second-place finish to a tactical mistake: he looked over his shoulder to see where Larsson was in the final leg of the race.|$|E
