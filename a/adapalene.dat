5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and <b>adapalene</b> (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the field}} of dermatology, topical retinoids {{represent}} a mainstay in acne treatment. <b>Adapalene</b> is a naphthoic acid derivative showing some pharmacological activities similar to the regular retinoids. The drug is used singly or in combination for treating acne {{and a few other}} miscellaneous skin disorders. OBJECTIVE: To critically review the pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic aspects and clinical benefits and adverse effects associated with topical <b>adapalene.</b> METHOD: A systematic literature review was conducted primarily based on PubMed citations. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: <b>Adapalene</b> shares some biological activities in common with retinoic acid. However, it exhibits distinct physicochemical and binding properties for selective retinoic acid receptors. In acne, <b>adapalene</b> is expected to reduce comedogenesis, expel mature comedones and exert some anti-inflammatory effects. The drug is effective as monotherapy in mild comedonal acne and in combination with benzoyl peroxide for mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne. The safety profile of <b>adapalene</b> is good. Indeed, only discrete to moderate adverse events including erytheme, xerosis, itching and stinging may develop during the early treatment phase.

The preparation and physical characteristics of the beads were not dependent on whether <b>adapalene</b> had been previously dissolved or dispersed in soybean oil. Drug encapsulation efficiency was high (> 96 %) and drug loading on the order of a therapeutic level could be achieved in freeze-dried beads prepared from an oily dispersion of <b>adapalene.</b> After application to human skin, unloaded beads induced no adverse reaction and were better tolerated than an alcoholic gel. Tape-stripping the stratum corneum from treated pig skin showed that <b>adapalene</b> release and penetration from the beads was comparable to that from gel and cream formulations available on the market.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Acne is a multifactorial {{skin disease}} {{affecting}} about 80 % of people aged 11 to 30. Several systemic and topical treatments {{are used to}} treat existing lesions, prevent scarring and suppress {{the development of new}} lesions. Topical therapy is often used as first line treatment for acne, due to the location of the target organ, the pilosebaceous unit, in the skin. Retinoids are widely used as oral or topical treatment for this disease, with tretinoin and <b>adapalene</b> being two of the most used topical retinoids. The transdermal route offers several challenges to drug delivery, e. g. the excellent resistance of the stratum corneum to diffusion, as well as variable skin properties such as site, age, race and disease. Some additional difficulties are associated with the dermatological delivery of tretinoin and <b>adapalene,</b> which include suboptimal water solubility of the retinoids, isomerisation of tretinoin in the skin, mild to severe skin irritation, as well as oxidation and photo–isomerisation of tretinoin, even before crossing the stratum corneum. Researchers constantly strive to improve dermatological retinoid formulations in order to combat low dermal flux, skin irritation and instability. The release kinetics of tretinoin varies greatly according {{to the way in which}} it is incorporated into the formulation and according to the type of formulation used. Little research has been conducted regarding improved formulations for <b>adapalene.</b> Pheroid technology is a patented delivery system employed in this study in order to improve the dermal delivery of retinoids. Tretinoin and <b>adapalene</b> were separately incorporated into castor oil, vitamin F and Pheroid creams. The creams were evaluated in terms of their in vitro retinoid release, in vitro transdermal diffusion and stability. Castor oil and Pheroid creams were superior in terms of release and dermal delivery of <b>adapalene.</b> Tretinoin was best released and delivered to the dermis by castor oil cream. The castor oil creams were the most stable formulations, whereas the Pheroid creams were the most unstable. In terms of release, dermal diffusion and stability, castor oil cream proved to be the most suitable cream for both tretinoin and <b>adapalene.</b> Master...|$|E

40|$|A niosome based topical gel of <b>adapalene</b> was {{developed}} and characterized {{for the treatment of}} mild acne. <b>Adapalene</b> is a third-generation topical retinoid primarily used in the treatment of mild-moderate acne. Niosomes containing <b>adapalene</b> were prepared by lipid film hydration technique using nonionic surfactants (span 60) and cholesterol at different concentrations. All the niosomal formulations were evaluated for FTIR studies, entrapment efficiency, optical microscopy, stability studies, in-vitro drug release study, and zeta potential analysis. Then the optimized niosomal formulation was used for formulating topical gel consisting of carbopol 934. All the formulations were tested for physical properties, in-vitro drug release and skin irritation test. The result suggests that in all the prepared niosomal formulations as the surfactant concentration increases the entrapment efficiency increases. Lower the cholesterol concentration higher the entrapment efficiency in span 60 formulations. The size of niosomes was found to be uniform and spherical in shape. The entrapment efficiencies of all formulation were calculated. The IR spectral analysis suggested that there was no interaction between the drug and formulation excipients. The drug content was in the range of 95. 04 ± 0. 57 to 90. 68 ± 0. 39. The in- vitro release data was calculated using franz diffusion cell.
