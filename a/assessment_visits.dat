A care plan tailored for specific circumstances is prepared after a comprehensive assessment has taken place, and is continuously monitored and modified as needed.A comprehensive geriatric care assessment is thorough and can take anywhere from 2 to 5 hours in length, this of course is broken down into 2 or 3 <b>assessment</b> <b>visits</b> with the patient/family members. The comprehensive assessment is really a compilation of smaller individual assessments with the first one being a primary intake assessment which includes demographic type data {{as well as a}} health history, social history, and legal/financial history. From there, a medication profile assessment is included, as well as an assessment of ADLs (Activities of Daily Living) and IADLs (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living). In addition other assessments may include; Falls risk assessment, Home safety assessment, Nutritional assessment, Depression assessment, Pain assessment, Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), MiniCog Clock Drawing Exam (Cognitive Assessment), Balance assessment, and Gait assessment(ability to walk). If the comprehensive geriatric care management assessment is being conducted by a Registered Nurse, then a physical assessment can be included such as vitals signs recording temperature, pulse, respirations, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and sometimes FBS or RBS (Fasting or Random Blood Sugar) checks for diabetics.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{measurement}} of the quality of <b>assessment</b> <b>visits</b> of community nurses in The Netherlands. Process criteria were derived for the quality of the <b>assessment</b> <b>visits</b> from the quality standards of community nursing care established by Appelman et al. Over a period of 8 weeks, a representative sample of 108 community nurses and 49 community nursing auxiliaries at 47 different locations paid a total number of 433 <b>assessment</b> <b>visits.</b> The nursing activities were recorded for each visit. The results suggested that most <b>assessment</b> <b>visits</b> (88 %) were paid by community nurses. During the <b>assessment</b> <b>visits,</b> community nurses more often paid attention to questions and expectations of the patient than nursing auxiliaries did. Furthermore, the quality of taking case histories in the actual practice of assessment appeared to be high in general. However, nearly half of the nurses did not enquire whether the patient received care from other health care professionals. The drafting of the care plan was, on average, of a lesser quality.

The {{aim of this}} research was to systematically investigate current predischarge occupational therapy home assessment visit practices in a rehabilitation ward of a regional Australian hospital. Methods: A retrospective chart audit was conducted over a 7 -month time period and included 227 patients discharged from the inpatient rehabilitation ward at the study hospital. Results: Fifty-five per cent of patients in the study sample received home <b>assessment</b> <b>visits.</b> At least one recommendation for change was made {{as a result of the}} visit for 99 % of those patients receiving visits. A total of 139 visits were completed and resulted in 1179 recommendations for change. The median number of recommendations made for the home <b>assessment</b> <b>visits</b> was 10 (range 0 – 33). The most common types of recommendations, timing of visits, persons present during the visit and documentation of visits were also investigated.

40|$|Introduction: This article {{describes}} the evaluation of nine pilot obstetric ultrasound education workshops for Australian rural and remote doctors developed {{in response to an}} educational needs assessment that showed a large unmet need in this area. Method: Data from pre- and post-knowledge tests were analysed in SPSS. Data from the follow-up sonographer <b>assessment</b> <b>visits</b> were analysed in an EXCEL spreadsheet. Results: In all, 141 doctors attended one of the nine pilot obstetric ultrasound workshops and reported an increase in their confidence in obstetric ultrasound. The overall workshop pre- and post-knowledge test mean improved from a score of 13. 9 to 15. 5 (p= 0. 001) and the RANZCOG pre- and post-knowledge test mean improved from 9. 56 to 15. 12 (p=< 0. 001).

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} is to explore how {{specialist}} cancer nurses carry out first assessments of patients in the community, their use of the Symptoms and Concerns Checklist (SCC) and their views on first assessments. Methods & Sample: An ethnographic approach was taken. The data were collected by use of non-participant observation of specialist nurses carrying out a first assessment of patients with cancer, followed by semi-structured interviews with six specialist nurses. Data were analysed using iterative thematic analysis. Key results: All the specialist nurses recognised the value of facilitating the patients’ narrative. Use of the SCC was seen to jar with the overall theme of building relationships during the first <b>assessment</b> <b>visit.</b> It was recognised by the specialist nurses that the SCC was beneficial in prompting the patients to discuss psycho-social concerns. Conclusions: This study gives insight into the conflict and ambiguity for specialist nurses when using the SCC during the first <b>assessment</b> <b>visit.</b> It confirms the SCC as beneficial in cueing some patients to identify specific concerns and for these concerns to be recognised by the specialist nurses...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{number of}} {{patients}} who have a pre-discharge home <b>assessment</b> <b>visit</b> following a stroke {{has been reported to}} vary nationally. The purpose of this research was to explore the factors influencing occupational therapists' decisions to complete such visits. Method: Semi-structured interviews were completed with 20 senior occupational therapists working with stroke in-patients, from a range of urban and rural locations in the United Kingdom. The interviews explored their views about those patients for whom a pre-discharge home <b>assessment</b> <b>visit</b> would and would not be required. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: Three themes were identified: the patient's level of physical, cognitive, or perceptual impairment and its impact on performance in activities of daily living; factors relating to the patient's home environment, including the availability of support within the home environment; and other influences on occupational therapists. The presence of a cognitive impairment was a particularly important factor. Conclusions: Occupational therapists balanced aspects from each of these themes in order to determine whether a visit was needed or not. Although the level of impairment was important, the most dependent patients were not necessarily those believed to be the most likely to need a visit...|$|R

40|$|Background: Numerous {{studies have}} looked at the {{potential}} benefits of various nootropic drugs such as Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761 H; TanakanH) and piracetam (NootropylH) on age-related cognitive decline often leading to inconclusive results due to small sample sizes or insufficient follow-up duration. The present study assesses the association between intake of EGb 761 H and cognitive function of elderly adults over a 20 -year period. Methods and Findings: The data were gathered from the prospective community-based cohort study ‘Paquid’. Within the study sample of 3612 non-demented participants aged 65 and over at baseline, three groups were compared: 589 subjects reporting use of EGb 761 H at {{at least one of the}} ten <b>assessment</b> <b>visits,</b> 149 subjects reporting use of piracetam at one of the <b>assessment</b> <b>visits</b> and 2874 subjects not reporting use of either EGb 761 H or piracetam. Decline on MMSE, verbal fluency and visual memory over the 20 -year follow-up was analysed with a multivariate mixed linear effects model. A significant difference in MMSE decline over the 20 -year follow-up was observed in the EGb 761 H and piracetam treatment groups compared to the ‘neither treatment ’ group. These effects were in opposite directions: the EGb 761 H group declined less rapidly than the ‘neither treatment ’ group, whereas the piracetam group declined more rapidly (b= 20. 6). Regarding verbal fluency and visual memory, no difference was observed between the EGb 761 H group and the ‘neither treatment ’ group (respectively, b = 0. 21 and b= 20. 03), whereas the piracetam group declined more rapidly (respectively, b= 21. 40 an...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{functional}} effects and acceptability of rocker-soled shoes that were designed to relatively "unload" the calf muscles during walking in people with calf claudication due to peripheral arterial disease. METHODS: In this randomised AB/BA crossover trial, participants completed two <b>assessment</b> <b>visits</b> up to two weeks apart. At each visit, participants completed walking tests whilst wearing the unloading shoes or visually-similar control shoes. At the end of the second visit, participants were given either the unloading or control shoes to use in their home environment for 2 weeks, with the instruction to wear them for at least 4 h every day. The primary outcome was 6 -min walk distance. We also assessed pain-free walking distance and gait biomechanical variables during usual-pace walking, adverse events, and participants' opinions about the shoes. Data for continuous outcomes are presented as mean difference between conditions with corresponding 95 % confidence interval. RESULTS: Thirty-four participants (27 males, mean age 68 years, mean ankle-brachial index 0. 54) completed both <b>assessment</b> <b>visits.</b> On average, the 6 -min walk distance was 11 m greater when participants wore the control shoes (95 % CI - 5 to 26), whereas mean pain-free walking distance was 7 m greater in the unloading shoes (95 % CI - 17 to 32). Neither of these differences were statistically significant (p[*]=[*] 0. 18 and p[*]=[*] 0. 55, respectively). This was despite the unloading shoes reducing peak ankle plantarflexion moment (mean difference 0. 2 Nm/kg, 95 % CI 0. 0 to 0. 3) and peak ankle power generation (mean difference 0. 6 W/kg, 95 % CI 0. 2 to 1. 0) during pain-free walking. The survey and interview data was mixed, with no clear differences between the unloading and control shoes. CONCLUSIONS: Shoes with modified soles to relatively unload the calf muscles during walking conferred no substantial acute functional benefit over control shoes.

30|$|The methods {{differed}} on {{the probability}} of early stopping under the alternative hypothesis with method 2 having the lowest probability. This is because this approach includes data from all subjects that have been randomized {{by the time of}} the interim analysis in the denominator of the estimation of the event proportion even though a subgroup of these patients would not have had any assessment of the outcome since they would not have reached their first time point for outcome assessment. The consequence is the dilution of the interim treatment effect leading to lower interim power. Method 3 also uses all available data from randomized subjects at the time of the interim analysis. However, it employs a conditional probability approach which differentiates between those subjects who have not yet had an <b>assessment</b> <b>visit</b> (i.e. censored) and who are at risk at each <b>assessment</b> <b>visit,</b> thus yielding a greater probability of early stopping. Similarly, since method 1 uses only a subset of randomized subjects at the time of the interim analysis, the estimated interim treatment effect is less diluted and, therefore, has greater probability for early stopping than method 2. Conversely, since it uses a smaller number of subjects compared with method 3, the probability for early stopping is slightly lower than method 3 in trials where the standard group event proportion is 0.5, because the variability is greater for proportions closer to 0.5. Furthermore, we observed that the probabilities for early stopping are greater using the O’Brien-Fleming boundary compared with the Haybittle-Peto boundary since it is less conservative.|$|R
