5|$|The Early English Gothic chapel of Lambeth Palace {{dates from}} work carried out while Boniface was archbishop. Boniface left England in November 1268, and never returned. He died 18 July 1270, in Savoy. He was buried {{with his family}} in the Cistercian abbey of Hautecombe in Savoy. In his will, he left {{legacies}} to <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> of the Franciscans and Dominicans in the diocese of Canterbury. His will had differing provisions for his burial depending on whether he died in England, France, or near the Alps. Oddly enough, his official seal included a head of the pagan god Jupiter Serapis along with the usual depiction of the archbishop in full vestments.|$|E

25|$|The {{result was}} that almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> of the Rione south of the Passetto were demolished, and a new grand avenue emerged: the Via della Conciliazione (named after the Treaty of 1929 between Italy and the Holy See). A few major {{buildings}} (Santa Maria in Traspontina, Palazzo Torlonia, Palazzo dei Penitenzieri) were spared because they {{were more or less}} on axis with the new road.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the mid-20th century, bed bugs {{were very}} common. According {{to a report}} by the UK Ministry of Health, in 1933, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> in many areas had some degree of bed bug infestation. The {{increase}} in bed bug populations in the early 20th century has been attributed to the advent of electric heating, which allowed bed bugs to thrive year-round instead of only in warm weather.|$|E

25|$|<b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> were {{completed}} by early 1868 {{and the school}} was in use by autumn that year. Houses built under tenders 1 and 2 {{were completed}} with internal WCs in the cellar. A change of plan in spring 1867 led houses built under tenders 3 and 4 having external ash closets. Tenders 1 and 2 houses were retrofitted with external ash closets and the WCs removed. Reasons for the change remain obscure.|$|E

25|$|In September 1778, {{revenge for}} the Wyoming defeat {{was taken by}} American Colonel Thomas Hartley who, with 200 soldiers, burned nine to twelve Seneca, Delaware and Mingo villages along the Susquehanna River in {{northeast}} Pennsylvania, including Tioga and Chemung. At the same time, Butler's Rangers attacked German Flatts in the Mohawk Valley, destroying <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> and fields in the area. Further American retaliation was soon taken by Continental Army units under William Butler (no relation to John Butler) and John Cantine, burning the substantial Indian villages at Unadilla and Onaquaga on the Susquehanna River.|$|E

25|$|Robert Burns {{lived at}} the nearby Ellisland Farm from 1788 to 1791. Burns was {{probably}} introduced to Captain Robert Riddell and his wife, Elizabeth Kennedy of Manchester, by Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, his friend and landlord. In September 1788 he composed The Day Returns as a compliment to Riddell and his wife, commenting that At their fire-side I have enjoyed more pleasant evenings than at <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> of fashionable {{people in this country}} put together. Robert had fought in the American War and was an accomplished musical composer and musician as well as an antiquarian.|$|E

Thus did Zimri destroy <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> of Baasa, {{according}} to the word of the LORD, which He spoke against Baasa by Jehu <b>the</b> prophet, for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> sins of Baasa, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and wherewith they made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, with their vanities.|$|R

It drew mixed responses, winning her both the Turner Prize for best young British artist in 1993 and the K Foundation art award for worst British artist. She was the first woman to win a Turner Prize. Tower Hamlets London Borough Council demolished House on 11 January 1994, a decision which caused some controversy itself.|$|E
25|$|Kevin {{returns home}} and rigs {{the house with}} {{numerous}} booby traps. Harry and Marv break in, springing the traps and suffering various injuries. While the duo pursues Kevin around the house, he calls the police and flees the house, luring the duo into a neighboring vacant home. Harry and Marv manage to catch him and discuss how they will get their revenge, but Marley sneaks in and knocks them unconscious with his snow shovel before they can do anything to Kevin. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> they burgled due to the latter's habit of flooding them.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Castle Vale had a {{population}} of around 20,000 people, with the first residents moving into their new homes in 1964. Many of the new residents were of Irish descent , previously living in inner-city slums such as Aston and Nechells. As well as high-rise tower blocks, Castle Vale also had 27 four-storey blocks of maisonettes, three-storey blocks of flats, over 100 bungalows and hundreds of terraced and semi-detached houses. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> had modern features that the houses of the slums lacked such as electricity, indoor toilets and central heating. Many of the houses also had gardens to the front and rear, whilst most of the flats in the tower blocks had private balconies.|$|E

25|$|In Egypt, {{the first}} home of monasticism, the {{jurisdiction}} of the abbot, or archimandrite, was but loosely defined. Sometimes he ruled over only one community, sometimes over several, each of which had its own abbot as well. Saint John Cassian speaks of an abbot of the Thebaid who had 500 monks under him. By the Rule of St Benedict, which, until the Cluniac reforms, was the norm in the West, the abbot has jurisdiction over only one community. The rule, as was inevitable, was subject to frequent violations; {{but it was not until}} the foundation of the Cluniac Order that the idea of a supreme abbot, exercising jurisdiction over <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> of an order, was definitely recognized.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of Pontiac's War {{in the summer}} of 1763, coupled with the ineffective policies of the provincial government, aroused widespread settler suspicion and hatred against all Indians in the frontier counties, without distinguishing among hostile and friendly peoples. On 14 December 1763, the Paxton Boys, led by Matthew Smith and Capt. Lazarus Stewart, attacked Conestoga, killing the six Indians present, and burning <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> Officials sheltered the tribe's fourteen survivors in protective custody in the county jail, but the Paxton Boys returned on 27 December, broke into the jail, and massacred the remaining natives. The lack of effective government control and widespread sympathy in the frontier counties for the murderers meant they were never discovered or brought to justice.|$|E

No. 63 Hurst Street shared a chimney with No. 65 Hurst Street, the front house of a pair of back to backs which were part of Court 2 Hurst Street, now demolished. No. 55 Hurst Street has a large bay window at first floor level overlooking Inge Street, which is an early feature. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> in the terrace have late 20th century shop fronts, replacing earlier ones which were installed about 1900.|$|E
