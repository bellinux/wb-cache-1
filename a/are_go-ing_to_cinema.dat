40|$|Looking back on {{the past}} decade of {{research}} on clustering algorithms, we witness two ma-jor and apparent trends: 1) The already vast amount of existing clustering algorithms, is con-tinuously broadened and 2) clustering algorithms in general, {{are becoming more and}} more adapted to specific application domains with very par-ticular assumptions. As a result, algorithms have grown complicated and/or very scenario-dependent, which made clustering a hardly ac-cessible domain for non-expert users. This is an especially critical development, since, due to increasing data gathering, the need for analysis techniques like clustering emerges in many ap-plication domains. In this paper, we oppose the current focus on specialization, by proposing our vision of a usable, guided and universally appli-cable clustering process. In detail, we <b>are</b> <b>go-ing</b> <b>to</b> describe our already conducted work and present our future research directions. ...|$|R

500|$|Whether the {{collection}} has a unified structure {{has been a}} source of debate among Hemingway critics. According to Reynolds {{the collection}} should be [...] "read as a predictable step in any young author's career" [...] and the pieces considered as [...] "discrete units". Yet he admits that Hemingway's remarks, and the complexity of the structure, suggests the stories and vignettes were meant to be an interconnected whole. In a letter to Pound in August 1923, Hemingway told him he had finished the full set of eighteen vignettes, saying of them, [...] "When they are read together, they all hook up... The bulls start, then reappear, then finish off. The war starts clear and noble just like it did... gets close and blurred and finished with the feller who goes home and gets clap." [...] He went on to say of [...] "in our time" [...] that [...] "it has form all right". On October 18, 1924, he wrote to Edmund Wilson, [...] "Finished the book of 14 stories with a chapter of 'In Our Time' between each story– that is the way they <b>are</b> meant <b>to</b> <b>go–</b> <b>to</b> give the picture of the whole before examining it in detail".|$|R
50|$|Most nouns in the Japanese {{language}} {{may be made}} polite by {{the addition}} of o- or go- as a prefix. o- is generally used for words of native Japanese origin, whereas <b>go-</b> <b>is</b> affixed <b>to</b> words of Chinese derivation. In some cases, the prefix has become a fixed part of the word, and is included even in regular speech, such as gohan 'cooked rice; meal.' Such a construction often indicates deference to either the item's owner or to the object itself. For example, the word tomodachi 'friend,' would become o-tomodachi when referring to the friend of someone of higher status (though mothers often use this form to refer to their children's friends). On the other hand, a polite speaker may sometimes refer to mizu 'water' as o-mizu in order to show politeness.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For {{distributive}} lattices, {{the so-called}} positive modal algebra was al-ready introduced by Dunn. He presented, using this notion, a canonical model and completeness theorem for positive modal logic. Following Dunn’s approach, but entirely by purely algebraic means, we introduce tense distributive algebras, i. e., bounded distributive lattices equipped with tense operators G,P,H and F. Tense operators express the quantifiers “it <b>is</b> always <b>go-ing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the case that}} ” and “it {{has always been the}} case that ” and hence enable us to express the dimension of time in a logic without negation or any kind of implication. Since distributive lattices have a nice theory of prime filters, we can generalize several approaches presented for tense Boolean algebras where a theory of ultra-filters is used. In the case when the pairs of tense operators (G,F) and (H,P) form the so-called MN-positive pairs, the representation problem of tense distributive algebras is solved. Main results Propositional logics, both clasical and non-classical, usually do not incorporate the di-mension of time. However, already Aristotle mentioned that time {{plays an important role in}} evaluation of true values of propositions. This motivated a lot of authors to investigate the so-called Temporal logic, i. e., the logic where time is considered as a variable of the propositional formula. In what follows, we will submit algebraic tools for the axiomatization of tense oper-ators on distributive lattices. The first step to the axiomatization of tense operators then will be a construction using the time frame (T,R). The second step is a solution of the representation problem in a case when the pairs of tense operators (G,F) and (H,P) form the so-called MN-positive pairs...|$|R
5000|$|Word {{beautification}} (bikago, 美化語, [...] "beautified speech", in tanka {{also sometimes}} gago, 雅語, [...] "elegant speech") is {{the practice of}} making words more polite or [...] "beautiful". This form of language is employed by the speaker to add refinement to one's manner of speech. This is commonly achieved by adding the prefix o- or <b>go-</b> <b>to</b> a word and {{used in conjunction with}} the polite form of verbs. In the following example, o before cha and senbei and the polite form of the verb are used to this effect. Generally o- is used before native Japanese words and <b>go-</b> <b>is</b> used before Sino-Japanese words, but there are exceptions.|$|R
40|$|M. A. The aim of {{the present}} essay {{is the study of}} the Resistance which took place in the area of Kalavrita and Egialia between 1941 - 1944 and how it is re-lated to the Resistance in the rest of Greece, using {{everyday}} people’s memo-ries. More specifically, we are going to find the impact of the geomorphology of the area {{on the development of the}} Resistance and the importance of the lo-cal history and traditions on the development of the patriotic feeling of the ar-ea’s citizens. Moreover, we are going to study the factors which led to the crea-tion and development of Resistance, the impact of the Communist party and ideas and of other factors, and the role of the allies’ diplomacy. Although many books and essays have been written about that period of time, the history of Greek Resistance is not complete yet, as they used to em-phasise the patriotic aspect, minimizing the importance of the Resistance in so-cial aspects, and the impact on the lives of everyday people. Moreover, most of the local history talks about the facts in the town of Kalavrita, and less is known about the Resistance in the rest of Achaia. However, there are still un-exploited sources, like interviews, diaries and photos. Their study will result in a more complete understanding of the local history and also in the preservation of these important memories of the people who were alive at that time. For this study, the quality methods of interviews and field study will be used. Qualitative analysis will be used to extract similarities and differences with other studies, so as to generate new evidence for the local history. This essay will contain 3 major parts. In the 1 st part, we are going to discuss what was happening in Greece just before the beginning of the 2 nd World War. More specifically, we will speak about the position of the Greek expedition from the day of capitulation (April 1943), till the organisation of the Resistance towards the German and Italian expeditions. Then we are going to find out what was going on in the same period in the regions of Kalavrita and Egialia (summer 1943) during the first years of the war. Moreover, we <b>are</b> <b>go-ing</b> <b>to</b> explore the everyday life of the Greek people, how the Greek society changed due to German and Italian army and the more or less important facts which helped in the organisation of the local Resistance, as these facts were presented in the local newspapers. In the first part, we are going to speak exten-sively about the birth of the Greek Resistance. We will also speak about the re-sisting organised teams, armed or not, in the local area and in the whole of Greece which were related to the Resistance. More specifically, we are going to speak about the people who took part in these teams, the way they were or-ganised and the relations they had with each other and similar European teams. Also, we are going to find out the relations with the political parties, so as to discover the political ideas of these teams. Moreover, we will talk about the le-gal and illegal mass media of the time, the way they were organised and their importance in the development of Resistance, through the newspapers and the testimonies of the people who lived of that time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Voltage-gated K {{channels}} (KV) and thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) play critical {{roles in}} controlling pulmonary arterial tone under physiological and pathological conditions. We hypothesized that TXA 2 might inhibit KV channels, thereby establishing {{a link between}} these two major pathogenic pathways in pulmonary hypertension. The TXA 2 analogue U 46619 inhibited IK(V) (Emax 56. 13. 9 %, EC 500. 0540. 019 mol/L) and depolarized pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells via activation of TP receptors. In isolated pulmonary arteries, U 46619 simultaneously increased intracellular Ca 2 concentration and contractile force, and these effects were inhibited by nifedipine or KCl (60 mmol/L). U 46619 -induced contractions were not altered by the inhibitors of tyrosine kinase genistein or Rho kinase Y- 27632 but were prevented by the nonselective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors staurosporine and calphostin C. Furthermore, these responses <b>were</b> sensitive <b>to</b> <b>Gö-</b> 6983 but insensitive to bisindolylmaleimide I and Gö- 6976. Based on the specificity of these drugs, we suggested a role for an atypical PKC in U 46619 -induced effects. Thus, treatment with a PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor markedly prevented the vasoconstriction, the inhibition of IK(V), and the depolarization induced by U 46619. Western blots showed a transient translocation of PKC from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction on stimulation with U 46619. These results indicate that TXA 2 inhibits IK(V), leading to depolarization, activation of L-type Ca 2 channels, and vasoconstriction of rat pulmonary arteries. We propose PKC as a link between TP receptor activation and KV channel inhibition. (Circ Res. 2003; 93 : 656 - 663. ...|$|R
