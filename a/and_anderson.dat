5|$|Director Wes Anderson first {{approached}} actors Schwartzman and Portman about Hotel Chevalier in 2005. Schwartzman <b>and</b> <b>Anderson</b> {{had previously}} worked on Rushmore (1998), Anderson's cult second feature, {{and had been}} living together in Schwartzman's Paris apartment {{in the months leading}} up to the shoot. Portman was approached after the director obtained her email address from Scott Rudin, producer of 2004's Closer in which she starred. The actors appeared for free, <b>and</b> <b>Anderson</b> financed the remainder of the production himself.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the War Games match, Zbyszko was kicked out of the Alliance for causing the Alliance loss. Soon after the Alliance disintegrated, Paul E. Dangerously left WCW. Eaton <b>and</b> <b>Anderson</b> continued to team after the Alliance fell apart, now managed by Michael Hayes. Eaton <b>and</b> <b>Anderson</b> worked in the tag team division until new WCW booker Bill Watts fired Eaton along with a number of other WCW regulars in a cost-cutting measure.|$|E
5|$|Charlie's first notable storyline was {{a lesbian}} {{relationship}} with Joey Collins (Kate Bell). The storyline was implemented by producers to boost ratings <b>and</b> <b>Anderson</b> said it helped portray Charlie's vulnerable side. The storyline angered Christian and conservative oriented family groups. They complained that Home and Away had featured sexualised plotlines unsuitable for children, and Channel Seven was inundated with parental complaints stating that children {{should not be}} exposed to same-sex relationships in a family show. Viewership declined after transmission of the storyline and producers cut scenes to attune to viewers' wishes, which outraged the LGBT community. The storyline came to a natural end <b>and</b> <b>Anderson</b> and executive producer Cameron Welsh praised the plot because it portrayed a real-life situation and denounced the conservative views as outdated. Anderson stated that the storyline was a great one to portray in terms of acting.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{findings}} of Rae <b>and</b> <b>Anderson,</b> the Admiralty did not plan another search of its own. Britain officially labelled the crew deceased in service on 31 March 1854. Lady Franklin, failing to convince the government to fund another search, personally commissioned one more expedition under Francis Leopold McClintock. The expedition ship, the steam schooner Fox, bought via public subscription, sailed from Aberdeen on 2 July 1857.|$|E
5|$|Manahan <b>and</b> <b>Anderson,</b> now legally called Anastasia Manahan, became {{well known}} in the Charlottesville area as eccentrics. Though Jack Manahan was wealthy, they lived in squalor with large numbers of dogs and cats, and piles of garbage. On 20 August 1979, Anderson was taken to Charlottesville's Martha Jefferson Hospital with an {{intestinal}} obstruction. A gangrenous tumor and a length of intestine were removed by Dr. Richard Shrum.|$|E
5|$|The album's {{original}} cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, bearded man in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, <b>and</b> <b>Anderson</b> later felt {{it would have been}} better to have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by Chrysalis Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman <b>and</b> <b>Anderson</b> have different accounts of level of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both the front and back covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E

Following {{the release of}} The X-Files: I Want to Believe, Carter, Spotnitz, Duchovny, <b>and</b> <b>Anderson</b> all expressed their interest in making one. However, on January 17, 2015, Fox Television Group chairman and CEO Gary Newman revealed that there was network interest in reviving The X-Files, not as a movie franchise, but as a limited run television event.|$|E

5|$|Neddermeyer {{contributed to}} the {{research}} {{which led to the}} 1932 discovery of the positron, for which Anderson was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. That year, Neddermeyer <b>and</b> <b>Anderson</b> discovered the muon, using cloud chamber measurements of cosmic rays. Their discovery predated Hideki Yukawa's 1935 theory of mesons that postulated the particle as mediating the nuclear force. Anderson and Neddermeyer collaborated with Millikan in high altitude studies of cosmic rays, which confirmed Robert Oppenheimer's theory that the air showers produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays contained electrons. They also obtained the first evidence that gamma rays can generate positrons.|$|E

Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence {{a new generation of}} artists, particularly Black Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists like New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States.|$|E
