40|$|Teacher {{education}} is a significant component in CWU’s academic profile, with about 1500 quarter credits of instruction provided by the Professional Education Program alone. The 32 endorsement programs in three colleges require at least that many more. More than 500 student teachers each year are assessed with the edTeacher Performance Assessment (edTPA), and in turn their component scores are aggregated to assess the teacher preparation programs that {{must be approved by}} the state. Furthermore, these scores are published, and reflect directly on the stature of CWU. We are particularly vulnerable in several subtests of the edTPA, which are complicated by the complexity and range of all the programs under the <b>accreditation</b> <b>unit.</b> We have recently achieved state approval for another five years, but we must still deliver on the promises we have made to continue improvement. There is a need for intuitive understanding of the logic and purpose of the edTPA instead of the coercive nature of its being a very expensive high stakes test. This orientation activity uses an original instructional method informed by current theory and research regarding student engagement, self-regulation, and multiple modalities. An ongoing challenge in teacher {{education is}} to “walk the talk”, that is, to employ the very instructional methods that we promote.

Studies have documented high interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs, which may impair the success of HAART if not managed properly. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a useful diagnostic tool that helps clinicians to optimize drug doses so that drug concentrations associated with the highest therapeutic efficacy are obtained with a reduced risk of concentration-dependent adverse effects. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether use of TDM improves clinical outcomes and cost of illness. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at L Sacco University Hospital in Milan, Italy, in HIV-infected patients aged ≥ 18 years with at least one prescription of antiretroviral drugs for which TDM was applied. The inclusion period was from January 2010 to December 2011, with a follow-up period of up to 12 months. Laboratory and administrative databases were analyzed and matched with each other. Results: The cohort consisted of 5, 347 patients (3, 861 males and 1, 486 females) of mean age 43. 9 ± 12. 5 years. We found that TDM had been used in 143 of these patients, among whom adherence with therapy was significantly higher than among those in whom TDM had not been used (94 % versus 78 %). In TDM-controlled patients, the mean length of HIV-related hospitalization stay and mean cost of hospitalization were significantly reduced with respect to those observed in the group in which TDM had not been used (7. 21 days versus 29. 47 days and € 293 versus € 688, respectively). Conclusion: Inclusion of TDM as part of routine clinical optimization of drug dosing in HIV-infected patients is associated with higher adherence to therapy, reduced length of hospitalization stay, and reduced cost of illness.

40|$|Heart rhythm (HR) {{management}} is rapidly developing as a subspecialty within cardiology {{and it is}} imperative to promote and ensure sufficient and homogeneous training and qualification among professionals in Europe. This encouraged the European Society of Cardiology, through the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), to organize a European Core Curriculum for the HR specialist through the following: definition of the scope of the HR speciality (Syllabus), development of minimum standards and objectives for training in HR management (Curriculum), development of a model to certify HR professionals and teaching <b>units</b> (<b>Accreditation),</b> and development of a Registry for European HR accredited professionals and teaching units and their activity (Registries). The duration of the training period should be of a minimum of 2 years following general cardiology training. During this period, the trainee must develop the required knowledge, practical skills, behaviours, and attitudes to manage HR patients. The trainee must be involved in a minimum number of different procedures and achieve specified levels of competence. The training centre should be integrated within a full-service cardiology department. Assessment of the trainee and the training programmes should include reports by the training programme supervisor and the national society HR organizations, a logbook of procedures, written examinations, and assessment of professionalism. The EHRA presently requires the trainee to pass the EHRA accreditation exams (invasive EP and cardiac pacing and ICDs).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although {{endovascular}} abdominal {{aortic aneurysm}} (AAA) repair (EVAR) is widely accepted for elective surgery, the uptake of emergency EVAR for ruptured AAA (REVAR) has trailed behind. This study {{was intended to}} identify the barriers to widespread application of REVAR in Australia and New Zealand. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey {{of members of the}} Australia and New Zealand Society of Vascular Surgeons was performed in late 2013. Primary themes explored were (1) perceived barriers to performing REVAR and (2) advantages of REVAR compared with open repair. Secondary data measures were the volume of AAA surgery, standard protocol use, and staff <b>accreditation</b> among vascular <b>units.</b> RESULTS: A total of 85 surgeons responded to an anonymous online questionnaire (41 % response rate); of these, 23 surgeons (27 %) had no experience with REVAR, and 65 % currently perform more EVAR than open repair for elective procedures, compared with 18 % for ruptured AAA. Of the perceived barriers explored, respondents agreed that poor availability of endovascular facilities (73 % agreed or strongly agreed) and ancillary staff (56 %) were barriers to REVAR. Most surgeons agreed that the advantages of REVAR include reduced intraoperative blood loss, length of stay, and postoperative complications. Four of 11 vascular units performing REVAR had standard protocols in use, and four had mandatory staff accreditation. CONCLUSIONS: The most common barrier to REVAR identified by surgeons was the poor availability of endovascular facilities, many of which are not ideally suited for this type of procedure. Australian and New Zealand vascular units have low rates of standard protocol use and staff accreditation for REVAR, which may have implications for patient care.

40|$|Quality {{patient care}} is {{frequently}} measured through {{analysis of the}} communication systems prevalent in nursing <b>units.</b> <b>Accreditation</b> agencies frequently use nursing records and documentation of nursing activities as objective measures of quality of patient care. Moreover, proper documentation tools are essential to help nurses in better communication and hence, improving their nursing care. The present study was designed with the aim to assess the availability {{of different types of}} reports and records used in the inpatient units at the Alexandria Main University Hospital and the pattern of their documentation, assess nurses' knowledge and learning needs for documentation and develop a manual to improve nursing communication system. The manual will be a tangible written document available for nurses and as a way to conceptualize and present program contents that will meet the goal and captivate the interest of the diverse learning group, instead of a single workshop as a teaching strategy that would do little to influence long term learning and achieve a sustained ciiange in behavior. The study included two general medical and two general surgical units, all nurses assigned to these four units who were available {{at the time of the}} study (50 nurses) and a representative sample of medical records (40 records) of patients admitted to the study units during the period of data collection were reviewed. The study revealed that some nursing records and reports are totally omitted and most of the general criteria of documentation were not met by the nursing staff with a negative effect on quality of recording and hence the quality of nursing care provided. Moreover, assessment of the nurses' knowledge and learning needs regarding the communication process and the' documentation system showed a dire need for developing a manual to meet their learning needs and upgrade their communication skills for improving quality of care.

40|$|In 2008 by {{royal decree}} article 20, of law 44 / 2003, for the {{management}} of health professionals was implemented. The law covers among other things multi/professional teaching units in the form of: 1. - Multidisciplinary specialties: namely those specialties for witch studentes can attedn at different stages. 2. - Related specialties: specialties namely those that affect health care care related fields. These multidisciplinary teaching units, like all postgraduate teaching units will be recognized by the ministry of Health according to the procedure laid dowwn in Article 263 of law 44 / 2003 in accordance with the general and specific requirements approved by the Ministries of Health and Consumer Education for each of the specilaties that are in them. The multidisciplinary nature teaching units listed in appendix II of Royal Decree 183 / 2008, specialists will train nurses. Several papers published by the ministry of health and social policy in 2009 - 2010 approve and support the training programs for the specialties of geriatric nursing, pediatric, family and community medicine. We sought to determine whether the rules governing the training programs had relevant impact on hospital libraries that have multidisciplinary teaching units. A second aspect of analysis is the consistency of the training programs forecasts with teacher certification requirements adopted jointly by the minisries of education and health. Methods: The description of courses is published in the official bulletin of the ministry of health to approve the training progrmas of nursing specialties and the criteria for <b>accreditation</b> of teaching <b>units</b> are avaible on the ministry website of the Ministry of Health, Social Policy and Equality.
