40|$|Average-value {{models are}} {{commonly}} used {{in the design and}} analysis of power electronic based systems. There are numerous <b>averaging</b> methodologies that have been developed that are applicable to specific classes of power electronic circuits including state-space <b>averaging,</b> canonical cell <b>averaging,</b> switch <b>averaging,</b> sampled-data modeling, and multi-rate <b>averaging.</b> Historically, the development of each <b>averaging</b> technique and the extensions thereof was motivated by a specific converter topology for which previous <b>averaging</b> techniques were inaccurate or cumbersome. In general, when a new converter topology is encountered, it is typically not clear as to which <b>averaging</b> technique or extension should be used for that converter. Consequently, substantial analytical effort is generally required to develop and implement the corresponding average-value model. In this research, three automated <b>averaging</b> techniques have been developed that differ in complexity and/or the range of applicability. The first of these techniques is automated state-space <b>averaging</b> that is shown to produce accurate small- and large-displacement <b>averaged</b> models for PWM controlled converters and inverters in which the switching intervals are functions only of control inputs. The second technique extends automated state-space <b>averaging</b> to accurately predict low-frequency small-displacement responses for converters in which the switching intervals are state-dependent. Finally, an observer-based automated <b>averaging</b> method is set forth that accurately portrays both small- and large-displacement responses for both classes of converters. Each <b>averaging</b> technique is verified by comparison with established analytical and numerical methods. ...|$|R
40|$|Simple Eulerian <b>averaging</b> of velocities, density, and tracers at {{constant}} {{position is}} the most natural way of <b>averaging.</b> However, Eulerian <b>averaging</b> gives incorrect watermass distributions and properties as well as spurious diabatic circulations such as the Deacon cell. Instead of <b>averaging</b> at constant height, <b>averaging</b> along isopycnals removes such fictitious mixing and diabatic circulations. Such isopycnal <b>averaging</b> is normally performed at constant latitude, that is, <b>averaging</b> along isopynals as they heave up and down. As a result, height information is lost and the sea surface becomes much warmer (or lighter) than with simple Eulerian <b>averaging.</b> In fact, <b>averaging</b> can be performed along arbitrarily aligned surfaces. This study considers a particular case in which isopycnal <b>averaging</b> is performed at constant height. Thus, this new isopycnal <b>averaging</b> follows isopycnals as they meander horizontally at constant z. Height information is now retained {{at the cost of}} losing latitudinal information. The advantage of this <b>averaging</b> is that it avoids the problem of giving a surface that is too warm. Associated with this new isopycnal <b>averaging,</b> a “vertical” transport streamfunction in (?, z) space can be defined, in analogy to the conventional meridional overturning streamfunction in (y, ?) space. Here in Part I, this constant-height isopycnal <b>averaging</b> is explained and illustrated in an idealized zonal channel model. In Part II {{the relationship between the two}} different isopycnal averagings and the Eulerian mean eddy flux divergence is explored...|$|R
40|$|In {{equilibrium}} systems, {{time and}} ensemble <b>averages</b> of physical quantities are equivalent due to ergodic exploration of phase space. In driven systems, {{it is unknown}} if a similar equivalence of time and ensemble <b>averages</b> exists. We explore effective limits of such convergence in a sheared bubble raft using <b>averages</b> of the bubble velocities. In independent experiments, <b>averaging</b> over time leads to well converged velocity profiles. However, the time-averages from independent experiments result in distinct velocity <b>averages.</b> Ensemble <b>averages</b> are approximated by randomly selecting bubble velocities from independent experiments. Increasingly better approximations of ensemble <b>averages</b> converge toward a unique velocity profile. Therefore, the experiments establish that in practical realizations of non-equilibrium systems, temporal <b>averaging</b> and ensemble <b>averaging</b> can yield convergent (stationary) but distinct distributions.
