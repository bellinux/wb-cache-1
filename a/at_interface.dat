Materials and methodsTwenty-four cavities were prepared (Inlay) on the mesial-occlusal-distal surfaces of twenty-four human freshly extracted premolars. CEREC III (Sirona) is used to prepare ceramic restorations by milling blocs (Vita Blocs Esthetic Line for CEREC/inlab German made) with 1 M 1 shade and K 12. Suitable Ceramic restorations for cavities were obtained. All samples of ceramic restorations were divided into three groups and were cemented with three types of luting resin cement as the following: Bistite II DC, Perma Flo DC and Multilink Automix, then the Plasma Arc light cure unit was used to cure cement. All restorations were finished and immersed in 0. 5 % basic fuchsine solution for 24 h. The specimens were cut in the mesio-distal direction and then evaluated for microleakage. ResultsThe data were analyzed using chi-square statistical test with significance 0. 05. A relationship between the degree of microleakage and the type of cement <b>at</b> <b>interface</b> tooth structure/luting cement has been found. No statistical difference was found between the type of cement and microleakage degree <b>at</b> <b>interface</b> luting cement/CEREC III restoration.

40|$|Zeta {{potential}} is a physico-chemical parameter {{of particular importance}} to describe sorption of contaminants at the surface of gas bubbles. Nevertheless, the interpretation of electrophoretic mobilities of gas bubbles is complex. This {{is due to the}} specific behavior of the gas <b>at</b> <b>interface</b> and to the excess of electrical charge <b>at</b> <b>interface,</b> which is responsible for surface conductivity. We developed a surface complexation model based on the presence of negative surface sites because the balance of accepting and donating hydrogen bonds is broken <b>at</b> <b>interface.</b> By considering protons adsorbed on these sites followed by a diffuse layer, the electrical potential at the head-end of the diffuse layer is computed and considered to be equal to the zeta potential. The predicted zeta potential values are in very good agreement with the experimental data of H- 2 bubbles for a broad range of pH and NaCl concentrations. This implies that the shear plane is located at the head-end of the diffuse layer, contradicting the assumption of the presence of a stagnant diffuse layer at the gas/water interface. Our model also successfully predicts the surface tension of air bubbles in a KCl solution. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
