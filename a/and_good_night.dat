60|$|They are all awake now, the {{children}} excepted, {{and most of}} them sit up, to stare. Wheresoever Mr. Rogers turns the flaming eye, there is a spectral figure rising, unshrouded, from a grave of rags. Who is the landlord here? - I am, Mr. Field! says a bundle of ribs and parchment against the wall, scratching itself. - Will you spend this money fairly, in the morning, to buy coffee for 'em all? - Yes, sir, I will! - O he'll do it, sir, he'll do it fair. He's honest! cry the spectres. And with thanks <b>and</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Night</b> sink into their graves again.|$|E

'Very well, white man,' {{answered}} the savage indifferently; 'only remember if thy answer is late thy little white bud will never {{grow into a}} flower, that is all, for I shall cut it with this,' and he touched the spear. 'I should have thought that thou wouldst play a trick and attack us at night, but I know from {{the woman with the}} girl that your men are down at the coast, and that thou hast but twenty men here. It is not wise, white man,' he added with a laugh, 'to keep so small a garrison for your [...] "boma" [...] [kraal]. Well, good night, <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>night</b> to you also, other white men, whose eyelids I shall soon close once and for all. At dawn thou wilt bring me word.

6000|$|My {{talk with}} Florac lasted for some time: at its close, {{when we went}} to join the ladies in the drawing-room, we found Ethel cloaked and shawled, and {{prepared}} for her departure with her young ones, who were already asleep. The little festival was over, and had ended in melancholy--even in weeping. Our hostess sate in her accustomed seat by her lamp and her worktable; but, neglecting her needle, she was having perpetual recourse to her pocket-handkerchief, and uttering ejaculations of pity between the intervals of her gushes of tears. Madame de Florac was in her usual place, her head cast downwards, and her hands folded. My wife was at her side, a grave commiseration showing itself in Laura's countenance, whilst I read a yet deeper sadness in Ethel's pale face. Miss Newcome's carriage had been announced; the attendants had already carried the young ones asleep to the vehicle; and she was in the act of taking leave. We looked round at this disturbed party, guessing very likely what the subject of their talk had been, to which, however, Miss Ethel did not allude: but, announcing that she had intended to depart without disturbing the two gentlemen, she bade us farewell <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>night.</b> [...] "I wish I could say a merry Christmas," [...] she added gravely, [...] "but none of us, I fear, can hope for that." [...] It was evident that Laura had told the last chapter of the Colonel's story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course they}} will come to a bad end, Macumazahn," [...] she went on in a soft, thick voice, [...] "for I and all with whom I have to do were 'torn out of the reeds' [i.e. created] that way. And that's why I won't tempt you to run away with me any more, as I meant to do when I saw you, because it is true, Macumazahn {{you are the only}} man I ever liked or ever shall like; and you know I could make you run away with me if I chose, {{although}} I am black and you are white--oh, yes, before to-morrow morning. But I won't do it; for why should I catch you in my unlucky web and bring you into all sorts of trouble among my people and your own? Go you your road, Macumazahn, and I will go mine as the wind blows me. And now give me a cup of water and let me be away--a cup of water, no more. Oh, do not be afraid for me, or melt too much, lest I should melt also. I have an escort waiting over yonder hill. There, thank you for your water, Macumazahn, <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>night.</b> Doubtless we shall meet again ere long, and-- I forgot; the Little Wise One {{said he would like to}} have a talk with you. Good night, Macumazahn, good night. I trust that you did a profitable trade with Umbezi my father and Masapo my husband. I wonder why such men as these should have been chosen to be my father and my husband. Think it over, Macumazahn, and tell me when next we meet. Give me that pretty mirror, Macumazahn; when I look in it I shall see you as well as myself, and that will please me--you don't know how much. I thank you. Good night." ...|$|E
6000|$|High on the farm-house hearth, {{the first}} autumn fire was kindled; [...] Scintillant hickory bark and dryest limbs of the beech-tree [...] Burned, where {{all summer long}} the boughs of {{asparagus}} flourished. [...] Wild were the children with mirth, and grouping and clinging [...] together, [...] Danced with the dancing flame, and lithely swayed with its humor; [...] Ran to the window-panes, and peering forth into the darkness, [...] Saw there another room, flame-lit, and with frolicking children. [...] (Ah! by such phantom hearths, I think that we sit with our [...] first-loves!) [...] Sometimes they tossed on the floor, and sometimes they hid in the [...] corners, [...] Shouting and laughing aloud, and never resting a moment, [...] In the rude delight, the boisterous gladness of childhood,-- [...] Cruel as summer sun and singing-birds to the heartsick. [...] Clement sat in his chair unmoved {{in the midst of}} the hubbub, [...] Rapt, with unseeing eyes; and unafraid in their gambols, [...] By his tawny beard the children caught him, and clambered [...] Over his knees, and waged a mimic warfare across them, [...] Made him their battle-ground, and won and lost kingdoms upon him. [...] Airily to and fro, and out of one room to another [...] Passed his cousin, and busied herself with things of the household, [...] Nonchalant, debonair, blithe, with bewitching housewifely [...] importance, [...] Laying the cloth for the supper, and bringing the meal from the [...] kitchen; [...] Fairer than ever she seemed, and more than ever she mocked him, [...] Coming behind his chair, and clasping her fingers together [...] Over his eyes in a girlish caprice, and crying, [...] "Who is it?" [...] Vexed his despair with a vision of wife and of home and of [...] children, [...] Calling his sister's children around her, and stilling their [...] clamor, [...] Making believe they were hers. And Clement sat moody and silent, [...] Blank to the wistful gaze of his mother bent on his visage [...] With the tender pain, the pitiful, helpless devotion [...] Of the mother that looks on the face of her son in his trouble, [...] Grown beyond her consoling, and knows that she cannot befriend him. [...] Then his cousin laughed, and in idleness talked with the children; [...] Sometimes she turned to him, and then when the thistle was falling, [...] Caught it and twined it again in her hair, and called it her [...] keepsake, [...] Smiled, and made him ashamed of his petulant gift there, before [...] them. [...] But, when the night was grown old and the two by the hearthstone [...] together [...] Sat alone in the flickering red of the flame, and the cricket [...] Carked to the stillness, and ever, with sullen throbs of the [...] pendule [...] Sighed the time-worn clock for the death of the days that were [...] perished,-- [...] It was her whim to be sad, and she brought him the book they were [...] reading. [...] "Read it to-night," [...] she said, [...] "that I may not seem to be going." [...] Said, and mutely reproached him with all the pain she had wrought [...] him. [...] From her hand he took the volume and read, and she listened,-- [...] All his voice molten in secret tears, and ebbing and flowing, [...] Now with a faltering breath, and now with impassioned abandon,-- [...] Read from the book of a poet the rhyme of the fatally sundered, [...] Fatally met too late, and their love was their guilt and their [...] anguish, [...] But in the night they rose, and fled away into the darkness, [...] Glad of all dangers and shames, and even of death, for their love's [...] sake. [...] Then, when his voice brake hollowly, falling and fading to [...] silence, [...] Thrilled in the silence they sat, and durst not behold one another, [...] Feeling that wild temptation, that tender, ineffable yearning, [...] Drawing them heart to heart. One blind, mad moment of passion [...] With their fate they strove; but out of the pang of the conflict, [...] Through such costly triumph as wins a waste and a famine, [...] Victors they came, and Love retrieved the error of loving. [...] So, foreknowing the years, and sharply discerning the future, [...] Guessing the riddle of life, and accepting the cruel solution,-- [...] Side by side they sat, as far as the stars are asunder. [...] Carked the cricket no more, but while the audible silence [...] Shrilled in their ears, she, suddenly rising and dragging the [...] thistle [...] Out of her clinging hair, laughed mockingly, casting it from her: [...] "Perish the thorns and splendor,--the bloom and the sweetness are [...] perished. [...] Dreary, respectable calm, polite despair, and one's Duty,-- [...] These and the world, for dead Love!--The end of these modern [...] romances! [...] Better than yonder rhyme?... Pleasant dreams <b>and</b> <b>good</b> <b>night,</b> Cousin [...] Clement." ...|$|E
