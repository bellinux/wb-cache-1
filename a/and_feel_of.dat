Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film.|$|E

A father-son duo of Georgia Tech alums attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at Sanford Stadium in Athens.

5|$|Though Disney gave Nomura {{freedom in}} the {{characters}} and worlds used for the games, {{he and his staff}} tried to stay within the established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds. Nomura has stated that though many of the Disney characters are not normally dark and serious, there were not many challenges making them so for the story, and despite this, their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics. He also felt managing and keeping multiple worlds was problematic. When deciding which worlds to include in the game, the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting and made an effort to minimize any overlap in the overall look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> each world.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Willamette University {{purchased}} the old building from the YWCA. The $1.35 million purchase included the main YWCA building {{adjacent to the}} former library {{for a total of}} , with the YWCA continuing their operations in the building for three years after the sale. After that group left the building in 2006, Willamette spent $4.6 million ($2 million more than originally planned) to remodel the old library building over a year's time and convert it into the Oregon Civic Justice Center as part of the College of Law. The remodeling project began in the summer of 2007 and included removing a swimming pool structure that had been added to the south of the building, while also adding a new entrance to the former library on the same side as where the pool was located. Renovations also removed a mezzanine that the YWCA had added to the upper portion of the main floor. Other renovations included new heating, cooling, and ventilation systems, upgrades for technology, all while retaining the historical look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the original 1912 building.|$|E
5|$|Pillsbury's {{management}} {{made several}} attempts at reorganization or {{restructuring of the}} restaurant chain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The most prominent change came in 1978 when Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. In a plan called Operation Phoenix, Smith initiated a restructuring of corporate business practices {{at all levels of}} the company. Changes to the company included updated franchise agreements, a broadening of the menu, and new store designs to standardize the look <b>and</b> <b>feel</b> <b>of</b> the company. While these efforts were initially effective, many of them were eventually discarded, resulting in Burger King falling into a fiscal slump that damaged the financial performance of both Burger King and its parent. Poor operating performance and ineffectual leadership continued to bog the company down for many years, even after it was acquired in 1989 by the British entertainment conglomerate Grand Metropolitan and its successor Diageo. Eventually, the institutional neglect of the brand by Diageo damaged the company to the point where major franchises were driven out of business and its total value was significantly decreased. Diageo eventually decided to divest itself of the loss-making chain and put the company up for sale in 2000.|$|E
