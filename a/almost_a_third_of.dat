5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression.

5|$|The castle {{was built}} between 1220 and 1223, during {{the rule of}} the Prince of Achaea Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, {{as a result of a}} dispute between the Prince and the clergy of the Principality. Geoffrey had asked the clergy, which owned <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the Principality's lands but was not obliged to render {{military}} service, for additional donations to help defend the realm. When the clergy refused, claiming that they owed allegiance only to the Pope, Geoffrey confiscated Church property, and began construction of Chlemoutsi with the new funds. The fortress was set on a new foundation, with no previous structure identifiable on this site. Its French name, Clairmont or Clermont, most probably gave rise to the Greek form of Chlomoutsi, which more recently became Chlemoutsi, although various theories have been proposed as to the name's origin, with suggestions of Greek, Albanian or Slavic roots pre-dating the Frankish fortress. From the 15th century, Italian sources came to call it Castel Tornese, apparently through a confusion with the seat of the Principality's mint in nearby Glarentza, which until the middle of the 14th century minted silver tornese coins.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Aarhus is {{predominantly}} knowledge and service based, {{strongly influenced by}} the University of Aarhus and the large healthcare industry. The service sector dominates the economy and is growing as the city is transitioning away from manufacturing. Trade and transportation remain important sectors benefiting from the large port and central position on the rail network. Manufacturing has been in slow but steady decline since the 1960s while agriculture long has been a marginal employer within the municipality. The municipality is home to 175,000 jobs with some 100,000 {{in the private sector}} and the rest split between state, region and municipality. The region is a major agricultural producer, with many large farms in the outlying districts. People commute to Aarhus {{from as far away as}} Randers, Silkeborg and Skanderborg and <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> those employed within Aarhus municipality commute from neighbouring communities.

With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the distance to the Hongorai, for just one man wounded. Further progress was made over the next week, but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun, mines and other improvised explosive devices. After this, the 15th Brigade's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour, to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines. The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also. To negate the effectiveness of the Australian tanks, the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads, forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support. Additionally, the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry, which they kept under constant observation and fire.|$|E

40|$|To combat illegal land {{occupation}} the {{municipalities of}} Utrecht (the Netherlands) and León (Nicaragua) set up an overall urban development plan for León, finally resulting in the León Southeast (LSE) project. With this project the municipality offers cheap plots to low-income households which, after repaying it, build their houses through self-help housing in newly urbanised neighbourhoods, prepared by sites-and-services by the municipality. Though relatively successful, after <b>almost</b> <b>a</b> decade <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> the households have not built a house yet. In addition, there are also uninhabited, unfinished and demolished houses. Central to this thesis is to understand why households have not moved to the new neighbourhood where they own a plot. The project offers {{a wide array of}} opportunities to low-income households in order to get access to plots and self-help housing, including low-cost plots; sites-and services; cooperation housing NGOs; and access to financial and technical assistance. However, even with all actors involved, in many cases low-income households have such a low and vulnerable socio-economic status that they cannot cope with external shocks, leaving them financially incapable to build a house or unable to maintain living in the house they already built.

This was the case for all ethnic groups except Other White, where the proportions were the same (39%). The pattern for inter-ethnic relationships for those married or in a civil partnership and those who were cohabiting was similar to the overall picture of inter-ethnic relationships across the ethnic groups - with the Mixed/Multiple ethnic groups as the most likely and White British the least likely. The largest differences between people who were married and cohabiting were in the Asian ethnic groups. Bangladeshis who were cohabiting were nearly seven times more likely to be in an inter-ethnic relationship than Bangladeshis who were married or in a civil partnership (39% compared with 6%).

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the loss of human life was not limited to Ebola victims alone. Many hospitals had to shut down, leaving people with other medical needs without care. A spokesperson for the UK-based health foundation, the Wellcome Trust, said in October 2014 that [...] "the additional death toll from malaria and other diseases is likely to exceed that of the outbreak itself". Dr Paul Farmer stated: [...] "Most of Ebola's victims may well be dying from other causes: women in childbirth, children from diarrhoea, people in road accidents or from trauma of other sorts."As the epidemic drew to a close in 2015, a report from Sierra Leone showed that the fear and mistrust of hospitals generated by the epidemic had resulted in an 11% decline in facility-based births, and that those receiving care before or after birth fell by about a fifth.

Despite the replacement of forest by agriculture the forest area was being increased by the afforestation of waste lands. The reclamation of waste lands principally for afforestation needed active promotion, although cost had to be considered. Management had to be based on production.
