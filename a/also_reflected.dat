5|$|Nevertheless, the FVdG's Rhineland and Westphalia section {{merged with}} left {{communist}} unions {{to form the}} Free Workers' Union (FAU) in September 1919. Syndicalists from the FVdG were {{the biggest and most}} dominant faction in the FAU. The FAU's statutes mostly reflected compromises by the federation's member unions, but <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> the FVdG's significant influence.|$|E
5|$|Since 1922, nine Irish {{definitive}} stamp series {{have been}} released. Besides different designs, there were changes involving the watermark and eventually {{doing away with}} watermarked paper, changes in currency were <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> on the stamps: decimalisation in 1971, and Euro changeover in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In early 1971, Rainbow played {{its first}} show, which {{consisted}} of two sets performed at Richmond Community College in Staten Island. After the show, the group discovered that there was already another band called Rainbow. They decided to drop the name, {{and came up with}} the name Wicked Lester, which Klein liked because it was unusual. While the decision to change the group's name came partly out of a desire to avoid any potential legal issues, it <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> Klein and Eisen's desire to start playing more original compositions.|$|E
5|$|The Brancacci Chapel, in the {{basilica}} of Santa Maria del Carmine, was founded around 1366/7 by Piero di Piuvichese Brancacci. The chapel passed to Piero's nephew, Felice Brancacci, who some time between 1423 and 1425 commissioned the painter Masolino {{to decorate the}} walls {{with a series of}} frescoes from the life of Saint Peter. Peter was the name-saint of the founder, and the patron saint of the Brancacci family, but the choice <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> support for the Roman papacy during the Great Schism.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean pantheon already {{included}} many divinities that were subsequently encountered in Classical Greece, {{although it is}} difficult to determine whether these deities had the characteristics and responsibilities that would be attributed to them in later periods. In general, the same divinities were worshipped throughout the Mycenaean palatial world. There may be some indications for local deities at various sites, in particular in Crete. The uniformity of Mycenaean religion is <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> in archaeological evidence with the phi- and psi-figurines that have been found all over Late Bronze Age Greece.|$|E

5|$|The Seven Fold Way is <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> in the group's initiatory system, {{which has}} seven grades {{through which the}} member can {{gradually}} progress. Theses are: (1) Neophyte, (2) Initiate, (3) External Adept, (4) Internal Adept, (5) Master/Mistress, (6) Grand Master/Mousa and (7) Immortal. The group has revealed that very few of its members raise to the fifth and sixth degrees, and in a 1989 article the ONA stated that at that point there were only four individuals who had reached the stage of Master.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy is}} mainly based on {{agriculture}} and this, along with tourism, {{has contributed to}} the rural and seaside character of the Riding. These aspects are <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> in the places of interest to visitors and major landmarks, which include historic buildings, nature reserves and the Yorkshire Wolds Way long-distance footpath. The open and maritime aspects and lack of major urban developments have also led to the county being allocated relatively high targets for the generation of energy from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|The final Delrina-branded {{version of}} WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the {{subsequent}} version 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was purely a marketing decision, based on {{keeping up with}} the suite of products in Microsoft Office which were then at the same number. It <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> the development effort required to develop the first full 32-bit application version, designed to work with the Windows 95 operating system, which set it apart from its competition at the time.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech blocked {{all three}} Cincinnati extra point attempts, while Virginia Tech's sole extra point kick missed. Cincinnati's kicking woes were <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> in their punting game. Cincinnati {{averaged}} just 19 yards a punt, setting {{the record for}} the lowest punting average in Sun Bowl history. All 24 of the game's points were scored in the second half. Virginia Tech earned just 34 rushing yards against the Bearcats' defense while allowing 369 yards to Cincinnati's rushing offense. Those two totals are the least-gained and most-allowed marks in Virginia Tech bowl game history.|$|E
5|$|At Kaufmann's request, Denver artist Allen Tupper True {{was hired}} to handle the design and {{decoration}} of the walls and floors of the new dam. True's design scheme incorporated motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of the region. Although some initially were opposed to these designs, True was given the go-ahead and was officially appointed consulting artist. With {{the assistance of the}} National Laboratory of Anthropology, True researched authentic decorative motifs from Indian sand paintings, textiles, baskets and ceramics. The images and colors are based on Native American visions of rain, lightning, water, clouds, and local animals— lizards, serpents, birds— and on the Southwestern landscape of stepped mesas. In these works, which are integrated into the walkways and interior halls of the dam, True <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> on the machinery of the operation, making the symbolic patterns appear both ancient and modern.|$|E
5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E

5|$|Little {{history is}} {{available}} in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt (and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This period saw the Kassites destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the Hyksos destroy the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> heavy influence from Asiatic cultures. Under their new cultural influences, the people of the New Kingdom began using oboes, trumpets, lyres, lutes, castanets, and cymbals.|$|E
5|$|Since ancient times, the Chinese {{believed}} in a folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. The Chinese believed Tao and the afterlife was a reality {{parallel to the}} living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in Tang dynasty art. This is <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up {{in the realm of}} the dead, only to come back and report their experiences.|$|E
5|$|Some new bands, such as London's Alternative TV, Edinburgh's Rezillos, and Leamington's the Shapes, {{identified}} with the scene even as they pursued more experimental music. Others of a comparatively traditional rock 'n' roll bent were also swept up by the movement: the Vibrators, formed as a pub rock–style act in February 1976, soon adopted a punk look and sound. A few even longer-active bands including Surrey neo-mods the Jam and pub rockers the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer also became associated with the punk rock scene. Alongside the musical roots shared with their American counterparts and the calculated confrontationalism of the early Who, the British punks <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> the influence of glam rock and related bands such as Slade, T.Rex, and Roxy Music. One of the groups openly acknowledging that influence were the Undertones, from Derry in Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} originated {{during a}} period marked by Harrison's devotion to a Hindu-aligned ascetic life and {{the height of his}} public association with the Hare Krishna movement, which included his donation of Bhaktivedanta Manor for use as an ISKCON temple. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the falsehood of striving for wealth or power in the material world and advocates a direct relationship with one's deity as a genuine life goal. In doing so, he belittles the role of political leaders, as well as his own status as a celebrated rock musician. The song's Krishna Conscious message was <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> in Harrison's choice of artwork for the Material World album, specifically the reproduction of a painting from a Prabhupada-published edition of the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the clash between Gaddafi and Goukouni were both ethnic and political. The FROLINAT was divided between Arabs, like Acyl, and Toubous, like Goukouni and Habré. These ethnic {{divisions}} <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> a different attitude towards Gaddafi and his Green Book. In particular, Goukouni and his men had shown themselves reluctant to follow Gaddafi's solicitations to make The Green Book the official policy of the FROLINAT, and had first tried to take time, postponing the question until the complete reunification of the movement. When the unification was accomplished, and Gaddafi pressed again for the adoption of The Green Book, the dissensions in the Revolution's Council became manifest, with many proclaiming their loyalty to the movement's original platform approved in 1966 when Ibrahim Abatcha was made first secretary-general, while others, including Acyl, fully embraced the Colonel's ideas.|$|E
5|$|The story {{concerns}} the British secret agent James Bond, gambling at the casino in Royale-les-Eaux to bankrupt Le Chiffre, the treasurer of a French union {{and a member}} of the Russian secret service. Bond is supported in his endeavours by Vesper Lynd, a member of his own service, as well as Felix Leiter of the CIA and René Mathis of the French Deuxième Bureau. Fleming used his wartime experiences as a member of the Naval Intelligence Division, and the people he met during his work, to provide plot elements; the character of Bond <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> many of Fleming's personal tastes. Fleming wrote the draft in early 1952 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica while awaiting his marriage. He was initially unsure whether the work was suitable for publication, but was assured by his friend, the novelist William Plomer, that the novel had promise.|$|E
