40|$|Multiple {{generations of}} normal faults dismembered, tilted, and exposed {{thicknesses}} {{of up to}} 15 km of the upper crust in portions of central and southern Arizona. This extension, variable in distribution and magnitude, was superimposed on the axis of the Laramide magmatic arc and dismembers many porphyry copper systems, allowing for detailed study of vertical and lateral zonation of <b>alteration</b> around these centers. This study examines tilted fault blocks containing portions of porphyry systems across Arizona, focusing on hydrothermal <b>alteration</b> deep and distal in these systems (3 + km paleodepth) to develop a more complete understanding of porphyry occurrences as larger geochemical systems. This study focuses on Na-Ca and coarse muscovite <b>alteration</b> in the roots of Laramide porphyry copper systems across Arizona (Ajo, Sierrita, Kelvin-Riverside, Mt. Grayback, Granite Mountain, Charleston, Globe-Miami, Sycamore Canyon, Copper Basin, Texas Canyon, and Copper Creek), provides a detailed study of Middle Jurassic coarse muscovite <b>alteration</b> at Luhr Hill in the Yerington district, Nevada, and documents the structural and hydrothermal evolution of the Ajo mining district in southwestern Arizona. Most areas {{in this study are}} interpreted to be highly extended, highly eroded, or both, allowing for study of deep hydrothermal <b>alteration.</b> Na-Ca <b>alteration</b> has been previously documented extensively along the Jurassic arc of the southwestern United States but less widely known in younger plutons, notably of Laramide age in Arizona. Coarse muscovite <b>alteration</b> previously has rarely been documented in porphyry copper systems, and this study shows that coarse muscovite <b>alteration</b> is likely present in systems where root zones are exposed at surface. Na-Ca <b>alteration</b> also is present in many in Laramide porphyry systems, though volumetrically minor, as no Laramide system contains more than a few volume perfect Na-Ca <b>alteration</b> in a given hydrothermal system. Na-Ca <b>alteration</b> in Laramide systems can include Ca, Na-Ca and Na <b>alteration</b> but is dominated by Na <b>alteration</b> (epidote-albite-chlorite ± actinolite). At Ajo, both Na-Ca and coarse muscovite <b>alteration</b> are present within the district due to superposition of temporally unrelated hydrothermal <b>alteration,</b> coupled with complex extensional deformation. This study shows that both Na-Ca and coarse muscovite <b>alteration</b> are more common in Laramide porphyry copper systems than previously recognized, that Na-Ca <b>alteration</b> is most commonly developed as shallower Na <b>alteration</b> (albite-epidote-chlorite ± actinolite), common deeper Na-Ca <b>alteration</b> (oligoclase-actinolite-epidote), and rare, deep Ca <b>alteration</b> (oligoclase-diopside-actinolite ± garnet ± epidote). Na-Ca <b>alteration</b> is commonly less voluminous in Laramide systems than documented in systems along the Jurassic arc. Coarse muscovite <b>alteration,</b> commonly termed greisen, occurs structurally below and commonly postdates potassic <b>alteration</b> and likely formed from late-stage, low-temperature, magmatic-hydrothermal fluids. Coarse muscovite <b>alteration</b> associated with more silicic magmatic compositions is developed at shallower depths and contains muscovite with higher trace element contents, coarse muscovite <b>alteration</b> with more variable mineral assemblages, and coarse muscovite veins that are better mineralized. Coarse muscovite <b>alteration</b> (greisen) occurs as the main mineralized veins at the tops of evolved metaluminous to peraluminous granites in W-Sn systems, as well mineralized veins in the cores and tops of Mo-Cu porphyry systems, and as poorly mineralized veins in the roots of porphyry copper systems. Detailed understanding of coarse muscovite <b>alteration</b> in a given district can, therefore, can be an indicator of depth or petrologic affiliation of a system. These results provide a better understanding of late-stage magmatic-hydrothermal <b>alteration</b> and hydrothermal <b>alteration</b> associated with the incursion of external fluids into the root zones of porphyry copper systems...|$|R

The Matok Complex is situated in the southern marginal zone (SMZ) of the Limpopo Belt (LB), close to the zone of rehydration. Two major stages of hydrothermal <b>alteration</b> could be identified in local shear zones, a pervasive propylitization and a subsequent vein controlled quartzalbite <b>alteration.</b> The two-stage <b>alteration</b> occurred sometimes between the emplacement of the Matok Complex (2670 Ma) and the intrusion of unaltered mafic dykes (1900 Ma). Calculated isotopic compositions of the hydrothermal fluids indicate that magmatic ± meteoric waters as well as juvenile C 02 were responsible for the establishment of the <b>alteration</b> zones. The fluids most probably were late magmatic fluids associated with the Matok magmatism. The propylitic <b>alteration</b> was accompanied by introduction of small amounts of CU + Au and represents an <b>alteration</b> type identical to that developed in porphyry copper deposits.

40|$|The <b>alteration</b> {{state of}} basalt lavas {{is shown to}} be largely {{the result of the}} {{combined}} action of two <b>alteration</b> processes, deuteric oxidation and regional hydrothermal <b>alteration.</b> The former process is well des-cribed in the literature while the latter is shown here to be another widespread source of lava <b>alteration.</b> The environment of regional hydro-thermal <b>alteration</b> is that of the zeolite metamorphic facies, with tempera-tures of up to 300 °C, and abundant groundwater being the major elements. Independent and rapid spatial variation of the two <b>alteration</b> processes results in the wide range of observed lava properties. Micro-scopically undetectable titanomagnetite <b>alteration,</b> indicated by steady rise in strong field Curie point, is the first response of a non-deuterically oxidized basalt to regional hydrothermal <b>alteration.</b> With more extreme <b>alteration,</b> titanohematite etc. is seen to pseudomorph titanomagnetite grains.
