5|$|<b>An</b> <b>error</b> as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, fact is an {{exception}} to the general rule that the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983) – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – <b>an</b> <b>error</b> as to a precedent fact may be regarded as a form of illegality.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said that <b>an</b> <b>error</b> of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas <b>an</b> <b>error</b> of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving <b>an</b> <b>error</b> of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E

5|$|One {{exception}} in this rule {{occurs when the}} defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete a double play or triple play. <b>An</b> <b>error</b> is not charged in that situation if a wild throw allows the runner to reach safely.

However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete a double play or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, <b>an</b> <b>error</b> may be charged.|$|E

50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of using IMUs for navigation {{is that they}} typically suffer from accumulated error. Because the guidance system is continually integrating acceleration with respect to time to calculate velocity and position (see dead reckoning), any measurement errors, however small, are accumulated over time. This leads to 'drift': an ever-increasing difference between where the system thinks it is located and the actual location. Due to integration <b>a</b> constant <b>error</b> in acceleration results in <b>a</b> linear <b>error</b> in velocity and <b>a</b> quadratic <b>error</b> growth in position. <b>A</b> constant <b>error</b> in attitude rate (gyro) results in <b>a</b> quadratic <b>error</b> in velocity and <b>a</b> cubic <b>error</b> growth in position.|$|R

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>error</b> as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of <b>an</b> <b>error</b> of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park.

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after <b>an</b> <b>error</b> or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by <b>an</b> <b>error,</b> the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike out, then one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
5|$|During the women's class F35/36 discus competition, <b>an</b> <b>error</b> {{in scoring}} caused the wrong medals to be presented.

Due to <b>an</b> <b>error</b> in the scoring system, the gold medal in the event was originally awarded to Ukrainian athlete Mariia Pomazan. When the mistake was discovered, the recalculated points showed that Chinese athlete Wu Qing had finished first, with Pomazan in second place. A second medal ceremony was held, which Pomazan did not attend in protest. She was eventually required to return her gold medal.|$|E

40|$|A {{steady-state}} microchannel split-system {{simulation model}} has been developed based on previous research at the ACRC. This model was utilized as a design tool to optimize a microchannel split system {{with the goal of}} minimizing TEWI, or total equivalent warming impact. The system components were then selected and the optimized microchannel heat exchangers were fabricated. Next, the entire system was assembled and extensive tests were run at steady state conditions over a wide range of outdoor ambient conditions in a calorimeter test facility. The experimental results have been compared to the simulations for the purpose of model refinement and its eventual validation. The full system model overpredicts the total capacity of the system with <b>a</b> minimum <b>error</b> of 0. 2 %, <b>a</b> mean <b>error</b> of 5 %, and <b>a</b> maximum <b>error</b> of 11 %. The evaporator submodel overpredicts the total capacity as well, with <b>a</b> minimum <b>error</b> of 0. 7 %, <b>a</b> mean <b>error</b> of 7 %, and <b>a</b> maximum <b>error</b> of 11 %. The condenser submodel also overpredicts with <b>a</b> minimum <b>error</b> of 0. 5 %, <b>a</b> mean <b>error</b> of 2 %, and <b>a</b> maximum <b>error</b> of 6 %.
