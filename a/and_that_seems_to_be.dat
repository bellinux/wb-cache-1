Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five and noted that the episode lacked [...] "structure and point".

6000|$|... "I am very glad," [...] she replied, simply. [...] "Sometimes I get discouraged. I {{speak and}} people applaud, and I go away, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{all there is}} to it. I never hear a word afterwards; but once in a while, some one comes to me or writes to me, as you have done, and that gives me courage to go on; {{otherwise}} I'd think people came to hear me simply to be amused." ...|$|E
6000|$|Our inn, the [...] "Hotel of the Post," [...] {{a spacious}} and {{comfortable}} residence, is {{on a little}} place planted round with trees, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the Palais Royal of the town. Three clubs, which look from without to be very comfortable, ornament this square with their gas-lamps. Here stands, too, the theatre that is to be; there is a cafe, and on evenings a military band plays the very worst music I ever remember to have heard. I went out to-night to take a quiet walk upon this place, and the horrid brazen discord of these trumpeters set me half mad.|$|E

6000|$|... "I hadn't the nerve. You {{always seemed}} so--I don't {{know how to}} put it--I always seemed such a worm. I was just trying to get the courage to propose when I caught the mumps, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me to finish it.

60|$|There are {{two ways}} of {{clarifying}} liquids--ebullition and precipitation; one forces the impurities to the surface as scum, the other sends them to the bottom as dregs. The former is the more offensive, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> our way; but neither is useful if the impurities are merely separated but not removed. We are told with tiresome iteration that our social and political systems are clarifying; but when is the skimmer to appear? If the purpose of free institutions is good government where is the good government?--when may it be expected to begin?--how is it to come about? Systems of government have no sanctity; they are practical means to a simple end--the public welfare; worthy of no respect if they fail of its accomplishment. The tree is known by its fruit. Ours, is bearing crab-apples.|$|E

Systems of government have no sanctity; they are practical means to a simple end--the public welfare; worthy of no respect if they fail of its accomplishment. The tree is known by its fruit. Ours is bearing crab-apples. If the body politic is constitutionally diseased, as I verily believe; if the disorder inheres in the system; there is no remedy. The fever must burn itself out, and then Nature will do the rest. One does not prescribe what time alone can administer. We have put our criminals and dunces into power; do we suppose they will efface themselves? Will they restore to us the power of governing them? They must have their way and go their length. The natural and immemorial sequence is: tyranny, insurrection, combat. In combat everything that wears a sword has a chance--even the right. History does not forbid us to hope. But it forbids us to rely upon numbers; they will be against us. If history teaches anything worth learning it teaches {{that the majority of}} mankind is neither good nor wise. When government is founded upon the public conscience and the public intelligence the stability of states is a dream.|$|E

5000|$|The name Sant Feliu {{goes back}} to the martyred saint, Feliu, who came from Africa.

6000|$|Oh! There was an {{earthquake}} here in England the other night, {{while you were}} asleep; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> you too near to be pleasant. Will there ever be earthquakes in England which will throw houses down, and bury people in the ruins? ...|$|R

5000|$|At Senate {{hearings}} in July 2014, Degnan, {{in regard to}} the Fort Lee George Washington Bridge lane closures of September 2013 said [...] "If the lanes were closed as an act of political retribution against the mayor of Fort Lee or any other individual and not part of a legitimate traffic study, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> validated by some of the evidence, it's an outrageous misuse of office." [...] During his tenure as chairman he opposed dissolving the PANYNJ in its entirety, believing any changes made to the mission of agency should involve state legislatures and governors in both states.|$|E
5000|$|Mary McNamara {{writing for}} Los Angeles Times was more {{positive}} about the book, and said: [...] "Not everything in Yes Please works ..., but many things are funny, and as with most of her comedy". McNamara {{also said that the}} writing is [...] "choppy and self-consciously eccentric" [...] and added: [...] "Poehler is a smart and funny woman who isn't either of those things all the time and doesn't mind admitting it because she thinks that's important too". Rachel Dry of The Washington Post commented: [...] "So she is funny and honest. Writing a book is hard, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the truth. At least she made some good jokes about it." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{treatment}} of dancers was sometimes caustic. Choreographer Hermes Pan recalled in 1972 interview that Prinz [...] "would make some girls hysterical. He {{loved to have}} them in tears. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be the thing, to swear at the girls and be nasty." ...|$|R

What Greville describes as his ‘best friends’ Joseph King (MP), Maude Egerton King, Godfrey Blount and Ethel Blount lived in Haslemere too, and he had visited and stayed with them often. Greville and Joseph King were cousins. In 1913 Greville’s wife ‘lost a leg’ <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of the reason behind his move to the country. Greville describes his involvement in the Peasant Arts movement as ‘happy that I might possibly help them, I soon assigned my scanty leisure, along with some too easily earned money, to the support of their Society.’ ...|$|E
5000|$|Fyson devoted {{only the}} next to the last page of his slim book to the actual myth of the seven pagodas (Fyson 28). He recounts a local myth {{regarding}} the pagodas, that the god Indra became jealous of this earthly city and sank it during a great storm, leaving only the Shore Temple above water. He also recounts the assertion of local Tamil people {{that at least some}} of the other temples can be seen [...] "glittering beneath the waves" [...] from fishing boats (Fyson 28). Whether the six missing pagodas exist does not seem to matter much to Fyson; the Seven Pagodas gave his beloved city its nickname and fame, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the important part for him. However, the six missing temples have continued to fascinate locals, archaeologists, and lovers of myth alike, and have recently returned to the archaeological spotlight.|$|E
50|$|The plot {{is based}} on the arrival of Aunt Alejandra to a {{familiar}} household consisting of two parents and three children. A woman who is loving, in principle, suffers severe mood swings and strange things happen in her room quite regularly <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> surrounded by an aura of mystery. Rejected by the eldest child, she only serves to bring misfortune to them since coming home. Auntie has a fortune that will surely help her relatives, but really begins to destroy the whole family with diabolical acts, and attempts to teach children witchcraft. When one of the children mocks her, she caused his death. When her nephew dismisses of his house, she chokes him in his own bed. When the older girl burns her face, Alejandra burns an entire room with the girl inside. Only surviving Lucía, the wife, and her young daughter, but she seems to have learned the secrets of Alejandra...|$|E

5000|$|Collison {{made his}} senior debut for Wales in a {{friendly}} win away at Iceland on 29 May 2008. Bellamy praised the young midfielder saying, [...] "I've seen him every afternoon at West Ham and he does extra training. If {{you want to give}} this career a good go then you get the rewards <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> how Jack is looking at it." [...] After the death of Collison's father, national team coach John Toshack gave him the choice whether to make himself available for selection. Having played in West Ham's last two games, he declared himself available for the World Cup qualifier against Russia. This match would confirm Collison as a full Wales international, as his previous six caps all came in friendlies. He did not play, however, as he had to attend his father's funeral, which took place {{on the day of the}} match. A calf injury ruled Collison out of Wales' remaining World Cup qualifying matches.|$|E
