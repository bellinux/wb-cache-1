5|$|Jain texts mention five transgressions (Atichara) of the vow: {{the desire}} to be reborn as a human, {{the desire to}} be reborn as a divinity, the desire to {{continue}} living, the desire to die quickly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> live a sensual life in the next life. Other transgressions include: recollection of affection for friends, recollection of the pleasures enjoyed, and longing for the enjoyment of pleasures in the future.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{settlers}} divided New Zealand into provinces, {{which had}} a degree of autonomy. Because of financial pressures <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> consolidate railways, education, land sales and other policies, government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876. The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays and sporting rivalries.|$|E
5|$|The pitch {{invasion}} at the 1924 Paris Olympics {{had given}} rugby a poor image and this, {{together with the}} problems of attracting sufficient teams to make it a viable sport <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> include more individual and women's events, spelled the death knell for rugby at the Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Tyrant is {{the code}} {{name of a}} series of boss {{characters}} in the Resident Evil horror video game series by Capcom, introduced in the original Resident Evil in 1996. Tyrants are towering, biologically engineered undead supersoldiers created and used by the sinister Umbrella Corporation. Tyrant creatures make appearances as boss characters in most Resident Evil games <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> create an obedient bioweapon lies {{at the core of the}} series' storyline. Tyrants also appear in other media and merchandise of the Resident Evil franchise, as well as in some unrelated games.|$|E
5|$|Carol Vernallis, {{author of}} Experiencing Music Video, found homoerotic connotations between Madonna and the mermen. The mermen {{in the video}} exist in a {{self-contained}} world of their own, where they procreate with their own kind, both biologically and socially. The fact that the mermen {{did not seem to}} possess genitalia led Vernallis to believe that the video associated them with other works by Ritts – namely homoerotic sculptural images without penises. Their tails drew different meanings, including sexual ones and Christian symbolism. Since in contemporary art, images of mermen are rare while mermaids are common, they are sometimes called fairies partly because it is not known how they came to be. Vernallis believed that the mysteriousness and the elusiveness of the mermen in the video played a crucial role. They never address the camera directly and are often shown disappearing from view. Vernallis believed that since invisibility was a central theme in the homosexual community, this actually portrayed oppression <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> watch but never be seen.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942 the Royal Navy {{formed the}} Future Building Committee, chaired by the Deputy First Sea Lord, {{to examine the}} fleet's {{requirements}} {{for the rest of}} the war. Tasked with anticipating the Navy's readiness and requirements for January 1944, the committee realised that a major expansion of naval aviation was required, which meant that more aircraft carriers would be needed. Many factors combined to drive up the size of these new carriers, notably the increasing size and speed of aircraft <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> increase the numbers of aircraft aboard fleet carriers. Another important consideration was the change in carrier tactics from the earlier doctrine of more attacks with smaller numbers of aircraft to the use of large, single airstrikes.|$|E
50|$|In particular, {{during the}} 1980s, as several rocky peace {{negotiations}} where {{carried out with}} guerrilla groups, such as the 19th of April Movement <b>and</b> <b>the</b> EPL, <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> constitution {{as part of the}} potential peace agreements began to gradually become part of a wide national consensus.|$|R

50|$|Kauikeaouli had {{a troubled}} childhood. He was torn between the Puritan Christian {{guidelines}} {{imposed on the}} kingdom by the kuhina nui (Queen Regent) who was his stepmother Kaʻahumanu, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> honor <b>the</b> old traditions. Under the influence of Oahu's then governor, Boki, and a young Hawaiian-Tahitian priest named Kaomi, Kauikeaouli's aikāne partner, he rebelled against his Christian teachings, created the secret order of Hulumanu (Bird Feather), and named Kaomi his co-ruler in place of Kīnaʻu. By 1835 he had returned to ways of the missionaries.|$|R
5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing {{of what he}} saw. He is torn between the need {{to tell the truth}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E
5|$|Serevi started 2001 {{by leading}} Fiji in the 2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Argentina. Fiji were {{defeated}} by Australia in their semi-final; the Australians {{went on to}} lose to New Zealand in the final. In the 2000–01 IRB Sevens World Series, he played in only the London and Wales legs. He also missed the 2001 Hong Kong Sevens, {{the first time he}} had missed the tournament in 12 years. Serevi was omitted from the team due to form, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> develop new players for the 2004 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Fiji's coach at the time, Tomasi Cama, suggested Serevi had lost some pace and age was catching up with him. Serevi's last sevens tournament for the year was the World Games in Akita, Japan. As captain, he led Fiji to the Gold medal after defeating Australia 35–19 in the final.|$|E
5|$|The British and Egyptian governments {{would not}} again attempt major {{intervention}} until 1896, whereupon {{the government in}} Britain was impelled to act by several factors. The Egyptian economy had improved since British administrators commandeered the country's finances. Public sentiment towards Mahdist Sudan had been stoked by several embellished accounts of the Mahdists' savagery <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> avenge General Charles Gordon. France, Britain's longtime competitor in the Scramble for Africa, was beginning to encroach upon the Nile river valley, alongside the Belgians. Finally, it was politically advantageous in Europe for Britain to distract the Khalifa from the Italians in Eritrea, who had been made vulnerable by a recent defeat {{at the hands of}} Menelik II, Emperor of Ethiopia. The government chose Herbert Horatio Kitchener to lead the new expedition, outfitting him with around ten-thousand soldiers and Britain's latest technology: Maxim guns, heavy artillery, and a small fleet of gunboats.|$|E

She is the youngest member of <b>the</b> Outlaw Printmakers <b>and</b> is known for her colorful and vivid large-scale silkscreen collages. According to her artist statement, Curran's work is [...] "...a satirical deconstruction of American pop-culture and socio-political history, and how fear <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desires</b> <b>to</b> own <b>and</b> to control drive hyper-masculinity and hyper-consumption."

50|$|The Advaita Ashram has {{its origins}} in 1896, when Vivekananda was {{travelling}} through <b>the</b> Alps recuperating, <b>and</b> expressed <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> have a similar place in India, for retreat and study of Vedas.|$|R

25|$|Runway 18/36, {{which had}} only 1% of {{operations}} in 2010, was closed in 2011 and {{is scheduled to}} be eliminated in 2017, due to its close proximity to housing on either side <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> build new office space at the south end.|$|E
25|$|It was {{announced}} in June 2000 that the athletics program would be phased out {{as part of the}} change from a junior college to a four-year college, due mainly to the costs associated with running a college athletic department, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> develop a more comprehensive participatory student activities program.|$|E

25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{physical}} design flow is Floorplanning. Floorplanning is the process of identifying structures that should be placed close together, and allocating space for them in such a manner as to meet the sometimes conflicting goals of available space (cost of the chip), required performance, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> have everything close to everything else.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism {{appealed to}} Chinese intellectuals and elites and the {{development}} of gentry Buddhism was sought as an alternative to Confucianism and Daoism, since Buddhism's emphasis on morality and ritual appealed to Confucianists <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> cultivate inner wisdom appealed to Daoists. Gentry Buddhism was a medium of introduction for the beginning of Buddhism in China, it gained imperial and courtly support. By the early 5th century Buddhism was established in south China.|$|E
25|$|Hatoyama {{was also}} {{faced with the}} issue of the {{relocation}} of the American Futenma Marine Corps Air Base. The United States government hoped that Hatoyama would honor a 2006 agreement to relocate the base to a less populated part of Okinawa and move 8,000 marines to Guam. Some voices in the DPJ demanded that America move its military bases off Okinawa islands altogether. Hatoyama was torn between public opinion on Okinawa <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> retain strong ties with Washington.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{inherent}} risks of operating at {{or close to}} VMCa with asymmetric thrust, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> simulate and practise these manoeuvres in pilot training and certification VSSE may be defined. VSSE safe single-engine speed is the minimum speed to intentionally render the critical engine inoperative, established and designated by the manufacturer as the safe, intentional, one engine inoperative speed. This speed is selected to reduce the accident potential from loss of control due to simulated engine failures at inordinately slow airspeed.|$|E
25|$|As Confederate {{command and}} control was {{reestablished}} for the pursuit, the men ran into a third Union force, under General William Emory, about 5,800 men sitting atop a ridge overlooking Chatman's Bayou. The Confederates pushed forward, but Emory's division repulsed attempts to take this location. However, the Union forces did not have control of the precious water in the bayou. During the night, Banks decided to withdraw back to Pleasant Hill {{because of lack of}} water <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> unite with A. J. Smith's men.|$|E
25|$|It {{may seem}} a vast {{depletion}} of the downtown shopping area, it now having only one department store, the Hudson's Bay Company. But {{the fact is that}} for many years, until the arrival of the Hudson's Bay Company there were only two department stores downtown, Simpson's and the discount department store on Broad Street — the wholesale wing of Simpson's and Sherwood Department Store being outside city centre. Reaching a balance between convenience for residents of Regina <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> make the city appealing and impressive is not a novelty.|$|E
