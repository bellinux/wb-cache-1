5|$|Some 20th-century {{literary}} theorists, relying less on {{the opposition}} of prose <b>and</b> <b>poetry,</b> focused on the poet as simply one who creates using language, <b>and</b> <b>poetry</b> as what the poet creates.

Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral traditions in general <b>and</b> <b>poetry</b> in particular was well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to apartheid. Music <b>and</b> <b>poetry</b> were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these traditions. In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E

5|$|There are few {{surviving}} {{records of}} Blackstone's undergraduate term at Oxford, but the curriculum of Pembroke College {{had been set}} out in 1624, and Prest notes that it was probably still followed in 1738, so Blackstone would have studied Greek, science, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, geography <b>and</b> <b>poetry.</b> Blackstone was particularly good at Greek, mathematics <b>and</b> <b>poetry,</b> with his notes on William Shakespeare being included in George Steevens' 1781 edition of Shakespeare's plays. Many of Blackstone's undergraduate texts survive, and they include few legal texts, instead being wide-ranging; politics, current affairs, poetry, geometry and controversial theological texts. The last element is understandable, given his family's theological interests, but the more surprising element is {{the sheer number of}} texts he owned given his relative poverty as a student.|$|E

5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished {{at a time when many}} publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose <b>and</b> <b>Poetry</b> of America.|$|E

5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus {{as an example of}} a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier in the plot.
