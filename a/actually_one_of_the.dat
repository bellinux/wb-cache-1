5|$|In the present, Kratos overcomes several {{obstacles}} {{in his quest}} to find the Ambrosia, including defeating a giant spider, ignoring Athena's pleas to stop his quest, and overcoming the reanimated corpses of Captain Nikos and his men—a final attempt by Hades to stop the Spartan. On returning to the island, Kratos discovers that the island is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chaos Giants, the fifty-headed and one hundred armed Gyges. An outraged Gyges explains that Kratos had thwarted the Giant's plan to use the elixir to resurrect his brothers Briareus and Cottus, and then reclaim the world. In his fiery battle with Cereyon, Kratos inadvertently burned off Gyges' one hundred arms, and then stole the Ambrosia. Without arms and now unable to reach the Ambrosia, Gyges was forced to wait for Kratos' return. During the battle, Kratos reveals that he seeks to destroy the elixir to prevent the worshipers of the slain god Ares from resurrecting their master. Kratos then uses the Fire of Apollo to destroy both the Tree of Life and Gyges.|$|E

Alert comes with Ai - recognizable from her appearance in the Japanese TV series Car Robots (Robots in Disguise in America). As with several other Binaltech (and Asterisk) figures, there is no Alternators version of Red Alert.|$|E
25|$|The large basins of the Michelangelo {{quadrangle}} {{have been}} dated relatively by counting the cumulative density of superposed primary impact craters that have diameters greater than 20 km. This technique {{has proven to}} be of great value in dating lunar basins (Wilhelms, in press), where obvious superposition relations do not exist. Results of these crater counts indicate that Dostoevskij, presumed to be of c3 age (McCauley and others, 1981), is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oldest basins in the map area (early c1). Thus, strict morphological determination of stratigraphic age may be significantly in error.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{important}} evolution of coin shape (round to square) and material (from gold to silver to brass) across the territories and the periods, and from Greek type to Indian type {{over a period of}} nearly 3 centuries. Also, the quality of coinage illustration decreases down to the 1st century CE. Coinage evolution is {{an important}} point of Indo-Greek history, and <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important since most of these kings are only known by their coins, and their chronology is mainly established by the evolution of the coin types.|$|E
25|$|Another site {{to explore}} the deeply rooted Chinese culture in George Town is the Khoo Kongsi, a large Chinese clan house at Cannon Square. Originally built as a meeting place for the Khoo clan, the Khoo Kongsi still retains its {{authentic}} Chinese architecture, with its granite-paved courtyard surrounded by an intricately-built association building, a theatre stage and rows of smaller houses inhabited by the clan members in the past. The Khoo Kongsi is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numerous clan houses that are scattered in the city, which were built by separate surname-based clan associations established to assist the newly arrived Chinese immigrants in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous item found is the Nuzi map, which is the oldest known map ever discovered. It is unknown exactly what the Nuzi map charts, even though the {{majority}} of the tablet is preserved. The Nuzi map is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> so-called Gasur texts, and predates the invasion of the city of Gasur by the Hurrians, who renamed it Nuzi. The cache of economic and business documents among which the map was found date to the Old Akkadian period (ca. 2360-2180 BC). Gasur was a thriving commercial center, and the texts reveal a varied business community with far reaching enterprises. It is possible that Ebla was a trading partner, and that the tablet, rather than a record of land-holdings, might indeed be a road map. The tablet, which is approximately 6 x 6.5cm., is inscribed only on the obverse. It shows the city of Maskan-dur-ebla in the lower left corner, as well and a canal/river and two mountain ranges.|$|E

25|$|England went to Australia the {{following}} winter and, in a controversial series, won The Ashes {{for the first}} time since Richie Benaud's team had beaten them in the 1958–59 series. England under Ray Illingworth were <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most successful Test teams of all time. They created a world record in official Test cricket of 27 consecutive Tests without defeat from 1968 to 1971; the record was equaled by Clive Lloyd's West Indies team between 1981 and 1984. At the time, however, the Rest of the World Tests were recognised as official and England's record run has only been confirmed retrospectively. England took sixteen players on tour and fourteen of these had featured against the Rest of the World. The other two were reserve wicket-keeper Bob Taylor and Yorkshire batsman John Hampshire. Alan Ward had to return home because of injury problems and was replaced by the young fast bowler Bob Willis, who made his Test debut on the tour.|$|E
25|$|Launched {{concurrently}} with Boat 10, with 42 people aboard, {{the last}} of the wooden lifeboats was launched under the supervision of Lightoller at 1:50a.m. with Quartermaster Walter Perkis put in charge. It was <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first lifeboats to be lowered on Captain Smith's suggestion that passengers should be loaded from the Promenade Deck rather than the Boat Deck. However, the captain had forgotten that– unlike on his previous command, Titanics sister ship Olympic– the forward half of the Promenade Deck was enclosed. Lightoller ordered that the windows on the Promenade Deck's enclosure were to be opened, and moved on to deal with the other lifeboats. The windows proved unexpectedly difficult to open and to add to the problems, the lifeboat got caught up on Titanics sounding spar, which projected from the hull immediately below the boat. The spar had to be chopped off to allow the lifeboat to progress. A stack of deck chairs was used as a makeshift staircase to allow passengers to climb up and through the windows and into the boat.|$|E
500|$|The {{apparently}} mundane task {{of converting}} author names into a standard Surname, Initial format is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{more difficult to}} automate, due to {{the wide variety of}} naming conventions around the world and the possibility that a given name such as Davis could be a first name, middle name or surname.

500|$|Although [...] "Bittersweet Poetry" [...] {{appears as}} a Japanese bonus track on Graduation, it was <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very first songs crafted for Late Registration. After seeing the 2004 biographical film Ray together, Kanye West and blues-rock {{musician}} John Mayer decided to collaborate on a record and immediately went back to a recording studio to compose the song [...] "Bittersweet." [...] This wasn't the first time West and Mayer collaborated with one another. The two previously worked together to make [...] "Go!", the third single from Common's sixth studio album Be, which came about when Mayer went to visit West at The Record Plant in Los Angeles. In the end, because Kanye West felt that their song did not coincide well into the overall soundscape of his second studio album, it was subsequently unincluded.|$|E
500|$|Katy Stevens {{notes that}} the {{dialogue}} in [...] "The Body" [...] was recorded with microphones {{very close to the}} actors, making variations in their voices—cracks, rises, and whispers—more prominent to the audience, to close the distance between the actors and the viewer. Conversely, the scene in which Dawn is told of Joyce's death was shot through a large classroom window, muffling Dawn's emotional reaction, to isolate Buffy and Dawn from the class and the audience. Several moments of silence follow this scene. Whedon shot the conversation up close several times, filming over-the-shoulder and reaction shots, but eventually went with a more distanced point of view. Michelle Trachtenberg later said of this effect, [...] "obviously you know in the end result there was no sound and I thought that was <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most brilliant ideas [...] ever had because it allows everyone to sort of attach their own emotional plug into whatever might have happened in your life. I think it allowed the audience to really connect with Dawn for the first time." ...|$|E

Co-creator Greg Daniels had wanted Jim to get a haircut for a while, as {{he thought it would}} [...] "change [...] up a little bit." [...] Krasinski thought it was [...] "really smart" [...] to make it seem like Karen's idea. Kwapis was careful with Jim's reaction shots in the episode, as {{he did not want to}} [...] "tip anything" [...] to the audience about Jim's choice of Karen or Pam. Kwapis explained, [...] "That to me was <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big challenges of the episode is how to keep you on your toes in terms of not knowing where the story was going." [...] Jim's flashback scene with Pam on the beach was initially intended to be the cold open of the episode before Michael Schur suggested it be moved. Kwapis shot multiple endings, and the cast was unaware how the season would end.|$|E

Writing for NME in November 1997, Ben Willmott called it [...] "supremely irritating" [...] and stated [...] "Kylie belts out the lyrics like she's reading from an autocue. Any soul {{is lost in}} a slurry of bought-in brass and a ropey guitar solo that's be more at home on a Shakin' Stevens record." [...] John Magnan from The Age said while the song was a stand out to the album, it [...] "is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album's clunkier tracks". Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music reviewed her Ultimate Kylie compilation album, and criticised the musical composition by calling it a [...] "awkward faux-rock". Matt James from PopMatters reviewed her compilation The Best of Kylie Minogue and was disappointed with [...] "Some Kind of Bliss"' absence, labelling it a [...] "lost classic". Larry Flick from Billboard was positive, saying [...] "Ms. Minogue has been reborn as an alterna-pop vixen to be reckoned with." ...|$|E
500|$|John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave Revelation four-and-a-half {{out of five}} {{stars and}} commented that [...] "If the album doesn't grab the {{listener}} from Powell's soulful southern drawl and an accompanying acoustic before [...] "This Is Who I Am" [...] breaks wide open, closer attention to the words and themes that permeate the album should bring to light what is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strongest records so far this year" [...] and stated that [...] "Revelation is an honest, emotional, vulnerable, beautiful, and delicious southern rock record"; however, he also stated that [...] "only fault [...] may be that its greatest strengths double as a minor weakness". He elaborated that the album's second half, despite consisting of [...] "wonderful" [...] songs that he wouldn't think to leave out, was slightly worse than the album's first half, which he characterized as having an edgier sound. Debra Akins of Gospel Music Channel described Revelation as [...] "a solid exclamation of who Third Day is musically, while underscoring the cultural relevancy they've continued to display over the years" [...] and also praised the album as a whole, commenting that [...] "there are no throw-away tracks on this CD, and that's a rarity in today's fast-paced, song-driven music industry".|$|E
500|$|Mileena was {{described}} by Computer and Video Games as [...] "equally erotic and repulsive".

[...] In 2008, IGN's Scott Collura listed [...] "Mileen-ewwwwww" [...] as one of [...] "top 50 chicks behaving badly," [...] while GamesRadar included her on the list of [...] "gaming's most repellent anti-babes". Comparing the Mortal Kombat characters to the seven deadly sins in Dante's Inferno, Chris Holt of GamePro chose Mileena to represent Envy. Aaron Koehn of GamePro placed Mileena and Kitana eleventh on his 2009 list of the best palette-swapped video game characters, but wrote that [...] "if you gauge Mileena's attractiveness simply based on the size of her baby-feeders, be ready for some disappointment when she removes her mask." [...] ScrewAttack ranked her as seventh on their list of the top ten [...] "ugly chicks in games" [...] for her horrific looks when unmasked, but otherwise calling her [...] "the ultimate woman." [...] Virgin Media included her on their list of the ten [...] "game girls you wouldn't dare to date" [...] for being attractive [...] "until she rips off her veil and reveals her monstrous form beneath." [...] Destructoid's Nick Chester commented: [...] "Her story, as far as I'm concerned, is that she needs to see a dentist." [...] On the other hand, EGMs Eric L. Patterson, stating his preference of Mileena over Kitana, wrote that Mileena's face is <b>actually</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons why he likes her. Reviewing the Vita version of MK2011, GamesRadar's Jack DeVries called it [...] "as pretty as Mileena minus mask, but overall, just as viciously fun." [...] Ranking Mileena as second on his 2013 list of ugliest video game characters, Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi wrote: [...] "If ever there were a time to use the term 'butterface' it would be with Mileena, because everything about her is hot...but her face. Her face will friggin' bite your face off, which is never a sign of a good date." [...] Ramon Hagenbeuk of Dutch XGN included Mileena among the [...] "top 10 ugly game chicks" [...] in 2015 due to her face despite [...] "her nice figure". French magazine Retropolis placed Mileena second in a 2013 ranking of the sexiest girls in fighting games in which her bust was the criteria for her [...] "reverse décolleté" [...] approach to fashion after Mortal Kombat II, while comparing the character to shrimp in regards to her physical appearance: [...] "Everything is good except for the head."
