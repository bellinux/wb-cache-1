Angered by the British decision, Iceland decided to submit a formal complaint to NATO about their move, and it also provoked more than 80,000 Icelandics (equal to 25% of its entire population) to sign an online petition set up under the heading [...] "Icelanders are not terrorists". The relationship got even tenser when UK replied a month later by cancelling its scheduled patrol of the Icelandic airspace in December 2008. Iceland has no standing army of its own, and relies on a long-term standing agreement with NATO where a group of member states have committed in turns to defend the Icelandic airspace, and the UK Royal Air Force had now cancelled this after mutual agreement with NATO (presumably with <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> having accepted to overtake the liability).|$|E

2500|$|The Dublin {{regulation}} {{determines the}} EU {{member state responsible}} to examine an asylum application to prevent asylum applicants in the EU from [...] "asylum shopping", where applicants send their applications for asylum to numerous EU member states {{to get the best}} [...] "deal," [...] instead of just having [...] "safety countries", or [...] "asylum orbiting", where no member state takes responsibility for an asylum seeker. By default (when no family reasons or humanitarian grounds are present), the first member state that an asylum seeker entered and in which they have been fingerprinted is responsible. If the asylum seeker then moves to <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> they can be transferred back to the member state they first entered. This has led many to criticise the Dublin rules for placing too much responsibility for asylum seekers on member states on the EU's external borders (like Italy, Greece and Hungary), instead of devising a burden-sharing system among EU states.|$|E

2500|$|First, the Citizens Rights Directive 2004 article 4 says {{every citizen}} {{has the right}} to depart a member state with a valid passport. This has {{historical}} importance for central and eastern Europe, when the Soviet Union and the Berlin Wall denied its citizens the freedom to leave. Article 5 gives every citizen a right of entry, subject to national border controls. Schengen Area countries (not the UK and Ireland) abolished the need to show documents, and police searches at borders, altogether. These reflect the general principle of free movement in TFEU article 21. Second, article 6 allows every citizen to stay three months in <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> whether economically active or not. Article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of [...] "sufficient resources... not to become a burden on the social assistance system". Articles 16 and 17 give a right to permanent residence after 5 years without conditions. Third, TEU article 10(3) requires the right to vote in the local constituencies for the European Parliament wherever a citizen lives.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that [...] "selling arrangements" [...] would be presumed to {{not fall into}} TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected {{them in the same}} manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as [...] "in law and in fact" [...] it was an equally applicable [...] "selling arrangement" [...] (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so {{did not need to be}} justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect [...] "in fact" [...] particularly where traders from <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were [...] "the only effective form of promotion enabling [...] to penetrate" [...] the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' [...] "traditional social practices and to local habits and customs" [...] to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory [...] "race to the bottom", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.|$|E
50|$|On {{the first}} {{question}} regarding the condition of prior lawful residence in <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> the Court noted {{in the first place}} that no provision of the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 makes its application conditional on prior residence in a member state. Indeed, some of its provisions suggest that it is applicable to family members not already lawfully resident in <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> Thus Article 5(2) allows entry without a residence card while Article 10(2) is an exhaustive list of documents that may need presenting, which nevertheless does not include any documents demonstrating prior lawful residence in <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{effect of}} Metock is much {{enhanced}} by Eind and Singh, which confirmed that returning migrants continue {{to enjoy the}} family reunification rights they enjoyed while residing in <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> This {{has led to the}} so-called [...] whereby a national of a member state circumvents national restrictions on family reunification by taking up residence in <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>state,</b> thus exercising his right of free movement and subsequently relying on his right to family reunification under the Citizenship Directive 2004/38 on his return.
