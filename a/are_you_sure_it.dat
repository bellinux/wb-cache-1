6000|$|... 'Pah!' said Aubrey; 'it puts me {{in mind of}} {{the wings}} of houses in books that get shut up because {{somebody}} has been murdered! <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> is not haunted, Leonard?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't," [...] {{answered}} Davies, with {{a puzzled}} air. [...] "The boys saw every log into standard lengths. We have {{no use for}} a two-hundred-footer and couldn't get her into the mill. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> wasn't a wind-blown log?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it's</b> your {{particular}} duty?" [...] suggested Joan. [...] "I'm told you've become {{a household word}} both in Germany and France.

5000|$|Rich, {{who retired}} at age 87, holds {{the record for}} being the oldest justice {{to sit on the}} bench of the High Court. This record will almost {{certainly}} not be broken, since High Court justices now must retire at age 70. It is said that, following the funeral of former justice Sir Isaac Isaacs in 1943, Hayden Starke said to Rich (who at that stage was 80 years old) [...] "George, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it's</b> worth your while going home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But are {{you sure}} you are not pretending to love me now, as you pretended to think I was the muchacha you had run away with and lost? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> is not pity for the deceit you practiced upon me--upon Don Juan--upon poor Father Pedro?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Try it, Hake, by all means. Go {{with your}} {{brother in the}} little boat and set them where you think best. Fresh salmon for supper would be a rare treat just now. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was a salmon you saw, and not a large trout?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} one can live quite comfortably when one's {{conscious}} of the disapproval of one's fellows? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> won't begin to worry you? Everyone has {{some sort of a}} conscience, and sooner or later it will find you out. Supposing your wife died, wouldn't you be tortured by remorse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{may be true}} enough, boy," [...] Stephen admitted, {{blowing out}} dense volumes of smoke from his pipe; [...] "but <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>it's</b> toward those great things that she is {{pointing}} you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}} you do, Cuthbert? I have thought all these months that you had taken me at my word, {{and that it was}} but as a friend you {{regarded}} me. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> is not gratitude for what little I did for you in the hospital! Still more that it is not because I showed my feelings so plainly the day before yesterday, and that it is from pity as well as gratitude that you speak now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was easy}} enough," [...] {{answered}} the girl, [...] "for Uncle Andry made the roof o' the place uncommon thick, an' there's a short tunnel leadin' to some bushes by the burn that let us oot {{at a place}} that canna be seen frae the hoose. But oh, granny, dinna ask me to speak aboot thae things, for they may be torturin' Uncle Andry at this vera moment. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was him ye saw?" [...] she added, turning to Bruce.|$|E
60|$|TANNER. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was {{not that}} we were {{beginning}} to be something more? What does the beginning of manhood and womanhood mean in most people's mouths? You know: it means the beginning of love. But love began long before that for me. Love played its part in the earliest dreams and follies and romances I can remember--may I say the earliest follies and romances we can remember?--though we did not understand it at the time. No: the change that came to me was the birth in me of moral passion; and I declare that according to my experience moral passion is the only real passion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you open}} that bottle, before <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> will be wanted?" [...] She asked sharply. [...] "You know that Mr. Keller {{and his son}} prefer beer." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well,' said Anne, 'it is {{a comfort}} {{that if they}} like {{anything}} <b>you</b> do, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> is really very good. Their praise {{is worth more than}} that of other people.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I confess I {{was greatly}} {{surprised}} with this good news, and had scarce power {{to speak to}} him for some time; but at last I said to him, [...] "How do you know this? <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> is true?"--"Yes," [...] says he; [...] "I met this morning in the street an old acquaintance of mine, an Armenian, who is among them. He came last from Astrakhan, and was designed to go to Tonquin, where I formerly knew him, but has altered his mind, and is now resolved to go with the caravan to Moscow, and so down the river Volga to Astrakhan."--"Well, Seignior," [...] says I, [...] "do not be uneasy about being left to go back alone; if this be a method for my return to England, it shall be your fault {{if you go back to}} Macao at all." [...] We then went to consult together what was to be done; and I asked my partner what he thought of the pilot's news, and whether it would suit with his affairs? He told me he would do just as I would; for he had settled all his affairs so well at Bengal, and left his effects in such good hands, that as we had made a good voyage, if he could invest it in China silks, wrought and raw, he would be content to go to England, and then make a voyage back to Bengal by the Company's ships.|$|E
6000|$|In {{these terrible}} words the Pope of Dimchurch began:--"Oscar! {{you are to}} {{understand}} distinctly, if you please, that I maintain my protest against this impious attempt to meddle with my afflicted daughter's sight.--Mrs. Finch! you are to understand that I excuse your unseemly pursuit of two strange surgeons, in consideration of the state that I find you in at this moment. After your last confinement but eight you became, I remember, hysterically irresponsible. Hold your tongue. You are hysterically irresponsible now.--Oscar! I decline, in justice to myself, to be present at any discussion which may follow the visit of those two professional persons. But I am not averse to advising you for your own good. My Foot is down. Put your foot down too.--Mrs. Finch! {{how long is it}} since you ate last? Two hours? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> is two hours? Very good. You require a sedative application. I order you, medically, to get into a warm bath, and stay there till I come to you.--Oscar! you are deficient, my good fellow, in moral weight. Endeavor to oppose yourself resolutely to any scheme, on the part of my unhappy daughter or of those who advise her, which involves more expenditure of money in fees, and new appearances of professional persons.--Mrs. Finch! the temperature is to be ninety-eight, and the position partially recumbent.--Oscar! I authorize you (if you can't stop it in any other way) to throw My moral weight into the scale. You are free to say 'I oppose This, with Mr. Finch's approval: I am, so to speak, backed by Mr. Finch.'--Mrs. Finch! I wish you to understand the object of the bath. Hold your tongue. The object is to produce a gentle action on your skin. One of the women is to keep her eye on your forehead. The instant she perceives an appearance of moisture, she is to run for me.--Oscar! you will let me know at what decision they arrive, up-stairs in my daughter's room. Not after they have merely heard what you have to say, but after My Moral Weight has been thrown into the scale.--Mrs. Finch! on leaving the bath, I shall have you only lightly clothed. I forbid, with a view to your head, all compression, whether of stays or strings, round the waist. I forbid garters--with the same object. You will abstain from tea and talking. You will lie, loose, on your back. You will----" ...|$|E
60|$|Second, {{you shall}} have the {{testimony}} of the holy angels also by the scriptures. And first look into Mark 16:3-7 the words are these, 'And they [viz. the disciples] said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone?' They had a good mind to see their Lord, but they could not, as they thought, get away the stone which covered the mouth of the sepulchre. 'And when they looked [that is, towards the sepulchre] they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man [that is, an angel] sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and They [the disciples] were affrighted. And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted [you have no cause for it] Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen, he is not here; behold the place where they laid him.' What scripture can be plainer spoken than this? Here is an angel of the Lord ready to satisfy the disciples of Jesus, that he was risen from the dead. And lest they should think it was not the right Jesus he spoke of, Yes, saith he, it is the same Jesus that you mean; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, do you not? Why he is risen, he is not here. But do you speak seriously, and in good earnest? Yea surely, if you will not believe me, behold the place where they laid him. This scripture, or testimony is very clear to our purpose. But again, the next place is in Matthew 28:3-7. In the third verse there is an angel (as before) bearing witness of the resurrection of Jesus. 'His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow: And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto them, [viz. to the women who came to seek Jesus] Fear not ye': but let them that seek to keep the Lord in his grave fear if they will; for you have no ground of fear, who seek Jesus who was crucified; He is not here, for he is risen; he cannot be in body here and risen too: If you will not believe me, come, see where the Lord lay, and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goeth before you into Galilee, there shall you see him. But shall we be sure of it? Yea, saith the angel, Lo, it is I that have told you. See how plainly this scripture also doth testify of Christ his resurrection. Here, saith the angel, you seek a Saviour and none will content you but he, even the same that was crucified: Well you shall have him, but he is not here. Why, where is he then? He is risen from the dead. But <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> is the same that we look for? Yea, it is the same that was crucified (v 5). But where should we find him? why, he goeth before you into Galilee, where he used to be in his life-time, before he was crucified: And that you might be sure of it, there to find him, know that he is an angel of God that hath told you (v 7). And thus have you in brief {{the testimony of}} the angels of God, to witness that Jesus the son of the virgin, the Son of God, is risen from the dead.|$|E

5000|$|The 1951 children's novel Punchbowl Midnight by Monica Edwards {{features}} {{the story of}} the Unknown Sailor and the Sailor's Stone. One of the characters, Tamzin Grey, believes that she has been cursed because she scratched her initials on the stone with a penknife. [...] "It was for his money they did it, of course," [...] Lindsey said. [...] "And there's a curse, you know.""What sort of curse?""Someone put a stone where the crime was committed and it says on it, 'Cursed be the man who injureth or moveth this stone.'"..."Lindsey, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> says 'injureth' as well as 'moveth'?""Of course. Why?""Well, it's a pretty slender outlook for me, then. I found the stone two days ago and I scratched my initials on it with the marline spike of my knife. Funny thing, I didn't notice any curse at all.""It's {{on the back of the}} stone," [...] said Lindsey.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 October 2012, The Amherst Student {{published}} an essay by Epifano on her personal {{experience of a}} sexual assault at Amherst College. She reported that she was raped by a male acquaintance on May 25, 2011 in dormitory {{on the campus of}} Amherst College. Nine months after the alleged rape occurred, a friend suggested that she seek counseling. When she eventually did so, she reported in her essay that a campus sexual assault counselor told her [...] "In short I was told: No you can't change dorms, there are too many students right now. Pressing charges would be useless, he's about to graduate, there's not much we can do. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>SURE</b> <b>it</b> was rape?" [...] She described how the counseling center focused on her apparent psychological instability and placed her in a psychiatric hospital. Within the first week of publication of the essay, it received over 370,000 hits.|$|E
40|$|If {{you think}} about the last {{television}} commercial for an Italian pasta brand you have seen, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> is really Italian? In many cases, especially in the food sector, neither the company nor the product originate from the advertised country, meaning that the company is pursuing a foreign branding strategy and is trying to benefit from positive stereotypes customers have about the specific foreign country. By collecting both quantitative and qualitative data through a point-of-sale intercept survey, this article assesses the impact of alleged origins on customers’ willingness to buy (WTB) and willingness to pay (WTP) if the actual origin is disclosed. The sample consisted of 200 German customers who were asked to answer questions related to one of two hedonic products they had just bought. It is empirically shown that foreign branding has a positive impact on the brand’s performance. However, as soon as customers find out that they were misled with regard to the origin of the product, both their WTB and their WTP decrease. This study contributes to the knowledge on the role of products’ origins on customers’ WTB and WTP. In contrast to {{the vast majority of the}} studies in this field, the communicated origin of the product is based on a foreign branding strategy and not on the product’s actual origin. Consequently, it was possible to manipulate within-subject variables by disclosing the actual origin of the product. The results of our study suggest that foreign branding may be a successful strategy for companies to increase their customers’ WTB and WTP. At the same time, our results raise concerns about the suitability of foreign branding as a long- term marketing strategy, unless a company can successfully maintain its foreign image. Future research opportunities include the choice of consumers with a different cultural background, of other hedonic products or of utilitarian products...|$|E
