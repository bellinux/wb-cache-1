25|$|At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge {{from one}} another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to {{the pull of the}} tectonic plates, the release of {{pressure}} leads to <b>adiabatic</b> <b>expansion</b> (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the mantle, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are {{at the bottom of the}} oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, Iceland.|$|E

25|$|As gas {{leaves the}} {{cylinder}} it decreases in {{pressure in the}} first stage, becoming very cold due to <b>adiabatic</b> <b>expansion.</b> Where the ambient water temperature is less than 5°C any water {{in contact with the}} regulator may freeze. If this ice jams the diaphragm or piston spring, preventing the valve closing, a free-flow may ensue that can empty a full cylinder within a minute or two, and the free-flow causes further cooling in a positive feedback loop. Generally the water that freezes is in the ambient pressure chamber around a spring that keeps the valve open and not moisture in the breathing gas from the cylinder, but that is also possible if the air is not adequately filtered. The modern trend of using plastics to replace metal components in regulators encourages freezing because it insulates the inside of a cold regulator from the warmer surrounding water. Some regulators are provided with heat exchange fins in areas where cooling due to air expansion is a problem, such as around the second stage valve seat on some regulators.|$|E

As a possible alternative to the plasmoid mechanism for decreasing the relatively large possible macroscopic or bulk motions in QSO clouds, it is shown that certain large relative bulk motions in QSO clouds can be dissipated without the presence of strong magnetic fields and without large <b>adiabatic</b> <b>expansions.</b> The essence of the argument is that a cloud with convergent internal velocities can coalesce inelastically, because the internal kinetic energy can be dissipated and radiated away.

This convergence is not achieved in mass models with a quenched N = 82 shell gap. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier B. V...|$|R

2500|$|Other {{real-world}} issues {{reduce the}} efficiency of actual engines, because of limits of convective heat transfer, and viscous flow (friction). There are also practical mechanical considerations, for instance a simple kinematic linkage may be favoured over a more complex mechanism needed to replicate the idealized cycle, and limitations imposed by available materials such as non-ideal properties of the working gas, thermal conductivity, tensile strength, creep, rupture strength, and melting point. A question that often arises is whether the ideal cycle with isothermal expansion and compression {{is in fact the}} correct ideal cycle to apply to the Stirling engine. Professor C. J. Rallis has pointed out that {{it is very difficult to}} imagine any condition where the expansion and compression spaces may approach isothermal behavior and it is far more realistic to imagine these spaces as adiabatic. An ideal analysis where the expansion and compression spaces are taken to be adiabatic with isothermal heat exchangers and perfect regeneration was analyzed by Rallis and presented as a better ideal yardstick for Stirling machinery. He called this cycle the 'pseudo-Stirling cycle' or 'ideal adiabatic Stirling cycle'. An important consequence of this ideal cycle is that it does not predict Carnot efficiency. A further conclusion of this ideal cycle is that maximum efficiencies are found at lower compression ratios, a characteristic observed in real machines. In an independent work, T. Finkelstein also assumed <b>adiabatic</b> <b>expansion</b> and compression spaces in his analysis of Stirling machinery ...|$|E

In contrast using electron impact ionization the clusters are strongly fragmented when varying the electron energy between 150 and 1 500 eV. The number of evaporated molecules depends on the cluster size and the energy dependence follows that of the stopping power of the solid material.
