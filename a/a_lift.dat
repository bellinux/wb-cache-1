5000|$|Especially at ski areas, {{chairlifts}} {{are referred}} to with a ski industry vernacular. <b>A</b> one-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "single", <b>a</b> two-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "double", <b>a</b> three-person <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> “triple”, four-person <b>lifts</b> are “quads”, and <b>a</b> six-person <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> [...] "six pack". If the <b>lift</b> is <b>a</b> detachable chairlift, it is typically referred to as <b>a</b> “high-speed” <b>lift,</b> which results in a “high-speed quad” or “high-speed six pack”.|$|R
30|$|Since π :Δ X →Δ is <b>a</b> {{discrete}} fibration, <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> morphism f:[n] → [n'] in Δ to a morphism in Δ X {{amounts to}} choosing a simplex x' ∈ X([n']), and <b>lifting</b> <b>a</b> commutative square (5.1) to a commutative square in Δ X amounts to choosing x_ 12 ∈ X([n_ 12]). Say that such <b>a</b> <b>lifted</b> morphism f is special resp. co-special {{if it is}} so as a morphism in Δ, and say such <b>a</b> <b>lifted</b> square is standard if it is standard in Δ.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>lifting</b> hook is <b>a</b> {{device for}} {{grabbing}} and lifting loads {{by means of}} a device such as a hoist or crane. <b>A</b> <b>lifting</b> hook is usually equipped with a safety latch to prevent the disengagement of the lifting wire rope sling, chain or rope to which the load is attached.|$|R
5|$|Abbotsford Bridge is a steel Allan truss-type bridge {{spanning}} the Murray River between Curlwaa, New South Wales, and Yelta, Victoria. It {{is the only}} remaining steel truss bridge with <b>a</b> <b>lift</b> span that crosses the Murray. Opened in 1928, the bridge was built by the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Public Works and was designed by Percy Allan. It was the second last lift-span bridge to be built over the river, the last being the Nyah Bridge, which opened in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Also {{known as}} Nam Tin Hotel, the Great Southern Hotel in Singapore's Chinatown {{was built by}} Swan and Maclaren in 1936. Started as a {{boutique}} hotel, it was the tallest building in Chinatown when it was completed. It {{was also the first}} Chinese hotel in Singapore with <b>a</b> <b>lift.</b> Its height also gave it an unfortunate reputation as the focal point of many suicide attempts in its early days, until the tall Singapore Improvement Trust flats at Upper Pickering Street were built.|$|E
5|$|In {{this section}} Tolkien {{describes}} {{variations on the}} basic patterns. For example, dips (between lifts) were usually monosyllabic, {{but the number of}} syllables was not limited by Old English metre, so a series of weak syllables was permitted in a half-line. Other variations included breaking <b>a</b> <b>lift</b> into two syllables, the first short but stressed, the second weak, with for instance 'vĕssel' in place of 'boat'.|$|E

5|$|The urban {{regeneration}} company Clydebank Re-Built started a £3.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane {{opened to the}} public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting. <b>A</b> <b>lift</b> for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night.|$|E
5|$|A family {{goes to a}} {{hotel with}} their gran, (which would have been played by Helen Mirren.) Gran hates the family {{so much that she}} wants them to {{disappear}} as they then do. She's stuck in the hotel until the Doctor appears in <b>a</b> <b>lift.</b> Russell T Davies thought of this idea to pick for a potential Christmas Special for 2009 to give to Phil Ford to write. Phil decided to use some aliens in the plot he was given and a chase down Buckingham Palace. But Russell decided that the better choice was 'Christmas on Mars' which then became The Waters of Mars.|$|E
5|$|At six storeys, the Great Southern Hotel was {{the first}} Chinese hotel to have <b>a</b> <b>lift.</b> The {{original}} design accommodated offices on the first storey, the hotel on {{the second and third}} storeys, a restaurant on the fifth storey, and a tea house on the roof terrace as well as a cabaret. The restaurant on the fourth floor was later converted into the owner's office. The whole of the fifth floor was occupied by a then-well-known cabaret, the Southern Cabaret. Shops and entertainment outlets, including a Hainanese kopitiam, were situated on the ground floor.|$|E

5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some airflow relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster airflow moving over the wing. This generates <b>a</b> <b>lift</b> force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Boyd had {{her first}} {{encounter}} with LSD in early 1965 when the couple's dentist, John Riley, secretly laced her coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home. As she {{was getting ready to}} leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in <b>a</b> <b>lift</b> on their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone {{sought to}} remove the pigeons from Trafalgar Square; he tried to evict seed sellers and {{introduced}} hawks to scare the pigeons off. He pedestrianised {{the north side of}} the Square, transforming it into a public space with a cafe, public toilets, and <b>a</b> <b>lift</b> for the disabled. He introduced an annual Saint Patrick's Day festival to celebrate the contributions of the Irish to London, and revived London's free anti-racism music festival, now called , later attributing London's 35% decrease in racist attacks to this and other anti-racist policies. Continuing his support for LGBT rights, in 2001 he set up Britain's first register for same-sex couples; while falling short of legal marriage rights, the register was seen as a step towards the Civil Partnership Act 2004.|$|E

5|$|Meyer's major storylines include {{operating}} {{on his own}} sister when she falls ill, despite a long-term enmity with his brother-in-law, Greg. He seeks help from his friend, neurologist Professor Charles Merrick (Simon Williams), when he fears he may have Motor Neurone Disease, but Merrick deduces he has an easily treatable thyroid problem instead. Merrick's daughter Victoria (Lisa Faulkner) works on Meyer's firm for a period as a Senior house officer (SHO). When she is murdered by the irate father {{of one of her}} patients, Meyer becomes involved when he is trapped in <b>a</b> <b>lift</b> with her killer, James Campbell. Campbell overdoses on pills and dies in the lift before Meyer can revive him to face justice.|$|E
5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get <b>a</b> <b>lift</b> to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
5|$|On its route southwards, {{the river}} passes the former {{junction}} with Aike Beck, once navigable to Lockington Landing, but the stream was subsequently re-routed {{to join the}} Arram Beck. The Leven Canal used to join on the east bank, but the entrance lock {{has been replaced by}} a sluice. The Arram Beck flows in from the west, and then the river is crossed by Hull Bridge, the cause of repeated disagreement between the owners of the Driffield Navigation and the Corporation of Beverley, who owned the bridge. Just above Beverley Beck, which joins from the west, is Grovehill Bridge, now <b>a</b> <b>lift</b> bridge but once a ferry bridge.|$|E

5|$|State {{maintenance}} begins {{again on}} the Terminal Island Freeway, which is also signed as State Route 103. After a partial interchange with New Dock Street, only allowing access {{to and from the}} north, SR 47 crosses the Cerritos Channel on the Schuyler Heim Bridge, <b>a</b> <b>lift</b> bridge opened in 1948. Just beyond the bridge, SR 47 leaves the freeway, which continues northeast as SR 103, onto Henry Ford Avenue, and state maintenance ends. The remainder of what is signed as SR 47, along Henry Ford Avenue and Alameda Street to the Redondo Beach Freeway (SR 91), is locally maintained. Henry Ford Avenue quickly crosses the Dominguez Channel and Anaheim Street, and merges with Alameda Street, which continues southwest into Wilmington as a local street.|$|E
5|$|The club can cater for fleets of {{over one}} hundred boats and it hosts large {{national}} events. Normal club racing has fleet starts for the following dinghy classes: Flying Fifteen (keelboat), Laser (dinghy), Solo (dinghy) and Topper (dinghy) {{as well as a}} handicap fleet run under the Portsmouth yardstick scheme. Five slipways enable easy launching. Off the water, the clubhouse facilities include large changing rooms, hot showers, hot food at the weekends, a bar and terrace overlooking the lake. The club caters for disabled people with facilities on both floors and <b>a</b> <b>lift.</b> Royal Yachting Association sailing courses are held at the club for members including race training, youth training, powerboat training, race officer training as well as more informal training run within each fleet.|$|E
