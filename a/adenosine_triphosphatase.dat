2500|$|Digoxin's primary {{mechanism}} of action involves inhibition of the sodium potassium <b>adenosine</b> <b>triphosphatase</b> (Na+/K+ ATPase), mainly in the myocardium. This inhibition causes an increase in intracellular sodium levels, resulting in decreased activity of the sodium-calcium exchanger, which normally imports three extracellular sodium ions into the cell and transports one intracellular calcium ion out of the cell. The inaction of this exchanger causes {{an increase in the}} intracellular calcium concentration that is available to the contractile proteins. Increased intracellular calcium lengthens phase 4 and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, which leads to a decrease in heart rate. [...] Increased amounts of Ca2+ also leads to increased storage of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a corresponding increase in the release of calcium during each action potential. This leads to increased contractility (the force of contraction) of the heart without increasing heart energy expenditure.|$|E

However, increasing evidence {{for the importance of}} local ATP and GTP pools, synthesised in close proximity to ATP- or GTP-consuming reactions, has fundamentally challenged our view of energy metabolism. It has become evident that cellular energy metabolism occurs in many specialised ‘microcompartments’, where energy in the form of NTPs is transferred preferentially from NTP-generating modules directly to NTP-consuming modules. Such energy channeling occurs when diffusion through the cytosol is limited, where these modules are physically close and, in particular, if the NTP-consuming reaction has a very high turnover, i. e. is very processive. Here, we summarise the evidence for these conclusions and describe new insights into the physiological importance and molecular mechanisms of energy channeling gained from recent studies.
