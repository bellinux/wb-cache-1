Feelings of turmoil, difficulty in thinking constructively, loss of sex-drive, agoraphobia and social phobia, increasing anxiety and depression, loss of interest in leisure pursuits and interests, and an inability to experience or express feelings can also occur. Not everyone, however, experiences problems with long-term use. Additionally, an altered perception of self, environment and relationships may occur.|$|E

40|$|In today's {{knowledge-based}} {{and competitive}} economy, {{research and development}} (R&D) efforts are increasingly geographically distributed across multiple institutions. This chapter explores the management of cognitive <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> trust <b>and</b> distrust within {{a new type of}} geographically distributed and multi-institutional R&D organization, called the conceptual organization. Both cognitive <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> trust are important to the conceptual organization because it relies on collaboration among individual members to achieve its goals, and collaboration is not possible without cognitive or affective trust. Data from a 2 -year case study of a conceptual organization illuminates how the organization's structure, use of power and information and communications technology (I&CT) shape and are shaped by cognitive <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> trust. Tightly coupled collaboration appears to only emerge in situations where high cognitive <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> trust simultaneously exist, and no collaboration will emerge in situations with high cognitive <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> distrust exist. In comparison, limited collaboration emerges when <b>affective</b> trust <b>and</b> cognitive distrust exist concurrently, and competitive collaboration appears to emerge when cognitive trust <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> distrust exist concurrently. Different mechanisms to manage the collaboration emerged in these situations. These results help inform our understanding of cognitive <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> trust <b>and</b> distrust, and their management in R&D...|$|R

Results showed that both cognitive <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> empathy were positively related to prosocial behavior. Furthermore, cognitive empathy was positively related to offending, whereas affective empathy was not related to offending. Finally, no support was found for our hypothesis that cognitive distortions play a moderating role in the relation between empathy and offending...|$|R

25|$|Aggression {{can have}} {{adaptive}} benefits or negative effects. Aggressive behavior {{is an individual}} or collective social interaction that is a hostile behavior {{with the intention of}} inflicting damage or harm. Two broad categories of aggression are commonly distinguished. One includes affective (emotional) and hostile, reactive, or retaliatory aggression that is a response to provocation, and the other includes instrumental, goal-oriented or predatory, in which aggression is used as a mean to achieve a goal. An example of hostile aggression would be a person who punches someone who insulted him or her. An instrumental form of aggression would be armed robbery. Research on violence from a range of disciplines lend some support to a distinction between <b>affective</b> <b>and</b> predatory aggression. However, some researchers question the usefulness of a hostile versus instrumental distinction in humans, despite its ubiquity in research, because most real-life cases involve mixed motives and interacting causes.|$|E

40|$|The central aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{predictive}} value of <b>affective</b> disposition <b>and</b> meaningful work on employee engagement. Specifically, it was proposed that meaningful work moderates the relationship between <b>affective</b> disposition <b>and</b> engagement. Questionnaires were completed by 252 white-collar employees, working in a variety of organizations and jobs across Israel, recruited from community-based samples on a voluntary basis. As hypothesized, work engagement, <b>affective</b> disposition, <b>and</b> meaningful work were positively correlated. Additionally, a significant interaction between <b>affective</b> disposition <b>and</b> meaningful work was found. The relationship between <b>affective</b> disposition <b>and</b> work engagement was found to differ by the extent to which individuals perceived their work as meaningful. Specifically, when work was not perceived as meaningful, employees characterized by high scores on affective disposition were more strongly engaged compared to employees who were characterized by low scores on affective disposition.

500|$|Cognitive {{science is}} the {{interdisciplinary}} {{scientific study of}} the mind and its processes. [...] It examines what cognition is, what it does, and how it works. [...] It includes research on intelligence and behavior, especially focusing on how information is represented, processed, and transformed (in faculties such as perception, language, memory, reasoning, and emotion) within nervous systems (human or other animal) and machines (e.g. computers). Cognitive science consists of multiple research disciplines, including psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, and education. It spans many levels of analysis, from low-level learning and decision mechanisms to high-level logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organisation. Rowlands argues [...] that cognition is [...] enactive, embodied, embedded, <b>affective</b> <b>and</b> (potentially) extended.

This theory argues that there is value for the individuals who interact because over time a reciprocal relationship develops and delivers intangible and tangible outcomes such as resources and support, which benefit individuals and the organisational overall. Using SET, the theory argues that effective supervisor-nurse relationships engage nurses, which in turn, promote high levels of psychological wellbeing <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> commitment <b>and</b> in turn, low turnover intentions.

A total of 370 service employees from Canada completed a questionnaire.
