6000|$|That Southampton, however, DID 'take notice' may {{be safely}} {{inferred}} {{from the fact}} that Shakespeare, in 1594, dedicated to him 'The Rape of Lucrece.' Had the Earl been an ungrateful patron, had he taken no notice, Shakespeare had Latin enough to act on the motto Invenies alium si te hic fastidit <b>Alexin.</b> He speaks of 'the warrant I have of your honourable disposition,' which makes the poem 'assured of acceptance.' This could never have been written had the dedication of 'Venus and Adonis' been disdained. 'The client never acknowledged his obligation to the patron,' says Judge Webb. The dedication of 'Lucrece' is acknowledgment enough. The Judge ought to think so, for he speaks, with needless vigour, of 'the protestations, warm and gushing as a geyser, of [...] "The Rape."' There is nothing 'warm,' and nothing 'gushing,' in the dedication of 'Lucrece' (granting the style of the age), but, if it were as the Judge says, here, indeed, would be the client's 'acknowledgment,' which, the Judge says, was never made.* To argue against such logic seems needless, and even cruel, but judicial contentions appear to deserve a reply.|$|E

40|$|The {{experiments}} here recorded, as well {{as those}} preceding them and outlined in the introductory paragraphs, have had the purpose of analyzing the phenomenon of <b>alexin</b> fixation occurring when dissolved, unformed proteins are added to their specific antisera. The present experiments have shown that specific precipitates have the same relation to the complement fractions first described by Ferrata that are possessed by sensitized cells. In this they differ from indifferent suspensions, like kaolin, which fix <b>alexin</b> and its fractions indiscriminately, fixing the end-piece without dependence upon previous adsorption of the mid-piece. The writer believes this to be of theoretical importance since it seems to show, in the first place, that the fixation of <b>alexin</b> by precipitates is not merely a mechanical adsorption, and in that it renders more likely the supposition that the so called precipitin is actually a protein sensitizer by which a foreign protein is rendered amenable to the proteolytic action of the <b>alexin.</b> The visible precipitation in such reactions is merely secondary, occurring because of the colloidal nature of the reacting bodies, under conditions of quantitative proportions and environment which favor flocculation. It does not seem necessary to assume a structure for the so called precipitins essentially different from that of other sensitizers. Carried to its logical consequences, the acceptance of this view, taking the identity of agglutinins and precipitins at least as a possibility, leads to the conception that functionally there is but one variety of specific antibodies, and that is the sensitizer which makes possible the action of <b>alexin</b> or complement upon various antigens...|$|E
40|$|Our {{experiments}} {{show that}} the albumen fraction, or end-piece, obtained by the dialysis of normal guinea pig serum possesses definite opsonic action. This action is often almost equal to that residing in the unfractionated <b>alexin.</b> It is evident, however, only if the reaction maintained during the experiments approximates that of the original serum. By the addition of small quantities of a weak sodium hydrate solution to the dialyzed serum {{we have been able}} to bring back opsonic action which was not evident in the same end-piece if simply rendered isotonic. Although our attention was called to the question of reaction by the work of Bronfenbrenner and Noguchi, like Liefmann, we have been unable to reactivate the hemolytic function of end-piece by alteration of reaction. Our experiments suggest that the opsonic action of the albumen fraction is enhanced by preliminary sensitization of the bacteria with heated normal serum and by persensitization of such bacteria with the globulin fraction. However, we cannot be positive of this, since the slight differences of phagocytic counts upon which such an opinion can be based, fall within the limits of what we consider our experimental error. The fact that the albumen fraction can exert opsonic activity upon bacteria but cannot hemolyze blood cells seems to us particularly interesting in the light of the fact that <b>alexin</b> can be absorbed by unsensitized bacteria but not by similarly untreated blood cells. The literature upon the relation of the <b>alexin</b> fractions to bacteria and the bactericidal effect is confusing in that contradictory results have been obtained by other workers. We are studying this phase of the problem with particular attention to the alkalinity or acidity under which the reactions are carried out. We think that our experiments do not point to a differentiation of normal opsonin from <b>alexin,</b> but we believe they indicate that the so called end-piece can enter to a slight extent into non-specific relationship with unsensitized bacteria, and it is therefore active, whereas it cannot enter into a similar relation to unsensitized cells. This conception, however, is tentatively made, since we are studying further the non-specific absorption of <b>alexin</b> or complement by unsensitized bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Whether {{complement}} or <b>alexin</b> {{be measured}} in hemolytic, opsonic, bactericidal, or combining units, these units refer only to the smallest volume of guinea pig or other serum producing the effect in question and give no indication of the actual amount of complement involved. The present study was undertaken {{in the hope of}} filling this gap and providing, in place of these relative and often variable units, an absolute measure of complement in weight units. The need for this seemed all the more indicated by the extension of knowledge and the results of theoretical and practical interest that followed substitution of the old relative dilution methods by quantitative, absolute methods of antigen and antibody estimation conforming to the criteria of analytical chemistry (1 - 3). It has been known for many years that the titer of added complement or <b>alexin</b> is reduced by antigen-antibody precipitation in rabbit antisera; but the actual addition of a complement component to such precipitates has not been shown directly although hemolysis is generally interpreted as mediated by the addition of complement to the red cell. Indeed, Muir (4) has defined complement as "that labile substance of normal serum which is taken up by the combination of an antigen and its anti-substance (immune-body). " Owing to the accuracy with which specifically precipitable nitrogen may be measured, the quantitative precipitin method (5) seemed worthy of trial as a means of estimating any actual uptake of complement. It was thought that any difference between the amounts of specifically precipitable nitrogen found in the presence of active complement, on the one hand, and in the presence of inactivated complement on the other, might serve as a measure, in milligrams of nitrogen per milliliter...|$|E

40|$|The {{preceding}} experiments {{showed that}} partial or complete inactivation of serum by shaking {{brought about a}} marked decrease in the activity of homologous fibroblasts. Generally, serum was not completely inactivated by shaking. In only one instance was the hemo-lytic effect of chicken serum on sheep corpuscles entirely lost after the serum had been shaken for 8 hours. In all other cases, the normal hemolytic power of chicken and dog sera for sheep erythrocytes was merely decreased. The effect of shaking varied according to certain conditions of the serum. It may {{be compared to the}} inffuence of heat, which differs widely according to individual sera, even when they are obtained from animals which are apparently in identical condition. Shaken serum always inhibited the activity of homologous fibroblasts more than normal serum. When chicken serum was completely inactivated by shaking, its restraining action on chicken fibroblasts became also more marked. On the contrary, dog serum partly inactivated by shaking was much less toxic for chicken fibroblasts than normal serum. Thus, shaking brought about a change in the condition of serum, against which homologous and heterologous fibroblasts reacted in an opposite manner. At the same time, the normal lytic action of serum on foreign erythrocytes decreased. This last phenomenon is caused, as is well known, by the partial or complete destruction of <b>alexin.</b> The decrease of the restraining effect of shaken serum on foreign fibroblasts may be attributed to the same cause. The increase of the inhibiting action of shaken serum on homologous fibroblasts is due possibly to the disappearance of a substance favoring the activity of homologous cells. A similar hypothesis was advanced for explaining the increase of the growth-inhibiting action of serum under the influence of senescence and of heat. The restraining power of adult serum on cell multiplication {{may be due to the}} antagonistic action of growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting substances, the growth-promoting substance being as unstable as <b>alexin</b> and certain tissue juices which have the property of increasing the rate of cell proliferation. <b>Alexin</b> and growth-activating substances contained in embryonic and gland tissue juices have in common the property of being destroyed by heat and by shaking. Leucocytes added to serum under certain conditions increase its hemolytic power on foreign erythrocytes and decrease its inhibiting action on homologous fibroblasts. Variations in the alex-inic activity of serum under other influences are followed also by a change in its action on homologous cells. Long ago, Gengou found that serum from plasma is less bactericidal than serum from blood. We observed that the lytic effect on sheep erythrocytes of dog and chicken serum from blood was sometimes more marked than that of serum from plasma, but there was often no difference in the action of both sera. At the same time, the growth of homologous fibroblasts was always more extensive in the serum from blood. The opposite effect was observed when heterologous fibroblasts were used. The growth-inhibiting power of serum from blood was still less marked on leucocytes than on fibroblasts. But embryonic juice, which greatly enhances the rate of multiplication of homologous cells, did not increase the lytic action of serum on foreign erythrocytes. It may be concluded that, under the conditions of the experiments: 1. Chicken serum partly or completely inactivated by shaking becomes more inhibiting for chicken fibroblasts. 2. Dog serum partly inactivated by shaking becomes less inhibiting for chicken fibroblasts...|$|E

The length of the inhibition period varied; the milk from some cows prevented growth for 8 hours, that of others for only 4 or 6 hours.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{condition}} of the technique of cultivation of tissues, the only possible way of studying leucocytic secretions was to grow colonies of leucocytes in a medium of known properties and to examine the modifications of these properties {{under the influence of}} the living cells. The method was far from perfect, because the secretions were mixed with serum and accumulated for 48 hours in a medium where they probably underwent partial destruction. But an approximate idea of certain of the qualities of the secretions, although not of their quantity, could be derived from the experiments. In the fluids extracted from the cultures, we attempted to detect the presence of the leucocytic secretions through their physiological effects on homologous and foreign cells. Two kinds of substances were sought, those which act on homologous cells, and those which destroy foreign erythrocytes. The secretion by leucocytes of substances necessary to the nutrition of other cells was considered as probable long ago. Renaut thought that the main function of the white blood corpuscles was to bring to the fixed cells of the tissues the food material which they need. While the existence of physiological relations between leucocytes and tissue cells could be considered as almost certain, their nature had remained practically unknown. It was probable, however, that the substances secreted by leucocytes were analogous to the growth-activating and unstable substances which are found in embryonic tissues, leucocytes, and certain adult tissues. When connective tissue was aseptically inflamed, or when an aseptic peritoneal exudate contained many leucocytes, aqueous extracts of both connective tissue and peritoneal exudate were found to have acquired the power of stimulating cell proliferation. These experiments showed that leucocytes could bring to the tissues some activating substances. But it remained to be ascertained whether leucocytes, while they are alive, could secrete similar substances either spontaneously or under the stimulus of a foreign factor. Leucocytes are supposed to be, as is well know, the origin of the substances which protect the organism against infection. Although the problem of the origin of <b>alexin</b> and antibodies has been investigated by many experimenters, it is not yet completely solved. It was of interest, therefore, to ascertain whether leucocytic secretions could increase the natural hemolytic effect of hen serum on sheep or rabbit erythrocytes, and whether these secretions would become more active under the influence of a foreign protein. The substances which destroy foreign cells are not necessarily different from those which act on homologous cells. The word substance is used for simplicity of description and may be taken as meaning only a given property of an unknown substrate. A comparison was made of certain properties of sera extracted after 48 hours incubation from media containing leucocytes and from media containing no leucocytes. The serum from the leucocytic cultures was always found to be more favorable to the growth of homologous fibroblasts than the serum from the culture media incubated without leucocytes. The natural hemolytic power of the serum on sheep erythrocytes was found to be increased in about SO per cent of the experiments. In other experiments, we found that when two culture media free of cells were placed, one in an incubator at + 38 °C. and the other in a refrigerator at + 5 °C. for 48 hours, the serum from the incubated medium partly lost its hemolytic action on sheep or rabbit erythrocytes, while that from the refrigerated medium remained normal; at the same time, the inhibiting action of the incubated medium on homologous fibroblasts had increased very much. This effect of incubation indicates that certain unstable constituents of serum are destroyed by heat. Then the changes found in the properties of the serum from cultures of leucocytes are due to the fraction of the activating substances which has not been destroyed by incubation at 38 °C. A quantitative study of the secretions is, therefore, impossible with the present technique, which can furnish only qualitative indications about the substances set free by the leucocytes. We have ascertained also whether a medium containing leucocytes and kept in the refrigerator undergoes any change {{under the influence of the}} cells while they are in a condition of latent life. Gabritschewski dishes with and without leucocytes were placed in a refrigerator at a temperature of about + 5 °C. After 48 hours, the hemolytic power on sheep erythrocytes of the serum from the leucocytic cultures had increased slightly and its inhibiting action on the growth of homologous fibroblasts had decreased. Then certain substances favorable to the growth of homologous cells and toxic for heterologous cells were diffused by the leucocytes into their medium. But the action of these substances was weaker than in the case of the cultures kept in the incubator. This experiment showed that leucocytes under certain conditions diffuse <b>alexin</b> or natural hemolysins which originate from them at the same time as the substances which activate homologous cells. In other experiments, although leucocytes were frozen at – 10 °C., treated with distilled water, or extracted with saline solution, they did not yield any hemolysin. To summarize: Leucocytes, cultivated in plasma, always secreted substances which increased the rate of growth of homologous cells. Less frequently, they set free substances which hemolyzed foreign erythrocytes. The growth-promoting substances are analogous to those contained in embryonic tissues, and probably represent some of the foodstuffs brought to fixed tissue cells by leucocytes. They may possess the function of rejuvenating cells which have ceased to multiply when the cicatrization of a wound or the repair of a fracture requires a resumption of tissue activity. According to this hypothesis, the leucocytes brought to the surface of a wound by the process of inflammation would not only oppose bacterial invasion, but also bring to the tissues the material necessary to cell multiplication. It seems that in some cases regeneration is started by substances brought to the tissues by other cells. Loeb thinks that in Tubularia, when endodermic cells gather at the end where a new polyp is about to be formed, the substances given off by these cells are responsible for polyp formation. 6 There may be an analogy between this phenomenon and the secretion by leucocytes of growth-activating substances at the surface of a wound. If we assume that leucocytes in vivo set free their secretions in the blood stream, certain variations of the growth-inhibiting action of normal serum can be better understood. The rate of proliferation of homologous fibroblasts is much slower in the serum of an old chicken than in that of a young one. When the serum is heated at 56 ° and 70 °C. for ½ hour, it becomes still more inhibiting. A substance favorable to cell activity has disappeared. It is therefore permissible to suppose that the growth-inhibiting power of serum and its variations are due to the antagonistic action of two substances, one growth-promoting and thermolabile, and the other growth-inhibiting and thermostable, the activating substance being always weaker in its effect than the inhibiting one. We know that activating substances can be extracted from embryonic tissue, from muscle and gland tissues, and from leucocytes of the adult animal, and that they are thermolabile and very unstable. Leucocytic secretions seem to have some of the properties of leucocytic extracts. It is probable that the activating substances which disappear from the heated serum are secreted by leucocytes and other cells. An increase of these secretions, then, would diminish the inhibiting action of serum on homologous fibroblasts. On the contrary, a decrease of the secretions in the serum would increase its inhibiting effect on homologous cells. The strong inhibiting action of serum in old age would be due partly to a reduction in the amount and activity of the substances secreted by leucocytes and tissue cells in the humors of the organism. Leucocytes also secreted in vitro substances which were toxic for foreign cells. Although the results were not constant, the serum appeared to become slightly more hemolytic for sheep or rabbit erythrocytes, under the influence of the leucocytes. The hemolysis of rabbit corpuscles by hen serum is due, according to Hyde, 9 to a complex sensitizer <b>alexin,</b> and not merely to <b>alexin,</b> as Bordet thought. When a foreign protein was added to the culture medium, the leucocytic secretions increased, as was shown by the action on homologous fibroblasts of sera taken from cultures of leucocytes with and without casein. The presence in the medium of the cultures of leucocytes of only 0. 1 per 1, 000 casein did not markedly modify the action of their serum on the proliferation of fibroblasts. When the concentration of casein in the leucocyte cultures reached 1 per 1, 000, the growth of chicken fibroblasts in the serum extracted from the Gabritschewski dishes became more rapid. But there was no parallel increase of the hemolytic action of the serum upon sheep erythrocytes. We found that chicken serum containing 0. 1 per 1, 000 casein was barely toxic for homologous fibroblasts, while it became markedly inhibiting when the casein concentration reached 1 per 1, 000. Probably, there is a relation between the toxicity of the medium, the increase of leucocytic secretions, and the time of the increase. The change brought about by casein in the equilibrium of the system composed of the cells and their medium determines the secretion by the leucocytes of substances which increase the activity of homologous cells and oppose the inhibiting effect of the foreign proteins. This reaction of the leucocytes is immediate, and may represent the first defense of the organism against a factor which disturbs its equilibrium. Possibly it differs from the specific cell reaction which leads to the production of antibodies. It is known that antibodies develop more slowly. Hemolysins were detected in cultures of bone marrow 4 days after the addition of antigen. The immunization of fibroblasts against foreign proteins has been shown by Fischer to begin after 4 days. If leucocytes behave in the organism as they do in vitro, we may assume that before the appearance of antibodies, they respond to the presence of an antigen by setting free growth-promoting substances and possibly <b>alexin.</b> This immediate reaction of the leucocytes against a disturbing factor, and the resulting production of substances which increase the activity of homologous cells, might be partly responsible for the results observed in the treatment of certain diseases by the injection of foreign proteins. It may be concluded that, under the conditions of the experiments: 1. The serum obtained from cultures of leucocytes is less inhibiting for homologous fibroblasts than the serum from media without leucocytes. In some experiments, its hemolytic action on sheep or rabbit erythrocytes is also increased. 2. The addition of casein to leucocytic cultures brings about a decrease in the inhibiting effect of the serum on homologous fibroblasts. 3. The increase in the activity of homologous fibroblasts in serum obtained from leucocytic cultures is probably due to growth-promoting substances secreted by the leucocytes. The presence of a foreign protein under certain conditions determines a more abundant leucocytic secretion...|$|E
