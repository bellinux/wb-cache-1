40|$|A {{screening}} of several Chinese medicinal herbs for nematicidal properties showed that <b>Arisaema</b> <b>erubescens</b> (Wall.) Schott tubers possessed significant nematicidal activity against the root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita). From the ethanol extract, two nematicidal flavone-C-glycosides were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation. The compounds {{were identified as}} schaftoside and isoschaftoside {{on the basis of}} their phytochemical and spectral data. Schaftoside and isoschaftoside possessed strong nematicidal activity against M. incognita (LC 50 = 114. 66 μg/mL and 323. 09 μg/mL, respectively) while the crude extract of A. erubescens exhibited nematicidal activity against the root-knot nematode with a LC 50 value of 258. 11 μg/mL...|$|E
40|$|The monocot lectin {{from the}} tubers of <b>Arisaema</b> <b>erubescens</b> (Wall.) Schott has been {{purified}} by consecutive hydrophobic chromatography and ion exchange chromatography methods. The molecular weight of this A. erubescens lectin (AEL) {{was determined to}} be about 12 kDa by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) methods. AEL could agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes. The haemagglutination activity of AEL was only inhibited by asialofetuin, while monosaccharide did not react. Rat paw edema and neutrophil migration models were used to investigate the pro-inflammatory activity of AEL. AEL (100 and 200 μg/paw) could induce significant rat paw edema. In addition, AEL (100, 200 and 300 μg/mL/cavity) could induce significant and dose-dependent neutrophil migration in the rat peritoneal cavities. Besides, AEL at doses ranging from 100 to 300 μg/mL/cavity could significantly increase the concentration of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal fluid. As compared with control animals, 75 % depletion in the number of resident cells following peritoneal lavage did not reduce the AEL-induced neutrophil migration. However, pre-treatment with 3 % thioglycollate which increased the peritoneal macrophage population by 201 %, enhanced the neutrophil migration induced by AEL (200 μg/mL/cavity) (p < 0. 05). Reduction of peritoneal mast cell population by chronic treatment of rat peritoneal cavities with compound 48 / 80 (N-methyl-p-methoxyphenethylamine with formaldehyde) did not modify AEL-induced neutrophil migration. The results provided the basis for identifying the toxic components of A. erubescens and AEL could be a new useful tool for pro-inflammatory research...|$|E
