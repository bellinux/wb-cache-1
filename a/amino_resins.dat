50|$|Urea-formaldehyde, {{also known}} as urea-methanal, so named for its common {{synthesis}} pathway and overall structure, is a non-transparent thermosetting resin or plastic. It is produced from urea and formaldehyde. These resins are used in adhesives, finishes, particle board, MDF, and molded objects. UF and related <b>amino</b> <b>resins</b> are a class of thermosetting resins of which urea-formaldehyde resins make up 80% produced globally.

5000|$|Safety {{concerns}} are two part, one being fine dust and chemicals released when particleboard is machined (e.g., sawing or routing). Occupational exposure limits exist {{in many countries}} recognizing the hazard of wood dusts. Cutting particle board can release formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide (in the case of <b>amino</b> <b>resins)</b> and phenol (in the case of phenol-formaldehyde resins). The other concern is with the slow release of formaldehyde over time. In 1984 concerns about the initial indoor level of formaldehyde led the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to set standards for construction of manufactured homes. Particleboard (PB), medium density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), and laminated flooring have been major sources of formaldehyde emissions. In response to much consumer and woodworker pressure on the industry, PB and MDF are at least now available in [...] "no added formaldehyde" [...] (NAF) versions, which are not yet commonly used by 2015.

Protective liquid surface treatments such as paints and varnishes are often used to extend the esthetic and economic life of wooden material surfaces [15 – 17]. The main purpose of a surface treatment is to protect the surface of wood and give it a good appearance. Varnishes and paints are the most used coating materials and are usually the outermost layer of the treated wood. Coating materials consist of binders, fillers, pigments, flatting agents, solvents, and additives. The main properties of the materials to be used for surface treatment depend greatly on the binder.

A solid-supported perfluorosulfonyl linker unit would allow cleavage of substrates using transition-metal- catalysed cross-coupling reactions. This thesis describes several approaches towards a perfluoroalkanesulfonyl diversity linker from diiodoperfluoroalkanes. Early work concentrated on the reaction of diiodoperfluoroalkanes with eugenol. The resulting perfluoroalkyliodides were attached to Wang resin using Mitsunobu chemistry. However, stability problems prevented the generation of resin bound perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids and the route was abandoned. A bis-perfluoroalkanesulfonyl chloride linker unit was prepared from diiodoperfluoroalkanes by generation of the bis-sodium sulfite salt and subsequent chlorination. Optimisation studies using design software allowed preparation of multigram quantities in 60 - 70 % yield. Model solution phase synthesis of bis- perfluoroalkanesulfonamides and bis-perfluoroalkanesulfonate esters showed the feasibility of attaching the bis-sulfonyl chloride to <b>amino</b> <b>resins</b> and loading phenols. Diversity cleavage was demonstrated using Suzuki and Stille reactions and optimised by screening parallel arrays of reaction conditions. Loading the bis-sulfonyl chloride onto TentaGel® gave access to solid supported porfluorosulfonate osters and diversity cleavage was shown using Suzuki reactions. However, the linkage to solid supports proved to be unstable and an additional spacer unit was required if the linker was to find widespread use. To this end, a second generation perfluoroalkanesulfonyl linker unit was developed from ally I alcohol and diiodoperfluoroalkanes. Oxidation to a perfluoroalkanesulfonyl chloride was achieved using a novel reaction employing N- chlorosuccinimide. Several methods for loading this linker unit onto a solid support were investigated but none were successful and this chemistry requires further development before it offers a practical perfluoroalkanesulfonyl diversity linker.

40|$|A {{literature}} {{survey was conducted}} on herbs, their preparations and ingredients with reported liver protection activities, in which a total of 274 different species and hundreds of active ingredients have been examined. These ingredients can be roughly classified into two categories according to their activities: (1) the main ingredients, such as silybin, osthole, coumarin, glycyrrhizin, saikosaponin A, schisandrin A, flavonoids; and (2) supporting substances, such as sugars, <b>amino</b> acids, <b>resins,</b> tannins and volatile oil. Among them, some active ingredients have hepatoprotective activities (e. g. anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, immunomodulating and liver cirrhosis-regulating effects). Calculation of physicochemical parameters indicates that the main ingredients with negative and positive Elumo values possibly display their hepatoprotective effects through different mechanisms, such as antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. As the combination of herbs may achieve some treatment effects synergistically and/or additively, it is common in Chinese medicine to use mixtures of various medicinal herbs with pharmacologically active compounds to have synergistic and/or additive effects, or to reduce harmful effects of some pharmacologically active compounds. In particular, the active compounds with Clog P around 2 are suitable for passive transport across membranes and accessible to the target sites. Thus, Elumo and Clog P values are good indicators among the calculated parameters...|$|R

The present study intended with various phytochemical screening and toxicity studies {{were carried out}} on the leaves of the Capparis sepiaria. Preliminary phyto-chemical evaluation of the ethanolic extract of revealed that the presence of reducing sugar, flavonoids, steroids, tannins, glycosides, alkaloids, gums, <b>resins,</b> <b>amino</b> acids, proteins and anthraquinones. The toxicity studies were performed as acute, sub-acute and chronic toxicity determined the LD 50 value of 300 - 5000 mg/kg body weight 4 - 6 weeks. The results of the various phytochemical tests indicated that the plant to be rich in various biologically active compounds which could serve as potential source of the crude drugs and in addition the plant is not toxic to the experimental model...|$|R
