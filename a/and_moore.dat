5|$|From 1943-47, Durante <b>and</b> <b>Moore</b> had a joint show, with Moore as the {{straight}} man. Impressed with {{his ability to}} interact with audiences, CBS offered him his own show.

5|$|Linda Schuyler had co-created The Kids of Degrassi Street in 1979 with Kit Hood, and Yan Moore was {{a writer}} on that series. As the {{children}} grew up, the Degrassi franchise developed into Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High. In 1999 two episodes of Jonovision, a CBC Television talk show aimed at teenagers, reunited some of the cast members from the series. At the same time, Schuyler <b>and</b> <b>Moore</b> were developing a new television drama. When the Jonovision reunion episode proved to be popular, Schuyler <b>and</b> <b>Moore</b> wondered about reuniting the characters, too. As the months passed, they began thinking about {{what might have happened}} to the characters of Degrassi High and realized that the character Emma Nelson, born at the end of Degrassi Junior Highs second season, would soon be entering junior high school. Stephen Stohn, Schuyler's husband suggested Degrassi: The Next Generation as the name for the new sequel series, borrowing the concept from , of which he was a fan.|$|E

Matheos released the album FWX and toured with Fates Warning. Moore moved from Costa Rica to Istanbul, Turkey. In 2004, he released the third Chroma Key album, Graveyard Mountain Home, and wrote the soundtrack (released as Ghost Book) to the Turkish horror film Okul.

5|$|Alder {{left for}} Paul's house, with Moore, in November 1805. He <b>and</b> <b>Moore</b> arrived in Virginia the Sunday after New Year, and Alder was {{reunited with his}} {{biological}} mother and siblings. Alder stayed {{with his family in}} Virginia for over a year, and while visiting his family he met {{and fell in love with}} Mary Ann Blont, a woman from Virginia. The couple were married on January 6, 1806, and in August 1806, Alder, Blont, and the rest of Alder's family returned to Pleasant Valley. Alder built another log cabin along the Big Darby Creek in 1806, and he and Mary had 12 children between 1808 and 1830.|$|E
5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed by Britain, who they {{regarded}} as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby <b>and</b> <b>Moore,</b> however, take the view that Mountbatten {{played a crucial role in}} ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E

Between Sean Connery giving his notice at the {{beginning}} of filming You Only Live Twice and its release, Saltzman had planned to adapt The Man with the Golden Gun in Cambodia and use Roger Moore as the next Bond, but political instability meant the location was ruled out <b>and</b> <b>Moore</b> signed up for another series of the television programme The Saint. After You Only Live Twice was released in 1967, the producers once again picked the often-delayed On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which had previously been considered to follow both Goldfinger and then Thunderball.|$|E
5|$|Hardy {{taught himself}} {{how to play}} guitar and later {{purchased}} a drum set.

5|$|In that half, the Tech offense {{finally got}} rolling. The Hokies scored 14points {{in both the}} third and fourth quarters, ending the game on an uncontested 280 run. Alabama's offense was stifled {{throughout}} by effective pressure from Tech defensive end Corey Moore, and Tech was able to turn several fumbles and interceptions by the Crimson Tide into points on the scoreboard. The final 387 Virginia Tech victory was the biggest win in Virginia Tech bowl game history, <b>and</b> <b>Moore</b> was named the game's most valuable player. The two teams did not meet again until the 2009 Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game on September 5, 2009.|$|E

Despite the attack, Helms {{would go on to}} defeat Guerrero for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship at Greed and was the reigning Cruiserweight Champion immediately before WCW was bought out by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Helms' contract with WCW was one of twenty-five that were included in WWF's purchase of WCW.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was known}} for his {{conservative}} political views. In the 1970s, he was chairman of the anti-immigration United Country Party, a position he held until the party was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980. He campaigned for the politician Edmund Iremonger at the 1979 general election, as they agreed the French and Germans were not to be trusted. Iremonger <b>and</b> <b>Moore</b> gave up political campaigning after deciding they were Thatcherites. Moore campaigned on behalf of Douglas Denny (UKIP) for the Chichester constituency in 2001. A Conservative voter for many years, he was a supporter and patron of the eurosceptic UK Independence Party until his death.|$|E
5|$|Mount Pleasant Road was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of several years by interconnecting several existing streets as well as building a new road in other places; at that time, a road existed to the north and south of the cemetery. The road to the south, running between Clarence Street (renamed Heath Street on April 7, 1913) <b>and</b> <b>Moore</b> Avenue, was known as Lyle Street and Kinsman Avenue. The road to the north, running between Balliol Street and Merton Street, was known as Alberta Avenue.|$|E
40|$|Most {{cutting plane}} methods, {{like that of}} Kelley and Cheney and Goldstein solve a linear {{approximation}} (localization) of the problem, and then generate an additional cut to remove the linear program's optimal point. Other methods, like the "central cutting" plane methods, calculate a center of the linear approximation and then adjust {{the level of the}} objective, or separate the current center from the feasible set. In this paper we present a unified treatment of Elzinga <b>and</b> <b>Moore's</b> <b>and</b> Goffin and Vial's central cutting plane methods. It is shown that Goffin and Vial's method enjoys the same convergence properties as Elzinga <b>and</b> <b>Moore's</b> method...|$|R

5|$|Neither team got {{a hit in}} {{the third}} or fourth innings. The only runners to reach base were Whitey Kurowski and Marion, both on walks. The fifth started that the same way, with Slaughter <b>and</b> <b>Moore</b> flying out. With two outs however, the Cardinals started hitting. Musial doubled, Kurowski walked, Slaughter tripled, and Dusak singled. All but Dusak scored on the hits, {{bringing}} the score to 5–1 and ending Hatten's day. Hank Behrman came on in relief. Behrman kept any more runs from scoring, and after another inning in which the Dodgers did not record a hit, the score was 5–1 {{at the end of the}} fifth.|$|E
5|$|On May 16, the nine-person {{committee}} of James A. O'Neil, Robert Moore, William H. Gray, William P. Dougherty, David Hill, Robert Shortess, Thomas J.

The group met again for two days starting on June 16, with George LeBreton serving as the recorder <b>and</b> <b>Moore</b> as the chairman for both sets of meetings. The laws drafted became the Organic Laws of Oregon and were ratified on July 5. Committees on land claims, appropriations, military, the judiciary, and districting were also formed at that meeting.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{his junior}} season, Moore participated in {{workouts}} in Houston with Houston Rocket and former Villanova Wildcat Kyle Lowry.

His averages increased as well, to 15.2points per game, a team high, and 4.2rebounds per game, while also being the only Temple player to start all 34games.
