At the University of Guelph, working on her master’s degree Wright decided to study <b>apple</b> <b>maggots</b> but professor John Laing persuaded her to study ladybird beetles instead as not as much research had been done on them. Wright did much field work studying ladybird beetles, determining the conditions during the winter that made them most likely to survive. The conditions for research were difficult involving carrying packs of tools, traps and specimens through areas without roads. She dug traps of specimens out of frozen ground to recover them.|$|R
40|$|Species that {{compete for}} access to or use of sites, such as {{parasitic}} mites attaching to honey bees or <b>apple</b> <b>maggots</b> laying eggs in fruits, can potentially increase their fitness by carefully selecting sites at which they face little or no competition. Here, we systematically investigate the evolution of site-selection strategies among animals competing for discrete sites. By developing and analyzing a mechanistic and population-dynamical model of site selection in which searching individuals encounter sites sequentially and can choose to accept or continue to search based on how many conspecifics are already there, we give a complete characterization of the different site-selection strategies that can evolve. We find that evolution of site-selection stabilizes population dynamics, promotes even distribution of individuals among sites, and occasionally causes evolutionary suicide. We also discuss the broader implications of our findings and propose {{how they can be}} reconciled with an earlier study (Nonaka et al. in J Theor Biol 317 : 96 – 104, 2013) that reported selection toward ever higher levels of aggregation among sites as a consequence of site-selection...|$|R
40|$|ReportThis {{study showed}} that {{resistance}} to organophosphates remained relatively stable in the field populations of OBLR during the 3 years of the study, {{despite the absence of}} sprays of these materials. The control of OBLR in the soft pesticide programs was generally better than that obtained by growers in their standard pesticide treatments. However, adequate control of plum curculio was not obtained in most of the blocks {{and at the end of}} the study, damage was observed even in blocks that were completely free of this pest during the first season. These results showed that adequate control of the curculio cannot be maintained for multiple seasons without using special control sprays even in blocks that would not be considered to be at risk from this pest. This soft insecticide program did not provide adequate control of internal lepidoptera in some of the blocks for multiple seasons, although control of <b>apple</b> <b>maggots</b> was acceptable. Foliar pests such as tentiform leafminers, green apple aphids, white apple leafhoppers, and mites were not serious problems in the soft pesticide blocks. Tarnished plant bug damage was generally similar in grower's standard programs and the soft pesticide blocks. Secondary pests, such as rosy apple aphids and the San Jose Scale were problems in some of the soft pesticide blocks. However, the overall insect damage in the standard and soft pesticide was fairly similar during all seasons of the 3 year study, except in one orchard, which suffered severe damage from curculio and internal lepidoptera.

50|$|The <b>apple</b> <b>maggot</b> (Rhagoletis pomonella), {{also known}} as a {{railroad}} worm (not {{to be confused with the}} Phrixothrix beetle larvae also called that), is a pest of several fruits, mainly apples. Before the arrival in America of apples from Europe, it was found mainly in hawthorns.|$|E
50|$|Diachasma alloeum {{is a small}} wasp in {{the family}} Braconidae. It is a {{parasitoid}} of Rhagoletis pomonella, the <b>apple</b> <b>maggot.</b> The wasp lays its eggs into third instar larvae of the fly, which then develop after the larvae have pupated. The immature wasps then eat the fly larvae and overwinter inside the fly puparia.|$|E
50|$|Although some {{evolutionary}} biologists still regard {{sympatric speciation}} {{as a highly}} contentious issue, both theoretical and empirical studies increasingly support sympatric speciation as a likely process in explaining the diversity of life in particular ecosystems. Arguments either implicitly or explicitly implicate competition and niche separation of sympatrically co-occurring ecological variants that through assortative mating ultimately evolve into separate races and then species. Assortative mating most easily occurs if mating is linked to niche preference, as occurs in the <b>apple</b> <b>maggot</b> Rhagoletis pomonella where individual flies from different races use volatile odors to discriminate between hawthorn and apple and look for mates on natal fruit.|$|E
50|$|The {{hawthorn}} fly (Rhagoletis pomonella), {{also known}} as the <b>apple</b> <b>maggot</b> fly, appears to be undergoing sympatric speciation. Different populations of hawthorn fly feed on different fruits. A distinct population emerged in North America in the 19th century some time after apples, a non-native species, were introduced. This apple-feeding population normally feeds only on apples and not on the historically preferred fruit of hawthorns. The current hawthorn feeding population does not normally feed on apples. Some evidence, such as that six out of thirteen allozyme loci are different, that hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies; and that there is little evidence of interbreeding (researchers have documented a 4-6% hybridization rate) suggests that sympatric speciation is occurring.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} {{evolution}} at {{work is the}} case of the hawthorn fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, also known as the <b>apple</b> <b>maggot</b> fly, which appears to be undergoing sympatric speciation.

5000|$|Rhagoletis pomonella, the <b>apple</b> <b>maggot,</b> may be {{currently}} undergoing sympatric or, more precisely, heteropatric (see heteropatry) speciation. The apple feeding race of {{this species}} appears to have spontaneously emerged from the hawthorn feeding race in the 1800-1850 AD time frame, after apples were first introduced into North America. The apple feeding race does not now normally feed on hawthorns, and the hawthorn feeding race does not now normally feed on apples. This may be an early step towards {{the emergence of a}} new species. [...] Some parasitic ants may have evolved via sympatric speciation.Isolated and relatively homogeneous habitats such as crater lakes and islands are among the best geographical settings in which to demonstrate sympatric speciation. For example, Nicaragua crater lake cichlid fishes include nine described species and dozens of undescribed species that have evolved by sympatric speciation.|$|E
5000|$|The adult {{form of this}} insect {{is about}} 5 mm long, {{slightly}} smaller than a house fly, with a white dot on its thorax and a characteristic black banding shaped like an [...] "F" [...] on its wings. When threatened it turns its wings 90 degrees and moves them up and down whilst walking sideways; the combination mimics the appearance of it being a spider due to the wing pattern in the new position appearing as additional legs. The larva, which is the stage of this insect's life cycle that causes the actual damage to the fruit, {{is similar to a}} typical fly larva or maggot. Other [...] "worms," [...] especially the larvae of the codling moth, that infest the insides of apples are often confused with the <b>apple</b> <b>maggot.</b> Generally speaking, however caterpillars often feed in the apple’s core while apple maggots feed on the fruit flesh. In infested fruit, the larvae are often difficult to detect due to their pale, cream colour and small body size. The maggot stage has many enemies, including several braconid wasps: Utetes canaliculatus, Diachasmimorpha mellea, and Diachasma alloeum.|$|E
