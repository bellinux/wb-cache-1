25|$|The {{last two}} trains plied the Rock Island's Illinois Division as the track quality {{declined}} from 1971 through 1977. The transit times {{that were once}} a fairly speedy 2½ hours in the 1950s had softened to a 4½ hour run by 1975. Despite this, the State of Illinois continued to subsidize the service to keep it running. The track program of 1978 helped with main line timekeeping, although the Rock Island's management decreed that the two trains (down to two coaches and <b>a</b> <b>beat-up</b> EMD E8 for power) were not to delay freight traffic on the route. Eventually, with the trains frequently running with as many paying passengers as coaches in the train, the state withdrew the subsidy and the two trains made their final runs on December 31, 1978.|$|E

Pérez was nonetheless overjoyed to record the song, due of the conjunto nature of the track, which brought back memories of his childhood. Pérez added that Selena's vocals would greatly compliment the song, a conjunto song about a jubilant protagonist who regains control of her life after feeling trapped in a relationship.

5000|$|... "Hook Me Up" [...] is a {{song that}} was {{inspired}} by a newspaper article about a young Palestinian man in occupied territory who was trying desperately to make contact with people via <b>an</b> old, <b>beat-up</b> ham radio. It was written from the young man's perspective who was trapped in a small corner of the world, amidst horrible events and all he wanted was communication, connection with outside world and other people. [...] "Right Side of Wrong" [...] is a modern-day Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid song that talks about good people involved in wrongdoing, but people who have hearts in right place. Song [...] "Love Me Back to Life" [...] is about world-weariness and need for someone or something that will breathe the life back into you and allow you to appreciate the world again. [...] "You Had Me From Hello" [...] is the song about a committed relationship and ability of someone to constantly see something new and beautiful in the one they love. The title was taken from the phrase made by Cameron Crowe in his movie Jerry Maguire (1996). The title track [...] "Bounce" [...] was originally written {{near the end of the}} One Wild Night Tour and it had more sports-oriented lyrics. But after the events of September 11, song became, lyrically, about declaration of strength and defiance. It referres to the city of New York, and the United States as a whole, but also to the band's perseverance over a twenty-year career. Song [...] "Open All Night" [...] is dialog between two characters in TV series Ally McBeal (1997-2002): Ally McBeal and Victor Morrison, plumber and babysitter portrated by Jon Bon Jovi. Jon appeared in nine episodes in role of this character and storyline (especially romantic) between him and Ally took a long time to evolve and Jon admitted that if that happened in real life, he would either never allow it to take so long or he would have move on.

[...] He further added that it showcased her [...] "lack of restraint" [...] emotive vocal range and [...] "spitting out lyrics with the gritty passion of a Lucha Villa", calling it [...] "all sass and fire." [...] The singer said in a July 1993 interview that the song [...] "speaks for all the ladies". The lyrics to [...] "Como la Flor" [...] are [...] "simple, plaintive melody and aching". They speak of a woman who witnessed her former lover with another woman and must move on; she wishes them the best, and compares her relationship with her ex-lover to a flower that has withered and died. [...] "Como la Flor" [...] is a [...] "catchy" [...] pop cumbia that depicts a [...] "lovelorn" [...] woman in a [...] "pleading vocal delivery" [...] to a [...] "lost-love".

Paredez found the recording to contain [...] "emotive chorus to ebullient choreography", and stated that it [...] "captures and conveys" [...] what Roland Barthes called [...] "the grain of Selena's voice". She further added that Selena's [...] "teardrop vocal chords" [...] are present in [...] "Como la Flor", adding that the recording contains a [...] "residue of materiality". Paredez said that, with its melodic shifts, [...] "Como la Flor" [...] successfully [...] "evokes Selena's presence in the elegy marking her absence".|$|R
