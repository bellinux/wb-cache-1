Jon Snow notes {{that there are no}} dead Night's Watch brothers amongst the horses, which Orell claims he had seen. Rayder tells Jon that the dead have become wights, and orders Tormund Giantsbane to take 20 men, along with Jon, and climb the Wall. Rayder then says he will light the biggest fire the North has seen to signal them to attack the Night's Watch. He stipulates that if Snow doesn't prove useful, he can be thrown off the Wall.|$|E

500|$|A {{supporter}} {{of a unified}} Germany, Ernest watched the various political movements with great interest. While he initially was a great and outspoken proponent of the liberal movement, he surprised many by switching sides and supporting the more conservative (and eventually victorious) Prussians during the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars and subsequent unification of Germany. His support of the conservatives came at a price however, and {{he was no longer}} viewed as the possible leader of a political movement. According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest became [...] "increasingly lost in <b>a</b> <b>whirl</b> of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside".|$|E

Entertainment Weekly reviewer Kyle Anderson called the song [...] "middle-of-the-road R" [...] and criticized Minaj for choosing to make music that appeals to pop radio, instead of being unique. Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! was critical of the song, saying it was: [...] "by-the-books Nicki, as she delivers venomous raps on the verses before giving saccharine-sweet melody <b>a</b> <b>whirl</b> on the choruses. Surprise, surprise — {{the whole thing is}} delivered atop poppy, crystal clear synths." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1868 to 1884, Stowe split {{her time}} between her {{residence}} in Hartford, Connecticut, a mansion named Oakholm, and {{her house in}} Mandarin. A few weeks before Christmas each year, she would oversee arrangements to close Oakholm for the season, which involved preparing {{the house for the}} winter, packing all their clothes, living necessities, her writing materials, and the carpets in the house and shipping everything to Florida. Various family members would accompany her, living in the comfortable two-story house she modestly called a [...] "cottage" [...] or [...] "hut". In Hartford she was barraged with requests and at the center of <b>a</b> <b>whirl</b> of activity. Mandarin was not connected to a telegraph line until the 1880s and mail was received only once a week by boat. Stowe was able to relax somewhat in Mandarin and write for at least three hours a day.|$|E
500|$|Ernest's {{support of}} the Prussians in the Austro-Prussian War and later Franco Prussian War meant {{he was no longer}} the {{potential}} leader of a political movement; although it was true that {{he had been able to}} retain his duchies, it had come at a price. According to historian Charlotte Zeepvat, Ernest [...] "was increasingly lost in <b>a</b> <b>whirl</b> of private amusements which earned only contempt from outside". Ernest funneled his political thoughts into the private sphere, preferring to write covertly sponsored articles in the Coburg press that became increasingly embittered against England. In 1886, Ernest published Co-Regents and Foreign Influence in Germany, a pamphlet that greatly angered his family; though produced anonymously, no one doubted that it was written by Ernest. It attacked Vicky as a disloyal German that was too dependent on her mother, and declared that she had been too indiscreet in passing along confidential information during both war and peacetime. Queen Victoria was furious, writing to Vicky, [...] "What you told me of Uncle E and that pamphlet is simply monstrous. I assure you that I felt great difficulty in writing to him for his birthday, but I wrote it as short and cool as I could consistently with civility". [...] "Dear Uncle Ernest does us all a great deal of harm by his odd ways and uncontrollable tongue with his very lively imagination".|$|E

2500|$|According to the Serer narrative, {{this initial}} islet was not static, but {{animated}} by <b>a</b> <b>whirl</b> around {{the axis of}} the world. The Serers were able to symbolize the Earth's axis and the whirl in a geometrical diagram. In Serer cosmology, the diagram depicts two crossed lines representing the rotational motion and the intersection points representing the axis of the world. One of the lines depicts the axis running from east to west, the other from north to south. Simultaneously, they are the Empyrean Heaven where the supreme deity {{is said to have}} given way to the first elements. In the myth, Roog is portrayed as the mythical deity who somehow [...] "turned its self on". As the deity rotate in space, its rapid motions expanded with the primordial world it had first created. Roog's motion also affected the axis of the cosmos. The vital energies it had emitted, rotated in a spiral motion thereby creating the celestial objects.|$|E
