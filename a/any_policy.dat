5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of <b>any</b> <b>policy</b> should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing <b>any</b> <b>policy</b> involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes that the author handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E
5|$|In May 1923, Bonar Law was {{diagnosed}} with advanced terminal throat cancer. He immediately resigned, and King George V sent for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stanley Baldwin, to form a government. Baldwin served as his own Chancellor for three months while he sought a successor and then promoted Chamberlain to the position. Chamberlain had little time for <b>any</b> <b>policy</b> changes, as he served only five months {{in the office and}} did not present a budget. Though the Unionists had an ample majority in the House of Commons and the current Parliament had four years to run, Baldwin decided that a general election was needed and that the Unionists should fight it on the issue of tariff reform. He hoped to gain both a personal mandate as Prime Minister and a policy mandate for his tariff proposals. He miscalculated badly: in the general election held in December 1923 the Unionists remained the largest party in the House of Commons, but were outnumbered by the combined Liberal and Labour MPs. The Baldwin Government retained office until it was defeated when Parliament assembled in January 1924, and Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister. Chamberlain's majority in Birmingham Ladywood was cut yet again, this time to 1,500votes.|$|E

25|$|The Great Recession {{had caused}} federal {{government}} revenues {{to fall to}} their lowest level relative {{to the size of}} the economy for 50 years, with tax revenues falling nearly $400 billion (20%) between 2008 and 2009. At the same time, safety net expenditures caused expenditures to rise considerably. For example, automatic stabilizer spending (such as unemployment compensation, food stamps, and disability payments, which increased without legislative action) ranged between $350–420 billion annually from 2009 to 2012, roughly 10% of the expenditures. This drove the budget deficit up even without <b>any</b> <b>policy</b> steps by President Obama, creating significant debt concerns. This resulted in a series of bruising debates with the Republican Congress, which attempted (with much success) to blame the President for the deficits caused primarily by the recession that began during the Bush administration.|$|E
25|$|The Korean War {{also led}} to other {{long-lasting}} effects. Until the war, the U.S. had largely abandoned the government of Chiang Kai-shek, which had retreated to Taiwan, and {{had no plans to}} intervene in the Chinese Civil War. The start of the Korean War rendered untenable <b>any</b> <b>policy</b> that would have caused Taiwan to fall under PRC control. Truman's decision to send American forces to the Taiwan Strait further deterred the PRC from making any cross-strait invasion of Taiwan. The anti-communist atmosphere in the West in response to the Korean War and Cold War contributed to the unwillingness to diplomatically recognize the People's Republic of China by the United States until 1979. Today, diplomacy between the Republic of China and mainland China remains strained, and mainland China continues to claim the sovereignty of Taiwan, although some progress has been made.|$|E
25|$|Pataki's term {{had been}} marked with annual debates with the State Legislature over the powers {{allocated}} to the Executive and Legislative Branches on {{the adoption of the}} state budget.

Pataki said the Legislature could then only change the numbers but could not change <b>any</b> <b>policy</b> decisions made in the budget document. Pataki and the Legislature ended up in court and the courts ruled in Pataki's favor, giving him more budgetary power.

25|$|On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{an appeal}} filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's {{view that the}} President did not possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and was required to act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the legislative history of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, {{and the nature of}} the President's power in the Constitution. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights. In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on <b>any</b> <b>policy</b> in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.|$|E

500|$|In 1979, Cunningham Elementary School had 436 students, {{well over}} its {{original}} capacity of 300. 75.5% {{of them were}} White, 14% qualified for free lunch, and 15% qualified for reduced cost lunch. Due to the increasing population and the sudden conversion of adults-only complexes to family oriented, Cunningham Elementary School became overcrowded by 1986 with its enrollment increasing from around 500 in 1985 to more than 900 the next year. By 1988, Gordon Elementary School, a campus in Bellaire, Texas, re-opened {{to serve as a}} reliever school to Cunningham and to a non-Gulfton school. By September 3 of that year, 1,268 students were enrolled at Cunningham; 72% were classified as Hispanic and 99% were on free or reduced-cost lunch programs. Many of the children arrived from Central American countries experiencing civil strife, and therefore many had received an inadequate education prior to coming to the United States. In 1989, Cunningham's overcrowding was described as being [...] "unanticipated." [...] In 1988 the U.S. federal government passed the Fair Housing Act, which, under most circumstances, prohibits <b>any</b> <b>policy</b> that excludes families with children from living in an apartment complex. Abbe Boring, the principal of Cunningham in 1992, said that the student population increased when formerly singles-only apartments were required to allow families to rent complexes. In September 1991 Braeburn and Cunningham were two of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments; in other words the schools were filled to capacity and excess students had to attend other schools.

500|$|Prior to the First World War, Rangers did {{not have}} <b>any</b> <b>policy</b> {{regarding}} religion dictating {{if they could be}} signed or not. Prior to the war, Rangers did have a number of Catholic players. [...] In the 1920s, following the rise in popularity of the Orange Order in Glasgow where Rangers players and directors attended functions, [...] Rangers quietly introduced an unwritten rule that the club would not sign any player or employ any staff member who was openly Catholic. The policy was kept a secret within Rangers until 1965 when Ralph Brand revealed to the News of the World that Rangers operated a Protestants-only policy when he left them for Manchester City. [...] Two years later vice-chairman Matt Taylor was asked about perceived anti-Catholicism with the [...] "No Catholic" [...] signing policy at Rangers, he stated [...] " [...] part of our tradition... we were formed in 1873 as a Protestant boys club. To change now would lose us considerable support". The policy was mirrored by Northern Irish club Linfield, who shares a similar club culture to Rangers, up until the 1980s as a contrast to their Big Two rivals Glentoran though it was not as strict as Rangers'. Some Catholic players did play for Rangers during this time despite the policy with Don Kitchenbrand keeping his Catholicism secret and Laurie Blyth, who left the club after his Catholic faith was discovered. There were also claims by some former Rangers players that the policy extended to non-Catholic players who married Catholics. However the former Rangers player and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, himself married to a Catholic, confirmed that marriage to a Catholic was {{not a part of the}} signing policy to exclude players.|$|E
