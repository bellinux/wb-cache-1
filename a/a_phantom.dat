50|$|Since all Space Phantoms appear {{identical}} and {{can appear}} {{as any other}} creature, {{it can be difficult}} to determine which Space Phantom did what; the following activities have previously been attributed to the Space Phantom who first encountered the Avengers, but these may not have been the same Space <b>Phantom.</b> <b>A</b> Space <b>Phantom</b> allied with the Grim Reaper and impersonated Madame Hydra, and commanded a division of HYDRA in that identity. The Space Phantom battled the Avengers, but was shunted back into Limbo when he attempted to mimic Rick Jones who was then linked to Captain Mar-Vell. <b>A</b> Space <b>Phantom</b> was compelled by Immortus to impersonate Mantis to deceive Kang. <b>A</b> Space <b>Phantom</b> attempted to trick Thor into freeing the planet Phantus from Limbo, and allied with Thor to save Phantus, which led to Thor losing much of Mjolnir's power over time. <b>A</b> Space <b>Phantom</b> once encountered Rom in Limbo. <b>A</b> Space <b>Phantom</b> later encountered the Avengers in Limbo. <b>A</b> Space <b>Phantom</b> was used as a pawn by the Young God Calculus in a scheme pitting Spider-Man against the Avengers.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the actual formation, <b>a</b> <b>phantom</b> 76th Infantry Division was formed for deception. The phantom division {{was part of the}} notional British Fourth Army, to be used for the fictitious Operation Trolleycar. This operation aimed to deceive the Germans into believing that an Allied landing would occur along the northern German coast. While the deception effort was not a complete success, it managed to divert German attention to the northern flank {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on <b>a</b> <b>phantom</b> circuit.|$|E
5|$|After {{his first}} {{marriage}} Ambrose Dudley remained childless. His second wife, Elizabeth Tailboys, suffered <b>a</b> <b>phantom</b> pregnancy in 1555. Anne Russell, though nearly 20 years her husband's junior, {{turned out to be}} a congenial partner. Through their paternal grandmother the Dudley brothers descended from the famous 15th century earls, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. The Beauchamp descent especiallywhich was represented by the earldom of Warwickfilled them with pride. Ambrose's childlessness deeply concerned the widowed Robert Dudley, who for many years dared not to remarry for fear of the Queen's displeasure, and eventually died without direct heirs himself in September 1588. Most of Leicester's estateand debtspassed on to Warwick and encumbered his remaining lifetime. He also took care of his deceased brother's illegitimate teenage son Robert, who was his godson and whom Leicester had willed to inherit after Warwick's death.|$|E

5|$|When Phantoms {{were first}} {{delivered}} to interceptor squadrons, they {{remained in the}} grey-green camouflage colour scheme more associated with the strike and close air support missions they had undertaken. During the late 1970s, the RAF began experimenting with new colours for its air defence units, with 56 Squadron tasked with trialling proposed new schemes. In October 1978, <b>a</b> <b>Phantom</b> FGR.2 of 56 Squadron became {{the first to be}} painted in the new air superiority grey colour, combined with small, low visibility roundels and markings. However, although the roundel remained in low visibility colours, individual squadron markings eventually returned to more observable sizes and colours.|$|E

25|$|Hakor's {{accession}} {{and relationships}} with his predecessor Nepherites I were long debated.

25|$|As direct-contact {{membrane}} keyboards became popular, {{the available}} rollover of keys was optimized {{by analyzing the}} most common key sequences and placing these keys {{so that they do}} not potentially produce phantom keys in the electrical key matrix (for example, simply placing three or four keys that might be depressed simultaneously on the same X or same Y line, so that <b>a</b> <b>phantom</b> key intersection/short cannot happen), so that blocking a third key usually isn't a problem. But lower-quality keyboard designs and unknowledgeable engineers may not know these tricks, and it can still be a problem in games due to wildly different or configurable layouts in different games.|$|E

25|$|This {{story begins}} with a {{conversation}} between an old man and a young traveler, Tomás Gomez. The older man explains that he came to Mars because he appreciates the new and novel. Even everyday things have become amazing to him once again. He has returned full circle to his childhood. Later, Tomás encounters a Martian named Muhe Ca. Each can see the Mars he is accustomed to, {{in his own time}} frame, but the other person is translucent to him and has the appearance of <b>a</b> <b>phantom.</b> The young man sees ruins where the Martian sees a thriving city, while the Martian sees an ocean where Tomás sees the new Earth settlement. Neither knows if he precedes the other in time, but Bradbury makes the point that any one civilization is ultimately fleeting.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of Nexus, a secret military communication centre in Karen, Nairobi. The Government spent Sh2.6 billion (US$36.9 million) {{to construct the}} complex. Three years later, military personnel have not moved into the centre. <b>A</b> <b>phantom</b> company, Nedermar BV Technologies, which {{is said to have}} its headquarters in the Netherlands, implemented the secret project situated along Karen South Road. Nedermar is linked to businessman Anura Pereira. However, Pereira has denied this. The tendering process for the Nexus project was circumvented as DoD's Departmental Tender Committee. Funding for the project was made through the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The complex is currently headed by Colonel Philip Kameru. Nexus was first meant to be an ammunition dumpsite before it was turned into a military communication and operations centre. Construction continued without any site visits by either the DoD staff or Ministry of Public Works officials. The Nexus project was implemented during the tenure of General Joseph Kibwana.|$|E
