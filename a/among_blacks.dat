5|$|In 2010, {{coronary}} artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most {{years of life}} lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates. U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other Western nations, especially <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> and Hispanics.|$|E
5|$|Most Catholic clergy in Buenos Aires willingly backed Rosas' regime. The Jesuits, {{the only}} ones who refused to do so, were {{expelled}} from the country. The lower social strata in Buenos Aires, which formed the vast majority of its populace, experienced no improvement in the conditions under which they lived. When Rosas slashed expenditures, he cut resources from education, social services, general welfare and public works. None of the lands confiscated from Indians and Unitarians were turned over to rural workers, including gauchos. Black people did not experience any improvement in their conditions either. Rosas was himself a slave-owner, and helped revive the slave trade. Despite doing little to promote their interests, he remained popular <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> and gauchos. He employed blacks, patronized their festivities and attended their candombles. The gauchos admired his leadership and willingness to fraternize with them to some extent.|$|E

40|$|This study explores how {{racial and}} {{religious}} identities are impacted and subsequently reconciled <b>among</b> <b>Black</b> women who join the historically White Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. This study {{was based upon}} {{the premise that the}} African-American religious aesthetic and the Black Church shape racial and religious identities. Therefore, identity reconciliation <b>among</b> <b>Black</b> LDS women who previously attended the Black church is jeopardized. A mixed-methods research approach was used to measure Black women’s ability to reconcile their racial and religious identities. The data gathered enabled the researcher to broadly determine the degree to which reconciliation is achieved <b>among</b> <b>Black</b> LI) S women. The researcher found that the diminutive presence of the African-American religious aesthetic in the LDS Church did not considerably influence identity reconciliation <b>among</b> <b>Black</b> LDS women. This finding is significant as it will help to inform future studies about identity reconciliation <b>among</b> <b>Black</b> people who join historically White religious institutions as well as the viability of the Black Church as a resource for spiritual and racial identity cultivation <b>among</b> <b>Black</b> people...|$|R

25|$|Compared to {{some other}} states, blacks were better {{established}} {{both before and after}} the civil war. Nearly half the population was free before the war, and some had accumulated property. Half the population lived in cities. Literacy was high <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> and, as Democrats crafted means to exclude them, suffrage campaigns helped reach blacks and teach them how to resist. Whites did impose racial segregation in public facilities and Jim Crow laws, which effectively lasted until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other states}} in the South, Florida had many African American leaders who were active {{in the civil rights}} movement. In the 1940s and '50s, a new {{generation}} started working on issues. Harry Moore built the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Florida, rapidly increasing its membership to 10,000. Because Florida's voter laws were not as restrictive as those of Georgia and Alabama, he also had some success in registering black voters. In the 1940s he increased voter registration <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> from 5 to 31% of those age-eligible.|$|E

25|$|The state {{population}} in 1900 was 47% African-American: {{a total of}} 652,013 citizens. Many in New Orleans were descendants of Creoles of color, the sizeable population of free people of color before the Civil War. By 1900, {{two years after the}} new constitution, only 5,320 black voters were registered in the state. Because of disfranchisement, by 1910 there were only 730 black voters (less than 0.5 percent of eligible African-American men), despite advances in education and literacy <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> and people of color. Blacks were excluded from the political system and also unable to serve on juries. White Democrats had established one-party Democratic rule, which they maintained in the state for decades deep into the 20th century until after Congressional passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act provided federal oversight and enforcement of the constitutional right to vote.|$|E
25|$|Drug use {{discrimination}} is the unequal treatment people experience {{because of the}} drugs they use. People who use or have used illicit drugs may face discrimination in employment, welfare, housing, child custody, and travel, in addition to imprisonment, asset forfeiture, {{and in some cases}} forced labor, torture, and execution. Though often prejudicially stereotyped as deviants and misfits, most drug users are well-adjusted and productive members of society. Drug prohibitions may have been partly motivated by racism and other prejudice against minorities, and racial disparities have been found to exist in the enforcement and prosecution of drug laws. Discrimination due to illicit drug use was the most commonly reported type of discrimination <b>among</b> <b>Blacks</b> and Latinos in a 2003 study of minority drug users in New York City, double to triple that due to race. People who use legal drugs such as tobacco and prescription medications may also face discrimination.|$|E
25|$|The publication's {{platform}} {{greatly influenced}} Wallace-Johnson's later union-related activities in Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast. Colonial governments perceived the Negro Worker to {{be a threat}} to peace and stability in the regions and quickly banned the distribution of the publication. In 1933, he {{became a member of the}} editorial board of the Negro Worker. Afterward, he met many prominent black Communists and attended the International Labor and Defence Conference in Moscow, where he remained for almost 18 months. He claimed that he pursued studies at the People's University of the East in Marxist-Leninist theory, political activism, and trade union organisation and roomed with Jomo Kenyatta, the future colonial leader for whom Kenya was named after. It was here that became influenced by the Pan-Africanism George Padmore, who was the Comintern-appointed coordinator of Communist activities <b>among</b> <b>blacks.</b> He returned to Lagos, Nigeria in 1933, but was deported by authorities months later for his trade union activities.|$|E

40|$|Research {{and theory}} combine {{to suggest that}} the {{relationship}} between religious belief and psychological well-being should be more positive <b>among</b> <b>Black</b> than <b>among</b> White individuals. Further, this relationship should be mediated by social psychological aspects of religion that have positive implications for well-being, such as self-enhancing religious attributions and a positive social identity associated with one's religious affiliation. These predictions were examined in a sample of 66 Black and 59 White university students. Religious belief salience and psychological well-being were moderately positively correlated, but only <b>among</b> <b>Black</b> subjects. The relationship between religious belief and well-being was partially mediated by attributions to God that enhance life meaning and positive social identification resulting from one's religious affiliation, again only <b>among</b> <b>Black</b> subjects. Implications of these results for the self-maintenance of Black college students are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The 3rd book {{takes up}} half of Froudacity. It begins with Froude alleging {{that there are}} few black intellectuals. Thomas {{responds}} by accusing the West Indian governments of suppressing blacks and noting that many black intellectuals sprang up in America shortly after Emancipation because they were integrated into society. Thomas uses the examples of Fredrick Douglass and Chief Justice William Conrad Reeves extensively in his arguments about race and intelligence. Both men are black and highly successful. Thomas uses these men as examples of successful black intellectuals, who succeeded despite racism. Thomas convincingly counters Froude's cheerful view of slavery. Thomas continues to contest Froude's multiple accusations about the results of black ruling over whites and what the ideal governance situation is for the West Indies. When Froude brings up the old stereotypes of blacks being lazy, or being cannibals or devil-worshipers, Thomas quickly counters all of the accusations. Thomas goes on to note the rising prominence of Christianity <b>among</b> <b>blacks,</b> and engages in a discussion on the limits of science and religion.|$|E
25|$|Voter {{demographic}} data for 2016 {{were collected by}} Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News and the Associated Press. The voter survey is based on questionnaires completed by 24,537 voters leaving 350 voting places throughout the United States on Election Day, in addition to 4,398 telephone interviews with early and absentee voters. Trump's crucial victories in the Midwest were aided {{in large part by}} his strong margins among non-college whites – while Obama lost those voters by a margin of 10 points in 2012, Clinton lost this group by 20 percent. The election also represented the first time that Republicans performed better among lower-income whites than among affluent white voters. To some analysts' surprise, Trump narrowed Clinton's margin compared to Obama by 7 points <b>among</b> <b>blacks</b> and African-Americans, 8 points among Latinos, and 11 points among Asian-Americans. Meanwhile, Trump increased his lead with non-Hispanic white voters through 1 percent over Mitt Romney's performance, and American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders shifted their support towards the Republican candidate using the same relative amount. Additionally, although 74 percent of Muslim voters supported Clinton, Trump nearly doubled his support there compared to Mitt Romney, according to the New York Times exit poll. However, exit polls are believed to have overstated sectors of the electorate oftentimes in the past, and further study with additional data is generally recommended by experts, as it {{is considered to be a}} more accurate representation of voting behavior in presidential elections.|$|E
