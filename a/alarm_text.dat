40|$|ABSTRACT: The Netherlands has a {{new tool}} to alarm and inform the {{population}} in case of crises. NL-Alert can simultaneously draw people’s attention and explain the crisis matter. The use requires determining of both the impact area and the <b>alarm</b> <b>text.</b> This raises questions about required knowledge and expertise to compose messages. Current experiences are mainly based on communication aimed at educating about potential future crisis. Composing a textual message in limited time to alarm the popula-tion is a different job. A good message meets three criteria: completeness (description of threat, location and action), relevance (receiver can determine if alarm is intended for him/her) and correctness given situation. TU Delft analysed messages composed by experts and laypeople on length, content, structure and readability.

All safety regions in The Netherlands can dispatch messages from their emergency con-trol room. Within seconds mobile phones in the specified geographical area will pick up the mes-sage. NL-Alert is currently positioned as a valuable addition to existing means, such as the siren, the emergency broadcasting stations and the crisis. nl website. The launch marked the start of a national public campaign: ‘NL-Alert, immediate infor-mation in emergency situations’. This campaign should make the population aware of the new sup-plementary emergency alert system and the neces-sity to check if the setting of once mobile phone needs adjustment in order to receive messages. Since its launch, NL-Alert has been used in five incidents (December 2012, twice in January 2013 and twice in April 2013) until mid-April 2013. In February 2013 a nationwide control message was broadcasted together with the monthly test of the outdoor siren. In multiple other countries, for example Japa...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{majority}} {{portion of}} the operations in modern manufacturing industries are performed by the implementation of automation technology. All automation technologies employ a graphical Human Machine Interface (HMIs) {{to interact with the}} machine. Color is a major component of the HMI. The main characteristic of the HMI is that it should be intuitive and user friendly. With the use of appropriate colors, the HMI can be designed {{in such a way that}} the user focuses only on the specific part of the interface at that specific time period. Choosing the right color for the background, control buttons, <b>alarms,</b> <b>text</b> and other objects is very critical to design a good HMI. This paper will briefly examine theoretical and practical aspects of these components and the established techniques for the effective use of color in graphical HMI.

25|$|Triggers are {{reminders}} {{that may be}} explicit or implicit about {{the performance of a}} behavior. Examples of triggers can be <b>alarms,</b> <b>text</b> messages or advertisement, triggers are usually perceptual in nature but may also be intrinsic. One of the most important aspects of a trigger is timing as only certain times are best for triggering certain behaviors. As an example if a person is trying to go to the gym everyday, but only remembers about packing clothing once out of the house it is less likely that this person will head back home and pack. In contrast if an alarm sounds right before leaving the house reminding about packing clothing, this will take considerably less effort. Although the original article does not have any references for the reasoning or theories behind the model, some of its elements can be traced to social psychology theories, e.g., the motivation and ability factors and its success or failure are related to Self-efficacy.|$|R

40|$|Text {{characters}} {{embedded in}} images and video sequences represents {{a rich source}} of information for content-based indexing and retrieval applications. However, these text characters are difficult to be detected and recognized due to their various sizes, grayscale values and complex backgrounds. This thesis investigates methods for building an efficient application system for detecting and recognizing text of any grayscale values embedded in images and video sequences. Both empirical image processing methods and statistical machine learning and modeling approaches are studied in two sub-problems: text detection and text recognition. Applying machine learning methods for text detection encounters difficulties due to character size, grayscale variations and heavy computation cost. To overcome these problems, we propose a two-step localization/verification approach. The first step aims at quickly localizing candidate text lines, enabling the normalization of characters into a unique size. In the verification step, a trained support vector machine or multi-layer perceptrons is applied on background independent features to remove the false <b>alarms.</b> <b>Text</b> recognition, even from the detected text lines, remains a challenging problem due to the variety of fonts, colors, the presence of complex backgrounds and the short length of the text strings. Two schemes are investigated addressing the text recognition problem: bi-modal enhancement scheme and multi-modal segmentation scheme. In the bi-modal scheme, we propose a set of filters to enhance the contrast of black and white characters and produce a better binarization before recognition. For more general cases, the text recognition is addressed by a text segmentation step followed by a traditional optical character recognition (OCR) algorithm within a multi-hypotheses framework. In the segmentation step, we model the distribution of grayscale values of pixels using a Gaussian mixture model or a Markov Random Field. The resulting multiple segmentation hypotheses are post-processed by a connected component analysis and a grayscale consistency constraint algorithm. Finally, they are processed by an OCR software. A selection algorithm based on language modeling and OCR statistics chooses the text result from all the produced text strings. Additionally, methods for using temporal information of video text are investigated. A Monte Carlo video text segmentation method is proposed for adapting the segmentation parameters along temporal text frames. Furthermore, a ROVER (Recognizer Output Voting Error Reduction) algorithm is studied for improving the final recognition text string by voting the characters through temporal frames. The whole system was successfully evaluated on large databases of camera-based images and video sequences obtained in context of two European projects ASSAVID 1 and CIMWOS 2.   [...] 1 European project ASSAVID: Automatic Segmentation and Semantic Annotation of Sports Videos, 5 th Framework Programme, Information Society Technology, supported by OFES.

He explained that while the purpose of such a system is to [...] "get {{information to the public}} as rapidly and as clearly as possible", on his television provider's set-top box [...] "the text was arriving on my screen incredibly slowly. Several minutes into the alert, we were just starting to get the description of the child and the suspect vehicle. It was embarrassing — when seconds count, the province needed minutes to deliver incredibly basic, utterly crucial facts about the emergency. The contrast between the urgently screeching buzz of the <b>alarm</b> and the <b>text</b> crawling up the screen in ultra-slow motion seemed designed for comedic effect."

40|$|Background: Increasingly, {{information}} and communication technology {{is being used to}} support persons with dementia living at home and their relatives. The aim of the present intervention study was to describe and explore the use and experiences of using a passive positioning alarm, over time, in daily life among persons with dementia and their spouses. Methods: Using an ethnographically inspired approach, five couples, each including a person with Alzheimer´ s disease and his/her spouse living in their own home, were repeatedly observed and interviewed regarding their experiences of using a passive positioning <b>alarm.</b> Interview <b>text</b> transcripts and field notes were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results: The main findings show changes over time, where testing and checking the passive positioning alarm successively led to trust in the alarm and in one own´s ability to use it. These components were a prerequisite for the couples to perceive the value of the alarm. Conclusions: A passive positioning alarm for persons with dementia and their spouses needs to be packaged as a “service” with flexibility for each user and based on user needs, abilities, knowledge and skills. Using a passive positioning alarm can be a valuable support that allows persons with dementia to be alone outdoors and can increase safety and security for them and their spouses. The present study contributes to our understanding of what prerequisites need to be in place and what barriers need to be dealt with before successful implementation can occur...|$|R
40|$|Fall of {{patients}} and aged people may become fatal if unnoticed in time. The concept {{is to have a}} fall detection system which sends alarm to the concerned people or to the doctor, at the time of eventuality. To minimize fall and its related injuries continuous surveillance of subjects who are diseased and prone to fall is necessary. The article discusses the design and development of a prototype of an electronic gadget which is used to detect fall among elderly and the patients who are prone to it. In this article, the body posture is derived from change of acceleration in three axes, which is measured using triaxial accelerometer (adxl 335). The sensor is placed on the lumbar region to study the tilt angle. The acceleration values in each axis are compared twice with threshold and also a delay of 20 secs between two comparisons, to reduce the false alarms. Values of the threshold voltage are selected by experimental methods. The algorithm is executed by microcontroller (PIC 16 F 877 A). The location of fall is determined by GPS receiver, which is programmed to track the subject continuously. On detection of fall, the device sends a text message through GSM modem, and communicates it to computer through ZigBee transceivers. The device can also be switched to only <b>alarm</b> if <b>text</b> message is not required. The prototype developed is tested on many subjects and also on volunteers who simulated fall. Out of 50 trials 96 % o...|$|R
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} method for the {{detection}} and identification of parked vehicles stationed. This technique composed many algorithms for the detection, localization, segmentation, extraction and recognition of number plates in images. It is acts of a technology of image processing used to identify the vehicles by their number plates. Knowing that we work on images whose level of gray is sampled with (120 × 180), resulting from a base of abundant data by PSA. We present two algorithms allowing the detection of the horizontal position of the vehicle: the classical method “horizontal gradients” and our approach “symmetrical method”. In fact, a car seen from the front presents a symmetry plan and by detecting its axis, that one finds {{its position in the}} image. A phase of localization is treated using the parameter MGD (Maximum Gradient Difference) which allows locating all the segments of text per horizontal scan. A specific technique of filtering, combining the method of symmetry and the localization by the MGD allows eliminating the blocks which don’t pass by the axis of symmetry and thus find the good block containing the number plate. Once we locate the plate, we use four algorithms that must be realized in order to allow our system to identify a license plate. The first algorithm is adjusting the intensity and the contrast of the image. The second algorithm is segmenting the characters on the plate using profile method. Then extracting and resizing the characters and finally recognizing them by means of optical character recogni-tion OCR. The efficiency of these algorithms is shown using a database of 350 images for the tests. We find a rate of lo-calization of 99. 6 % on a basis of 350 images with a rate of false <b>alarms</b> (wrong block <b>text)</b> of 0. 88 % by image...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} {{handwritten}} document image analysis, {{so as to}} study and propose methods for two critical preprocessing stages in the workflow of an optical character recognition application, such as text-line and word segmentation. The shortcomings of the existing methods are discussed and two novel techniques for text-lines segmentation and one for locating words are introduced. The first text-line segmentation algorithm is based on locating the optimal succession of text and gap areas within vertical zones by applying Viterbi algorithm on a Hidden Markov Model with parameters drawn from statistics of each type of area from the whole document image. Then, a text-line separator drawing technique is applied and finally the connected components are assigned to text lines according to simple geometrical constraints that conclude if a connected component can be directly assigned or it should be split because it lies across successive text lines. The algorithm participated in the ICDAR 07 and ICDAR 09 handwriting segmentation contests and took {{the first and second}} place respectively. The second method is based on binary morphology. The basic steps of the approach are: a) texture reduction (by combining dilation and sub-sampling) to produce a low resolution image, in which the underlying texture of text lines is apparent while preventing aliasing and b) application of dilations and (p,q) -th generalized foreground rank openings successively to join close and horizontally overlapping regions while preventing a merge in the vertical direction. These operations evolve the candidate text lines and distinguish special patterns, which imply that text lines have come very close or have been merged. Finally, each connected component of the initial document image is assigned to the text line that intersects, whereas if it intersects more than one text lines, we cut it using the local ridges produced with the application of the watershed algorithm. Word segmentation {{can be seen as a}} problem which requires the formulation of a metric of the gap between successive components and the clustering of the gaps in "inter" or "intra" word classes. To measure the gap metric, we use the negative logarithm of the objective function of a soft-margin linear Support Vector Machine. We employ a nonparametric approach to estimate the probability density function of the gap metrics and have observed that the “inter” words gaps are accumulated to the most right lobe of the probability density function while the “intra” word gaps are gathered to the left lobe. The classification threshold is chosen to be equal to the minimum between the two main lobes. The algorithm tested on the benchmarking datasets of ICDAR 07 and ICDAR 09 handwriting segmentation contests and outperformed the participating algorithms. Furthermore, the thesis studies the problem of locating artificial text in video frames. A new method for verifying text areas detected in video streams is proposed. The algorithm explores the spectral properties of the horizontal projection of candidate text regions in order to reduce the high amount of false <b>alarms</b> that most <b>text</b> detection algorithms suffer from. The algorithm has been tested on newscast video sequences and we conclude that the addition of the verification module increased the precision rate significantly while keeping the recall rate almost unaffected. ...|$|R
