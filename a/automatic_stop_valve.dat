40|$|Abstract: <b>Stop</b> <b>valves</b> are {{commonly}} used as fluid flow control equipments in many engineering applications. A numerical study of a three-dimensional, complex geometry, stop-check valve was performed for model validation and improved understanding of valve flow features. This paper has provided a numerical investigation of the fluid flow inside a <b>stop</b> <b>valve,</b> including the modeling and the simulation of the <b>stop</b> <b>valves.</b> According to the simulation result of original valve structure, two cone valve block shape with different gradient are presented to bring some optimization to the stop-valve. CFD simulations were conducted for different structure of the valve to verify {{the performance of the}} valve after redesign the internal flow structure. The simulation results show that the pressure drop vortex strength, maximum velocity and velocity nonuniformity of valve outlet had been reduced obviously. Furthermore, the results of the three-dimensional optimization analysis of valve shape can be used in the design of low noise and high efficiency valve for industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new non-intrusive methodology for testing the seal quality of inline <b>stop</b> <b>valves.</b> An inline <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> {{is a common}} element of the water supply system, both in large diameter transmission pipelines and in distribution networks. A good quality valve seal is essential for executing an isolation procedure. The proposed technique uses an artificially generated hydraulic transient to test the valve seal. The valve resistance coefficient, {{the diameter of the}} orifice that is equivalent to the open area of the valve and the discharge rate through the valve are derived based on the reflection of the transient wave from the closed valve. The method provides a quick and inexpensive way of identifying inline <b>stop</b> <b>valves</b> that fail to seal and allows operators to rate their condition without internal access to the pipe. This technique may provide a useful diagnostic tool for planning the replacement of valvesBursts; detection;, monitoring; transient response; water hammer; inverse analysisDalius Misiunas, Angus Simpson, Martin Lambert & Gustaf Olsson[URL]...|$|R

40|$|AbstractStop valves are {{commonly}} used as fluid flow control equipments in many engineering applications. Thus it's more and more essential to know the flow characteristic inside the valve. Due to the fast progress of the flow simulation and numerical technique, it becomes possible to observe the flows inside a valve and to estimate {{the performance of a}} valve. This paper presents the researches of the authors in modeling and simulation of the <b>stop</b> <b>valves.</b> The flow system with <b>stop</b> <b>valves</b> is complex structure and has non-linear characteristics, because the construction and the hydraulic phenomena are associated of <b>stop</b> <b>valves.</b> In this paper, three-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted to observe the flow patterns and to measure valve flow coefficient and flow fluctuations when <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> with different flow rate and uniform incoming velocity were used in a valve system. The spectra characteristics of pressure fluctuation on the flow cross section were also presented here to investigate the wake induce of the valve part. These results not only provided people with the access of understanding the flow pattern of the valve with different flow rate, but also were made to determine the methods which could be adopted to improve the performance of the valve. Furthermore, the results of the three-dimensional analysis can be used in the design of low noise and high efficiency valve for industry...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} accurate method for characterizing pressure barrier of capillary <b>stop</b> <b>valves</b> inside micro sample separators based on active CD-like microfluidics platforms. The capillary <b>stop</b> <b>valves</b> and micro sample separator were fabricated on polycarbonate (PC) substrates by using hot embossing techniques. The capillary <b>valves</b> <b>stop</b> the flow of liquid inside the microfluidic devices using a capillary pressure barrier when the channel geometry changes abruptly. Experiments are performed by rotating micro sample separator on a platform. The liquid sample stopped inside the micro sample separator {{is expected to be}} segmented by using density gradient centrifugation. Various density segments of samples required for an analysis can be separated by simply rotating at different speeds. Design parameters of the capillary valves used in micro sample separator have been analyzed theoretically. It is shown that the pressure barrier of capillary valve design can be better predicted by using current modified 3 -D meniscus model. Detailed theoretical analyses of valve behavior is presented and compared with experimental measurement. A model for the valve is then extracted that characterizes the valve performance for various parameters of capillary <b>stop</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Russian trains {{there is}} usually an {{emergency}} brake known as a [...] "stop valve" [...] (стоп-кран). In elektrichkas and other trains it is usually located near the doors, and sometimes {{in the middle of}} the car as well. A <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> usually has a distinctive red handle. Turning the handle down (counter-clockwise) by about 90 degrees causes pneumatic brakes to engage, due to pressure loss in the standard air-braking system. While primitive and not allowing any override such a system is effective, resembling usual train brake activation; it does not fail in emergency conditions. More complicated systems may not provide quick braking when needed, or during a communications failure. Emergency braking is somewhat risky; it is hard on passengers, and there is a risk of passenger injury if braking occurs at high speed. As a result, use of a <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> without good reason is prohibited and may lead to fines. Depending on circumstances and consequences, authorities may even arrest a person for the incorrect use of a <b>stop</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The maximum {{pressure}} rating of a metering pump {{is actually the}} top of the discharge pressure range the pump is guaranteed to pump against at a reasonably controllable flow rate. The pump itself is a pressurizing device often capable of exceeding its pressure rating, although not guaranteed to. For this reason, if there is any <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> downstream of the pump, a pressure relief valve should be placed in between to prevent overpressuring of the tubing or piping line in case the <b>stop</b> <b>valve</b> is inadvertently shut while the pump is running.
