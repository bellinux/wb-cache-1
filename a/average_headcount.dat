5000|$|Dial Post is a hamlet in the Horsham District of West Sussex, England. The civil parish, {{where the}} lowest level {{political}} meetings are held, is West Grinstead in the north-east - its biggest settlement is 2 mi east at Partridge Green. It {{has a population of}} around 100 based on the <b>average</b> <b>headcount</b> per inhabited dwelling. In 2001 the population of the civil parish as a whole was 2,934 ...|$|E
50|$|The {{significance}} of military medicine for combat strength {{goes far beyond}} treatment of battlefield injuries; in every major war fought until the late 19th century disease claimed more soldier casualties than did enemy action. During the American Civil War (1860-65), for example, about twice as many soldiers died of disease as were killed or mortally wounded in combat. The Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) is considered {{to have been the}} first conflict in which combat injury exceeded disease, at least in the German coalition army which lost 3.47% of its <b>average</b> <b>headcount</b> to combat and only 1.82% to disease. In new world countries, such as Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada, military physicians and surgeons contributed significantly to the development of civilian health care.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sludge was {{measured}} in the treatment lagoon at 15 swine finisher sites, seven sow sites and 15 nursery sites using a commercially available sludge level detector. Lagoon design dimensions or as-built survey data and the resulting sludge levels were used to calculate sludge volume in each lagoon using three-dimensional CAD analysis. Accumulation rates for each lagoon were calculated using the sludge volume, lagoon age, <b>average</b> <b>headcount</b> and total solids calculated using the composition of swine diets. Data indicates the average sludge accumulation rate (SAR) for swine lagoons is not statistically different than the current ASAE recommendation; however, the SAR for sow lagoons is significantly higher than for finisher and nursery lagoons. It is recommended that a revision of ASAE EP 403. 3 should include SAR values nearer 0. 002 m 3 /kg TS (0. 032 ft 3 /lb TS) for nursery and finisher lagoons and 0. 0034 m 3 /kg TS (0. 054 ft 3 /lb TS) for sow lagoons...|$|E
50|$|The college {{currently}} has three elementary tracks and the secondary school. Each elementary track has a Titular Director, a Deputy Director, a succession Professor (supernumerary), five teachers for five classes and two workers. The <b>average</b> annual <b>headcount</b> of students is 560 per track. The length of study at primary school is six years. The age group of elementary students is from 6 to 14 years. The six years {{lead to a}} certificate from the Ministry of Education that provides access to secondary education. A distinctive certificate from the Society of Jesus is added to their diploma.|$|R
40|$|Retention and {{graduation}} rates of underrepresented minority students were studied during 1985 - 91 with first-time freshman cohorts at 67 U. S. colleges and universities. Data were also collected from 17 institutions for science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) majors {{by race and}} gender. Research areas included: <b>headcounts,</b> <b>average</b> admission test scores, retention rates after one and two years, {{and graduation}} and continuation rates within 4, 5, and 6 years. Findings included: underrepresented minorities constituted 14 percent of 1985 entering freshman and 19 percent of 1991 freshmen; 6 -year tracking of the 1985 and 1986 cohorts of 312, 795 first-time freshmen indicated that 80 percent continued to the second year and 69 percent progressed to {{the third year of}} college; after the first year, retention rates were 73 percent for Blacks, 72 percent for Hispanics, and 69 percent for American Indians compared with 8...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{construct}} a poverty profile for Sri Lanka, and examine the micro-level determinants and correlates of poverty. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on the latest Sri Lanka Integrated Survey commissioned by the World Bank. The unconditional poverty profile was constructed using three different poverty measures (poverty <b>headcount,</b> <b>average</b> poverty gap and squared poverty gap), nested in the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke index. The conditional poverty profile was constructed on the basis of a multivariate analysis of poverty correlates. Partial correlates of poverty are computed using two comparable methodologies. First, a logistic regression was estimated, with the probability of a household being in poverty as the dependent variable and a set of economic and demographic variables as correlates. Second, the quantile regression approach was utilized to examine the correlates of per capita consumption at different points on the distribution. Findings – The empirical findings are broadly encouraging. The estimation results show that the education of the household head, being salary employed and being engaged in business have a significant positive effect on the standard of living. The probability of being poor increases with the household size, household head being female, living in a rural area, and being a casual wage earner. These findings indicate the importance of a set of policies which are super pro-poor, namely increasing school enrolment and achievement, effective family planning programs to reduce the birth rate and dependency load within households, and granting priorities for specific cohorts (children-, elderly-, rural- and female-headed households) in targeted interventions. Originality/value – This is the first study that examines the probable determinants and correlates of Sri Lankan poverty in a multivariate framework employing both logit and quantile regressions.
