5|$|LGBT {{themes in}} comics are a {{relatively}} new concept, as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from the content of comic books and their comic strip predecessors, due to either censorship or the perception that comics were for children. With any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority (CCA) until 1989, earlier attempts <b>at</b> <b>exploring</b> these issues in the US {{took the form of}} subtle hints or subtext regarding a character's sexual orientation. LGBT themes were tackled earlier in underground comix from the early 1970s onward. Independently published one-off comic books and series, often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines, tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers.|$|E

25|$|Diverse {{in style}} and subject, the Fifth Generation directors' films ranged from black comedy (Huang Jianxin's The Black Cannon Incident, 1985) to the esoteric (Chen Kaige's Life on a String, 1991), but they share a common {{rejection}} of the socialist-realist tradition worked by earlier Chinese filmmakers in the Communist era. Other notable Fifth Generation directors include Wu Ziniu, Hu Mei, Li Shaohong and Zhou Xiaowen. Fifth Generation filmmakers reacted against the ideological purity of Cultural Revolution cinema. By relocating to regional studios, they began to explore the actuality of local culture in a somewhat documentary fashion. Instead of stories depicting heroic military struggles, the films were built out of the drama of ordinary people's daily lives. They also retained political edge, but aimed <b>at</b> <b>exploring</b> issues rather than recycling approved policy. While Cultural Revolution films used character, the younger directors favored psychological depth {{along the lines of}} European cinema. They adopted complex plots, ambiguous symbolism, and evocative imagery. Some of their bolder works with political overtones were banned by Chinese authorities.|$|E

The nerve is intentionally removed in [...] "radical" [...] neck dissections, which are attempts <b>at</b> <b>exploring</b> the neck surgically for the presence and extent of cancer.

Current research shows that believing in such claims increases gender bias in evaluations of others and backlash effects against females who violate gender norms.

2500|$|In 1978 a {{committee}} {{was formed in}} order to mount a third, and even larger excavation at Sutton Hoo. Backed by the Society of Antiquaries of London, the committee proposed an investigation to be led by Philip Rahtz from the University of York and Rupert Bruce-Mitford, but the British Museum's reservations led to the committee deciding to collaborate with the Ashmolean Museum. The committee recognised that much had changed in archaeology since the early 1970s. The Conservatives' privatisation policies signalled a decrease in state support for such projects, whilst the emergence of post-processualism in archaeological theory moved many archaeologists toward focussing on concepts such as social change. The Ashmolean's involvement convinced the British Museum and the Society of Antiquaries to help fund the project. In 1982, Martin Carver from the University of York was appointed to run the excavation, with a research design aimed <b>at</b> <b>exploring</b> [...] "the politics, social organisation and ideology" [...] of Sutton Hoo. Despite opposition by those who considered that funds available could be better used for rescue archaeology, in 1983 the project went ahead.|$|E

40|$|The Masters thesis {{deals with}} {{dependence}} of quality parameters of malt on {{the temperature of}} mashing at sweet wort preparation. The theoretical part focuses on the technology of malt production including description of ingredients, production parts, some kinds of malt and the quality parameters. There is also described the technology of sweet wort preparation and the methods of determination of the malt quality parameters in the sweet wort there. The experimental part focuses on determination of malt extract, viscosity, haze, colour, time of starch cleavage, pH, degree of fermentation and beta-glucans content. Based on temperature dependence of parameters, the individual samples were compared {{and the effects of}} temperature were discussed. The biggest extract of light and caramel malts was <b>explored</b> <b>at</b> 70 °C, of coloured malt at 50 °C. The lowest viscosity of light and coloured malts was <b>explored</b> <b>at</b> 65 °C, of caramel malt at 50 °C. The lowest haze of wort was at 65 °C. Ideal colour of all malts was at all mashing temperatures. Ideal pH of all malts was <b>explored</b> <b>at</b> 70 °C. Ideal time of starch cleavage was <b>explored</b> <b>at</b> 70 - 85 °C. The biggest achievable degree of fermentation and the hugest increase of beta-glucans content were <b>explored</b> <b>at</b> 65 °C...|$|R
