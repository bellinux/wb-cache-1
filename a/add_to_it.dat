5|$|Although the Argentine and Chilean navies possessed {{insignificant}} {{naval forces}} in the 1860s, with zero and five warships, respectively, Argentina's concern over a strong Brazilian Navy and the Chilean war against Spain caused them to add capable warships to their fleets in the 1870s. During this time, diplomatic relations between Argentina and Chile soured due to conflicting boundary claims, particularly in Patagonia. By {{the beginning of the}} 1880s, after the War of the Pacific, the Chilean government possessed possibly the strongest navy in the Americas. They planned to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> with an 1887 appropriation for one battleship, two protected cruisers, and two torpedo gunboats. Argentina responded a year later with an order for two battleships of its own. The naval arms race unfolded over the next several years, with each country buying and ordering vessels that were slightly better than the previous ship, but the Argentines eventually pulled ahead with the acquisition of multiple Garibaldi-class cruisers.|$|E

25|$|Liszt {{attempted}} in the symphonic poem {{to extend}} this revitalisation {{of the nature}} of musical discourse and <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> the Romantic ideal of reconciling classical formal principles to external literary concepts. To this end, he combined elements of overture and symphony with descriptive elements, approaching symphonic first movements in form and scale. While showing extremely creative amendments to sonata form, Liszt used compositional devices such as cyclic form, motifs and thematic transformation to lend these works added coherence. Their composition proved daunting, requiring a continual process of creative experimentation that included many stages of composition, rehearsal and revision to reach a version where different parts of the musical form seemed balanced.|$|E

The renowned officer in the Parliamentary army, Robert Venables, published in 1662 The Experienced Angler, or Angling improved, being a general discourse of angling, imparting many of the aptest ways and choicest experiments for the taking of most sorts of fish in pond or river.

25|$|The Jews {{suffered}} much {{during the}} great conquests of Moulay Rashid, who united the separate parts of Morocco into one single state, and wished to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> all northwest Africa. According to Chénier, when Al-Raschid took the city of Marrakech in 1670, at {{the desire of the}} inhabitants he caused the Jewish counselor and governor of the ruling prince Abu Bakr, together with the latter and his whole family, to be publicly burned, in order to inspire terror among the Jews. He also tore down the synagogues of the city, expelled many Jews from the Berber region of Sus and treated them tyrannically. His demands on the Jews in the way of taxes were enormous; he had them collected by Joshua ben Hamoshet, a rich Jew, to whom he was under obligations for various services and whom he appointed chief over the Jews. He even ordered the Jews to supply wine to the Christian slaves.|$|E

On the other hand, the ordinals form an absolutely infinite sequence that cannot be increased in magnitude because there are no larger ordinals to <b>add</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> In 1883, Cantor also introduced the well-ordering principle [...] "every set can be well-ordered" [...] and stated that it is a [...] "law of thought." ...|$|E

The game's distance fog was reduced and disguised as an atmospheric effect, resulting in players {{being able to see}} five time as far than they could in the original game. The game's progression, focus on exploration and mission objectives were inspired by the Mario and Zelda franchises.

2500|$|Her third {{release was}} Mahesh Bhatt's romantic comedy Hum Hain Rahi Pyaar Ke {{opposite}} Aamir Khan, which many critics called her career's best performance. Critics wrote [...] "Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla have already {{proved to be}} a great on-screen pair and here they shine once again. Aamir Khan is effective in a suitably restrained performance but it is Juhi Chawla who steals the show with her comic nirvana. Easily she is the funniest actor in the history of Hindi cinema {{and it would be a}} tough challenge for any actor to match up to that. Moreover, her effortless dialogue delivery in Tamil (especially for someone who doesn't speak the language) only further prove what a gifted actress she is." [...] Another critic wrote [...] "The film ultimately belongs to Juhi, because she is the soul of all things. She is the active reason of things happening. She is the fun. She is that innocence people love. It is difficult to imagine any other actress in this role. Such is her natural charm and comic sense in this one, and she truly deserved the Filmfare she received. Looking sweet and simple throughout the film she makes you smile with her mere presence. This is definitely her best performance. <b>Add</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> she is acting opposite Aamir, the two compliment each other and share a crackling chemistry and you are left with a feeling of bliss". The pairing of Chawla with Khan (one of the most popular on screen pairings of the '90s) resulted in hype over the film's release, and it proved a major commercial and critical success. Her comic-dramatic performance met with unanimous critical acclaim and won her several awards, including the Filmfare Best Actress Award for her performance in the film.|$|E
