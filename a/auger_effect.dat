40|$|The rate {{at which}} excited charge {{carriers}} relax to their equilibrium state affects {{many aspects of the}} performance of nanoscale devices, including switching speed, carrier mobility and luminescent efficiency. Better understanding of the processes that govern carrier relaxation therefore has important technological implications. A significant increase in carrier-carrier interactions caused by strong spatial confinement of electronic excitations in semiconductor nanostructures leads to a considerable enhancement of <b>Auger</b> <b>effects,</b> which can further result in unusual, Auger-process-controlled recombination and energy-relaxation regimes. Here, we report the first experimental observation of efficient Auger heating in CdSe quantum rods at high pump intensities, leading to a strong reduction of carrier cooling rates. In this regime, the carrier temperature is determined by the balance between energy outflow through phonon emission and energy inflow because of Auger heating. This equilibrium results in peculiar carrier cooling dynamics that closely correlate with recombination dynamics, an effect never before seen in bulk or nanoscale semiconductors.

The PL dynamics at selected energies, ELE and EHE, are respectively shown on Figure 5 b,c. The time-resolved emission related to the LE transition can be fitted by the sum of a shorter exponential decay with a lifetime of 770 ps and a constant associated with the very long lifetime of the indirect transition. Many-body <b>Auger</b> <b>effects</b> leading to an enhancement of intradot carrier relaxation may lower the optical transition lifetime. The density of electron-hole pairs is indeed estimated to be high (above 10 per QD). Such effects have been observed in InAs/InP QDs[20]. For the HE transition, the emission shows a biexponential decay with short lifetimes of 340 and 1, 700 ps, respectively. Both times are consistent with a direct type-I electronic transition in QDs and a better overlap of electron and hole wave functions. The EHEELE difference is also in reasonable agreement with that of theoretical calculations.

40|$|Nanostructured {{plasmonic}} metal {{systems are}} known to enhance greatly variety of radiative and nonradiative optical processes, both linear and nonlinear, which are due to the interaction of an electron in a molecule or semiconductor with the enhanced local optical field of the surface plasmons. Principally different are numerous many-body phenomena that are due to the Coulomb interaction between charged particles: carriers (electrons and holes) and ions. These include carrier-carrier or carrier-ion scattering, energy and momentum transfer (including the drag effect), thermal equilibration, exciton formation, impact ionization, <b>Auger</b> <b>effects,</b> etc. It is not widely recognized that these and other many-body effects can also be modified and enhanced by the surface-plasmon local fields. A special but extremely important class of such many-body phenomena is constituted by chemical reactions at metal surfaces, including catalytic reactions. Here, we propose a general and powerful theory of the plasmonic enhancement of the many-body phenomena resulting in a closed expression for the surface plasmon-dressed Coulomb interaction.

Low threshold currents obtained at 1. 54 μm for broad area lasers are promising for the future. This paper is {{a review of the}} recent progress toward the understanding of electronic properties, carrier dynamics and device modelling in this system, taking into account materials and nanostructures properties. A first complete analysis of the carrier dynamics is done by combining time-resolved photoluminescence experiments and a dynamic three-level model, for the QD ground state (GS), the QD excited state (ES) and the wetting layer/barrier (WL). Auger coefficients for the intradot assisted relaxation are determined. GS saturation is also introduced. The observed double laser emission for a particular cavity length is explained by adding photon populations in the cavity with ES and GS resonant energies. Direct carrier injection from the WL to the GS related to the weak carrier confinement in the QD is evidenced. In a final step, this model is extended to QD GS and ES inhomogeneous broadening by adding multipopulation rate equations (MPREM). The model is now able to reproduce the spectral behavior in InAs-InP QD lasers. The almost continuous transition from the GS to the ES as a function of cavity length is then attributed to the large QD GS inhomogeneous broadening comparable to the GS-ES lasing energy difference.

Smaller bandgap materials necessary for this range {{are more susceptible to}} non-radiative Auger recombination. Further, as laser structures become more complicated, like quantum cascade intersubband and interband lasers, Shockley-Read-Hall losses increase. The simplest structure is Type-I multiple quantum well (MQW), but few QW III-V heterojunction material systems capable of 2 - 5 µm emission have a Type-I offset. One such system with InAsSb wells and AlInAsSb barriers has been unable to exceed 175 K under CW operation partially due to poor carrier confinement associated with small valence band offsets. This paper describes the growth and performance of AlInAsSb/InAsSb lasers using a 0. 3 mole fraction of Al in the Group III elements. Increased Al content enhances the valence and conduction band offsets, but the AlInAsSb alloy exhibits a miscibility gap above 0. 06 Al mole fraction, so a digital alloy technique was used to grow high quality 0. 3 - 2 µm thick quaternary films. As Al mole fraction in the barriers was increased from 0. 20 to 0. 30 an 80 -fold increase in photoluminescence (PL) was observed. The corresponding lasers were grown and tested demonstrating lasing at 3. 9 µm and 50 K. Theoretical studies suggest that adding Ga to the barriers, forming an AlGaInAsSb quinary alloy, results in band structures more favorable towards minimizing <b>Auger</b> <b>effects</b> and realizing Type I offset behavior over a wider range of alloy compositions.

Since accurate photoabsorption and photoionization cross sections are needed in their spectral models, they have been computed for isoelectronic sequences with electron number 12 ≤ N≤ 18 using a multi-channel method. Target representations are obtained with the atomic structure code AUTOSTRUCTURE, and ground-state cross sections are computed with the Breit [...] Pauli R-matrix method (BPRM) in intermediate coupling, including damping (radiative and <b>Auger)</b> <b>effects.</b> The contributions from channels associated with the 2 s-hole [2 s]μ target configurations and those containing 3 d orbitals are studied in the Mg and Ar isoelectronic sequences. Cross sections for the latter ions are also calculated in the isolated-resonance approximation as implemented in AUTOSTRUCTURE and compared with BPRM to test their accuracy. It is confirmed that the collisional channels associated with the [2 s]μ target configurations {{must be taken into}} account owing to significant increases in the monotonic background cross section between the L and K edges. Target configurations with 3 d orbitals give rise to fairly conspicuous unresolved transition arrays in the L-edge region, but to a much lesser extent in the K-edge which is our main concern; therefore, they have been neglected throughout owing to their computationally intractable channel inventory, thus allowing the computation of cross sections for all the ions with 12 ≤ N≤ 18 in intermediate coupling with BPRM. We find that the isolated-resonance approximations performs satisfactorily. Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics. 5 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
