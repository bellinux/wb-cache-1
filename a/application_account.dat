40|$|Information {{has played}} {{important}} role for man's activity. By getting information, people can learn something. When internet was invented, {{it has made}} spreading information become very easy and fast without time and space boundary. The internet also affects banking industry. Account holders demand a more efficient way of doing their business anytime, anywhere. This {{can be done by}} using internet as media for doing transactions. This final project was motivated to provide such conveniency. A web-based banking application is built using JSP (Java Server Pages) and Servlet technology. JSP is an web interface that communicates with account holder and Servlet provides the business logic which handles the transactions. This application provides banking transactions such as view information about account, transfer and bill payment. This web-based application which called JOE-Banking that implements JSP and Servlet technology has been successfully built using Java	 2 	Platform languageand Oracle	 9 i database. By using this web-based banking <b>application,</b> <b>account</b> holder will be easily doing their banking transactions anytime, anywhere through the internet...|$|E
40|$|An {{enhanced}} dual-layer {{wide area}} {{wireless sensor network}} (WSN) system was developed and applied in fresh food tracking application. The sensor nodes of WSN provide a set of useful measurements about the environmental conditions during the fresh food transportation. Since the 3 -axis acceleration data in such <b>application</b> <b>account</b> for more than 99 % out of all collected source data, we propose a novel acceleration data compression scheme for this specific application, to overcome the resource and cost limitation imposed on embedded sensing nodes and wireless communication links in WSN. According to general fresh food transport behavior pattern, the acceleration data can be extracted into three components (D waveform, A waveform and P waveform). Each component could be compressed separately according to its distinct characteristic and then packetized as an encoded frame. In this paper we examine the experimental acceleration dataset from a field test (fresh melon fruit transport from Brazil to Sweden in 20 days) as a test case. Experimental results show that a high compression ratio (around 10 : 1) with the acceptable distortion could be achieved, confirming {{the effectiveness of the}} compression scheme proposed in this work.

40|$|Soil {{has been}} {{regarded}} as {{a rich source of}} antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) due to the complex microbial community and diverse antibiotic-producing microbes in soil, however, {{little is known about the}} ARGs in unculturable bacteria. To investigate the diversity and distribution of ARGs in soil and assess the impact of agricultural practice on the ARGs, we screened soil metagenomic library constructed using DNA from four different agricultural soil for ARGs. We identified 45 clones conferring resistance to minocycline, tetracycline, streptomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin. The similarity of identified ARGs with the closest protein in GenBank ranged from 26 % to 92 %, with more than 60 % of identified ARGs had low similarity less than 60 % at amino acid level. The identified ARGs include aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, aminoglycoside 6 -adenyltransferase, ADP-ribosyl transferase, ribosome protection protein, transporters and other antibiotic resistant determinants. The identified ARGs from the soil with manure <b>application</b> <b>account</b> for approximately 70 % of the total ARGs in this study, implying that manure amendment may increase the diversity of antibiotic resistance genes in soil bacteria. These results suggest that antibiotic resistance in soil remains unexplored and functional metagenomic approach is powerful in discovering novel ARGs and resistant mechanisms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we identify the ill-effects of implementing TCP over a hybrid network (IP-access and OBS-core). We purpose a Split-TCP approach for a hybrid IP-OBS network to improve TCP performance. We propose two Split-TCP approaches, namely, 1 : 1 : 1 and N: 1 :N. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches over an IP-OBS hybrid network. Based on the simulation results, N: 1 :N Split-TCP approach outperforms all other approaches. ...|$|R
