5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Daucus carota is a {{biennial}} plant. In {{the first}} year, its rosette of leaves produces {{large amounts of}} sugars, which <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> in the taproot to provide energy for the plant to flower in the second year.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} {{mentioning}} that sea shells, after collecting, {{need to be}} washed thoroughly in freshwater to remove the salt that is on and in the shell, and then dried thoroughly before they <b>are</b> <b>stored.</b> Salt attracts moisture and makes shells more vulnerable to Bynesian decay.|$|E

5|$|A {{manuscript}} normally {{known as}} the Orus Apollo also exists in the Lyon municipal library, where upwards of 2,000 original documents relating to Nostradamus <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> {{under the aegis of}} Michel Chomarat. It is a purported translation of an ancient Greek work on Egyptian hieroglyphs based on later Latin versions, all of them unfortunately ignorant of the true meanings of the ancient Egyptian script, which was not correctly deciphered until Champollion in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
5|$|Bynesian decay usually starts when {{specimens}} <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> or displayed for considerable {{periods of}} time in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or display cases are entirely or partially made of wood, plywood or other wood products such as Masonite, or when the specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are cellulose-based and can turn water vapor acidic.|$|E

5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> which may cause them to decay.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to remove a key–value pair from the dictionary. However, it {{is not sufficient to}} do so by simply emptying its cell. This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell, but that <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> in a position later than the emptied cell. The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key is not present.|$|E

5|$|Since {{different}} neuronal cell {{types are}} neatly organized into layers in the hippocampus, it has frequently {{been used as}} a model system for studying neurophysiology. The form of neural plasticity known as long-term potentiation (LTP) was first discovered to occur in the hippocampus and has often been studied in this structure. LTP is widely believed {{to be one of the}} main neural mechanisms by which memories <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> in the brain.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{energy system}} gives players 5 energy {{points at the}} start. Beginning a run in any mode costs one point, and it takes 10 minutes for a point to recharge.

Players can make friends at the leaderboard; once per day they can send and request 5 energy points, which <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> in their inboxes.|$|E
5000|$|Chavannes {{used the}} term [...] "vital force" [...] to {{describe}} the intellectual, emotional and sexual energy stored within the body. Intellectual vital force, he believed, <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in the brain, emotional vital force <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> behind the heart, and sexual vital force <b>is</b> <b>stored</b> in the genitalia.

5|$|The poly(A) tail is {{important}} for the nuclear export, translation, and stability of mRNA. The tail is shortened over time, and, when it is short enough, the mRNA is enzymatically degraded. However, in a few cell types, mRNAs with short poly(A) tails <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> for later activation by re-polyadenylation in the cytosol. In contrast, when polyadenylation occurs in bacteria, it promotes RNA degradation. This is also sometimes the case for eukaryotic non-coding RNAs.|$|E
5|$|The {{red color}} of the fruit bodies is caused by five types of {{carotenoid}} pigments, including plectaniaxanthin and β-carotene. Carotenoids are lipid-soluble and <b>are</b> <b>stored</b> within granules in the paraphyses. British-Canadian mycologist Arthur Henry Reginald Buller suggested that pigments in fruit bodies exposed to the Sun absorb some of the Sun's rays, raising {{the temperature of the}} hymenium—hastening the development of the ascus and subsequent spore discharge.|$|E
