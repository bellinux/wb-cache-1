To do so, the Court found, [...] "Where the claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make clear the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory purpose. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 540–541 (1993) (First Amendment); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240 (1976) (Fifth Amendment).

It instead involves a decisionmaker’s undertaking a course of action [...] "'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' [...] adverse effects upon an identifiable group." [...] Ibid.

The author have studied family law relations {{between parents and children}} in contemporary Serbia and in European law. In historical perspective in Vojvodina (including Medjumurje and Prekomurje) the Hungarian law (acts) was in use, except in Srem and Vojna granica where the Austrian law was in use. The issues of family status of children, in other words, the rules of establishing and contesting paternity, parental rights and duties, exercise of parental rights were analyzed. The father had paternal authority and priority role if the child was born in wedlock. If the child was born out of wedlock, mother had priority role in exercising rights and duties. If parents were divorced or separated the priority role had the parent who had custody of the child, the other parent had visitation rights. In the second part of this paper the court cases in parent-child relation in twentieth and thirtieth years of XX century kept in Archive of Vojvodina, were analyzed.

60|$|July 8, 1871.—Mr. Gladstone {{believes}} that <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>precedent</b> the commander-in-chief, when a peer, has not shrunk from giving his opinion on measures {{submitted to the}} House of Lords. In 1847, the government of that day introduced the Short Service bill, of which on the merits {{it is believed that}} the Duke of Wellington, then commander-in-chief, did not approve. Indeed he expressed in debate on April 26th, 1847, his doubts whether the measure would produce the advantages which were anticipated from it; nevertheless, while having no political connection with the government, he spoke and voted in a division for the bill. It is probable, as the numbers were only 108 to 94, that his speech and vote alone carried the bill. Your Majesty will not fail to bear in mind that until 1855, there was always a very high military authority who was in political connection with the government, namely, the master of the ordnance. Indeed, unless Mr. Gladstone’s recollection deceives him, Lord Beresford was required by the Duke of Wellington in 1829, as master of the ordnance, to support the Roman Catholic Relief bill. And it is still regretted by many that ministries have not since comprehended any such officer. All question, however, as to the political support of a ministry by the military chiefs of the army is now at an end.|$|E

60|$|The {{new draft}} marks {{a new chapter}} in the Hunt's history. From an {{isolated}} phenomenon in a barge it became a permanent institution with brick-built kennels ashore, and an influence social, political, and administrative, co-terminous with the boundaries of the province. Ben, the Governor, departed to England, where he kept a pack of real dainty hounds, but never ceased to long for the old lawless lot. His successors were ex-officio Masters of the Gihon Hunt, as all Inspectors were Whips. For one reason; Farag, the kennel huntsman, in khaki and puttees, would obey nothing under the rank of an Excellency, and the hounds would obey no one but Farag; for another, the best way of estimating crop returns and revenue was by riding straight to hounds; for a third, though Judges down the river issued signed and sealed land-titles to all lawful owners, yet public opinion along the river never held any such title valid till it had been confirmed, <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>precedent,</b> by the Governor's hunting crop in the hunting field, above the wilfully neglected earth. True, the ceremony had been cut down to three mere taps on the shoulder, but Governors who tried to evade that much found themselves and their office compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses who took up their time with lawsuits and, worse still, neglected the puppies. The older sheikhs, indeed, stood out for the unmeasurable beatings of the old days--the sharper the punishment, they argued, the surer the title; but here the hand of modern progress was against them, and they contented themselves with telling tales of Ben the first Governor, whom they called the Father of Waterwheels, and of that heroic age when men, horses, and hounds were worth following.|$|E
