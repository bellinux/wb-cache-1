25|$|Unlike other Sophists, such as Protagoras, Gorgias did not {{profess to}} teach arete (excellence, or, virtue). He {{believed}} {{that there was no}} absolute form of arete, but that it was relative to each situation. For example, virtue in a slave was not the same as virtue in a statesman. His believed that rhetoric, the <b>art</b> <b>of</b> <b>persuasion,</b> was the king of all sciences, since he saw it as a techné with which one could persuade an audience toward any course of action. While rhetoric existed in the curriculum of every Sophist, Gorgias placed more prominence upon it than any of the others.|$|E
25|$|Despite his adventurous career, mere reminiscences {{obviously}} bored him; he {{was always}} for movement, for some betterment of present or future conditions, and in discussion he was {{a master of the}} <b>art</b> <b>of</b> <b>persuasion,</b> unconsciously creating in those around him a latent desire to follow, if he would lead. The source of such persuasive influence eludes analysis, and, like the mystery of leadership, is probably more psychic than mental. In this latter respect, Jameson was splendidly equipped; he had greater power of concentration, of logical reasoning, and of rapid diagnosis, while on his lighter side he was brilliant in repartee and in the exercise of a badinage that was both cynical and personal...|$|E

2500|$|Once the {{language}} was mastered grammatically {{it could be}} used to attain the second stage, eloquence or rhetoric. This <b>art</b> <b>of</b> <b>persuasion</b> [...] was not art for its own sake, but the acquisition of the capacity to persuade others – all men and women – to lead the good life. As Petrarch put it, 'it is better to will the good than to know the truth'. Rhetoric thus led to and embraced philosophy. Leonardo Bruni (c.1369–1444), the outstanding scholar of the new generation, insisted that it was Petrarch who [...] "opened the way for us to show how to acquire learning", but it was in Bruni's time that the word umanista first came into use, and its subjects of study were listed as five: grammar, rhetoric, poetry, moral philosophy, and history".|$|E

The answer was brought back by the servant who waited on Miss Dunross, in four resolute words: [...] "It can not be." [...] This time the woman spoke out before she left me.

Early Nigerian writers in particular, during the period immediately after liberation from British colonial rule in 1960, used their rich oral antecedents, myths, cultural beliefs, and traditional values, combined with values and language inherited from the colonial past, to forge a creative link between their ideas, their ideals, and contemporary issues, and to predict a course for their young nation. Wole Soyinka, for instance, in his novel The Interpreters (1965), produced a running commentary on {{the affairs of the}} newly independent Nigeria by using inference and associations to describe acts of equivocation and ambivalence among the new African elites and to expose political and religious apostasy...|$|R

500|$|Another critic, Maria Tatar, {{notes that}} there is little to admire in Puss—he threatens, flatters, deceives, and steals in order to promote his master. She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a [...] "linguistic virtuoso", a {{creature}} who has mastered the <b>arts</b> <b>of</b> <b>persuasion</b> and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth. [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found. The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative, or beside the point. The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth, but the moral is belied by the poor miller's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage, but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat. The second moral stresses womankind's vulnerability to external appearances: fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts. In an aside, Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning, [...] "it {{has something to do with}} inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters." ...|$|R

40|$|Politics is {{regarded}} as a science for it tells us what to do, when it deals with measurable concepts. But politics is also an art—a form of practice, telling us how and when to do things. Lest we forget, the <b>arts</b> <b>of</b> <b>persuasion</b> and inspiration are part of politics. And, every art also produces an aesthetic. By aesthetics I mean, the ways by which we think about art: recall, art is what we do and how we do things. Th ose things and acts that become visible when we do and produce certain actions—jubilation, conversations, speeches, greetings, protests, banners, deaths, wounds and other expressions—all constitute the means by which thought becomes visible, effective, and sensible. These forms and visible expressions of the sensible constitute the aesthetics of politics. Only the patient will know where the momentum for change in the Arab world is heading. But, if the outcome of the Arab uprisings is unclear, then there is one certainty: the people have changed the order of the sensible. Thanks to peaceful protests in the face of regime brutality, {{tens of millions of people}} have performed change in myriads of expressions: aesthetics. Their feelings have cumulatively changed, and how people feel about governance is ultimately what politics is all about...|$|R
