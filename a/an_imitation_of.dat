5|$|Don Quixote in England {{was started}} as Fielding's second play, {{but it was}} not {{finished}} and produced until the later part of his career. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of Don Quixote in England. It was refused by the Theatre Royal and it was not produced or printed until 1734. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's 1734 preface. It was his second play, and Fielding attributes it to being written at Leyden during 1728. It was intended more as amusement than as a serious production and was <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> Cervantes's Don Quixote. After the prompting of Barton Booth and Colley Cibber, Fielding put away the play until 1733, when the Drury-Lane actors asked him for a new play. Soon after, Fielding rewrote parts of the play.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} {{with a background}} in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984.

Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.|$|E

5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not <b>an</b> <b>imitation</b> <b>of</b> the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. We have had our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E
