500|$|Conversely, various Marxist {{observers}} – including Western historians Hill and John Rees – {{argued against}} {{the view that}} Lenin's government was a dictatorship, viewing it instead as an imperfect way of preserving elements of democracy without some of the processes found in liberal democratic states. Ryan contends that the leftist historian Paul Le Blanc [...] "makes a quite valid point that the personal qualities that led Lenin to brutal policies were not necessarily any stronger than {{in some of the}} major Western leaders of the twentieth century". Ryan also posits that for Lenin, 'revolutionary' violence was merely a means to an end: the establishment of a socialist, ultimately communist world – a world without violence. Historian J. Arch Getty remarked, [...] "Lenin deserves <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the notion that the meek can inherit the earth, that there can be a political movement based on social justice and equality."

[...] In regards to the main plot, he said it [...] "could have done even more with the premise of the Jaypocalypse re-enacted with janitors, but it gets <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the inspired idea." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10 rating, writing that the janitor plot [...] "came at a perfect time" [...] in regards to the Leno and O'Brien controversy. He, however, did not like the other two plots, noting they were [...] "less impressive". Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times said that the Khonani and Subhas plot was [...] "supremely clever and self-referential", and that the show's take on it was [...] "decidedly neutral, albeit very funny".|$|E

[...] Yehl also praised the art, saying it looked [...] "impressively good" [...] despite {{the fact that there were}} four artists on the book. Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the first issue 2 stars out of 5, saying that the story is a [...] "protracted version of what readers have already learned in Phantom Stranger and elsewhere" [...] and criticizing the fact that Pandora's origin greatly differed from that of her Greek counterpart and the story had little to do with the [...] "Trinity War". Like Yehl, Johnson also praised the fluidity of the art from Zircher, Cannon, Sampere and Cifuentes. Newsarama's Aaron Duran gave the title a 5 out of 10, saying the comic is simply okay and would have worked better as a shorter installment within other books or as bonus digital content.|$|E

Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it."

500|$|The episode premiered to {{generally}} positive reviews. Although initially cringing {{over the}} musical premise, Ramsey Isler of IGN called the episode [...] "admittedly fun" [...] because it [...] "gave us an indirect window to view how Walter feels about himself". In {{a review of}} the DVD, another critic from IGN later called it the [...] "worst overall episode" [...] of the season however, asking the question [...] "Musical numbers and Olivia Dunham: who thought {{this would be a good}} idea?" [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was also initially irritated after hearing Fox's musical plans, and consequently gave [...] "Fringe <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> pulling off this hour so cleverly" [...] Jennifer Walker from TV Fanatic thought the episode was [...] "bizarre" [...] to watch; it [...] "held our interest for the entire 60 minutes, but really failed to introduce any new information about Peter and the unknown man that has crossed into our dimension". MTVs John Wigler loved the [...] "noir" [...] element, and thought [...] "each and every participating [...] "Fringe" [...] cast member exhibited great musical ability. Overall, it was a very solid effort on everyone's part". Jane Boursaw of TV Squad loved the scenes between Walter and Ella, and thought [...] "it was downright brilliant to create a story within a story". While he praised the episode's production and the singing abilities of the cast, Kurt Anthony Krug of Mania.com wrote a negative review: [...] "All in all, what was supposed to be a fun filler episode before the question of where Peter went at the end of the last episode when he found out he was the Peter from an alternate reality – one of the turning points in the show’s mythology – fell flat". Sarah Stegall of SFScope enjoyed it, writing [...] "There was just enough music, and just enough dance, to season this story without overburdening it". She praised the risktaking it took to make the episode [...] "edgy and whimsical, casting aside the concrete conventions of television storytelling...Not only was it entertaining, but it moved the storyline forward on some important emotional fronts, as the characters deal with Peter's disappearance in ways that protect them, but reveal as well".|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{director}} Chris Weitz {{wanted to}} recast {{the role of}} Jacob Black for Twilights sequel, , due to the major physical changes that occur in Black between the two novels, and have an actor that would accurately portray [...] "the new, larger Jacob Black."

Representatives for Weitz had stated that they were make a full effort to recast the [...] "high-profile gig," [...] and MTV News confirmed that Weitz was looking at Michael Copon to take on the role; however, Summit Entertainment said a decision had not been made. In an attempt to keep the role, Lautner weight-trained extensively and gained approximately 30 pounds of muscle. In January 2009, Weitz and Summit Entertainment announced that Lautner would continue {{to play the role of}} Jacob in the sequel. In an interview, fellow cast member Kristen Stewart talked about Lautner's transformation saying, [...] "He's an entirely different person physically." [...] Stewart later said, [...] "He gets a lot of attention because he's buff, but I think as soon as the movie comes out, people are going to realize that's not why he got the job." [...] Co-star Robert Pattinson said after seeing Lautner's body, [...] "I saw him and thought 'Jesus, I'm going to get fired." [...] In an interview with The Wrap, Weitz said Lautner deserved <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>for</b> the movie's box office, stating, [...] "If you look at the movie, it should have been the weakest in the franchise, because Robert Pattinson doesn't play as big a role." [...] Weitz said Lautner had to [...] "pick up that slack, and if his character hadn't been emotionally, not just physically, appealing, the movie wouldn't have been as big a hit." [...] The commercial performance of the film outpaced the first film, setting several box office records including the biggest midnight opening in the United States and Canada and the biggest single-day opening. The opening weekend of New Moon is the third highest opening weekend in domestic history with $142,839,137. The Twilight Saga: New Moon also has the sixth highest worldwide opening weekend with $274.9 million total. Critical reception was less favorable, with the movie getting a 4.6/10 average from Rotten Tomatoes, and a 44 on Metacritic.
