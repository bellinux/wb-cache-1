5|$|The Westinghouse <b>Air</b> <b>Brake</b> Company General Office Building (Known {{locally as}} The Castle or Library Hall) in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania is a {{building}} from 1890. It was {{listed on the}} Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation in 1975, National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Originally built as an office building for the Westinghouse <b>Air</b> <b>Brake</b> Company, it now houses The George Westinghouse Museum.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Dominik von Kripp {{suggested}} that the crest may {{have served as a}} rudder, an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even {{suggested that}} the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder. The rudder hypothesis again, {{does not take into account}} females nor P. sternbergi, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a rudder, the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the crest was an <b>air</b> <b>brake,</b> and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem. Additionally, the rudder and <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.|$|E
5|$|Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew W. Mellon, and Charles M. Schwab {{built their}} {{fortunes}} in Pittsburgh. Also based in Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse, credited with such advancements as the <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> {{and founder of}} over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886). Banks {{played a key role}} in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. For example, T. Mellon & Sons Bank, founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.|$|E

5000|$|The suffix [...] "A" [...] {{indicated}} that the locomotive's <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> had been commissioned. Until {{the introduction of the}} Mark 3, all Irish coaching stock used vacuum brakes but all locomotives since the 121 Class had also been equipped with <b>air</b> <b>braking,</b> albeit never commissioned.

5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral <b>air</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the T-10BM design {{outwardly}} {{resembles the}} Su-27 {{more than the}} Su-27M. During tests of the thrust-vectoring engines and the Su-27M's aerodynamic layout, Sukhoi had concluded {{that the loss of}} manoeuvrability due to the removal of the canards– the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe– could be compensated for by the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles. Industry progress in the fields of avionics and radars have also reduced the weight and size of such components, which shifted the centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward. Therefore, designers removed the canards (and the dorsal <b>air</b> <b>brake)</b> found on the Su-27M; the size of the vertical tails, aft-cockpit hump and tail boom were also reduced. With such changes, as well as the increased use of aluminium and titanium alloys and composites, designers had reduced the empty weight of the aircraft, while maintaining a similar maximum take-off weight to the Su-27M.|$|E
25|$|The H-101 {{differs from}} the Libelle in having a V-tail, showing its ancestry to the V-tailed Hütter H-30 GFK. Four {{flush-fitting}} <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> were fitted to the trailing edges of the wings, replacing the more conventionally sited <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> of the Standard Libelle. The Salto's <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> are hinged at their midpoints so that half the surface projects above the wing and half below.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} mandated the use {{of automatic}} couplers on all cars on the system in July 1925. The system was transitioning from vacuum <b>brakes</b> to <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> at this time, with most freight cars equipped with <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> by April 1927.|$|R
5000|$|Series 2 {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} with five <b>braking</b> systems; <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> for the locomotive, train <b>air</b> <b>braking,</b> train vacuum braking, a handbrake and dynamic rheostatic braking which can dissipate [...] The Series 1 locomotives were delivered without a vacuum brake system.|$|R
25|$|A railway <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> is {{a railway}} brake power braking system with {{compressed}} air as the operating medium. Modern trains {{rely upon a}} fail-safe <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> system that is based upon a design patented by George Westinghouse on March 5, 1868.

25|$|A railway <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> is a {{conveyance}} {{braking system}} which applies {{the means of}} compressed air which modern locomotives use to this day. George Westinghouse, a pioneer of the electrical industry, invented the railroad <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> in 1872.|$|E
25|$|If {{a driver}} either fails the <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> {{component}} of the general knowledge test or performs the skills test in a vehicle not equipped with air brakes, the driver is issued an <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> restriction, restricting the driver from operating a CMV equipped with air brakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{accident}} led to {{the fitting}} of <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> to rolling stock and improved signalling. Only the locomotives (Ub) had been fitted with <b>air</b> <b>brakes,</b> with hand-operated brakes in the guard’s van at the rear, and Rakaia station had no fixed signals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are used}} to {{increase}} drag. Spoilers might act as <b>air</b> <b>brakes,</b> but are not pure <b>air</b> <b>brakes</b> as they also function as lift-dumpers {{or in some cases}} as roll control surfaces. <b>Air</b> <b>brakes</b> are usually surfaces that deflect outwards from the fuselage (in most cases symmetrically on opposing sides) into the airstream in order to increase form-drag. As they are in most cases located elsewhere on the aircraft, they do not directly affect the lift generated by the wing. Their purpose is to slow down the aircraft. They are particularly useful when a high rate of descent is required. They are common on high performance military aircraft as well as civilian aircraft, especially those lacking reverse thrust capability.|$|R

25|$|Westinghouse <b>Air</b> <b>Brake</b> Company (known {{throughout}} the 19th and 20th Century as WABCO) {{was the first}} to offer air horns specifically for use with railroad equipment, as early as the 1910s. Their model E2 was recognized by many for the deep, commanding tone it produced.|$|E
25|$|On {{the under}} {{side of the}} {{aircraft}} there are three air brakes, two at the front and one at the rear. The front air brakes have an area of 0.76m², and a deflection angle of 35°. The rear <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> has an area of 0.46m² and a deflection angle of 40°. The rear <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> is blocked if the airplane carries an external fuel tank. Behind the air brakes are the bays for the main landing gear. On the under side of the airplane, just behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing are attachment points for two JATO rockets. The front section of the fuselage ends at former #28. The rear section of the fuselage starts at former #28a and is removable for engine maintenance.|$|E
25|$|As delivered, {{the only}} means of braking the {{locomotive}} was by operating a handbrake on the tender wheels. B 50 and B 108 were used in comparative trials of the Woods hydraulic and Westinghouse <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> systems in January 1884, with the Westinghouse system being later adopted as the standard.|$|E

Gladhand connectors resemble a pair of [...] "hands shaking" [...] when interlocked, hence the name.|$|R
25|$|The L class {{locomotive}} {{was also}} fitted {{with what was}} believed to be the most powerful dynamic brake in the world at the time, with L1150 able to maintain a steady 32mph (51km/h) leading a 1,100 ton test train on a 1 in 50 down-grade without use of the <b>air</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1869, at age 22, Westinghouse {{invented a}} {{railroad}} braking system using compressed air. The Westinghouse system used a compressor on the locomotive, a reservoir {{and a special}} valve on each car, and a single pipe running {{the length of the}} train (with flexible connections) which both refilled the reservoirs and controlled the brakes, allowing the engineer to apply and release the brakes simultaneously on all cars. It is a failsafe system, in that any rupture or disconnection in the train pipe will apply the brakes throughout the train. It was patented by Westinghouse on October 28, 1873. The Westinghouse <b>Air</b> <b>Brake</b> Company (WABCO) was subsequently organized to manufacture and sell Westinghouse's invention. It was in time nearly universally adopted by railways. Modern trains use brakes in various forms based on this design. The same conceptual design of fail-safe <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> is also found on heavy trucks.|$|E
25|$|The {{class was}} built in two batches; units 303001-035 were built 1959-60 (nominally for the North Clyde Line) and units 303036-091 were built 1960-61 (nominally for the Cathcart Circle Lines). In practice, when built, the North Clyde lines {{required}} {{the majority of the}} units. There was no electrified connection between the two networks until late {{in the life of the}} trains, and thus transfers between the two halves of the system, performed quite regularly, were dragged by locomotives via the Shields Road-High Street line. As the Class 303 were air braked, and most diesel locomotives of the early era were vacuum braked, a few Class 20 diesels were fitted with <b>air</b> <b>brake</b> connections for this, although when the Class 303 were new there were still a few former Caledonian Railway 4-4-0 steam locomotives in stock with the Westinghouse <b>air</b> <b>brake,</b> which were used for the transfers, and for delivering the units from their factory in Paisley.|$|E
