5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> love with your best friend.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Elder Paul Ryder, a prickly, {{judgmental}} young missionary assigned as Aaron's partner, Ryder is not enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> LA {{and even}} less so about living next door to a homosexual. Gordon-Levitt originally auditioned to play Aaron, but his aggressive attitude toward the script but {{good sense of humor}} made the producers decide he was a perfect Ryder.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can {{generally}} be found running rapidly from {{cover to cover}} or flying near ground level from bush to bush. However, this bird is not shy <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed ground squirrel. It will usually destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E

5|$|Speculation also {{surrounded}} whether former series star Kristin Kreuk would reprise {{her role}} as Lana Lang. Prior to the episode's broadcast, Kreuk ignited a minor controversy by noting {{that she would not}} be watching the episode when it aired, giving some fans the impression that she was avoiding the show. Kruek released a statement on her Facebook page, clarifying that, even when she was a star on Smallville, she did not watch the episodes when they aired. Kreuk stated that Peterson and Souders never approached her <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> the finale, and that she was glad that they had not, because she was fond of how Lana's story arc ended in season eight.|$|E

25|$|Hlaudi Motsoeneng, former COO of the SABC lied <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> {{possession}} of a Matric certificate. By his own admission, he simply invented marks for himself. He was appointed by Ellen Tshabalala, and his various court cases have cost the SABC more than R1.5 million.

25|$|Phillipos {{was arrested}} and faced charges of knowingly making false {{statements}} to police. He was released on $100,000 bail and placed under house confinement with an ankle monitor. He was convicted on October 28, 2014, on two charges of lying <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> Tsarnaev's dorm room. He later acknowledged {{that he had been}} in the room while two friends removed a backpack containing potential evidence relating to the bombing.|$|E
25|$|That Heidegger did {{not write}} this second part of Being and Time, and that the existential {{analytic}} was {{left behind in the}} course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of individual experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the collective human adventure that he understands the Western philosophical tradition to be. And this would in turn raise the question of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger's account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time. There are also recent critiques in this regard that were directed at Heidegger's focus on time instead of primarily thinking <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> relation to place and space, and to the notion of dwelling, with connections too to architectural theory as impacted by phenomenology.|$|E

500|$|I use micro-beats, {{a lot of}} whispery vocals, which I think sound amazing when they're {{downloaded}} {{because of}} the secrecy of the medium. The only acoustic instruments I would use would be those that sound good after they've been downloaded, so the harp, the music box, celeste and clavichord. They're plucky sounds. [...] And the strings [...] ended up being more panoramic textures in the background. It's all <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> a little house, on your own. [...] The strings would be like white mountains outside.|$|E
500|$|Two {{songs from}} the album, [...] "The Metre" [...] and [...] "Waiting for the Sun", were {{released}} as a double A-side to form the final single. The single was released on 21 August 2001, and included a cover of Iron Maiden's [...] "Number of the Beast". [...] "Waiting for the Sun" [...] was written by Fanning as a devotional, gospel style song. He said of the song; [...] "It’s <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> a relationship and being really heavily happy with it." [...] "The Metre" [...] spent one week on the ARIA Singles Chart, at #31.|$|E

500|$|During this time, {{there was}} a rumor that Cornell had checked himself into drug rehabilitation. He later {{confirmed}} it {{in an interview with}} Metal Hammer that was conducted from a clinic payphone. In a San Diego CityBEAT article, Cornell explained that he went through [...] "a horrible personal crisis" [...] during the making of the first record, staying in rehab for two months and separating from his wife. He credited Morello, Commerford and Wilk with helping him rebound from the difficult period. He dismissed the rumors <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> rehab for OxyContin or heroin, but when asked, offered only, [...] "Various things. I'm not picky. Mainly for drinking." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{reference}} points in [...] are all quite interesting—if {{you consider the}} youth-obsessed reference collaborators {{of the first two}} singles and how uncomfortable it all feels. 'Superstar' offers a glimpse of something far more comfortable in its own skin. All the {{reference points}} will mean very little to your average 17-year-old. We suppose the idea is that they're icons whose imagery transcends generations blah blah blah but after all the aggressive positioning of the first two singles it's great to hear Madonna relaxing into this sort of song. The lyrics <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> love are a bit soppy but love makes you go a bit soppy sometimes.|$|E

And {{it gave me a}} new perspective on this song, {{which is one of the}} first songs I recorded for [...] It's got a hot vibe to it, when you're driving around in the car on a normal, rainy day in Paris, driving around in circles in a Maserati — who doesn't do that every day? ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{references}} drugs both metaphorically and literally, and innocently {{delivers a}} transgressive message {{through the use}} of simile: [...] "I'm going to do you like drugs tonight". Miguel said of the song's lyrics, [...] "I have this propensity to just come out and say things. That's how I am in real life. If I wanna know something I just ask. Like, 'Hey, do you like drugs?' Because I do! Sometimes! ... MDMA… on occasion." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian observes [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "promises of narcotic [...] " [...] in the song's lyrics. Pitchfork Medias Carrie Battan said that [...] "Do You..." [...] is [...] "not so much <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> love as about a shared love of vices." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Biko" [...] means [...] "Please" [...] (or more {{accurately}} [...] "I implore you") in Igbo—a language spoken in Nigeria, the homeland of Okereke's parents—and is used [...] "when you're beseeching {{someone to do}} something". Okereke denied that {{it is about the}} murdered South African anti-apartheid protester Steve Biko. The lyrics of [...] "One Month Off" [...] reference feelings of anger and are <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> love with someone younger and unfaithful, while [...] "Zephyrus" [...] concerns an apology following neglect. The lyrics in the chorus of [...] "Ion Square", the last track on the original download release, are based on E. E. Cummings' poem [...] "I Carry Your Heart with Me". Okereke considers the song a personal favourite because it evokes the initial exciting stages of a new relationship when everything is going right.|$|E
500|$|... "Criminal" [...] is {{a guitar}} and synth-driven mid-tempo pop rock ballad which {{incorporates}} a folk-style flute melody. It {{is considered the}} only ballad on Femme Fatale, and is less aggressive than the other songs of the album. [...] "Criminal" [...] {{is influenced by the}} works of ABBA and Madonna. In the song, Spears sings <b>about</b> <b>being</b> <b>in</b> love with a bad boy and outlaw, and pleads to her mother to not worry about their relationship. [...] "Criminal" [...] received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising its organic and refreshing feel in comparison {{with the rest of the}} album. After the release of Femme Fatale, the song charted on the South Korean International chart. [...] "Criminal" [...] has also charted in major markets such as Canada, France, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.|$|E
