5|$|Delsener {{presented}} {{the plan to}} Paul Simon {{in the summer of}} 1981. Simon was enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> but questioned whether it could be financially successful, especially given the poor audience attendance of his last project, the autobiographical movie One-Trick Pony. Simon's confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression. He questioned whether he and Art Garfunkel could work together, but contacted Garfunkel, who was vacationing in Switzerland. Garfunkel was excited <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> and immediately returned to the US.|$|E
5|$|Since Darwin was {{enthusiastic}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> Wallace {{asked the}} Entomological Society of London {{to test the}} hypothesis. In response, the entomologist John Jenner Weir conducted experiments with caterpillars and birds in his aviary, and in 1869 he provided the first experimental evidence for warning coloration in animals.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Cornwall County Council and Plymouth City Council {{discussed}} {{the feasibility of}} building a road bridge. The government was unenthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> as {{they did not believe}} it was financially viable and there were more urgent projects in post-war Britain. After being rebuked, both councils agreed to self-fund the entire project, which would be paid for in tolls. The scheme received Royal Assent in July 1957. Invitations to tender were sent on 4 March 1959, and a proposal from the northeast England-based Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company was accepted on 9 June.|$|E

5|$|Quadras, who was {{interested}} in sports, started writing the screenplay for the film in 2011, which took two years to complete. Quadras arranged a meeting with Kom via her manager in the year he started writing the script. Kumar went to Manipur to meet Kom and seek her permission to make the film. Initially, Kom {{was surprised by the}} development as the sport, especially women's boxing, was not well known in India. However, she was enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the film {{originated}} in the 1990s from a conversation in which Prasad joked with Rajamouli <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a fly seeking revenge against a human. Rajamouli reconsidered the idea after finishing Maryada Ramanna (2010), and Prasad developed it into a script. The film's production began on 7 December 2010 at Ramanaidu Studios in Hyderabad. Principal photography began on 22 February 2011 and continued until late February 2012. Makuta VFX and Annapurna Studios oversaw Eega visual effects and digital intermediate process, respectively.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{his mission to}} Muhammad Ali, Montefiore was returning to Europe by way of Constantinople. On October 15, 1840, in the Ottoman capital he {{had a meeting with}} Lord Ponsonby, to whom Montefiore suggested that following the precedent set by Suleiman the Magnificent, the sultan should issue a decree (firman) formally denouncing the blood libel and effectively sealing the cases both in Rhodes and in Damascus. The British ambassador was enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> and within one week he arranged for Montefiore a meeting with Reshid Pasha. Montefiore prepared a draft text of the firman and had its French translation read to Reshid Pasha, who responded encouragingly.|$|E

5|$|After {{multiple}} failures, the Turtle Rock team {{looked for}} a business partner, a company that supported the idea and {{was in need of}} a co-operative shooter to fit into their games lineup. They eventually partnered with THQ for Evolve, which would serve as the game's publisher and help with funding. According to Robb, they had to show the game on their iPad, as they forgot to bring the battery for their laptop. THQ's then president, Danny Bilson and later, Jason Rubin were also excited <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> However, at that time, THQ had already entered financial difficulties, suffering from a severe decline in profits. Turtle Rock also knew that THQ had internal problems, but Turtle Rock decided not to part with THQ.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{build-up}} for the pay-per-view {{began in}} the middle of May, plans were in the works behind the scenes for several months in advance. Tommy Dreamer was in charge of organizing the event and getting ECW Originals to participate. He contacted several people, including The Sandman, Sabu, Justin Credible, and ECW commentator Joey Styles. Reports later stated that Paul Heyman was working with Dreamer to help prepare the event. Other ECW related wrestlers were later added to the pay-per-view. The event was publicly confirmed by WWE through a Dish Network magazine in March 2005. In an interview with SLAM! Sports days before One Night Stand, ECW Original Rob Van Dam announced he had asked Vince McMahon <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of holding an ECW reunion event.|$|E
5|$|Colonial {{rule in the}} Congo {{began in}} the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, {{frustrated}} by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. By the turn of the century, however, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.|$|E
50|$|The panel {{examined}} {{the results of}} 204 studies on reading comprehension instruction. It was evident throughout the grades that teaching students how to think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> in text can improve reading achievement. Particularly powerful in this regard were teaching students to summarize {{the information that they}} had read, or having them ask (and answer) questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas.</b> Additionally, efforts to guide students to monitor their comprehension (essentially paying attention to whether they were understanding during reading and taking some kind of action if they were not), to use their prior knowledge, to visualize the information described in text, or to think <b>about</b> <b>the</b> structure of a text through story mapping, all provided learning benefits to students.|$|R

5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|In August 1968, in an {{interview}} to Rolling Stone, Townsend talked about a new rock opera, which had the working title of Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy, and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages. Who biographer Dave Marsh subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album. Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint. The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> and let him have artistic control over the project.|$|E
5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have {{little interest in the}} subject. However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E

50|$|During the Second World War, Pratt {{worked in}} an {{engineering}} factory in Birmingham that manufactured components for tanks. Working on a drilling machine, {{he found the}} work tedious, but it gave him time to think, including <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> behind Cluedo.|$|R
5|$|Lake {{initially}} thought Microsoft was {{not particularly}} enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea,</b> but had accepted the pitch mainly because of Microsoft's vision of having Xbox One as an entertainment device with rich TV features at that time. However, as the TV show {{was not part of}} Microsoft's project, the closure of Xbox Entertainment Studios did not affect the progress of the TV show production. It was created by Lifeboat Productions, who worked closely with Remedy through Skype conversation and screenplay review. Many scenes had to be shot twice due to the game's alternate content and branching nature. Three writers from Remedy also contributed to the TV show content.|$|E
5|$|Newman {{himself had}} been {{regarded}} as a possible terrorist abduction target during the October Crisis, and armed guards had patrolled {{the headquarters of the}} NFB. Newman was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of releasing films with Quebec nationalist themes, such as Groulx's 24 heures ou plus, at such a tense political time, worried about what the Canadian public would think. Although it was Newman's deputy André Lamy who in some cases drew the monolingual Newman's attention to the controversial nature of French language productions, it was Lamy himself who later permitted the release of some of these same films after he succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner.|$|E

5|$|Sport England {{wished to}} avoid {{creating}} a white elephant, so they {{insisted that the}} City Council agree to undertake and fund extensive work to convert CoMS from a track and field arena to a football stadium, thereby ensuring its long-term financial viability. Sport England hoped either Manchester City Council or Manchester City F.C. would provide the extra £50 million required to convert the stadium to a 65,000 seater athletics and footballing venue with movable seating. However, Manchester City Council {{did not have the}} money to facilitate movable seating and Manchester City were lukewarm <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> Stadium architects Arup Sport believed history demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football – and cited examples such as the Stadio delle Alpi and the Olympic Stadium with both Juventus and Bayern Munich moving to new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{had formed}} a number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They {{believed}} that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because {{they believed that the}} freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.|$|E
