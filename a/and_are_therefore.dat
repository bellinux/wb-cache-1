5|$|Correct as of 2016–17 NK Maribor season. For {{the season}} in {{progress}} see 2017–18 NK Maribor season. Top scorer's goal tallies are for league goals only. Due to differences in the competition's structure over time, NK Maribor competed in both the Yugoslav Cup and the Slovenian Cup, performances cannot easily be compared, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> not available for sorting.|$|E
5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological {{and physiological}} changes. An advantage of inducible, as opposed to constitutive defenses, {{is that they are}} only produced when needed, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> potentially less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E
5|$|Lenis {{stops in}} Wagiman sound like English voiced stops <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> written using the Roman {{alphabet}} letters b, d and g. Fortis stops, however, sound more like voiceless stops in English, but are slightly longer than lenis stops. They are written with two voiceless letters, pp, tt and kk when they occur between two vowels.|$|E
50|$|Italian is a Romance language, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> a {{descendant}} of Vulgar Latin (the spoken form of non-classical Latin). Standard Italian is based on Tuscan, especially its Florentine dialect, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> an Italo-Dalmatian language, to which Sicilian and the extinct Dalmatian also belong, among a few others.|$|R
50|$|Sodium {{ethoxide}} is {{a strong}} base, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> corrosive.|$|R
5000|$|There is no pneumococcal capsule (<b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> not typable).|$|R
5|$|Old {{styles are}} {{considered}} slow, well-pronounced and dignified like the Maguindanao’s kamamatuan and the Maranao’s andung. Genres classified under this style have moderate tempos, are rhythmically oriented, balanced, lack many improvisations {{and are usually}} played by the older folks <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> always played first, to give due respect to the older generation.|$|E
5|$|The {{multiple}} {{side chains}} of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions. The types of these reactions {{are determined by}} the groups on these side chains <b>and</b> <b>are,</b> <b>therefore,</b> different between the various types of amino acid.|$|E
5|$|Warner Home Video {{released}} a complete series collection on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012. The collection does not feature the extra deleted scenes and jokes that were included on prior DVD releases, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> presented in their NBC broadcast versions.|$|E
50|$|D3 {{coincides with}} A3, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> not a {{distinct}} root system.|$|R
50|$|Ginsburg's {{translation}} {{was from}} a censored Soviet text <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> incomplete.|$|R
50|$|Riociguat {{can cause}} fetal harm <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> {{contraindicated}} in pregnant women.|$|R
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} have odd atomic numbers; hence, their {{isotopes}} must be either odd–odd (both proton and neutron number are odd) or odd–even (proton number is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable {{with respect to}} beta decay, because the decay products are even–even, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> more strongly bound, due to nuclear pairing effects.|$|E
5|$|At ambient {{conditions}} bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms of arsenic and antimony, crystallizing in the rhombohedral lattice (Pearson symbol hR6, space group Rm No. 166), {{which is often}} classed into trigonal or hexagonal crystal systems. When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure changes first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the body-centered cubic Bi-IV at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical conductivity; they are rather reproducible and abrupt, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> used for calibration of high-pressure equipment.|$|E

5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other {{members of the same}} genus include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E
5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today. These joints and fracture systems do not move, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> not faults. Spacing between joints {{is controlled by the}} amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to create a more resistant rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.|$|E
5|$|Frequently used topical retinoids include adapalene, isotretinoin, retinol, tazarotene, and tretinoin. They often {{cause an}} initial {{flare-up}} of acne and facial flushing, {{and can cause}} significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more. Tazarotene {{is the most effective}} and expensive topical retinoid, but is not as well-tolerated. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects, and is used in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} way {{to compute}} H∞ feedback controllers uses algebraic Riccati equations <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> of limited applicability. Here {{we present a}} new approach to the H∞ output feedback control design problem, which is based on nonlinear and nonsmooth mathematical programming techniques. Our approach avoids the use of Lyapunov variables, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> flexible in many practical situations...|$|R

5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat {{occupies}} limestone caves along rivers within dry evergreen or deciduous forests. In Thailand, Kitti's hog-nosed bat {{is restricted}} to a small region of the Tenasserim Hills in Sai Yok District, Kanchanaburi Province, within the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River. While Sai Yok National Park in the Dawna Hills contains much of the bat's range, some Thai populations occur outside the park <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> unprotected.|$|E
5|$|Other sites {{show more}} circumstantial {{evidence}} of mammoth hunting, such as piled bones bearing butcher marks. Some {{of these sites}} are not closely associated with Clovis points. The Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site and the Dent Site, where multiple juvenile and adult mammoths have been found with butcher marks and in association with Clovis points, were once interpreted as the killing of entire herds by Clovis hunters. However, isotope {{studies have shown that}} the accumulations represent individual deaths at different seasons of the year, and therefore not herds killed in single incidents. Many other such assemblages of bones with butcher marks may also represent accumulations over time, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> ambiguous as evidence for large scale hunting.|$|E
5|$|Palliative care is {{specialized}} {{medical care}} for people with serious illnesses, including Parkinson's. The goal of this speciality is to improve {{quality of life for}} both the person suffering from Parkinson's and the family by providing relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of illnesses. As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> palliative in nature.|$|E

5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords {{was awarded}} to 46 of the 328 Oak Leaves {{recipients}} of 1944. Out of these 46 presentations, Veit Scherzer disputed eight of them for reasons associated to the deteriorating situation of the Third Reich during {{the final days of}} World War II. The sequential numbers greater than 143 for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords are unofficial and were assigned by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR) <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> denoted in parentheses. The recipients are ordered and numbered chronologically. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves was awarded.|$|E
5|$|The high plains {{found on}} Triton's eastern hemisphere, such as Cipango Planum, cover over and blot out older features, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> almost {{certainly}} {{the result of}} icy lava washing over the previous landscape. The plains are dotted with pits, such as Leviathan Patera, which are probably the vents from which this lava emerged. The composition of the lava is unknown, although a mixture of ammonia and water is suspected.|$|E
5|$|The larval {{stages of}} B. rufimanus occur inside the seeds, <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>therefore</b> {{protected}} from any control measures, including chemical control. Bruchus rufimanus is most vulnerable at the adult stage. Most control measures have therefore targeted adults either at colonization {{stage in the}} field or at emergence in storage facilities. Control measures have been focused on direct control with insecticides, but restrictions and removal from market due to environmental concerns have increased the need for alternative measures.|$|E
