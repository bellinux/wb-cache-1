5|$|The novella {{is divided}} into 29 {{chapters}} with introduction, notes, and <b>acknowledgments</b> sections. Structured similarly to a classical Greek drama, the storytelling alternates between Penelope's narrative and the choral commentary of the twelve maids. Penelope narrates 18 chapters with the Chorus contributing 11 chapters dispersed throughout the book. The Chorus uses a new narrative style in each of their chapters, beginning with a jump-rope rhyme and ending in a 17-line iambic dimeter poem. Other narrative styles used by the Chorus include a lament, a folk song, an idyll, a sea shanty, a ballad, a drama, an anthropology lecture, a court trial, and a love song.|$|E

5|$|The book {{consists}} of five chapters, {{from which the}} five lectures were derived: Context, Pandemic, Education, Women, and Solutions. Before these chapters are sections titled Preface and <b>Acknowledgments,</b> and afterwards a Glossary section. The book's second edition contains an Afterword section written in May 2006. In the Preface, written by Lewis in August 2005, he states that his preferred genre is the spoken word and {{that the nature of}} the topic would not allow him to comprehensively cover every aspect. He justifies his writing by proclaiming himself a devotee to the United Nations and outlines the roles he has held with the organization since 1984. In the first chapter, Lewis tells anecdotes of visits to Africa and other UN-related events like, in 1986, brokering the resolutions from the General Assembly's 13th Special Session. He acknowledges colonialism and Cold War ideologues as historical influences on the African situation, but focuses on the effects of international finance institutions' conditional loans since the late 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Three studies {{investigated}} {{the capacity of}} negative <b>acknowledgment,</b> the admission of an unfavorable quality, to elicit relatively positive responses.

40|$|Following ostracism, {{individuals}} are highly sensitive to social cues. Here we investigate whether and when minimal <b>acknowledgment</b> can improve need satisfaction following an ostracism experience. In four studies, participants were either ostracized during Cyberball (Studies 1 and 2) {{or through a}} novel apartment-application paradigm (Studies 3 and 4). To signal acknowledgement following ostracism, participants were either thrown a ball a few times {{at the end of}} the Cyberball game, or received a message that was either friendly, neutral, or hostile in the apartment-application paradigm. Both forms of <b>acknowledgment</b> increased need satisfaction, even when the <b>acknowledgment</b> was hostile (Study 4), emphasizing the beneficial effect of any kind of <b>acknowledgment</b> following ostracism. Reinclusion buffered threat immediately, whereas <b>acknowledgment</b> without reinclusion primarily aided recovery. Our results suggest that minimal <b>acknowledgment</b> such as a few ball throws or even an unfriendly message can reduce the sting of ostracism...|$|R

40|$|A {{selective}} <b>acknowledgment</b> (SACK) mechanism, {{combined with}} a selective repeat retransmission policy, has been proposed to overcome the limitations with the cumulative <b>acknowledgment</b> scheme in TCP. With the SACK mechanism, the receiver informs the sender about the noncontiguous blocks of data that have been received and queued. However, for each such noncontiguous block, SACK requires 8 bytes to convey {{the information to the}} sender. Since TCP options field has a fixed length, an <b>acknowledgment</b> packet, at the maximum, can carry information about only 4 noncontiguous blocks. Under some error conditions, this limitation can cause the TCP sender to retransmit packets that have already been received successfully by the receiver. In this paper, we propose an improved selective <b>acknowledgment</b> (ISACK) scheme to overcome the limitations of the current selective <b>acknowledgment</b> scheme. Using examples, we demonstrate how the proposed scheme works. We further propose an adaptive selective <b>acknowledgment</b> (ASACK) strategy that dynamically switches between SACK and ISACK to give optimal performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} the <b>acknowledgment</b> procedures used at {{radio link control}} level in General Packet Radio Service (GPRS). The GPRS is a new GSM service, which is currently being standardized by ETSI for GSM Phase 2 C and it provides packet switched data services over GSM network resources. The role of <b>acknowledgment</b> procedures is to assure the delivery of packets on GPRS radio interface. This paper gives {{a brief description of}} GPRS radio interface with a special attention to the Radio Link Control and Medium Access Control (RLC/MAC) layer procedures. Particularly, the <b>acknowledgment</b> parameters and operations are described and their performance is evaluated. The delay introduced by <b>acknowledgment</b> procedures is studied analytically. In order to ameliorate the performance of RLC <b>acknowledgment</b> mechanism, we propose and describe a new additional hybrid FEC/ARQ mechanism, which can operate with the current one. The purpose of new mechanism is to decrease the number of control blocks used for RLC <b>acknowledgment</b> mechanism and thus reduces the delay requested for a packet delivery. After presenting the channel models used, we evaluate by simu-lation the performance of <b>acknowledgment</b> procedures presented in ETSI specifications and the proposed one over a stationary channel model and over a noisy wireless channel model affected by burst of errors...|$|R

25|$|In TFTP, a {{transfer}} is {{initiated by the}} client issuing a request to read or write a particular file on the server. The request can optionally include a set of negotiated transfer parameters proposed by the client under the terms specified by RFC 2347. If the server grants the request, the file is sent in fixed length blocks of 512 bytes by default or the number specified in the blocksize negotiated option defined by RFC 2348. Each block of transferred data which is usually carried within a single IP packet {{in order to avoid}} IP fragmentation, must be acknowledged by an acknowledgment packet before the next block can be sent. A data packet of less than 512 bytes or the agreed blocksize option signals termination of {{a transfer}}. If a packet gets lost in the network, the intended recipient will timeout and may retransmit their last packet (which may be data or an acknowledgment), thus causing the sender of the lost packet to retransmit that lost packet. The sender has to keep just one packet on hand for retransmission, since the lock step acknowledgment guarantees that all older packets have been correctly received. Notice that both devices involved in a transfer are considered senders and receivers. One sends data and receives <b>acknowledgments,</b> the other sends <b>acknowledgments</b> and receives data.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that approximately half of the women who have experiences which are consistent with legal descriptions of rape do not identify themselves as having experienced a rape. A model of sexual assault/rape <b>acknowledgment</b> was proposed, which attempts to integrate previous research in the area which suggests that the circumstances of the assault (i. e., relationship with the assailant, resistance and force), perceptions of significant others' and societal attitudes towards rape, attributions of blame, disclosure, unsupportive behavior from others, posttraumatic stress symptomatology, and posttraumatic growth may be important in terms of understanding <b>acknowledgment.</b> Path analysis was used to test this model as applied to sexual assault <b>acknowledgment.</b> The final sample consisted of 238 university women who had experiences consistent with legal definitions of sexual assault. This sample was obtained after screening 2552 female students based on their previous unwanted sexual experiences. The proposed model received partial support and a better fitting model was derived. Contrary to expectations, sexual assault <b>acknowledgment</b> was not associated with greater posttraumatic growth, as posttraumatic stress accounted for the observed relationship between sexual assault <b>acknowledgment</b> and posttraumatic growth. Thus, {{the results of this study}} contradict clinical and feminist literature, which suggests that <b>acknowledgment</b> is necessary in order to facilitate growth following a sexual trauma. More forceful assaults, greater perpetrator blame, more posttraumatic stress symptomatology, less negative perceptions of significant others' attitudes towards rape, and more negative perceptions of societal attitudes towards rape were all directly related to greater sexual assault <b>acknowledgment.</b> The relationship with the perpetrator, self blame, resistance, and unsupportive behavior were indirectly related to sexual assault <b>acknowledgment.</b> As expected, women who had experiences which were consistent with legal definitions of rape/sexual assault were more likely to use the term "sexual assault" rather than the term "rape" to describe their forced sexual experience. This study illustrates the complexity of the process of sexual assault <b>acknowledgment,</b> as there are many possible paths to <b>acknowledgment.</b> The results are discussed in terms of sexual assault reporting, clinical applications, and theoretical issues...|$|R

25|$|The {{defeat of}} Grattan's mild {{proposals}} helped to promote more extreme opinions, which, under growing influence from France, were now making inroads in Ireland. The Catholic question {{had come to}} the fore, and when a powerful section of the Whigs joined Pitt's ministry in 1794, Lord Fitzwilliam, who shared Grattan's views, was appointed Viceroy, expectations for further Catholic relief were raised. That may have been Pitt's intention, {{but it is not clear}} how far Lord Fitzwilliam had been authorised to pledge the government. Fitzwilliam privately asked Grattan to propose a Bill for Catholic emancipation, promising British government support. It appeared, however that the Viceroy had either misunderstood or exceeded his instructions; on 19 February 1795, Fitzwilliam was recalled. In the outburst of indignation, followed by increasing disaffection which this produced in Ireland, Grattan acted with conspicuous moderation and loyalty.

25|$|In the book, Menzies {{concludes that}} only China had the time, money, {{manpower}} and leadership to send such expeditions and then {{sets out to}} prove that the Chinese visited lands unknown in either China or Europe. He claims that from 1421 to 1423, during the Ming dynasty of China under the Yongle Emperor, the fleets of Admiral Zheng He, commanded by the captains Zhou Wen, Zhou Man, Yang Qing, and Hong Bao, discovered Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, Antarctica, and the Northeast Passage; circumnavigated Greenland, tried to reach the North and South Poles, and circumnavigated the world before Ferdinand Magellan. The book has been published in many languages and countries around the world and was listed as a New York Times best seller for several weeks in 2003. Although the book contains numerous footnotes, references and <b>acknowledgments,</b> critics point out that it lacks supporting references for Chinese voyages beyond East Africa, the location acknowledged by professional historians as the limit of the fleet's travels.
