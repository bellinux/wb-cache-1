5|$|On the November 19, 1999, {{episode of}} Millionaire, Carpenter {{proceeded}} {{to advance to}} the million-dollar question without using any lifelines. He then used his Phone-A-Friend to call his father not for help, but rather to tell him he was going to win the game. Carpenter <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> correctly and became the show's first millionaire. His win gave him national recognition and led to multiple talk show appearances, as well as reappearances on Millionaire itself.|$|E
5|$|The episodes {{featured}} {{game play}} {{based on the}} previous rule set of the syndicated version (including the rule changes implemented in season seven) but used the Fastest Finger round to select contestants. Various celebrities also made special guest appearances {{at the end of}} every episode; each guest played one question for a chance at $50,000 for a charity of their choice, being allowed to use any one of the four lifelines in place at the time (Phone-a-Friend, Ask the Audience, Double Dip, and Ask the Expert), but still earned a minimum of $25,000 for the charity if they <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> incorrectly.|$|E
5|$|When Maxwell {{concluded}} his argument, ex-Governor Bradley {{spoke on}} Taylor's behalf. After reiterating Taylor's legal {{claim to the}} office of governor, he <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of jurisdiction by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar case in which the court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including insufficient time given for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. Following Bradley's argument, the court recessed until May 14, 1900.|$|E

5000|$|Along the way, {{the player}} can be {{assisted}} by a [...] "classmate", {{one of five}} ten-year-old children, in <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> <b>The</b> classmate, chosen for two questions at a time, attempts to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> at <b>the</b> {{same time as the}} contestant, writing their answer on a virtual blackboard hidden from the contestant's view. The player picks a child to come and stand on the podium beside them and they <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> at <b>the</b> same time as the adult.

25|$|That Al Al-Sheikh <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> about {{government}} influence over fatwas so openly {{is a clear}} indicator that the public has growing concerns about the legitimacy of religious leaders. Also, that the statements were reprinted in the press signals that the Saudi government -- which wields enormous influence over the local press -- is moving {{to respond to the}} charges of undue influence and corruption and illegitimacy.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} segment {{was introduced}} in Season 2. It consists of Lizzy Lovette and later Sally Stanton giving a brief report on a particular topic. Teams are asked a 10-point buzz-in question on the topic {{to make sure they}} were listening. Initially the team who correctly <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> also won the right to be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked out in the next question. Should this happen, another question would be asked by Reeve for the remaining teams.|$|E
25|$|Although the Royal Navy {{suffered}} from many morale issues, it <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of prize money via the 'Cruizers and Convoys' Act of 1708 which {{handed over the}} share previously gained by the Crown to the captors of the ship. Technically it was still possible for the Crown {{to get the money}} or a portion of it but this rarely happened. The process of condemnation of a captured vessel and its cargo and men was given to the High Court of the Admiralty and this was the process which remained in force with minor changes throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

In her time in prison during legal proceedings, she is quickly becoming insane, planning one tea shop after another. Mr Entwhistle and Hercule Poirot suspect her punishment might be served in Broadmoor, but have no doubt she had plotted and carried out the cold blooded murder in full possession of her faculties – this ladylike murderer.|$|E
25|$|Jennings was a {{contestant}} on {{an episode}} of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? that aired on October 10, 2008, which held the possibility of exceeding Rutter's total game show winnings. After winning $500,000, enough to surpass Rutter's total, Jennings chose not to attempt the final $1,000,000 question, which would have deducted $475,000 from his winnings if he missed it. As is customary on the show, Jennings was then shown the question {{to see what would}} have happened, and he provided the correct answer. Had he risked his winnings and correctly <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> he would have become the show's second $1,000,000 winner.|$|E
25|$|Virgil's {{contemporary}} Horace wrote {{often of}} wine, though no single work is devoted {{entirely to the}} subject. He espoused an Epicurean view of taking life's pleasures, including wine, in moderation. Among the earliest recorded examples of deliberately choosing a wine for a specific occasion, Horace's Odes included serving a wine from the birth-year vintage at a celebration of an honored guest. He writes of serving simple wines for everyday occasions and saving celebrated wines such as Caecuban for special events. Horace <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> posed by the Alexandrian poet Callimachus as to whether water or wine was the preferred drink of poetic inspiration by enthusiastically siding with Cratinus and the wine drinkers. His affinity for wine was such that while contemplating his death, he expressed more dread {{at the thought of}} departing from his beloved wine cellar than his wife.|$|E

25|$|In 2001-2002, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) {{conducted}} the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcoholism and Related Conditions (NESARC). Similarly structured to the NLAES, the survey conducted in-person interviews with 43,093 individuals. This time, {{respondents were asked}} if they had ever attended a 12-step meeting for an alcohol problem in their lifetime (the question was not AA-specific). 1441 (3.4%) of respondents <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> affirmatively. Answers were further broken down into three categories: disengaged, those who started attending {{at some point in the}} past but had ceased attending at some point in the past year (988); continued engagement, those who started attending at some point in the past and continued to attend during the past year (348); and newcomers, those who started attending during the past year (105). In their discussion of the findings, Kaskautas et al. (2008) state that to study disengagement, only the disengaged and continued engagement should be utilized (pg. 270).|$|E
25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E

[...] One involves moment of inertia parameters, the other involves seismic observations. [...] In the case of the former, Karunatillake points out that the moment of inertia parameters indicate that the core of the moon is both dense and small, with the rest of the moon consisting of material with nearly-constant density. [...] As for the latter, he notes that the moon is the only planetary body besides Earth on which extensive seismic observations have been made. [...] These observations have constrained the thickness of the moon's crust, mantle and core, suggesting it could not be hollow.|$|E

500|$|In February 1855, {{while working}} in Sarawak {{on the island of}} Borneo, Wallace wrote [...] "On the Law which has Regulated the Introduction of New Species", a paper which was {{published}} in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History in September 1855. In this paper, he discussed observations regarding the geographic and geologic distribution of both living and fossil species, what would become known as biogeography. His conclusion that [...] "Every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a closely allied species" [...] {{has come to be known}} as the [...] "Sarawak Law". Wallace thus <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> he had posed in his earlier paper on the monkeys of the Amazon river basin. Although it contained no mention of any possible mechanisms for evolution, this paper foreshadowed the momentous paper he would write three years later.|$|E
500|$|... "What if" [...] episodes {{were another}} Millar-Gough concept used to {{generate}} first season storylines. These episodes posed underlying questions about Clark. Episodes would evolve from basic questions, including: [...] "what if someone {{had a crush on}} Lana, and acted on that obsession"; [...] "what if someone found out Clark's secret"; [...] "what if someone else had Clark's powers?" [...] These three questions developed into the episodes [...] "Metamorphosis", [...] "Rogue", and [...] "Leech", respectively. [...] "Stray", episode 16, <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "what if Clark had been adopted by the wrong parents and his powers were exploited?" [...] "X-Ray" [...] director Mark Verheiden {{and the rest of the}} crew realized divergent, unrelated storylines were not the best way to create episodes for Smallville.

500|$|At {{around the}} same time, Calgary radio evangelist William Aberhart began to preach a new {{economic}} theory called social credit. [...] Though the theory required control of monetary policy, a federal responsibility, it became increasingly popular among former UFA supporters who, following Aberhart's instructions, began to form local social credit [...] "study groups". [...] Brownlee argued against social credit {{on the basis that}} its application by a provincial government would be unconstitutional and that it would do nothing to create markets for Alberta's unsold wheat, which he viewed as the source of Alberta's woes. [...] The legislature held a series of hearings to investigate the theory, and both Aberhart and C. H. Douglas, the theory's originator, testified at them. [...] Brownlee questioned both on how the introduction of [...] "credit certificates" [...] issued by the Alberta government could help people so heavily dependent on interprovincial and international trade; neither <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> to his satisfaction.|$|E
