The Thule people were more technologically advanced than their Dorset predecessors, although they still relied on subsistence hunting, with walruses, reindeer, and particularly the fur seals constituting the base of the economy in the early period.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} the Solar System began 4.6billion years <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> gravitational collapse of {{a small part of}} a giant molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the NCVP can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 20 million years <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{emplacement}} of alkali basalt in western Yukon. Several types of volcanic eruptions have since created different landforms across the NCVP, including shield volcanoes, lava domes, stratovolcanoes and cinder cones. Other volcanic formations, notably subglacial volcanoes, take their shape from the environment they formed in regardless of what magma type they produced. The NCVP contains over 100 volcanoes and is the most volcanically active area in Canada, with eruptions expected to occur roughly every 100 years.|$|E

5|$|Magmatism in the Anahim Volcanic Belt can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 10–14million years <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{emplacement}} of dike swarms and plutons as well as the eruption of rhyolite flows and breccias on the British Columbia Coast. The slow continuous westward motion of the North American Plate during the late Neogene positioned the Anahim hotspot further east at the Chilcotin Plateau where volcanic activity built the Rainbow Range shield volcano 8.7to 6.7million years ago. Volcanism then shifted eastwards, in displacement contrary with the North American Plate's movement, 6.1million years ago to construct the Ilgachuz Range shield volcano, which became extinct 2.1million years later. Renewed volcanic activity southeast of the Ilgachuz Range starting 3.5million years ago {{led to the creation of}} the Itcha Range, the youngest of the three Anahim shield volcanoes. The Itcha Range continued to be an area of Anahim hotspot volcanism well into the Quaternary period (2.58million years ago to present).|$|E
5|$|Taiwanese aborigines are Austronesian peoples, with {{linguistic}} and genetic ties to other Austronesian ethnic groups, such as {{peoples of the}} Philippines, Malaysia, Madagascar and Oceania. Chipped-pebble tools dating from perhaps as early as 15,000 years ago suggest that the initial human inhabitants of Taiwan were Paleolithic cultures of the Pleistocene era. These people survived by eating marine life. Archaeological evidence points to an abrupt change to the Neolithic era around 6,000years <b>ago,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advent of agriculture, domestic animals, polished stone adzes and pottery. The stone adzes were mass-produced on Penghu and nearby islands, from the volcanic rock found there. This suggests heavy sea traffic took place between these islands and Taiwan at this time.|$|E
5|$|The lion's closest {{relatives}} {{are the other}} species of the genus Panthera: the tiger, the snow leopard, the jaguar, and the leopard. Studies from 2006 and 2009 concluded that the jaguar is a sister species to the lion and the leopard is a sister taxon to the jaguar/lion clade while 2010 and 2011 studies have swapped the positions leopard and jaguar. P. leo evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the Holarctic region. It appeared in the fossil record in Europe {{for the first time}} 700,000 years <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> subspecies Panthera leo fossilis at Isernia in Italy. From this lion derived the later cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), which appeared about 300,000 years ago. Lions died out in northern Eurasia {{at the end of the}} last glaciation, about 10,000 years ago; this may have been secondary to the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna.|$|E

5|$|The massif {{is about}} 15million years old, with {{volcanism}} continuing up until geologically recent times. Three constructive stages {{have been identified}} at Level Mountain. The first stage commenced 14.9million years <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> eruption of voluminous lava flows. These lavas assembled to create a large shield volcano. The second stage began 7.1million years ago to form a complex stratovolcano located centrally atop the shield. A series of lava domes were established during the third stage, which started 4.5million years ago. Renewed activity might {{have occurred in the}} last 11,000years. A wide range of rock types were produced during the long volcanic history of Level Mountain, of which alkali basalts and ankaramites are the most common. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity.|$|E
