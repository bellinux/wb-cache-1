2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God heard their grumbling, {{and in the}} evening quail covered the camp, {{and in the morning}} fine flaky manna covered the ground like frost. The Israelites {{gathered}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> they required; those who gathered much had no excess, and those who gathered little had no deficiency. Moses instructed none to leave any of it over until morning, but some did, and it became infested with maggots and stank. On the sixth day they gathered double the food, Moses instructed them to put aside the excess until morning, and it did not turn foul the next day, the Sabbath. Moses told them that on the Sabbath, they would not find any manna on the plain, yet some went out to gather and found nothing. A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|The Protestant Reformation {{during the}} 16th century in Europe almost entirely {{rejected}} the existing tradition of Catholic art, {{and very often}} destroyed <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> it could reach. [...] A new artistic tradition developed, producing far smaller quantities of art that followed Protestant agendas and diverged drastically from the southern European tradition and the humanist art produced during the High Renaissance. [...] In turn, the Catholic Counter-Reformation both reacted against and responded to Protestant criticisms of art in Roman Catholicism to produce a more stringent style of Catholic art. [...] Protestant religious art both embraced Protestant values and assisted in the proliferation of Protestantism, but the amount of religious art produced in Protestant countries was hugely reduced. [...] Artists in Protestant countries diversified into secular forms of art like history painting, landscape painting, portrait painting and still life.|$|E

2500|$|Historians Victor Davis Hanson and Donald Kagan {{have argued}} that Epaminondas' {{so-called}} [...] "oblique formation" [...] was not an intentional and preconceived innovation in infantry tactics, but was rather a clever response to circumstances. [...] Because Epaminondas had stacked his left wing {{to a depth of}} fifty shields, the rest of his units were naturally left with far fewer troops than normal. [...] This means that their maintenance of a depth of eight to twelve shields had to {{come at the expense of}} either number of companies or their width. [...] Because Epaminondas was already outnumbered, he had no choice but to form fewer companies and march them diagonally toward the much longer Spartan line in order to engage <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> possible. [...] Hanson and Kagan's argument is therefore that the tactic was more dilatory than anything else. [...] Whatever its motivation, the fact remains that the tactic did represent an innovation and was undoubtedly highly effective.|$|E
2500|$|The Crow People {{are well}} known for their intercut beadwork. They adorned {{basically}} every aspect of their lives with these beads, giving special attention to ceremonial and ornamental items. Their clothing, horses, cradles, ornamental and ceremonial gear, in addition to leather cases of all shapes, sizes and uses were decorated in beadwork. They gave reverence to the animals they ate by using <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> they could. [...] The leather for their clothing, robes and pouches were created from the skin of buffalo, deer and elk. The work {{was done by the}} tribeswomen, with some being considered experts and were often sought by the younger, less experienced women for design and symbolic advice. The Crow are an innovative people and are credited with developing their own style of stitch-work for adhering beads. [...] This stitch, which is contemporarily called the over-lay, is still also known as the [...] "Crow Stitch". In their beadwork, geometric shapes were primarily used with triangles, diamonds and hour-glass structures being the most prevalent. A wide range of colors were utilized by the Crow, but blues and various shades of pink were the most dominantly used. [...] To intensify or to draw out a certain color or shape, they would surround that figure or color in a white outline.|$|E
2500|$|Because God is [...] "an {{absolutely}} perfect being" [...] (I), Leibniz {{argues that}} God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection {{than what he}} is able of (III). His syllogism then ends {{with the statement that}} God has made the world perfectly in all ways. This also effects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God’s will, {{we have to understand that}} God [...] "is the best of all masters" [...] and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will – or <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> we understand (IV). In our view of God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so. Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). Effectively, Leibniz states that if we say the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II). Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.|$|E
