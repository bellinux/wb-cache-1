5|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} conducted from 2001 to 2005 {{revealed the}} presence of water ice as well as frozen carbon dioxide {{on the surface of}} Titania, which in turn suggested that the moon may have a tenuous carbon dioxide atmosphere with a surface pressure of about 10 nanopascals (10−13 bar). Measurements during Titania's occultation of a star put an upper limit on the surface pressure of any possible <b>atmosphere</b> <b>at</b> 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar).|$|E
5|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} for such a past resonance is Miranda's unusually high orbital inclination (4.34°) for a body {{so close to the}} planet. The largest Uranian moons may be internally differentiated, with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles. Titania and Oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the core/mantle boundary. The major moons of Uranus are airless bodies. For instance, Titania was shown to possess no <b>atmosphere</b> <b>at</b> a pressure larger than 10–20nanobar.|$|E

5|$|The {{incomplete}} combustion {{of fossil}} fuels (such as diesel) and wood releases black carbon into the air. Though black carbon, most of which is soot, is an extremely small component of air pollution at land surface levels, the phenomenon has a significant heating effect on the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>at</b> altitudes above two kilometers (6,562ft). Also, it dims {{the surface of the}} ocean by absorbing solar radiation.|$|E
5|$|Triton {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} be geologically active (the others being Jupiter's Io and Saturn's Enceladus). As a consequence, its surface is {{relatively}} young with few obvious impact craters, and a complex geological history revealed in intricate cryovolcanic and tectonic terrains.

5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable <b>atmosphere</b> <b>at</b> the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E

5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the <b>atmosphere.</b> <b>At</b> {{a point where the}} bulk density of the column {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and start moving laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal <b>atmosphere</b> <b>at</b> lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} {{when he came}} to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. George wanted to move into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to move into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>at</b> the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds.
