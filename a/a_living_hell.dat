25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2002, Bajević {{returned}} to AEK. Fans were bitterly divided among those who accepted him and those who couldn't forgive his defection to Olympiacos. The latter made his life <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b> In the 2002–03 Champions League, AEK became {{the first and only}} team to collect six ties out of six games in the group phase and ended up at third position. A notable match was the 3–3 draw against reigning European champions Real Madrid at the Nikos Goumas Stadium and another 2–2 draw against Real Madrid coming back from 2–0 down at the Bernabeu in Madrid.|$|E

The Commandant awards Lisa a special medal [...] "For Satisfactory Completion of the Second Grade".|$|E
2500|$|Despite breathless {{speculation}} {{then and}} {{later that the}} Communist mobilizing slogan [...] "Self-Determination for the Black Belt" [...] was a call for national secession, Allen later claimed that [...] "we weren't stupid." [...] For all the brashness of the [...] "self-determination" [...] slogan, historian Mark Solomon believed the actual meaning of the phrase was rather more modest: [...] Self-determination was defined as democracy at its essence: self-government, self-organization, social and economic equality, the right of blacks to run their own lives without the relentless terror and racism that dogged their steps and made every waking day <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b>|$|E
50|$|A tragic love {{triangle}} surrounding Angela, {{played by}} Patricia Javier, and her husband, David, played by Joseph Will. Angela and David's happy marriage is turned into <b>a</b> not so <b>living</b> <b>hell</b> when {{their lives are}} shattered by Angela's new friend.|$|R
50|$|The {{difficulty}} of homosexual life in Rome, particularly {{the requirements of}} secrecy and clandestinity of the love act, is a staple of Bellezza's poetic and prosaic writing. In Bellezza's first novel, L'innocenza (Innocence, 1971), Nino, the protagonist, consciously chooses the perdition and corruption of <b>a</b> <b>living</b> homosexual <b>hell.</b> In Bellezza's infernal world, homosexuality can be nothing else but prostitution and neurotically masochistic obsessions: in Lettere da Sodoma (Letters from Sodom, 1972), his conclusion is that everything is Hell {{and that the only}} salvation is the systematic refusal of the self.|$|R
50|$|Thus far, Mammon {{has made}} Spawn's life <b>a</b> truly <b>living</b> <b>Hell.</b> He is {{probably}} the brains behind the scheme to unleash Urizen, which leads to Spawn destroying Malebolgia. Mammon was alive during the time Urizen was first contained, while Malebolgia was only created 70,000 years prior to his second coming. Additionally, he orchestrates the plot to give Cog the means and opportunity to betray Spawn and seize control of the 8th Sphere of Hell. He is the stranger who tells Eddie Frank of redemption, which leads to Eddie becoming The Redeemer and beating Spawn badly enough {{that he could be}} dragged into Hell. He reveals the truth about Eddie's father to him to destroy his faith, weaken his powers and halt his attack while his minions capture Spawn. He sends Violator to Earth to take over Jason Wynn's body in order to break Spawn physically and mentally. Mammon personally takes the soul of Nyx's friend Thea to use as leverage later on to make Nyx betray Spawn by stealing his costume and going into Hell. While he is incapacitated she dons the K7-Leetha. This {{is part of a larger}} plan to gain Nyx's powers. He approaches her prior to her betrayal and tries to bargain with her. He also tells her about Thea's soul being in Hell.|$|R
2500|$|Much {{had to be}} {{done before}} the Leningrad première could take place. The Leningrad Radio Orchestra under Karl Eliasberg was the only {{remaining}} symphonic ensemble. The orchestra had survived—barely—but it had not been playing and musical broadcasts had ceased. Music was not considered a priority by Party officials. Political appeals took {{a significant part of the}} broadcast time. Even then, there were hours of silence because of the lack of agitators. As for the city itself, Leningrad surrounded by the Nazis had become <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>hell,</b> with eyewitness reports of people who had died of cold and starvation lying in doorways in stairwells. [...] "They lay there because people dropped them there, the way newborn infants used to be left. Janitors swept them away in the morning like rubbish. Funerals, graves, coffins were long forgotten. It was a flood of death that could not be managed. Entire families vanished, entire apartments with their collective families. Houses, streets and neighborhoods vanished." ...|$|E
2500|$|After that, DX {{remained}} unseen {{and largely}} unmentioned until Shawn Michaels returned to WWE in 2002. With {{the acquisition of}} Triple H being persuaded by Michaels, and then Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff to sign a contract to join Raw {{as part of the}} [...] "Brand Extension" [...] at Vengeance. The following night on the July 22 episode of Raw at Shawn Michaels' 37th birthday, a week after the breakup of the nWo, Triple H handed Michaels a DX T-shirt and stated he [...] "had an idea", suggesting that the two reform the group and make Eric Bischoff's life <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b> The duo later came out that night to their old music and crotch chops, and pyro to the delight of the crowd. However, Triple H turned on Shawn Michaels that same night; he had teased the reunion as a ploy to appease Michaels and lure him to the ring before giving him a Pedigree, making Triple H a villain once again. This act led to the in-ring return of Michaels at SummerSlam and was the genesis of a long feud between the two that ended with a Triple H victory during a Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|With his {{ownership}} reinstated, McMahon {{shifted his}} sights to, then babyface, Test, who was kayfabe dating Shane's sister, Stephanie. Shane disapproved of the relationship, feeling Stephanie was dating [...] "beneath the family's standards", {{and wound up}} feuding with Test. With help from the Mean Street Posse, McMahon made Test's life <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b> At SummerSlam, McMahon met Test in a [...] "Love Her or Leave Her" [...] match, with the stipulation being that if McMahon won the match, Test and Stephanie {{could no longer see}} each other, and if he lost, McMahon would give his blessings to the pair. Test was able to get the win, and McMahon eventually settled his differences with Test, thus making his second face run by becoming his ally. As his father, Vince, then feuded with Triple H, Shane was attacked in early December 1999 by Triple H and D-Generation X (DX). He was thrown off the stage in a gang style attack, in which Billy Gunn and Road Dogg prevented members of the Corporation from saving Shane. Later in the year, Stephanie turned heel, siding with her new kayfabe husband then-heel, Triple H (the two began their off-screen relationship around this time, but did not marry in real life until 2003). With that, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction began, {{and all of the other}} McMahons disappeared from television.|$|E

If she was a noise, she’d be an electric sander in the apartment next door, relentless, high-pitched and impossible to ignore. As it is, she compares herself favourably to both Simone de Beauvoir and Madonna.

50|$|Of Human Bondage made Cromwell's {{name as a}} director, {{and most}} {{specifically}} as a man knew how to cast - he had to bargain with Warner Bros. to get the then little-known Bette Davis, who got an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the vicious, lurid waitress Mildred in a performance unlike any a Hollywood actress had given to that point. Cromwell also agreed, quite unusually, to Bette Davis request to devise her own garish, mask-like make-up as she descends morally and physically into <b>a</b> kind of <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b> This was <b>a</b> radical departure from the glamorous looks that actresses {{were supposed to have}} even in their death scenes, but Bette wanted none of that, and didn't trust a studio make-up artist to go as far as she wanted. In an early example of the necessity for actors to choose and define their own roles, Bette had campaigned for the part relentlessly, and grabbed it when she got it. It made her a star {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|R

60|$|Bear with me {{a moment}} {{and look at the}} problem. Here were {{thirteen}} beasts of us over half a thousand other beasts. It was <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>hell,</b> that prison, and it was up to us thirteen there to rule. It was impossible, considering the nature of the beasts, for us to rule by kindness. We ruled by fear. Of course, behind us, backing us up, were the guards. In extremity we called upon them for help; but it would bother them if we called upon them too often, in which event we could depend upon it that they would get more efficient trusties to take our places. But we did not call upon them often, except in a quiet sort of way, when we wanted a cell unlocked in order to get at a refractory prisoner inside. In such cases all the guard did was to unlock the door and walk away {{so as not to be}} a witness of what happened when half a dozen hall-men went inside and did a bit of man-handling.|$|E
60|$|She sat {{before the}} fire, her eyes fixed upon the burning coals. She heard muffled {{voices in the}} hall, she heard Powers enter an {{adjoining}} room, {{and close the door}} behind him. Her fingers clutched the sides of her chair, her eyeballs were hot. For the first time a spasm of physical fear seized her. He had gone to make ready. What if it should be death? She had spoken boldly of it but a moment before. Yet she was young, for good or evil her life was as yet unlived. Then with a rush came back the memory of the last ten months. The hopeless weariness of those days behind the counter, the miserable humiliation of it, the web of bitter despair drawn so closely and inevitably around her. All the petty tyrannies to which she had been subject, all the fettering restrictions which had gone to turn servitude into slavery were suddenly fresh in her mind. A hideous vista of dreary days and lonely nights--nowhere a ray of hope; the same, yesterday, to-day, and all other days. The fear passed away from her. Death might have its terrors, but a return to Bearmain's would be <b>a</b> <b>living</b> <b>hell.</b> She heard the door open without a single tremor. She even smiled as she saw Powers standing upon the threshold.|$|E

The father loves his daughter as his own, but Alzira, the mother, nurtures a strange hatred for Nice and hides a secret past involving adoption. Nice's mother lives bedeviling the playing pests, humiliates, sends her away from home and often attacks her. Living in this environment since it was adopted created chances to become a nice woman outraged and angry life.|$|R
5000|$|Giving a {{score of}} 6.5 out of 10, Justin McElroy of Polygon called PlatinumGames [...] "one of the industry’s best action developers" [...] and called the game [...] "Platinum’s love letter to old school Transformers".
