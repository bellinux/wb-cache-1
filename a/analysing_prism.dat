However, its experimental verification is rather difficult, due to the probabilistic behaviors of both the robots and the obstacles. This paper presents the Markov Decision Process based probabilistic formal models for three obstacle-avoidance strategies of a mobile robot in an uncertain dynamic environment. The models are employed to make <b>analyses</b> in <b>PRISM,</b> and the correctness of the analysis results is verified by MATLAB simulations. Finally, the minimum time and the energy consumption are determined by further <b>analyses</b> in <b>PRISM,</b> which prove to be useful in finding the optimal strategy. The present work provides a foundation for the probabilistic formal verification of more complicated obstacle-avoidance strategies...|$|R

40|$|As {{ecosystem}} modeling {{becomes increasingly}} integrated with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) {{there is a}} rise in demand for spatially and temporally continuous meteorological data. But {{in order to justify}} management decisions or to provide robust scientific insights, the accuracy of meteorological data used as model input must be thoroughly quantified. Current methods to create spatially continuous climate data from discrete weather station data include inverse distance weighting, geostatistical techniques such as kriging and splines, local regression models such as Parameter-Elevation Regression on Independent Slope Model (PRISM) and Daymet, and regional regression models. For the conterminous United States, PRISM and Daymet are perhaps the most commonly used interpolated datasets. Both use similar inputs but apply different interpolation methods. To date, no comprehensive comparison of their respective accuracies exists. Here I show that {{for a wide range of}} conditions, PRISM is the preferred interpolation. I reached this conclusion by comparing the accuracy of predictions of annual and monthly minimum (Tmin) and maximum (Tmax) by PRISM and Daymet for the conterminous United States from 1980 - 2003. My goals were: (1) to determine which interpolation was more robust at predicting temperature values; and (2) to assess whether the performance of each method varies, either temporally (annual or seasonal), spatially, or by elevation. To evaluate comparative performance, I analyzed PRISM and Daymet temperature predictions of ground station temperatures by calculating the logs odds ratio (LOR), mean absolute error (MAE), and bias. In all the comparative performance <b>analyses,</b> <b>PRISM</b> was the better model. The monthly results followed the same trend as the annual average results. I found a spatial performance difference across the entirety of the conterminous United States with the largest difference on the coasts and in the mountainous western regions. Stratifying data by elevation demonstrated that as elevation increases, uncertainty from both PRISM and Daymet increased. Unless the daily resolution provided by Daymet is required, PRISM appears to be a more robust predictor of continuous temperature data over the conterminous United States from 1980 - 2003...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu Natal, Westville, 2008. This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two main sections. The first is a review of laser resonators using spherical mirrors, and incorporates a physical optics numerical model of a Fabry-Perot laser resonator without gain. The output of this model, which includes spot sizes, loss, and transverse mode formation, is compared to the parameters calculated using published analytical results. This comparison serves as a verification of the numerical methods used, {{as well as a}} frame of reference for the model of a Porro prism resonator which follows in the second section. The second section proposes a new method for <b>analysing</b> Porro <b>prism</b> resonators. The analysis incorporates both geometric as well as physical optics concepts, with the prisms modelled as rotating elements with amplitude and phase distortions. This yields expressions for the orientation of the loss at the apex of each prism, and as well as the number of petals in the “petal-pattern” beam structure commonly observed from Porro prism lasers. These expressions are included in a numerical model, which is first used to verify the development of the characteristic petal-pattern. Next, the numerical model is used to investigate the development of the beam structure, in both time and space, in crossed Porro resonators with a range of Fresnel numbers and stability parameters. This leads to some new insight into the transverse modes of these lasers...|$|R

40|$|Automated {{verification}} is {{a technique}} for establishing if certain properties, usually expressed in temporal logic, hold for a system model. The model can be defined using a high-level formalism or extracted directly from software using methods such as abstract interpretation. The verification proceeds through exhaustive exploration of the state-transition graph of the model and is therefore more powerful than testing. Quantitative verification is an analogous technique for establishing quantitative properties of a system model, such as the probability of battery power dropping below minimum, the expected time for message delivery and the expected number of messages lost before protocol termination. Models analysed through this method are typically variants of Markov chains, annotated with costs and rewards that describe resources and their usage during execution. Properties are expressed in temporal logic extended with probabilistic and reward operators. Quantitative verification involves {{a combination of a}} traversal of the state-transition graph of the model and numerical computation.

The results of the three case studies were <b>analysed</b> through the <b>prism</b> of IT business value literature and compared to other papers on benefits of e-invoicing. The cases showed that electronic invoice handling technology enhanced control over company invoicing, allowed better management of payables, and indeed increased labour productivity in invoice handling units.

At the same time, a number of clubs were unable to trade profitably, and the richer clubs were toying {{with the idea of}} forming a break-away competition. The transformation of the AFL from a parochial suburban competition to heavily commercialised national league is <b>analysed</b> through the <b>prism</b> of cartel structure and conduct. It is concluded that first, even in its previous guise as the VFL, it adopted many cartel-like features, including controls over player transfers, fixed admission prices, and gate equalisation policies. Second, the establishment of a governing Commission in 1984 strengthened its monopoly power, and enabled it to set a singular vision for the game's development. This vision, in turn, enabled the AFL to create a national participation program that became the envy of every other sport association in Australia. Third, in achieving this outcome, the AFL tightened its authority over its member teams, administrators, coaches and players. Finally, within this cartel arrangement, member clubs surrendered their autonomy in return for an assurance that they would share the benefits from the AFL's growth and national expansion. In short, the AFL has strategically exploite...|$|R

In modern times, it {{has experienced a}} significant decline in population due to pine beetle infestations, blister rust infections, fire suppression, and climate change. While climate, fire, and vegetation are strongly linked on regional and global scales, the relative roles of these three factors are not well-documented during the Holocene in high elevation mountain sites of North America. Recent anthropogenic changes in climate and fire management practices are underway, but the potential responses of subalpine vegetation to these environmental changes remain relatively unknown. Here, I documented the paleoecology of a watershed surrounding an unnamed, high-altitude pond containing {{a large number of}} whitebark pine trees located at 2805 m elevation in Grand Teton National Park, U. S. A. Using a 1. 5 meter lacustrine sediment core collected in 2010, I generated a Holocene-scale fire and vegetation record using fossil pollen, charcoal, and macrofossils preserved within the core. I also conducted a dendrochronological study of the current stand of whitebark pine in the watershed to determine both approximate dates of establishment and responses to past climate change of this modern stand. Sedimentary charcoal data indicate significant variability in both fire frequency and fire intensity during the Holocene. The fire regime observed in the past 1000 years is seemingly unprecedented at this site, with lower fire frequency and higher fire intensity than any other time during the Holocene. Sedimentary pollen data suggest the study site has been primarily dominated by whitebark pine until the last 1000 years, with brief periods of vegetation dominated by non-arboreal taxa that indicate the presence of either successional dynamics or shifts in treeline location. Ages of individual living whitebark pine trees average 365 years, and dendrochronology data suggest that ring widths of the current stand have been declining since 1991. Statistical <b>analyses</b> of <b>PRISM</b> climate data with ring width data suggest that this decrease in annual growth is likely the result of decreased growing season temperature ranges driven by a warming climate. While this stand of whitebark pine is threatened by both warming climate and fire suppression, there is the potential for low-intensity prescribed burns {{to play a role in}} conservation and restoration management plans for this threatened conifer...|$|R
