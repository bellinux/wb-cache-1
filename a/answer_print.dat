50|$|The {{interpositive}} is {{made after}} the <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> has been approved. All lights and opticals from the <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> are repeated when striking the interpositive, {{and once the}} IP exists, the original negative can be vaulted.|$|E
50|$|When {{the last}} <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> is {{approved}} and finalized, {{it is used}} to make an internegative from which the release prints are struck.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between camera stocks and print stocks involves {{a difference in}} the recording process. When the work print or edit master has been approved, the Original Camera Negative (OCN) is assembled by a negative cutter using the edited work print or EDL (edit decision list) as a guide. A series of Answer Prints are then made from the OCN. During the <b>Answer</b> <b>Print</b> stage, corrections in the film's density and color are corrected (timed) to the filmmakers' tastes. Interpositive (IP) prints are struck from the OCN, checked to make sure they look the same as the custom timed <b>Answer</b> <b>Print,</b> and then each IP is used to make one or more Dupe Negative (DN) copies. The release prints are then generated from the DN(s). Recently, with the development of digital intermediate (DI), it has become possible to completely edit, composite visual effects, and color grade the image digitally at full resolution and bit-depth. In this workflow, the <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> is generated digitally and then written out to the IP stage using a laser film printer.|$|E

50|$|Briefcase Test: At the {{beginning}} of the episode, each player was given a briefcase and told not to open it. If they all followed instructions, the group would double the money from the Flashback game. However, inside the briefcase is a piece of photographic paper with the <b>answers</b> <b>printed</b> on one side. When developed, the paper would remain white {{if it had not been}} exposed to light (i.e., by a player opening their briefcase). If any player opened their briefcase, the paper would turn black when developed. In that event, no money is added.|$|R

5000|$|Halfon has {{described}} the three principals as very hands-on during production. [...] "We are there {{every day on the}} set, we're there at the <b>answer</b> <b>print,</b> we're there at the mix, we're there at the delivery.

Helping writers and directors protect their vision of what the film should be, she says, is what draws filmmakers to Mr. Mudd.|$|E
5000|$|The {{director}} says he {{also had}} to rewrite the script to incorporate a Dutch actress for the Dutch market, {{and the making of}} the movie was intensely political and happened in far too quick period of time. [...] "It was a film that went from six page treatment to stereo <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> in 4 1/2 months. That is no way to make a feature and, when you see the film, you will answer why." ...|$|E
50|$|The BBC had preview theatres to run 16mm sepmag {{film and}} 35mm. The 16mm {{machines}} were Bauer and the 35mm projectors Kalee 21.The projection area {{was a long}} room (open plan) with projectors serving theatres E -J. There was a separate projection room {{in the same area}} for theatre K, which was 35mm. There was also a dubbing theatre B, where 16mm productions would be dubbed, and film dispatch and sound transfer suites, where the quarter-inch tape from Nagra tape machines would be transferred to 16mm magnetic. Film previews ran rushes, cutting copies, synch rushes, <b>answer</b> <b>prints</b> and transmission prints before going to telecine.|$|R

50|$|After a film is shot, the {{original}} negatives—taken {{directly from the}} camera equipment—are edited into correct sequence and printed onto fresh stock as a cohesive film, creating an interpositive print used for color timing. From the interpositive, answer prints, which include the color-corrected imagery and a properly synced sound track, are made. Once approved by the studio, the final <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> is made into an internegative used for striking copies that will be delivered to theaters for viewing.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} a {{restored}} film is the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The color portions of Oz were shot in the three-strip Technicolor process, which in the 1930s yielded three separate black and white negatives created from red, green, and blue light filters which were used to print the cyan, magenta, and yellow portions of the final printed color film <b>answer</b> <b>print.</b> These three negatives were scanned individually into a computer system, where the digital images were tinted and combined using proprietary software.|$|E

5000|$|In 1533 {{he appears}} as author of an ode on the {{coronation}} of Anne Boleyn, in 1535 he graduated B.D. at Cambridge, proceeding D.D. in 1537, {{and in the}} same year subscribing the Institution of a Christian Man. In 1540 {{he was one of the}} fifteen divines to whom were referred crucial questions on the sacraments and the seat of authority in the Church; his <b>answers</b> (<b>printed</b> in Pocock's Burnet, iii. 443-496) indicate a mind tending away from Catholicism, but susceptible to [...] "The King's Doctrine"; and, indeed, Cox was one of the divines by whom Henry said the [...] "King's Book" [...] had been drawn up when he wished to impress upon the Regent Arran that it was not exclusively his own doing. Moreover, he was present at the examination of Barnes, subscribed the divorce of Anne of Cleves, and in that year of reaction became Archdeacon and Prebendary of Ely and Canon of Westminster.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} works were <b>answered</b> in <b>print,</b> and among those who wrote against Faber's views were Thomas Arnold, Shute Barrington (bishop of Durham), Christopher Bethell (bishop of Gloucester), George Corless, James Hatley Frere, Richard Hastings Graves, Thomas Harding (vicar of Bexley), Frederic Charles Husenbeth, Samuel Lee, D.D., Samuel Roffey Maitland, D.D., N. Nisbett, Thomas Pinder Pantin, Le Pappe de Trévern, and Edward William Whitaker.|$|R
50|$|The edited {{original}} negative is then copied {{to create}} a safety positive {{which can be used}} as a backup {{to create a}} usable negative. At this point, an <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> will be created from the OCN, and upon its approval, interpositives (IPs) and internegatives (INs) are created, from which the release prints are made. Generally speaking, the OCN is considered too important and delicate to be used for any processes more than necessary, as each pass through a lab process carries the risk of further degrading the quality of the negative by scratching the emulsion. Once an <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> is approved, the IPs and INs are regarded as the earliest generation of the finished and graded film, and are almost always used for transfers to video or new film restorations. The OCN is usually regarded as a last resort in the event that all of the intermediate elements have been compromised or lost. Ironically, the more popular a film is, the higher the likelihood that the original negative is in a worse shape, due to the need to return to the OCN to strike new IPs to replace the exhausted ones, and thus create more INs and release prints. Before 1969, 35mm prints were struck directly from the original negative, often running into hundreds of copies, and causing further wear on the original.|$|E
50|$|When {{the film}} {{workprint}} {{had been cut}} to a satisfactory state, it was then used to make an edit decision list (EDL). The negative cutter referred to this list while processing the negative, splitting the shots into rolls, which were then contact printed to produce the final film print or <b>answer</b> <b>print.</b> Today, production companies {{have the option of}} bypassing negative cutting altogether. With the advent of digital intermediate ("DI"), the physical negative does not necessarily need to be physically cut and hot spliced together; rather the negative is optically scanned into computer(s) and a cut list is conformed by a DI editor.|$|E
50|$|At a {{screening}} at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas in July 2008, Hellman introduced the film, saying {{he thought it}} was his best work (though not his best film). His esteem for the work was partly due, he said, to the speed at which the entire project was put together. The original script was thrown out and rewritten in one week, starting in March. By the end of April, principal photography was done, editing was done in May (with Hellman taking time out to go to the Cannes Film Festival), and by July 1989 there was an <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> screened at a film festival.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{beginnings}} of the Church of God, there was a commitment to pacifism. In the late 19th century, the Church of God used their journal, the Gospel Trumpet, as a means to disseminate their interest in pacifism. In April 1898, the Gospel Trumpet responded to a question about the Church of God’s stance on a Christian going to war. The <b>answer</b> <b>printed</b> was [...] "We answer no. Emphatically no. There is no place in the New Testament wherein Christ gave instruction to his followers to take the life of a fellow-man". As time went on the Church of God was able to maintain their stance on pacifism, but as World War I was erupting across Europe, the church’s stance began to soften. As German Church of God congregants were drafted into the army, the Gospel Trumpet began running letters submitted about the conditions of training camps and on the battlefields. While encouraging their readers to pray for the German soldiers, the Gospel Trumpet made no reference to the apparent contrast between supporting the war effort and encouraging pacifism.|$|R

5000|$|The {{film was}} shot on 35mm film {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California, and was {{completed}} when a color-corrected <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> and other film elements were delivered to Columbia Pictures on March 15, 1990. Editing went on around the clock, with two separate crews of film editors working while the film was being shot. Two choreographers were hired, Miranda Garrison and Felix Chavez, and the work apportioned between them. Film critic Roger Ebert visited the set while filming, as news was publicized how fast a major-studio film could be produced. The film featured the 1989 song [...] "Lambada", performed by the group Kaoma, which {{became involved in the}} Lambada dance craze.|$|E
5000|$|The film's premiere was {{supposed}} to occur in early 1943, but the theatre that housed the <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> was bombed by Royal Air Force planes the night before. The film went on to have a respectable premiere in Paris in November 1943 [...] "where it was surprisingly well-received by its audience", and also played well in some other capital cities of Nazi-occupied Europe such as Prague. But Goebbels banned its playing in Germany altogether, stating that the German people [...] - [...] who were at that point going through almost nightly Allied bombing raids [...] - [...] were less than enthusiastic about seeing a film that portrayed mass death and panic.|$|E
50|$|Tex Avery was a perfectionist: {{he worked}} {{extensively}} on his films' stories and gags, revised his animators' drawings, {{and was even}} known to cut frames out of the final Technicolor <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> if he felt a gag had been animated too softly. The strain of overwork caused Avery to quit MGM in May 1950, after completing Rock-a-Bye Bear (not released until 1952 because of MGM's cartoon backlog). Former Walter Lantz director Dick Lundy {{was brought in to}} head Avery's unit. Lundy completed one Droopy cartoon and ten Barney Bear shorts before Avery returned in October 1951 and reassumed his role as director from Lundy, starting with Little Johnny Jet (released in 1953).|$|E
