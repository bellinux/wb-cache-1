5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, both {{mountain}} detachments had completed mobilisation and concentration, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> position. Detachment Lika was at its mobilisation centre, but the turn-out of men for its infantry component was low. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was completing its concentration. A large proportion of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski was moving from its mobilisation centres to its concentration areas. Across the 7th Army, around 80 percent of troops had answered the mobilisation order, but only 45 to 50 percent of vehicles and animals were available.|$|E
5|$|Discussed in ArticleVIII, the {{judiciary}} {{was separated from}} the two other branches of the government, and was to be served by elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> constant session, with judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province to hear the cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.|$|E

5|$|In early 348 BC, the Athenians were {{distracted by}} events on Euboea, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> no {{position}} to send much help to Olynthos.

Six Metrovick 950s were built, the first completed in 1956. They were successfully deployed within various departments of the company <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> use for about five years.|$|E
