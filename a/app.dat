40|$|Mobile {{telephones}} are ubiquitous {{and have}} more recently evolved into the smartphone, {{a combination of a}} handheld computer and mobile telephone. Smartphones support software applications (<b>apps)</b> with specialised functions. Some <b>apps</b> may be pre-installed on the telephone but many <b>apps</b> are downloaded. Downloading <b>apps</b> (either free or for a nominal fee) is straightforward. <b>Apps</b> are available for a large number of mental health conditions and are also known as mHealth <b>apps.</b> Many of these <b>apps</b> have already been investigated by researchers and include <b>apps</b> for psychosis, 1 depression, 2 anxiety, 3 alcohol use disorders, 4 smoking cessation, 5 sleep disturbance 6 and weight loss. 7 In this article we will avoid the more generic productivity <b>apps</b> (e. g. email <b>apps)</b> and will instead focus on general clinical and mHealth <b>apps</b> as well as regulated <b>apps</b> where possible...|$|R
30|$|Initially, our dataset {{contained}} 30 malicious <b>apps</b> {{but during}} feature vector similarity scoring using the Manhattan Distance metric, we discovered {{the existence of}} two malicious <b>apps</b> that consistently yielded a Manhattan Distance of 0.0 with multiple benign <b>apps.</b> In other words, the two malicious <b>apps</b> are identical to multiple benign <b>apps.</b> These ambiguous <b>apps</b> adversely affect the two-class identification process employed in this research. Therefore, we chose to remove them from our dataset for further study. For this research, {{the removal of the}} two <b>apps</b> resulted in a dataset of 30 benign <b>apps</b> and 28 malicious <b>apps.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Smartphone {{applications}} (“apps”) offer {{a number}} of possibilities for health promotion activities. However, young people may also be exposed to <b>apps</b> with incorrect or poor quality information, since, like the Internet, <b>apps</b> are mostly unregulated. Little {{is known about the}} quality of alcohol-related <b>apps</b> or what influence they may have on young people’s behavior. Objective: To critically review popular alcohol-related smartphone <b>apps</b> and to explore young people’s opinions of these <b>apps,</b> their acceptability, and use for alcohol-related health promotion. Methods: First, a content analysis of 500 smartphone <b>apps</b> available via Apple iTunes and Android Google Play stores was conducted. Second, all available blood alcohol concentration (BAC) <b>apps</b> were tested against four individual case profiles of known BAC from a previous study. Third, two focus group discussions explored how young people use alcohol-related <b>apps,</b> particularly BAC <b>apps.</b> Results: 384 <b>apps</b> were included; 50 % (192) were entertainment <b>apps,</b> 39 % (148) were BAC <b>apps,</b> and 11 % (44) were health promotion and/or stop drinking–related <b>apps.</b> When testing the BAC <b>apps,</b> there was wide variation in results, with <b>apps</b> tending to overestimate BAC scores compared with recorded scores. Participants were skeptical of the accuracy of BAC <b>apps,</b> and there was an overall concern that these <b>apps</b> would be used as a form of entertainment, further encouraging young people to drink, rather than reduce their drinking and risk taking...|$|R

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and tau protein in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (<b>APP).</b> <b>APP</b> is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. <b>APP</b> is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes <b>APP</b> to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E
