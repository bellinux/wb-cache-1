5|$|The Town Hall {{was built}} in 1778, with the porch and arcade being added in 1861 and the balcony and round windows in 1932. It is a Grade II listed building. It {{replaced}} the former {{on the site of}} the Market and Assize Hall in the Market Place, and a Canonical House also known as 'The Exchequer', on the authority of an Act of Parliament dated 1779. The building also houses the magistrates courts and other offices. The <b>Assize</b> <b>court</b> last sat here in October 1970.|$|E
5|$|On May 12 President Arthur sailed on {{her second}} voyage to Palestine, {{counting}} Hemda Ben-Yahuda, {{the widow of}} Hebrew linguist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, among her passengers. During the trip, an altercation between a Steward and the ship's master-at-arms resulted {{in the death of}} the latter while the ship was in Naples. Though the steward was arrested by Italian authorities, he was acquitted of murder by the <b>Assize</b> <b>Court</b> at Naples. After a return to New York, President Arthur sailed for Haifa on July 19 for what would be her last voyage for American Palestine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Assize</b> <b>Courts</b> (Κακουργιοδικεία) are Criminal Courts {{which are}} {{composed}} of three judges, one of which must hold {{the position of a}} President of District Court and presides over the session. While <b>Assize</b> <b>Courts</b> have in theory jurisdiction to rule on any criminal law case, from misdemeanours through to murder, {{due to the fact that}} District Courts deal with most cases which carry a maximum sanction of five years imprisonment, it is primarily more severe cases which are filed in <b>Assize</b> <b>Courts.</b> These Courts have the ability to impose the heaviest of all sentences, life imprisonment.|$|R

Nevertheless, while a {{majority}} of 2/3 is necessary for a conviction in <b>Assize</b> <b>Courts</b> with each judge having one vote, the President's vote counts for two in case there is disagreement on the height or quality of the sentence to be imposed.|$|R
25|$|However, {{trials and}} executions for {{witchcraft}} continued in England after the Wenham case. One such case involved Mary Hickes and her nine-year-old daughter Elizabeth, who were condemned {{to death by}} the <b>Assize</b> <b>Court</b> and were hanged in Huntingdon on Saturday 28 July 1716. They were believed to have taken off their stockings {{in order to raise}} a rainstorm.|$|E
25|$|Angoulême is {{the seat}} of a bishop, a prefect, and an <b>assize</b> <b>court.</b> Its public {{institutions}} include tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a council of trade-arbitrators, a chamber of commerce and {{a branch of the}} Bank of France. It has several lycées (including the Lycee de l'Image et du Son d'Angoulême (LISA – High School of Image and Sound)), training colleges, a school of artillery, a library and several learned societies.|$|E
25|$|By this time, the Lafarge affair had {{generated}} so {{much interest}} that the curious arrived {{from all over}} Europe to watch her murder trial, elevating it to a cause célèbre. Thus, when Marie entered the <b>assize</b> <b>court</b> of Tulle {{for the first time}} on 3 September 1840, dressed in mourning and carrying a bottle of smelling salts in her hand, projecting the image of a woman unjustly accused, the spectators were immediately divided into pro- and anti-Marie factions.|$|E

25|$|As regards civil law, {{with the}} {{exception}} of capital crimes, peregrini were subject to the customary laws and courts of their civitas (an administrative circumscription, similar to a county, based on the pre-Roman tribal territories). Cases involving Roman citizens, on the other hand, were adjudicated by the governor's <b>assize</b> <b>court,</b> according to the elaborate rules of Roman civil law. This gave citizens a substantial advantage in disputes with peregrini, especially over land, as Roman law would always prevail over local customary law if there was a conflict. Furthermore, the governor's verdicts were often swayed by the social status of the parties (and often by bribery) rather than by jurisprudence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sphere}} of {{criminal}} law, there was no law to prevent the torture of peregrini during official interrogations. Peregrini were subject to de plano (summary) justice, including execution, {{at the discretion of}} the legatus Augusti (provincial governor). In theory at least, Roman citizens could not be tortured and could insist on being tried by a full hearing of the governor's <b>assize</b> <b>court</b> i.e. court held in rotation at different locations. This would involve the governor acting as judge, advised by a consilium ("council") of senior officials, as well as the right of the defendant to employ legal counsel. Roman citizens also enjoyed the important safeguard, against possible malpractice by the governor, of the right to appeal a criminal sentence, especially a death sentence, directly to the emperor himself.|$|E
25|$|After the riot, {{the police}} {{set up a}} special {{investigation}} unit which detained 778 people, among them Karim Ghani. Out of these, 403 were released unconditionally and 106 were released on various conditions (they generally had {{to report to the}} police station monthly and adhere to a curfew after dark). The police eventually brought rioting charges against 200 people, of whom 25 were acquitted, 100 were convicted, 62 were referred to the Enquiry Advisory Committee, and seven were brought to trial at the <b>Assize</b> <b>Court</b> for wanton killing and five of them were subsequently sentenced to death on the gallows.One of the five that was sentenced to the gallows was A.K.S. Othman Ghani, a respectable Indian businessman from Madras, the founder of the once famous Jubilee Cafe and Restaurant.|$|E
50|$|A Clerk of Assize was a {{clerk of}} the <b>Assize</b> <b>Courts</b> of England and Wales, a {{position}} which existed {{from at least}} 1285 to 1971, when the Courts Act 1971 eliminated the <b>Assize</b> <b>Courts.</b> Originally the judges' private clerks tasked with enrolling pleas, the Clerks grew into the heads of administrative departments tasked with keeping each Assize running smoothly, {{and at one point}} sat as judges in their own right.|$|R

25|$|Typhus {{was also}} common in prisons (and in crowded {{conditions}} where lice spread easily), {{where it was}} known as Gaol fever or Jail fever. Gaol fever often occurs when prisoners are frequently huddled together in dark, filthy rooms. Imprisonment until the next term of court was often equivalent to a death sentence. It was so infectious that prisoners brought before the court sometimes infected the court itself. Following the Assize held at Oxford in 1577, later deemed the Black Assize, over 300 died from epidemic typhus, including Sir Robert Bell, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. The outbreak that followed, between 1577 and 1579, killed about 10% of the English population. During the Lent <b>Assize</b> <b>Court</b> held at Taunton (1730) typhus caused {{the death of the}} Lord Chief Baron, as well as the High Sheriff, the sergeant, and hundreds of others. During a time when there were 241 capital offences, more prisoners died from 'gaol fever' than were put to death by all the public executioners in the realm. In 1759 an English authority estimated that each year a quarter of the prisoners had died from gaol fever. In London, typhus frequently broke out among the ill-kept prisoners of Newgate Gaol and then moved into the general city population.|$|E
25|$|Those {{sentenced to}} death before c. 1800 at the castle were usually taken to Lancaster Moor, near where the Ashton Memorial now stands, to be hanged. After the Georgian remodelling of the castle, it was {{decided it would be}} more {{convenient}} to perform executions nearer the castle. The spot chosen became known as Hanging Corner. Lancaster has a reputation as the court that sentenced more people to death than any other in England. This is partly because until 1835 Lancaster Castle was the only <b>Assize</b> <b>Court</b> in the entire county and covered rapidly growing industrial centres including Manchester and Liverpool. Between 1782 and 1865, around 265people were hanged at Lancaster; the executions were frequently attended by thousands of people crowded into the churchyard. The Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 ended public executions, requiring that criminals be put to death in private, after which 6 executions were performed inside the castle, at first from the Chapel steps (5), then later (1) in a purpose-built execution shed, on the inside wall of Hanging Corner. This shed remained until the mid-20th Century, allegedly still containing the Gallows. The last execution (of Thomas Rawcliffe, wife-murderer) at Lancaster took place in 1910. The prison closed in 1916 due to a national {{decrease in the number of}} prisoners, although for part of the First World War it held German civilians and prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|The {{criminal}} judges {{serve at}} a penal court. These courts (mahkeme(ler)) are separated into ağır ceza (<b>assize</b> <b>court),</b> asliye ceza (penal court of first instance), and sulh ceza (penal court of peace). The civil judges serve at civil courts of first instance or at civil courts of peace (sulh or asliye hukuk mahkemeleri), while administrative judges serve in administrative courts (idari mahkemeler). The Supreme Council of Judges and Public Prosecutors (Hâkimler ve Savcılar Yüksek Kurulu) {{deals with the}} admission of judges and public prosecutors of courts of justice and administrative courts into the profession, appointments, transfers to other posts, the delegation of temporary powers, promotion to the first category, the allocation of posts; decisions concerning those whose continuation in the profession {{is found to be}} unsuitable; the imposition of disciplinary penalties and removal from office. After the Constitutional amendment which took place 2010, the composition of The High Council of Judges and Prosecutors was completely changed. It currently consists of 22 members. Ten members out of 22 are elected among the judges and prosecutors by their colleagues working in first instance courts. While five members are supreme judges elected by other supreme judges, four members of High Council are appointed among lawyers and law professors by the President of Republic and one comes from Judicial Academy. Minister of Justice is the president of High Council and The Undersecretary of the Justice Minister is also an ex-officio member. In the existing system, the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors has its own Secretariat. In addition, the Inspection Board operates under the authority of High Council.|$|E

500|$|Denning was demobilised on 6 February 1919, and {{returned}} to Magdalen College four days later. He initially thought about turning to applied mathematics, but decided on pure mathematics. He studied hard, not participating {{in any of the}} university's numerous societies or clubs so that he could better focus on his work, and graduated in 1920 with a first in Mathematical Greats. He was offered a job teaching mathematics at Winchester College for £350 a year, which he accepted. As well as mathematics, he taught geology, despite not having studied it; instead, he [...] "read up on [...] the night before". He found the job boring, and after viewing the <b>Assize</b> <b>Court</b> at Winchester Castle decided he would like to be a barrister.|$|E
500|$|By 1701, the {{conditions}} of the county jail had become scandalous and the decision was taken to redevelop the area occupied by the old bailey. A local tax helped to fund the development, and the king agreed for the ruins of St Mary's Abbey to be cannibalised for building stone. Three new buildings were erected to the south of Clifford's Tower. A new county jail, built between 1701 and 1705 by William Wakefield, was placed on the south side, closely resembling the fashionable work of John Vanbrugh. The local architect John Carr then built the Assize Courts {{on the site of the}} old Jury House between 1773 and 1777 on the west side, and oversaw the replacement of the Sessions House and Common Hall by the Female Prison between 1780 and 1783 on the east side. The Female Prison and county jail were later combined to become the Debtors' Prison. Both of Carr's buildings were designed in a distinctive neoclassical style; the <b>Assize</b> <b>Court</b> building was particularly praised at the time as being [...] "a superb building of the Ionic order". The castle courtyard was grassed over to form a circle in 1777 and became known as the [...] "Eye of the Ridings" [...] because it was used for the election of members of parliament for York.|$|E
500|$|In May 1937 Birkett was {{appointed}} Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee for Abortion {{set up by}} the Minister of Health and Home Secretary, preparing a report [...] "to inquire into the prevalence of abortion, and the law relating thereto, and to consider what steps can be taken by more effective enforcement of the law", something which occupied him for two years. During the summer of 1937, Birkett was asked to represent the English Bar {{at the annual meeting of}} the Canadian Bar Association in Toronto, where he was a popular speaker. In January 1938, he was asked to act as a Commissioner of Assize to open the <b>Assize</b> <b>Court</b> in Aylesbury, dealing with an average of ten cases a day. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he became a member of a committee advising the Home Secretary on the detention of suspected enemy agents. The committee dealt with more than 1,500 cases in two years. Although the work was unpaid, he was knighted on 6 June 1941 as a reward for his work. He also delivered weekly radio broadcasts after the Friday night news to counter the broadcasts of William Joyce, known as Lord Haw Haw. The first broadcast took place on 9 February 1940, and they were considered to be a morale boost during the so-called Phony War.|$|E

2500|$|At Taunton <b>Assize</b> <b>Court,</b> on 17 October 1951, Straffen stood {{trial for}} murder before Mr Justice Oliver. However, the only witness {{to be heard}} was Dr. Peter Parkes, medical officer at Horfield Prison, who testified to Straffen's medical history and stated his {{conclusion}} that Straffen was unfit to plead. Oliver commented: [...] "In this country we do not try people who are insane. You might as well try a baby in arms. If a man cannot understand what is going on, he cannot be tried." [...] The jury formally returned a verdict that Straffen was insane and unfit to plead.|$|E

Charges of a serious misdemeanor or lesser felonies go to the criminal court directly. In contrast, major felonies are referred to the Court of Appeal for the pretrial hearing. The Court of Appeal decides whether to approve the s recommendation, and if it does the case is turned over to the <b>Assize</b> <b>Court.</b> Examining magistrates are not involved at trials, although in France, criminal trials are [...] "in many respects a continuation of the pretrial investigation" [...] with the trial judge acting as the leading figure in the examination of witnesses.|$|E
