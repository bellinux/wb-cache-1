50|$|Nirvana {{can be used}} {{to control}} access to data by setting up {{specific}} access control lists by user, group etc. using user-defined metadata attributes (Project, Study, etc.) and by setting <b>access</b> <b>privilege</b> levels where users assigned higher levels can see more information than others assigned lower levels. Nirvana supports single sign-on and access by integrating with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and Active Directory, using Challenge-response authentication, Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI), and Kerberos.

25|$|An {{important}} logical {{control that}} is frequently overlooked {{is the principle}} of least privilege. The principle of least privilege requires that an individual, program or system process is not granted any more <b>access</b> <b>privileges</b> than are necessary to perform the task. A blatant example of the failure {{to adhere to the}} principle of least privilege is logging into Windows as user Administrator to read email and surf the web. Violations of this principle can also occur when an individual collects additional <b>access</b> <b>privileges</b> over time. This happens when employees' job duties change, or they are promoted to a new position, or they transfer to another department. The <b>access</b> <b>privileges</b> required by their new duties are frequently added onto their already existing <b>access</b> <b>privileges</b> which may no longer be necessary or appropriate.|$|R

50|$|The {{access control}} domain deals with {{implementation}} of access controls across all electronic forms of information processing systems like operating systems, applications, networks or mobile platforms. Access control is the selective restriction {{of access to}} a place or other resource. Typically an organization's access control policy establishes the requirement of controls {{that need to be}} implemented for controlling access to information, information processing facilities and business processes on the basis of business and security requirements. The policy should aim to control the assimilation, authorization, and dissemination of information in a controlled manner. The typical organizational objectives of the access control policy are to establish a procedure for user registration and de-registration, establish a procedure to grant the correct level of <b>access</b> <b>privilege,</b> establish a procedure to control password use, password change and password removal, establish a procedure for managements review of access rights, establish a procedure for unattended equipment, maintain a clear desk policy, establish a procedure to control network service access, establish a control method for authentication of remote users, establish a procedure for configuration ports, establish a procedure to segregate networks, establish a procedure to use precise routing controls, establish a procedure to control system utilities and to establish a procedure to secure communications over mobile computing devices.|$|E
50|$|Chakra protects {{database}} and enterprise properties which {{are stored in}} database through database access control. Recently, DBMS(s) have already offered some security function {{so there are a}} lot of database infringement cases such as log integrity and information leakage abusing data <b>access</b> <b>privilege</b> by internal users rather than external users like hackers. Therefore, Chakra controls user’s database access per privilege level and then a user is able to access only the part of database according to the policy of minimum privilege or Chakra offers a function which parts of data are masked. Especially, data masking reduces burden of the performance and cost for database encryption which is the top security issue recently. Chakra locates between client which requests query to {{database and}} network stream of database and it is monitoring in/out data flow in real time. Also, it saves as audit data. Chakra guarantees log integrity for saved audit data and Chakra policy management history and it protects those safely. Also, it helps administrators to manage audit data safely by backing up those as encryption algorithm. An administrator is able to search the audit data per condition later or handle organization security audit by printing multiple documents above 14 types like *.pdf, *.doc, *.hwp, *.csv, *.xls and so on. Currently, Chakra supports 14 DBs like Oracle, IBM DB2, MS SQL, Sybase IQ, Sybase ASE, Teradata, Altibase, Tibero, Cubrid, Informix, Netezza, Mysql, PostgreSQL and Mainframe DB2.|$|E
50|$|Chakra Max protects {{database}} and enterprise properties which {{are stored in}} database. The basic security method of Chakra Max is to control users’ database accesses per privilege level. It sets up <b>access</b> <b>privilege</b> for application servers or DB users causing in/out data flow in databases and then it allows reasonable transactions and blocks unreasonable transactions. It processes a work approval to the SQL execution privilege according to the organizational policy and gives limitation to only read data by providing masking data for key data like privacy information to users. Plus, it provides a function {{to be able to}} simulate before and after data in case SQL is executed to modify database. Of course, it is monitored for all traffic information and user identification information occurred in hear in real time by an administrator and saves those as auditing data. It guarantees integrity for the saved auditing data and the history of Chakra Max policy management and protects those safely. Also, it helps an administrator to manage auditing data safely by backing up those as encryption algorithm. An administrator is able to search the auditing data per condition later or handle organization security audit outputting various document forms of more than 14 types like *.pdf, *.doc, *.hwp, *.csv, *.xls and so on. As it gained the CC(Common Criteria) validation of EAL4 rating for international criteria in January 2012, it is accepted as a secure and stable solution deleted of the latest all vulnerabilities. Currently, Chakra Max supports 14 DBs like Oracle, IBM DB2, MS SQL, Sybase IQ, Sybase ASE, Teradata, Altibase, Tibero, Cubrid, Informix, Netezza, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Mainframe DB2.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>access</b> <b>privilege</b> management in a classical protection environment featuring subjects attempting to access the protected objects. We express an <b>access</b> <b>privilege</b> {{in terms of an}} access right and a privilege level. The privilege level and a protection diagram associated with each given object determine whether a nominal <b>access</b> <b>privilege</b> for this object corresponds to an effective, possibly weaker <b>access</b> <b>privilege,</b> or is revoked. We associate a password system with each object; the password system {{takes the form of a}} hierarchical bidimensional one-way chain. A subject possesses a nominal <b>access</b> <b>privilege</b> for a given object if it holds a key that matches one of the passwords in the password system of this object; the protection diagram determines the extent of the corresponding effective <b>access</b> <b>privilege.</b> The resulting protection environment has several interesting properties. A key reduction mechanism allows a subject that holds a key for a given object to distribute keys for weaker access rights at lower privilege levels. A subject that owns a given object can review or revoke the passwords for this object by simply modifying the protection diagram. The memory requirements to represent a protection diagram are negligible; as far as password storage is concerned, space-time trade-offs are possible...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, {{we propose}} an authentication-combined access control scheme for in-formation {{protection}} systems. Let aij be the <b>access</b> <b>privilege</b> of User i to File j. Initially, by the Diffie-Hellman public key distribution scheme, {{the system and}} the users are assigned distinct secret keys, and their corresponding public keys, respectively. Let K, be the secret key and yS be the public key of the system, and let Ki be the secret key and yi be the public key of the User i. By using a predefined one-way function F, we compute rij = F(Ki, ys, aij). Reversely, the <b>access</b> <b>privilege</b> can be retained es eij = F(K,, yi, Tij). Being different from the previously proposed schemes, our scheme is safer and the user’s secret key is used not only for computing the corresponding <b>access</b> <b>privilege</b> to the intended file, but also for authenticating the requesting user not to illegitimately access the protected files. The proposed scheme is simple to establish. Besides, it can perform the access control in dynamic environments, such as change access privileges and insert/delete users or files. 1...|$|E
