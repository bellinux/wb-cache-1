We are proud of our daughter.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot and {{directed}} by Cliff Watts, who had also shot Beyoncé's Sports Illustrated cover. The video for the song served as the closing clip for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, and was filmed on Super 8 mm film in Miami. Beyoncé discussed the music video with MTV, stating that, [...] " [...] feels like something you shouldn't be seeing, like you found a home video. It's very raw: no retouching, no special effects. That's who I am. You can see my soul." [...] In an interview with Vibe Beyoncé recalled the video, [...] "I didn't have any hair and makeup. [...] just me {{on the beach and}} in the sun, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> one bathing suit 'cause I was there for myself. It's very artistic and grimy, and [...] no retouching. It is what it is." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Suddenly {{she sat up}} in her bed {{and looked}} {{from one to the}} other of us with wide, frightened eyes," [...] wrote Eagar. [...] "She cried out suddenly, 'I'm dying! I'm dying!' She was coaxed to lie down again, but {{remained}} agitated. [...] "The child turned to me, and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'" [...] Eagar promised it would be done. [...] "She added, 'immediately.' ... We continued to fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> the wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her for a moment, and Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took the baby out of the room." [...] Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Charles re-recorded [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] as a {{duet with}} American singer-songwriter Norah Jones, who grew up {{listening}} to his music. During Jones' Billboard interview for her 2010 collaboration album ...Featuring, which included her [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] duet, she said [...] "I got a call from Ray asking if I'd be interested in singing on this duets record. I got on the next plane <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> my mom. We went to his studio and did it live with the band. I sang it right next to Ray, watching his mouth for the phrasing. He was very sweet and put me at ease, which was great because I was petrified walking in there." [...] She noted in one ...Featuring interview that the only part that was not done live was a piano overlay that she added afterwards to complement Charles' keyboard. In the same interview, she noted that she had been given the opportunity to select a song from Charles' songbook to perform as a duet and felt that this one provided the best opportunity to harmonize rather than alternate vocal verses. On the record, the two singers vocalize, accompanied by Billy Preston on Hammond organ, who had at one time been the regular organist in Charles' band.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carter {{claimed to}} have been {{inspired}} to write the episode after his dog had worms, a situation he called [...] "very disgusting". He also had been reading about Chernobyl and the extinction of species at the time and blended all three of these concepts when writing the episode. Carter described his mood while writing the episode, [...] "I was in a funk when I wrote that episode. We were coming back from hiatus and I was trying to find something more interesting than just the Flukeman. I was irritated at the time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> my irritation to Mulder's attitude. Basically, he had become fed up with the FBI. They had given him what he felt was a low assignment, which was sending him into the city after a dead body. But lo and behold, he finds that this is a case that {{for all intents and purposes}} is an X-File. It's been given to him by a man he's never looked at as an ally, Skinner. So it's an interesting establishing of a relationship between them." [...] Producer J.P. Finn described the episode as a departure from Carter's usual work as it did not deal with an alien subject matter.|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... He gave it to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry Lefèvre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E

2500|$|He {{published}} his autobiography, Witness to a Century in 1987. He wrote: [...] "And so [...] Gilbert <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>brought</b> {{up without a}} formal religion, remained throughout our lifetimes just what Father was, freethinkers. And, likewise, doubters and dissenters and perhaps Utopians. Father's rule had been 'Question everything, take nothing for granted,' and I never outlived it, and I would suggest it be made the motto of a world journalists' association." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{supporting}} cast consisted of relatively unknown actors and actresses, except for Jeffrey Kramer and Ford Rainey. Most {{of the cast}} previously or later appeared in films or television series by Universal Studios (the distributor for this film). Kramer was previously cast in a supporting role as Deputy Jeff Hendricks in Jaws and Jaws 2 (1978). In Halloween II, Kramer played Dr. Graham, a dentist who examines the charred remains of a boy confused with Myers. He was chosen to play Haddonfield Memorial Hospital's drunk resident doctor, Frederick Mixter. A host of character actors were cast as the hospital's staff. Many were acquaintances of director Rosenthal. He told an interviewer, [...] "I'd been studying acting with Milton Katselas at the Beverly Hills Playhouse <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> many people from the Playhouse into Halloween 2." [...] These included Pamela Susan Shoop, Leo Rossi, Ana Alicia and Gloria Gifford. Rossi played the part of Budd Scarlotti, a hypersexual EMS driver who mocks Jimmy as a [...] "college boy." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1953 to 1955 {{he went to}} sea as Commander Cruisers-Destroyers, Pacific, {{where his}} career was stalled {{temporarily}} by Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas. Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney was selecting members of an upcoming promotion board and picked Curts for his skill and contacts {{in the fields of}} electronics and communications. However, [...] "Mr. Thomas vetoed [...] when I brought the slate in, and said that he didn't want him around Washington. I couldn't get from him any expression of reason as to this prejudice, but it was perfectly obvious that I couldn't bring [...] back. It was also perfectly obvious that I'd better not nominate him for three stars, which I had planned to do...But about a year later, I was looking for a replacement in the Second Fleet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> in a nomination. Thomas said that he wasn't particularly impressed with the person I was suggesting and said {{it seemed to him that}} I'd do better if I put someone like [...] in." [...] Queried as to his change of heart, Thomas initially denied ever having vetoed Curts, then, when pressed by an incredulous Carney, [...] "finally said he couldn't understand why he had done it, except that somebody must have told him something." [...] Carney immediately nominated Curts for his third star.|$|E
