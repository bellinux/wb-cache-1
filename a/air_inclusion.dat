40|$|Recently, several papers {{investigated}} the linear dimensional changes in dentine after air-drying. This paper pertains to weight changes, volume changes, and density changes caused by air-drying {{of sound and}} demineralized intact dentine. The densities of sound and artificially demineralized human coronal dentine were measured in the wet state and after various drying periods of up to 24 h. The volume was assessed either {{by means of a}} pyknometer (wet samples) or by means of dimension measurements. The air-drying experiments were done using a Mettler thermobalance at room temperature. The density of wet sound coronal dentine was found to be 2. 24 +/- 0. 12 g. cm(- 3); the value of wet demineralized dentine was about 1. 6 g. cm(- 3). The data show that previously published density values of powdered sound dentine may have been influenced by powdering effects, air-drying, and <b>air</b> <b>inclusion.</b> In whole demineralized air-dried dentine, <b>air</b> <b>inclusion</b> can be very severe: up to 30 % by volume. The results show furthermore that in demineralized dentine we have two drying stages: during the first one (up to about 10 min of air-drying), the lesions shrink about 23 %, while a main part of the water in the lesion evaporates, and air is incorporated into the tissue; during the second stage (drying longer than 10 min), the lesions hardly shrink anymore, but water is evaporated mainly from underlying sound dentine, followed by air incorporation...|$|E

40|$|Since NASA's new {{spacecraft}} {{in development}} for both LEO and Deep Space capability have considerable crew volume reduction {{in comparison to}} the Space Shuttle, it is clear that NASA requires a smaller and less expensive commode. The UTAS Universal Waste Management System (UWMS) was designed to address these new constraints, resulting in an 80 % volume reduction in the cabin while enhancing performance. Whereas all of the current space commodes use air flow to capture both urine and feces and separate air from the captured air/urine mixture, the UWMS commode and urine fans and the urine separator were combined into a single unit. This unit enables use of a single motor and motor controller, which provides considerable packaging and weight efficiency. In some of the intended platform applications for the UWMS, the urine is pumped to a water reclamation system. The ISS Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) system requires delivered urine to include less than 0. 25 % <b>air</b> <b>inclusion.</b> <b>Air</b> <b>inclusion</b> in centrifugal urine separators is greatly dependent on its rotational speed. To satisfy this requirement, a gear reducer was included, allowing the fans to rotate at a much higher speed than the separator.

This continues to be a major problem in applying agricultural pesticides. The purpose of this research is to measure the amount of sedimenting drift from a horizontal boom sprayer for different (drift reducing) spray application techniques under field conditions and to compare the results with the results from a reference spray, taking into account variations in meteorological conditions during the field drift experiments. Field drift measurements were performed for several combinations of nozzle type (standard flat-fan, low-drift, <b>air</b> <b>inclusion)</b> and size (ISO 02, 03, 04, and 06), spray pressure (2. 0, 3. 0, and 4. 0 bar), driving speed (4, 6, 8, and 10 km h(- 1)), and spray boom height (0. 3, 0. 5, and 0. 75 m) according to ISO 22866 by sampling in a defined downwind area at 24 different positions using horizontal drift collectors. The reference spray was defined as a standard horizontal spray boom without air support, a spray boom height of 0. 50 m, a nozzle distance of 0. 50 m, ISO 110 03 standard flat-fan nozzles at 3. 0 bar (1. 2 L min(- 1)), and a driving speed of 8 km h(- 1), resulting in an application rate of approximately 180 L ha(- 1). Nozzle type as well as spray pressure, driving speed, and spray boom height, have an important effect on the amount of spray drift. Larger nozzle sizes, lower spray pressures and driving speeds, and lower spray boom heights generally reduce spray drift. Concerning nozzle types, <b>air</b> <b>inclusion</b> nozzles have the highest drift reduction potential, followed by the low-drift nozzles and the standard flat-fan nozzles.

In response the Universal Waste Management System (UWMS) was designed, resulting in an 80 % volume reduction from the last US commode, while enhancing performance. The ISS WMS and previous shuttle commodes have a fan supplying air flow to capture feces and a separator to capture urine and separate air from the captured air/urine mixture. The UWMS combined both rotating equipment components into a single unit, referred to at the Dual Fan Separator (DFS). The combination of these components resulted in considerable packaging efficiency and weight reduction, removing inter-component plumbing, individual mounting configurations and required only a single motor and motor controller, in some of the intended UWMS platform applications the urine is pumped to the ISS Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) system. It requires the DFS to include less than 2. 00 % <b>air</b> <b>inclusion,</b> by volume, in the delivered urine.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to develop the tools and {{knowledge}} to reduce dietary sodium by mitigating restrictions to flavour delivery and enhancing saltiness perception through sodium contrast effects in the mouth. This is achieved by restructuring semi-solid and liquid model food systems to achieve maximum flavour delivery for enhanced perception. The project considered two model systems: stable foams and double emulsions. Stable foams were developed to evaluate air inclusions as a potential sodium reduction strategy. Saltiness perception was enhanced as the levels of <b>air</b> <b>inclusion</b> increased and the incorporation of air also increased the delivery of a congruent mushroom aroma, ultimately this resulted in an enhanced overall flavour perception. The release of volatile aroma compounds from the aerated matrix was dependent on the hydrophobicity (Log P) of the volatile.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to produce a 3 D mesh of defect free electrospun {{cellulose}} acetate nanofibres and to use this to produce a prototype composite resin containing nanofibre fillers. This might find use as an aesthetic orthodontic bracket material or composite veneer for restorative dentistry. In this laboratory based study cellulose acetate was dissolved in an acetone and dimethylacetamide solvent solution and electrospun. The spinning parameters were optimised and lithium chloride added to the solution to produce a self supporting nanofibre mesh. This mesh was then silane coated and infiltrated with either epoxy resin or an unfilled Bis-GMA resin. The flexural strength of the produced samples was measured and compared to that of unfilled resin samples. Using this method cellulose acetate nanofibres were successfully electrospun in the 286 nm range. However, resin infiltration of this mesh resulted in samples with a flexural strength less than that of the unfilled control samples. <b>Air</b> <b>inclusion</b> during preparation and incomplete wetting of the nanofibre mesh was thought to cause this reduction in flexural strength.

The total concentration of air bubbles and air hydrates wasanalysed and validated by air mass balance. The inclusion size distributions were describedwith probability functions and with normalized distribution functions, allowing to distinguishbetween climatic signals and physical processes in a hydrate inclusion ensemble. Two typesof distribution functions were observed. A log-normal function characterizes a distribution ofair bubbles above the bubble-hydrate transition zone. The hydrate ensemble in the transitionzone assumes the same log-normal distribution, which {{is characterized by}} the presence ofhydrates or bubbles with sizes larger than 2. 5 times the average. Such big hydrates disappearat the end of the transition zone and the distribution function assumes a Gaussian type. Toexplain this we suggest the hypothesis of bifurcation mechanical instability on sphericallyshaped hydrates. After bubble-hydrate transformation the hydrate assumes the spherical shapeof the pre-existing air bubble and becomes unstable due to the ice sheet pressure, as it is thecase for rigid inclusions in a plastic matrix. Spherically shaped hydrates become unstable andtransform to elliptical or multi-branch shapes as observed in the ice core. To validate thishypothesis a statistical analysis of number of hydrates having different shapes was conducted. The results confirm that evolution of the hydrate concentration with depth can be explainedby mechanical instability and splintering of the hydrates by ice flow...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of dissolved noble gases in water {{are widely used}} as a climate proxy to determine noble gas temperatures (NGTs); i. e., {{the temperature of the}} water when gas exchange last occurred. In this paper we make a step forward to apply this principle to fluid inclusions in stalagmites in order to reconstruct the cave temperature prevailing at the time when the inclusion was formed. We present an analytical protocol that allows us accurately to determine noble gas concentrations and isotope ratios in stalagmites, and which includes a precise manometrical determination of the mass of water liberated from fluid inclusions. Most important for NGT determination is {{to reduce the amount of}} noble gases liberated from <b>air</b> <b>inclusions,</b> as they mask the temperature-dependent noble gas signal from the water inclusions. We demonstrate that offline pre-crushing in air to subsequently extract noble gases and water from the samples by heating is appropriate to separate gases released from <b>air</b> and water <b>inclusions.</b> Although a large fraction of recent samples analysed by this technique yields NGTs close to present-day cave temperatures, the interpretation of measured noble gas concentrations in terms of NGTs is not yet feasible using the available least squares fitting models. This is because the noble gas concentrations in stalagmites are not only composed of the two components air and air saturated water (ASW), which these models are able to account for. The observed enrichments in heavy noble gases are interpreted as being due to adsorption during sample preparation in air, whereas the excess in He and Ne is interpreted as an additional noble gas component that is bound in voids in the crystallographic structure of the calcite crystals. As a consequence of our study's findings, NGTs will have to be determined in the future using the {{concentrations of}} Ar, Kr and Xe only. This needs to be achieved by further optimizing the sample preparation to minimize atmospheric contamination and to further reduce the amount of noble gases released from <b>air</b> <b>inclusions...</b>|$|R

Satisfactory results can be obtained using the Looyenga’s (1965) equations to estimate the density and wetness of snow cover, and equations of van Beek’s (1967) showing the distinction between RWV speeds velocities in snow cover and ice layers with different prevailing orientation and sizes of <b>air</b> or water <b>inclusions.</b> RWV in dry snow with density 300  kg/m 3 may vary by 32  m/µs, depending on whether the vertical or horizontal orientation of the <b>air</b> <b>inclusions</b> prevails therein. In ice with density 700  kg/m 3 effect of <b>air</b> <b>inclusions</b> orientation on differences in RWV is reduced to 5  m/µs. If the inclusions are not filled with air but with water, the difference in RWV in snow is 21  m/µs, and in ice is 24  m/µs. The RWV is affected not only by orientation of the inclusions, but their elongation. Twofold elongation of ellipsoidal <b>air</b> and water <b>inclusions</b> increases the difference in RWV in snow (with a density 300  kg/m 3) to 23  m/µs and 22  m/µs. These estimates show a noticeable influence of snow structure on RWV in snow cover. The reliability of the above RWV estimates depends significantly on a thermal state of the snow cover, and decreases during snowmelt and increases in the cold period. It strongly depends on accuracy of measurements of the RWV in snow cover and its separate layers. With sufficiently high accuracy of the measurements this makes possible to detect and identify loose layers of deep hoar and compact layers of infiltration and superimposed ice, which is important for studying the liquid water storage of snow cover and a glacier mass balance. Therefore, considerable attention should be given to accuracy of the RWV measurements in dry and wet snow cover and its individual layers. With sufficiently high accuracy of measurements of the RWV, this should allow revealing such layers and estimating their thickness and average density. </p...|$|R
40|$|ERS- 1 SAR {{imagery of}} lake ice growing on shallow tundra lakes in {{northern}} Alaska shows interesting radar backscatter variations. Based on {{the analysis of}} ice cores from these lakes, a multi-layer backscatter model comprised of the following elements has been developed: (1) specular air-ice; ice-water and ice-frozen soil boundaries; (2) an ice layer of variable thickness; (3) ice sub-layers with <b>air</b> <b>inclusions</b> of variable density, size and shape including spheres, prolate spheroids, and cylinders of finite length. Preliminary model results confirm that backscatter is a sensitive function of greater reflectivity than from an ice-frozen soil interface. The model has also been tested using bubble data derived from ice cores in April 1992. The modelled backscatter is compared with backscatter derived from ERS- 1 SAR images obtained {{at the same time}} as the fieldwork...|$|R
