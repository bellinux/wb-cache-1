60|$|Mr. Chaffanbrass, having {{finished}} his {{business with the}} key, at once began with the bludgeon. The bludgeon was produced, and was handed up to the bench, and inspected by the Chief Justice. The instrument excited great interest. Men rose on tiptoe {{to look at it}} even from a distance, and the Prime Minister was envied because for a moment it was placed in his hands. As the large-eyed little boy who had found it was not yet six years old, there was a difficulty in perfecting the thread of the evidence. It was not held to be proper to <b>administer</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> an infant. But in a roundabout way it was proved that the identical bludgeon had been picked up in the garden. There was an elaborate surveyor's plan produced of the passage, the garden, and the wall,--with the steps on which it was supposed that the blow had been struck; and the spot was indicated on which the child had said that he had found the weapon. Then certain workers in leather were questioned, who agreed in asserting that no such instrument as that handed to them had ever been made in England. After that, two scientific chemists told the jury that they had minutely examined the knob of the instrument with reference to the discovery of human blood,--but in vain. They were, however, of opinion that the man might very readily have been killed by the instrument without any effusion of blood at the moment of the blows. This seemed to the jury to be the less necessary, as three or four surgeons who had examined the murdered man's head had already told them that in all probability there had been no such effusion. When the judges went out to lunch at two o'clock the jury were trembling as to their fate for another night.|$|E

In Germany during the Third Reich, medical students did not take the Hippocratic Oath, although they knew the ethic of [...] "nil nocere" [...] — do no harm.|$|E

In its early years the Order had had a lengthy ritual that was heavily influenced by Freemasonry. It worked three degrees - Endentured Apprentice, fellow Workman and Perfect Artisan.

60|$|The consuls {{departed}} from Rome {{to join the}} army, Æmilius attended by a moderate number of men of rank and station, and Varro by a much larger train, though it was formed of people of the lower classes of society. The army was organized, and the arrangements of the encampments perfected. One ceremony was that of <b>administering</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> the soldiers, as was usual in the Roman armies at the commencement of a campaign. They were made to swear {{that they would not}} desert the army, that they would never abandon the post at which they were stationed in fear or in flight, nor leave the ranks except for the purpose of taking up or recovering a weapon, striking an enemy, or protecting a friend. These and other arrangements being completed, the army was ready for the field.

40|$|Ninety-four {{percent of}} U. S. and 63 % of Canadian medical chools <b>administered</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> their graduating {{students}} in 1977. This making a 'profession' {{of the values}} of the medical profession has undergone a continuous and striking increase since at least 1928. The only factors which may be related to a U. S. school not giving <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> are its being located in a North Central State and its having a large number of basic science doctoral students (perhaps a reflection of the school's commitment to basic science research). It is argued that it may be legitimate to consider that those values which are more frequently noted in the oaths are those which are held to be more important than those which are less frequently mentioned. Based on this assumption, a comparison of the oaths given in 1958 with those given in 1977 suggests {{that there has been a}} decline in the importance that medical schools and/or graduating students hold certain values which have been traditionally ascribed to physicians-in-service-to-others (e. g. confidentiality, welfare of patient, and avoidance of injury) while at the same time there has been no change in the importance of values associated with physicians-in-relation-to-the-medical-profession (e. g. concern with the status of the physician and respect for teachers). This, then, raises the possibility of there existing the interesting paradox that, although at this level of the medical profession, the profession is talking more, they are promising less. ...|$|R

Bar Kappara told that an angel in the likeness of Moses came down and divided it. Rabbi Isaac taught that a Heavenly Voice came from Mount Horeb, saying that this much is half of the blood.

In the {{following}} months, Kolb was also elected mayor of Speyer and deputy in the Bavarian parliament for the riding of Speyer-Frankenthal. Bavaria rejected the new constitution worked out by the national assembly. On 28 April 1849, the Speyer city council supported a demand by the people's association for the Bavarian parliament to convene {{in order to put}} pressure on King Maximilian II. On the very same day, Frederick William IV of Prussia rejected the crown offered to him by the national assembly in Frankfurt.As of 2 May 1849, a provisional revolutionary government was formed in Kaiserslautern; it declared allegiance to the new constitution and secession of the Palatinate from Bavaria. Mayor Kolb addressed the people from the balcony of the city hall and <b>administered</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> the constitution. The following day, the citizens put up barricades to prevent Prussian troops from marching through in order to strengthen the garrison in Landau. On 21 May, for a few days, the revolutionary government moved to Speyer where it sacked several civil servants of the district government which did not recognise the new constitution. The black-red-golden flag of the revolution was flown from the cathedral and Friedrich Hilgard was appointed as new commissioner for the Palatinate. Hilgard confiscated all available public funds, sacked further servants loyal to the old government and levied a compulsory loan. Members of the old Palatinate government that hadn't left town were arrested. In the beginning of June, Kolb tried to cool the revolutionary fervour at which the provisional government dissolved the city council. Yet, in the local elections on 9 June almost the same council was put back in place. This was the first local election in Speyer in which all male citizens of full age were allowed to vote. On 13 June, Prussian troops invaded the Palatinate; Speyer was occupied on 16 June without resistance.As agreed, Bavarian troops took over on 21 June imposing martial law on the rebellious province. The Palatine uprising was put down and the old government was re-installed. Any revolutionary activities were considered as high treason. The NSZ was prohibited, Kolb was imprisoned in Zweibrücken until January 1850 and censorship was tightened considerably.|$|R

40|$|Peer reviewedThe Kenya Land and Freedom Army, {{otherwise}} called Mau-Mau, {{began their}} freedom war against British colonialism {{in the late}} 1940 s by first <b>administering</b> <b>a</b> binding <b>oath</b> <b>to</b> its recruits. In turn, the guerrilla war, which was mainly waged {{by the people of}} Central and Eastern Kenya, reached its climax in the mid-fifties. The injustices that its leadership cited as justification for their military activities can be explained in various ways: Firstly, the five million Africans who lived in the British colony of Kenya failed to gain any meaningful form of political representation. Secondly, the war was caused by other issues that dominated African politics since 1903 to 1952, such as land alienation, racial discrimination and the low level of African wages, among others. Thirdly, the heavy taxation was used by the European settlers as a weapon to execute their plan. Fourthly, the forced carrying of the Kipande – an identity card. During the war, three types of oaths were administered: umemba oath for recruitment, the batuni-oath for those who were sent to the forest and the atongoria oath that was administered to the leaders of the movement at all levels. The tension and conflict between the Anglican Church and the Mau-Mau rebellion were clear in the Kirinyaga County, particularly when the revolutionary rebels began to burn churches, schools and killed church leaders in early 1950 s. In view of this, this article sets out to unveil the problem that caused the conflict between the church and Mau-Mau rebels {{and the way in which}} it was addressed. The article is based on the premise that the Anglican Church was a “British church” automatically means that mistrust was bound to set in.
