500|$|After {{returning}} to Grand Rapids in 1946, Ford became active in local Republican politics, and supporters {{urged him to}} take on Bartel J. Jonkman, the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed {{his view of the}} world. [...] "I came back a converted internationalist", Ford wrote, [...] "and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated isolationist. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> ought to be replaced. Nobody thought I could win. I ended up winning two to one." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee Larkins, {{who played}} for Purdue {{and was one of}} the top {{defensive}} backs in the Big Ten, said in 1976 that Bell was the best running back he ever played against. [...] As a senior, Larkins played against Gordon Bell, Archie Griffin, and Ricky Bell of USC. [...] Larkins said: [...] "Gordon Bell was the best of the three. [...] He was a super tough runner and a tough guy to make a solid tackle on. [...] Gordon has a lot more speed and more moves than Archie does, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was a better all around player." ...|$|E
500|$|A washed-up former pilot {{called out}} of {{retirement}} by the Pan Pacific Defense Corps. On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had an earnest, really honest nature. And {{he was the kind}} of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you meet me, in the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E

500|$|Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, a {{cartoonist}} for the San Francisco Chronicle. While {{researching the}} film, Fincher considered Gyllenhaal to play Graysmith. According to the director, [...] "I really liked him in Donnie Darko <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>He's</b> an interesting double-sided coin. He {{can do that}} naive thing but he can also do possessed." [...] To prepare for his role, Gyllenhaal met Graysmith and videotaped him in order to study his mannerisms and behavior.|$|R

500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out. If I run into him again, we can have a good laugh about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E
500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was that I {{was the only one who}} wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I was the only one in opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, Eastwood {{told the}} UK's Daily Mail that [...] "I loved {{the fact that}} Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E

2500|$|Branson has guest starred, usually playing himself, {{on several}} {{television}} shows, including Friends, Baywatch, Birds of a Feather, Only Fools and Horses, The Day Today, a special {{episode of the}} comedy Goodness Gracious Me and Tripping Over. Branson made several appearances during the nineties on the BBC Saturday morning show Live & Kicking, where he {{was referred to as}} 'the pickle man' by comedy act Trev and Simon (in reference to Branston Pickle). Branson also appears in a cameo early in XTC's [...] "Generals and Majors" [...] video. [...] He was also the star of a reality television show on Fox called [...] (2004), in which sixteen contestants were tested for their entrepreneurship and sense of adventure. It did not succeed as a rival show to Donald Trump's The Apprentice and only lasted one season. According to Trump, Branson's [...] "show was terrible. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was terribly miscast. He’s a lot of hot air, like his balloons".|$|E
2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable storylines {{involving}} Kathy was her rape by yuppie bar owner James Willmott-Brown, played by William Boyde. It {{was the second time}} that the character had been raped, as Kathy's backstory had revealed that she had been raped at the age of fourteen, resulting in a pregnancy — Kathy gave her baby daughter away for adoption, although these events were not seen on-screen, as Kathy was already in her 30s when the serial began. Taylforth has revealed that she was apprehensive about the storyline when it was originally pitched. She has commented to the Walford Gazette, [...] "I didn't think it was a great idea at first. That Kathy was being raped {{for the second time in}} her life bothered me. And second, I didn't think Wilmott-Brown was a very likely rapist. I loved working with William Boyde, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> played it brilliantly. It was his idea to step up Wilmott-Brown's drinking in order for the rape to make some sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Sharapova {{had beaten}} fellow Russian Anastasia Myskina at the 2004 WTA Tour Championships, Myskina criticized Sharapova's father, saying: [...] "He was just yelling and {{screaming}} instructions to her <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> just might jump right on the court {{at one point in}} the match." [...] At the Fed Cup semifinals two weeks later, Myskina stated she would stop playing for Russia if Sharapova joined the Russian team the following season: [...] "If she joins our team next season you won't see me there for sure. His behaviour is totally incorrect, simply rude. I don't want to be around people like him." [...] Larisa Neiland, assistant to Russia Fed Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, added: [...] "Her father's behaviour (at the WTA Tour Championships) was simply outrageous. I just don't see how he could work with the rest of us." [...] However, Tarpishchev himself played down the problem, insisting: [...] "I feel that things will calm down soon and we'll have Myskina, Sharapova, Kuznetsova and everyone else playing for Russia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{decided to}} try being a solo act with a change of scenery. In late 1967, funded by a small family inheritance, he moved to London, living in various areas: Notting Hill, Belgravia, and Chelsea. After {{recording}} some demos in Soho, his friend Kortchmar gave him his next big break. Kortchmar used his association with the King Bees (who once opened for Peter and Gordon), to connect Taylor to Peter Asher. Asher was A head for the Beatles' newly formed label Apple Records. Taylor gave a demo tape of songs, including [...] "Something In The Way She Moves," [...] to Asher, who then played the demo for Beatles Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney remembers his first impression: [...] "I just heard his voice and his guitar <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> was great [...] and he came and played live, {{so it was just}} like, 'Wow, he's great.'" [...] Taylor became the first non-British act signed to Apple, and he credits Asher for [...] "opening the door" [...] to his singing career. Taylor said of Asher, who later became his manager, [...] "I knew from the first time that we met that he was the right person to steer my career. He had this determination in his eye that I had never seen in anybody before." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> might be clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who {{was a friend of}} a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the first}} day Hackman and Huston {{appeared}} in a scene together, Huston had to slap him, with her later saying the slap was real and [...] "I hit him a really good one. I saw the imprint of my hand on his cheek <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>he's</b> going to kill me". During young Margot's birthday scene in the opening scenes, Huston's hair caught fire from a birthday candle. Anderson credited Kumar Pallana with extinguishing the blaze before Huston was seriously injured. During the production, the bird used for Mordecai was captured by a citizen of New Jersey, who demanded a price for its return. The bird was instead replaced with one more white in color.|$|R
