50|$|The Scott {{designer}} William Cull {{had been}} experimenting with three-cylinder two-strokes throughout the 1930s and had developed a prototype 747 cc engine. The Scott Model 3S which was unveiled at the 1934 Olympia Motorcycle Show was a further development of this work, with the capacity enlarged to 986 cc and a four-speed gearchange. A notable feature of the Model 3S was the lubrication system, which had a throttle-operated pump drawing oil from the sump and delivering it to <b>a</b> <b>geared</b> <b>pump,</b> while <b>a</b> separate <b>geared</b> <b>pump</b> dealt with the return. Another unusual feature was that fuel was held in 'pannier' containers {{each side of the}} rear wheel so the apparent fuel tank was actually a dummy housing the instrumentation and control box (a feature later copied by the Honda Gold Wing). Only eight were produced before the outbreak of World War II. The final Model 3S is on display at the National Motorcycle Museum (UK).|$|R

50|$|Engines in {{hydraulic}} excavators {{usually just}} drive hydraulic pumps; {{there are usually}} 3 pumps: the two main pumps are for supplying oil at high pressure (up to 5000 psi) for the arms, swing motor, track motors, and accessories, {{and the third is}} a lower pressure (~700 psi) pump for Pilot Control, this circuit used for the control of the spool valves, this allows for a reduced effort required when operating the controls.

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the impeller inside the torque converter, the pump is typically <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> mounted between the torque converter and the planetary gearset. It draws transmission fluid from a sump and pressurizes it, which is needed for transmission components to operate. The input for the pump is connected to the torque converter housing, which in turn is bolted to the engine's flexplate, so the pump provides pressure whenever the engine is running and there is enough transmission fluid, but the disadvantage is that when the engine is not running, no oil pressure is available to operate the main components of the transmission, and is thus impossible to push-start a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission. Early automatic transmissions also had a rear pump for towing purposes, ensuring the lubrication of the rear-end components.|$|E

5000|$|The Detroit Diesel Series 51 was a {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} built by General Motors, Detroit Diesel Division from 1951 to 1959. Unlike other GM/Detroit Diesel engines, the 51 series designation did {{not refer to}} the cylinder displacement, but rather to the year it was introduced. Two versions were produced, an inline two-cylinder (2-51, 108 cid L) and an inline four-cylinder model (4-51, 216 cid L). It was a simplified version of the Series 53 {{that did not have}} exhaust valves. This was accomplished by using loop scavenging ports for both intake and exhaust along with a mechanical blower. This engine used a dry sleeve with 9 intake ports and three exhaust ports in that sleeve. These sleeves were located {{in such a way that}} the exhaust ports lined up with exhaust ports in the block that were physically higher than the intake ports in the block. This resulted in pressurized cool air being forced through the intake ports just after the exhaust started exiting (note that the exhaust ports in the sleeves were higher at the top than the intake ports while the bottom of all ports in the sleeve are at the same height. The net compression ratio is 18:1. Unlike a two cycle gasoline engine, the crankcase was not used to draw in the fuel/air mixture. Instead, the blower forced air in the intake ports and fuel was injected by a camshaft actuated injector which was pressurized by <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump.</b> As fuel is injected just before top dead center, little unburned fuel is expelled in the exhaust, unlike a two-cycle gasoline engine. The elimination of exhaust valves reduced the complexity and weight of the engine. The power output and RPM of this engine was controlled by governing the intake air and controlling the opening of the injectors with shutdown accomplished by completely closing off the air intake. The much lower weight of this engine compared to engines with valves made it quite suitable for applications where other engines of the same horsepower were not feasible. Its uses include: Marine propulsion, generators, pumps, air compressors, road graders and other industrial uses. It was never factory installed for automotive purposes but conversion kits and engines were made available for automotive use. This engine design did not see widespread use due to not being able to reduce the exhaust noise to an acceptable level, as any exhaust restriction would have resulted in a reduction of power and efficiency. It was a very fuel efficient engine with a high power output to fuel consumption ratio.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} method {{for the investigation}} of hydraulic fluid flow inside <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> model was performed during this study.

40|$|External spur <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{exceedingly}} useful {{components in}} common hydraulic systems. The main issue with external <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> {{is that all}} current models are limited to only fixed-displacement. This means that for every revolution of the <b>gears</b> inside the <b>pump,</b> <b>a</b> set amount of fluid will always be displaced. Consequently, external <b>gear</b> <b>pumps</b> are limited in their use because they can only operate at full throttle causing inefficiencies when reduced displacement is needed. The successful procurement of <b>a</b> variable displacement <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> will allow <b>a</b> more efficient use of hydraulic systems, {{such as in the}} displacement controlled systems used in some heavy construction equipment. In this research approach, the displacement is varied by changing the timing of the <b>gears</b> inside the <b>pump.</b> More specifically, changing the timing of the gearsâ connections with the inlet and outlet grooves alters the available volume in the gearsâ spaces, subsequently varying the displacement. With this in mind, additional research was conducted to develop an actuation system for the aforementioned process. This includes the design of new gears, bearing blocks, and additional hydraulics for use in a modified existing commercial pump. Simulations have shown the implementation of the design allowed for a 67 % reduction in displacement, and thus successful introduction of variable displacement into <b>an</b> external <b>gear</b> <b>pump.</b> Additional {{research is needed to determine}} the optimal designs for the actuation system and variable displacement concept used in the <b>gear</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} fault {{diagnosis}} methodology for <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> {{based on the}} ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method and the Bayesian network. Essentially, the presented scheme is a multi-source information fusion based methodology. Compared with the conventional fault diagnosis with only EEMD, the proposed method is {{able to take advantage}} of all useful information besides sensor signals. The presented diagnostic Bayesian network consists of a fault layer, a fault feature layer and a multi-source information layer. Vibration signals from sensor measurement are decomposed by the EEMD method and the energy of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are calculated as fault features. These features are added into the fault feature layer in the Bayesian network. The other sources of useful information are added to the information layer. The generalized three-layer Bayesian network can be developed by fully incorporating faults and fault symptoms as well as other useful information such as naked eye inspection and maintenance records. Therefore, diagnostic accuracy and capacity can be improved. The proposed methodology is applied to the fault diagnosis of <b>a</b> <b>gear</b> <b>pump</b> and the structure and parameters of the Bayesian network is established.
