5|$|In the Australasian and Middle Eastern markets, {{to further}} {{differentiate}} the Aurion from its Camry sibling, Toyota equipped the Aurion exclusively with a 3.5-litre V6 engine. With the Camry, the company only offered the 2.4-litre four-cylinder version. Previously in these markets, {{prior to the}} introduction of the Camry XV40, Toyota had offered both four- and a six-cylinder powerplants. Along with the naturally aspirated version, Toyota produced an Australia-only supercharged TRD Aurion between 2007 and 2009 as tuned by Toyota Racing Development (TRD). At its release, Toyota claimed this performance variant to be the world's most powerful front-wheel drive car. The powertrains used in the Asian specification Camry vary slightly from those of the Aurion. As well as the 3.5-litre V6, two four-cylinder engines are offered in either 2.0- or a 2.4-litre form. These engines are teamed with a six-, four- and five-speed <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> respectively.|$|E
25|$|Powertrain {{options for}} the Camry XV40 {{comprised}} both four- and six-cylinder engines with manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The entry-level engine was a 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE four-cylinder in front-wheel drive configuration available with manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> both five-speed units. For the Japanese market only, an all-wheel drive variant of the 2.4-liter engine was available, although a four-speed automatic was the sole transmission fitted. All other XV40 series Camrys utilize front-wheel drive. XV40s produced in the United States from January 2009 saw the 2.4-liter 2AZ-FE powerplant replaced by the 2.5-liter 2AR-FE engine and with it bringing new six-speed manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions.</b> In some markets, the top-level powertrain combination was a 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 engine paired exclusively to a six-speed automatic.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce costly downtime, {{adequate}} condition monitoring of the <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> components in heavy duty construction equipment is necessary. The transmission in such equipment enables to change the gear ratio automatically. Further, the bearings in an <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> provide low friction support to its rotating parts and act as an interface separating stationary from rotating components. Wear or other bearing faults may {{lead to an increase}} in energy consumption as well as failure of other related components in the <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission,</b> and thus costly downtime. In this study, different sensor data (particularly vibration) was collected on the <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> during controlled test cycles in an <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> test rig to enable adequate condition monitoring. An analysis of the measured vibration data was carried out using signal processing methods. The results indicate that predictive maintenance information related to the <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission</b> bearings may be extracted from vibrations measured on an <b>automatic</b> <b>transmission.</b> This information may be used for early fault detection, thus improving uptime and availability of heavy duty construction equipment...|$|R

25|$|For {{most years}} from 1959 to 1971, a three-speed manual {{transmission}} was standard equipment on all LeSabres but rarely ordered. Far more popular was the Turbine Drive automatic transmission (previously known as Dynaflow) along with power steering and power brakes. For 1961 and 1962, the automatic transmission was standard on the LeSabre {{and all other}} full-sized Buicks but in 1963 was {{moved back to the}} option list on LeSabres. For 1964, the Dynaflow-based Turbine Drive was replaced by two new <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions,</b> the two-speed Super Turbine 300 and the three-speed Super Turbine 400. A four-speed manual transmission was offered as a LeSabre option from 1963 to 1965 but {{only a small number of}} cars were so equipped. <b>Automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> would once again reappear as standard equipment on LeSabres in mid-1971 and continue in such form until the model line's demise after 2005.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} story of 1948 for Pontiac was the {{addition}} of Hydramatic automatic transmission as an option. As of 1948 only General Motors sold cars with fully <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> and the only other way to get one was to buy a higher priced Cadillac, Buick or Oldsmobile. Chevrolet would not introduce Powerglide until 1950, Ford FordoMatic until 1951 (Lincoln would start buying Hydramatics from GM in 1949), and Chrysler, PowerFlite on Imperials, until 1953. Hydramatic proved very popular {{with a total of}} 171,946 Pontiacs sold with it, or about 71% of all Pontiacs, and with 122,327 Streamliners equipped with it, or about 76% of all Streamliners, in its first year. Since Hydramatic was still only optional on Cadillac and Oldsmobile, and Dynaflow optional on Buick Roadmaster, given the total sales of Cadillac (50,619), Oldsmobile (173,661) and Buick Roadmaster (80,071), and the fact that Dynaflow was only introduced {{in the middle of the}} model year, this implies that probably over 40% of all cars sold with <b>automatic</b> <b>transmissions</b> in 1948 were Pontiacs.|$|E
