50|$|Closer {{linkages}} between trade and general economic planning in the 1980s had mixed effects. Fluctuating commodities prices {{at home and}} market-oriented trade with, and investment from, Western countries were too uncertain to plan. Consequently, the Second Five-Year Plan was crippled when hoped-for Western investment failed to materialize. The joint planning approach was designed to enable Vietnam to minimize risk because it could count on stable supplies of important resources and equipment at concessionary prices, especially from the Soviet Union. Any delays or bottlenecks in the plans or aid commitments of Comecon countries, however, could delay or disrupt Vietnam's planning effort. In the early 1980s, for example, announcement of the Third Five-Year Plan was delayed until the Fifth National Party Congress of March 1982 while Vietnam waited for the Soviet Union to confirm its <b>aid</b> <b>commitment.</b> Similarly, Vietnam in the mid-1980s endured first reduction, then elimination of Soviet price subsidies for purchases of Soviet oil. The reductions {{were in accordance with}} the then general Soviet practice of avoiding oil price subsidies in order to keep Comecon oil prices close to those of the world market. The volume of Vietnamese trade suffered increasingly from some of the recurring problems that troubled planners in other Comecon countries during this period, including overly optimistic targets, problems of regionalism, priorities often driven by ideology, and chronic shortages of domestically produced raw materials and industrial commodities. By 1987 observers had concluded that, despite Vietnam's financial ties with Comecon, increased investment and trade from Western countries and other non-Comecon sources would be required for a general Vietnamese economic recovery (following Vietnam's incursion into Cambodia in late 1978, numerous Western and regional aid donors had withdrawn their support and imposed a trade boycott).|$|E
50|$|Although the Vietnamese {{at first}} were adamant about United States {{economic}} assistance (their first postwar economic plan counted {{on the amount}} promised by President Nixon), the condition was dropped in mid-1978 when Hanoi made additional gestures toward normal relations. At that time, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach and the United States government reached an agreement in principle on normalization, but the date was left vague. When Thach urged November 1978, a date that in retrospect is significant because he was due in Moscow to sign the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union, Washington was noncommittal. During this period, United States officials were preoccupied {{with the question of}} the Indochinese refugees, and they {{were in the process of}} normalizing relations with China. This was an action that could have been jeopardized had Washington concurrently sought a rapprochement with Vietnam, a nation whose relationship with Beijing was growing increasingly strained. Policy makers in Hanoi correctly reasoned that the United States had opted to strengthen its ties with China rather than with Vietnam, and they moved to formalize their ties with the Soviets in response. Their original hope, however, had been to gain both diplomatic recognition from the United States and a friendship treaty with Moscow, as a double guarantee against future Chinese interference.In the United States, the issue of normalizing relations with Vietnam was complicated by Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in December 1978, the continuing plight of Vietnamese refugees, and the unresolved MIA issue. In 1987, under President Ronald Reagan, the United States continued to enforce the trade embargo imposed on Hanoi in 1975 and barred normal ties as long as Vietnamese troops occupied Cambodia. Any efforts to improve relations remained closely tied to United States willingness to honor its 1973 <b>aid</b> <b>commitment</b> to Vietnam and to Hanoi's failure to account for the whereabouts of more than 2,400 MIAs in Indochina. From the signing of the Paris agreements in 1973 until mid-1978, the Vietnamese had routinely stressed the linkage between the aid and MIA issues. Beginning in mid-1978, however, Hanoi dropped its insistence that the MIA and aid questions be resolved as a precondition for normalization and stopped linking the MIA question to other unresolved matters between the two countries. Vietnamese leaders contrasted their restraint on the MIA issue with its alleged political exploitation by the United States as a condition for normal relations. As additional signs of goodwill, Hanoi permitted the joint United States-Vietnamese excavation of a B-52 crash site in 1985 and returned the remains of a number of United States servicemen between 1985 and 1987. Vietnamese spokesmen also claimed during this period to have a two-year plan to resolve the MIA question but failed to reveal details.|$|E

Fitting a Bayesian linear regression model the empirical analysis finds that there is no strong correlation between changes in lagged <b>aid</b> <b>commitments</b> and changes in conflict intensity. Looking at the extensive margin the results do show that fungible aid is correlated with increased conflict risk, in line with rent-seeking behaviour, but the estimated magnitude of the coefficient is very small.

This study collects and analyzes Peking's foreign aid data from 1953 to 1989 in order to investigate Peking's foreign aid policy. In the internal dimension, it attempts to discover the relationships between the PRC's annual amount of <b>aid</b> <b>commitment</b> and its domestic political and economic development.

Bibliometric methods are used to evaluate the role of the Bank as a producer of knowledge on this specific issue. The potential influence of the World Bank’s main governance indicators: Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) and Doing Business, is depicted through what donors claim when allocating aid, and beyond rhetoric, through what correlations suggest.

Specifically, I consider how strategic interaction can lead donors to give less aid than they would ideally prefer. Using game theory, I find two main reasons for why a donor may give less aid than it would ideally prefer: 1) a donor may only want to provide aid on the condition of certain behavior by the recipient. If the donor believes or experiences that the recipient does not conform to this behavior, the donor may restrict aid even though it would ideally prefer to give more; 2) donors may see aid as a contribution to a public good, and be tempted to free ride on the efforts of each other. If the voluntary production of the good is Pareto suboptimal and effective enforcement mechanisms are absent, the resulting quantity of aid is unsatisfactory for the donor countries...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is compiled {{of three}} chapters {{in determining the}} effect of bilateral foreign assistance on the economy of Pakistan. The effect of foreign assistance will be {{measured in terms of}} public expenditure and revenue. The factors associated in the provision of aid commitments and disbursements, and the effect of bilateral assistance on the production efficiency of Pakistan. Chapter 1 uses an aid disaggregation approach to examine the impact of different types of bilateral donors on the fiscal sector of Pakistan, an important aid recipient in recent years. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the impact of bilateral aid on the economy of Pakistan, from the four largest donors, which include the USA, Japan, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Time series data for the period 1972 - 2010 were analyzed along with an estimation of a fiscal response model following Mavrotas (2005) that combines both aid disaggregation in terms of types of aid and the treatment of endogeneity. The empirical estimation of the structural equations and reduced form equations, using nonlinear three stage least squares estimation clearly suggests the importance of the above approach for delving deeper into aid effectiveness issues. Since different bilateral donors have different effects on key fiscal variables, an impact could not be revealed if a single figure for aid were employed. While aid from Japan increases public investment, aid from the USA, the UK, and Germany appears to cause a reduction in public investment. Similarly, aid from Japan reduces public consumption, but the aid from other donors causes an increase in public consumption. In regards to tax revenue, the aid flows from the USA, the UK and Germany leads to a reduction in tax revenue, but aid flow from Japan increases tax revenue. Chapter 2 investigates the relation between aid disbursements and aid commitments from the fourteen largest donors to Pakistan, and determine the factor that effects commitments and the disbursements. The time series data was employed for the period 1972 - 2010. The estimation of the model through fixed effect approach and two stage least squares approach showed that aid disbursements, <b>aid</b> <b>commitment</b> from donors to African countries, and Pakistan 2 ̆ 7 s membership at the United Nations Security Council effects aid commitments positively and significantly. But, the inverse relation existed between GDP per capita of Pakistan and aid commitments. Similarly, aid commitments relation with the aid disbursements was positive and significant. The war in Afghanistan during any time between 1972 - 2010 increases the aid disbursement to Pakistan. It was also determined that if the level of primary education increases, the aid disbursement to Pakistan decreases. The results also showed that when Pakistan is ruled by the military government the aid disbursements to Pakistan reduces. Chapter 3 focus is to see the impact of different bilateral donors on the production inefficiency of the Pakistan. To empirically estimate the effect of bilateral aid heterogeneity on production inefficiency, we use the time series data for Pakistan for the period 1972 - 2010. The stochastic frontier analysis was conducted using maximum likelihood estimation. The results determined that the aid from the United Kingdom (UK) and Germany tends to increase production efficiency of Pakistan. However on the contrary aid from Japan tends to decrease production efficiency. It was also concluded from the results that foreign direct investment and public investment also increases production efficiency. But, the relation between human capital and production efficiency was negative. Also, the results indicated that when Pakistan is ruled by the military government the aid flows from the USA and UK reduces production efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Some European Community (EC) {{countries}} give preferred {{market access}} and high prices to bananas from selected developing countries or EC regional suppliers. This preferential status {{is regarded as}} a form of aid to these countries, most of which are developing small island economies. EC marketers of bananas from these preferred suppliers also benefit because of the high retail prices. Nonpreferred suppliers - mainly developing countries of Latin America - are hurt by the policies because access is denied or restricted and the lower demand depresses the world price for bananas. The Community's commitment to establish a single unified EC banana market on December 31, 1992 provides a timely opportunity to reform existing distortionary trade policies. The recently announced proposal of the Commission of ECs to regulate banana trade within a unified market relies on quotas to control imports. The proposal is extremely complicated. It is designed to severely restrict competition and to maintain the advantages of selected groups. The authors update their earlier analysis of world banana trade to reflect the market in 1993. They evaluate the implications of the Commission's proposal alongside existing and alternative policies. They find that current policies cost EC consumers about $ 1. 6 billion annually to transfer a net benefit of $ 0. 3 billion a year to preferred suppliers. So, it costs EC consumers about $ 5. 30 to transfer $ 1. 00 of aid toselect developing countries or regions. Additionally, every dollar of aid reaching preferred suppliers costs other developing country suppliers $ 0. 32. EC marketers are the main beneficiaries. Of the $ 5. 30 cost to EC consumers, over $ 3. 00 is collected as excessive marketing margins by protected importers and wholesalers. About $ 1. 00 is lost in outright waste. Several plausible versions of the Commission's proposal are modelled. At best they are found to be slightly less costly than existing policies and at worst, considerably more costly. A 3. 5 percent reduction in the quota allocation is estimated to lead to a 30 percent increase in the cost of the proposal. The authors conclude that the Commission's proposal for a unified EC banana policy appears to be little more than a way of replacing existing distortionary national policies with an almost equally distortionary single policy and market. The only difference: the costs would be borne by consumers in all EC countries rather than consumers in only some countries. Worse still, costs could increase. Markets that now gain the benefits of mostly open and competitive marketing such as Germany would face closed and uncompetitive conditions. For developing countries exporting bananas, the proposal offers little. At best conditions may be no worse than they are now. At worst the policy could hurt Latin American suppliers even more than current policies and introduce considerable confusion about the level of support to preferred suppliers. Under the proposed quota system aid will not be well targeted. A more efficient way of achieving the EC's <b>aid</b> <b>commitment</b> is through a small tariff of about 17 percent, used to fund a system of well-targeted deficiency payments or direct aid. The only reason for choosing the Commission's proposal over simpler, tariff-based options seems to be to maintain the vested interests of protected EC markteters. But this is contrary to the objectives of unification, which are to seek gains from increased competition and trade.
