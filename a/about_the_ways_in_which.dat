He was intimidated, forced to watch videos on cults and told his church was just the same. He said he was watched 24 hours a day.

Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving {{him a chance to}} say anything in return, often tapping him or hitting him on the head to underscore his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the deprogramming had been concluded successfully and he had given up his beliefs.|$|E

This is also reflected in the way that Sofia has to buy her freedom from what she describes as an institution of intellectual prostitution; as well as the differences between the simple Runa who live in the countryside and the Jana'ata, who are the sophisticated city dwellers that created the beautiful music which triggered the mission originally.|$|E
