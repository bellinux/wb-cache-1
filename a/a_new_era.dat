5|$|After the war, {{increased}} wartime {{manufacturing and}} industrial growth ushered in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> of economic prosperity, and Indianapolis's population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 {{at the end}} of 1864. A real-estate boom led to the establishment of new residential suburbs, but the city retained its slums. Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, such as health care, utilities, street railways, and public schools. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, after decades of discussion. The city's iconic monument was dedicated on May 15, 1902.|$|E

In 2000, Roberts was named a Grand Prix Legend by the FIM.|$|E

5|$|Steel was {{produced}} in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use only began after more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the production of blister steel and then crucible steel.

5|$|The 1920s was <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>era</b> for Indian {{women and}} {{is defined as}} 'feminism' that was {{responsible}} for the creation of localised women's associations. These associations emphasised women's education issues, developed livelihood strategies for working-class women, and also organised national level women's associations such as the All India Women's Conference. AIWC was closely affiliated with the Indian National Congress. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, it worked within the nationalist and anti-colonialist freedom movements. This made the mass mobilisation of women an integral part of Indian nationalism. Women therefore were {{a very important part of}} various nationalist and anti-colonial efforts, including the civil disobedience movements in the 1930s.|$|E
