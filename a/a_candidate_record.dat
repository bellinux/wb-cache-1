Official numbers were not reported in the caucus states of Iowa, Nevada, Washington, and Maine.

In Texas, two-thirds of pledged delegates were selected through a primary, while one-third were selected through caucuses. However, voters were eligible to participate in the caucuses only if they also voted in the primary, so RealClearPolitics used the primary results and ignored the caucus in determining the popular vote.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The work draws a {{parallel}} between photonic bandgap (PBG) materials and optical holograms. Macrosco– pic {{figures of merit}} are introduced for description of PBG crystals based on the similar ones for holographic recordings. A novel and relatively simple procedure is proposed for single-cycle fabrication of complex three-dimensional structures exhibiting a PBG. The interference wavefield obtained by coherent illumination and correspon– ding to a desired photonic bandgap structure is recorded within a volume photosensitive medium, thus reversing {{the role of the}} usual thick (Bragg) transmission phase holo– grams. The proposed figures of merit are analyzed to appraise the applicability of the method and its limitations.

25|$|Admission to the {{university}} is based upon holistic review of <b>a</b> <b>candidate’s</b> academic <b>record,</b> with the strongest consideration being given {{to those who have}} a combined ability score of 140 or higher. The combined ability score is calculated by adding the percentage of students in the applicant's graduating class that the applicant outranks and the percentage of students the applicant outscored on a nationally standardized test (usually the ACT, although the SAT is also accepted). Admissions decisions are also based, however, on a mandatory application essay, the applicant's resume, and the applicant's high school and extracurricular record. According to the Princeton Review, Truman has a selectivity rating of 88, a 68% acceptance rate, with applicants having a 3.79 average high school GPA, and an 88% retention rate after freshman year. All applicants must have 4 credits of English, 3 credits of math, 3 credits of science, 2 credits of foreign language, 2 credits of social studies, and 1 credit of fine art. The average GPA of an admitted student is 3.25 on a 4.0 scale, with 50% of all admitted students ranking in the top 10% of their class, and the median ACT range is 25–31.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Similarity {{searches}} {{are essential}} in many applica-tions including data cleaning and near duplicate detection.

A {{major focus of}} those algorithms has been on how {{to reduce the number}} of <b>candidate</b> <b>records</b> in the early stage of similarity query processing. One of the most commonly used techniques to reduce the candidate size is the prefix filtering principle, which exploits the document frequency ordering of tokens. In this paper, we propose a novel partitioning technique that considers multiple token orderings based on token co-occurrence statistics.

40|$|A novel metallized azo dye {{has been}} synthesized. The {{absorption}} spectra of the thin film and thermal characteristic are measured. Static optical recording properties {{with and without}} the Bi mask layer super-resolution near-field structure (Super-RENS) of the metal-azo dye are investigated. The {{results show that the}} metal-azo dye film has a broad absorbance band in the region of 450 - 650 nm and the maximum absorbance wavelength is located at 603 nm. It is also found that the new metallized azo dye occupies excellent thermal stability, initiatory decomposition temperature is at 270 degrees C and the mass loss is about 48 % in a narrow temperature region (15 degrees C). The complex refractive index N (N = n + ik) is measured. High refractive index (n = 2. 45) and low extinction coefficient (k = 0. 2) at the recording wavelength 650 nm are attained. Static optical recording tests with and without Super-RENS are carried out using a 650 nm semiconductor diode laser with recording power of 7 mW and laser pulse duration of 200 ns. The AFM images show that the diameter of recording mark on the dye film with the Bi mask layer is reduced about 42 %, compared to that of recorded mark on the dye film without Super-RENS. It is indicated that Bi can well performed as a mask layer of the dye recording layer and the metallized azo dye can be <b>a</b> promising <b>candidate</b> for <b>recording</b> media with the super-resolution near-field structure...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{information}} extraction is to extract database records from text or semi-structured sources. Traditionally, information extraction proceeds by first segmenting each <b>candidate</b> <b>record</b> separately, and then merging records that {{refer to the}} same entities. While computationally efficient, this approach is suboptimal, because it {{ignores the fact that}} segmenting one <b>candidate</b> <b>record</b> can help to segment similar ones. For example, resolving a well-segmented field with a lessclear one can disambiguate the latter’s boundaries. In this paper we propose a joint approach to information extraction, where segmentation of all records and entity resolution are performed together in a single integrated inference process. While a number of previous authors have taken steps in this direction (e. g., Pasula et al. (2003), Wellner et al. (2004)), to our knowledge this is the first fully joint approach. In experiments on the CiteSeer and Cora citation matching datasets, joint inference improved accuracy, and our approach outperformed previous ones. Further, by using Markov logic and the existing algorithms for it, our solution consisted mainly of writing the appropriate logical formulas, and required much less engineering than previous ones...|$|R
