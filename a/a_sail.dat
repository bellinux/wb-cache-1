5|$|The {{sheer number}} of guns fired {{broadside}} meant <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her hull, knocking down masts, wrecking her rigging, and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was {{as little as a}} few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.|$|E
5|$|Provisions {{were now}} running low, {{and with the}} rescue mission overdue, Maxwell began formulating a plan to capture {{sufficient}} proas {{to escape from the}} island. While the plan was being proposed <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> was spotted on the horizon, heading toward the island. The appearance of this vessel, coupled with a sudden attack spearheaded by Alceste's marines, caused the pirates to flee. The rescue ship was Ternate, a 16-gun brig belonging to the British East India Company's navy, the Bombay Marine, despatched by Lord Amherst on the day of his arrival in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Spinosaurus {{has long}} been {{depicted}} in popular books about dinosaurs, although only recently has there been enough information about spinosaurids for an accurate depiction. After an influential 1955 skeletal reconstruction by Lapparent and Lavocat based on a 1936 diagram by Stromer, it has been treated as a generalized upright theropod, with a skull {{similar to that of}} other large theropods and <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> on its back, even having four-fingered hands.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> {{sailboat}} or <b>sailing</b> boat is <b>a</b> boat propelled partly or {{entirely by}} <b>sails</b> smaller than <b>a</b> <b>sailing</b> ship. Distinctions in what constitutes <b>a</b> <b>sailing</b> boat and ship vary by region and maritime culture.|$|R

50|$|The board {{moves through}} the water - much like <b>a</b> <b>sailing</b> boat does - using an {{extendable}} centreboard (if available) and fin or skeg for stability and lateral resistance. The centreboard is retracted at broad points of sail, again similarly to <b>a</b> <b>sailing</b> boat, to allow for jibing control. In these conditions windsurf boards also tack and jibe like <b>a</b> <b>sailing</b> boat.|$|R
5|$|The six {{pieces of}} painted Italian maiolica, or painted and tin-glazed earthenware, are all {{larger than the}} average, and there are none of the dishes that {{are the most common}} maiolica shape. The {{earliest}} piece is a large statue of Fortuna standing on a dolphin, holding <b>a</b> <b>sail,</b> by Giovanni della Robbia, made in Florence about 1500–10. This is a rare representative of the Early to High Italian Renaissance in the bequest.|$|E
5|$|A French frigate {{squadron}} sent to on {{a cruise}} in the Northern Bay of Biscay in the early autumn of 1793 was commanded by Captain Zacharie Allemand and consisted of the frigates Carmagnole, Résolue, Sémillante and Uranie with the brig-corvette Espiègle. On 22 October, the squadron sighted the 16-gun Spanish brig Alcoudia and Allemand ordered Uranie under Captain Jean-François Tartu to separate from the squadron and pursue the Spaniard. Uranie was easily able to capture Alcoudia, taking the prisoners on board the frigate and establishing a prize crew on the brig. Two days later, Uranie was sailing southwards in company with the prize with the wind at the southwest, when <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> appeared to the north at 09:30.|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such <b>a</b> <b>sail,</b> {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E

5|$|Ganteaume's {{surviving}} squadron gradually outran Keith's pursuit and on 24 June was sailing off Cape Derna when <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> was sighted to the northeast. Ganteaume {{ordered his}} ships to pursue, {{and the strange}} ship was discovered to be the British ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, which had been despatched by Keith to warn Warren's squadron that Ganteaume was in the Eastern Mediterranean. Although he attempted a series of increasingly desperate manoeuveres {{in his efforts to}} escape, Hallowell's ship was in poor repair and under-crewed and after a short exchange of fire, was forced to surrender. Without any warning, Warren was not able to intercept Ganteaume's return, and the French squadron was able to reach Toulon unharmed on 22 July.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that the evolution of <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> in Dimetrodon {{was related to the}} evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that the sail of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar to}} that of the sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E
5|$|In July 1816, Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley {{toured the}} Alps and visited Chamouni (as {{it was then}} known), {{as well as the}} Mer de Glace and the Bossons Glacier. They jointly {{published}} their accounts and letters in a work entitled: History of a Six Weeks' Tour through a part of France, Switzerland, Germany, and Holland; with Letters Descriptive of <b>a</b> <b>Sail</b> Round the Lake of Geneva and of the Glaciers of Chamouni. The book concludes with Mont Blanc, a 144-line poem by Percy Shelley, written whilst in Chamonix and which was inspired by the river Arve, the snow-covered summits, the chaotic glaciers and the forests that he experienced during their visit.|$|E
50|$|Originally <b>a</b> <b>sailing</b> {{schooner}} {{built in}} 1879, the General Miles was extensively reconstructed in 1890 and renamed Willapa.

5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to be}} able to splice ropes, reef <b>a</b> <b>sail,</b> work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected {{to be able to keep}} a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June, Nymphe was {{cruising}} alone off the Devon coast under Captain Edward Pellew when <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> {{appeared to}} the south east. Closing to investigate, Pellew rapidly identified the ship as Cléopâtre and gave chase, the French frigate initially fleeing but Captain Jean Mullon then turning to fight as Nymphe began to overtake his ship. At 06:15, with both crews cheering loudly, the frigates exchanged broadsides, the action lasting 50 minutes. Both ships fought hard, but at 07:10 the British crew were able to successfully board the French frigate and haul down the tricolour. Mullon was mortally wounded in the engagement, and his crew lost 63 casualties compared to 50 on board Nymphe. Pellew returned to Britain with his prize, the first major French warship captured during the conflict, and was proclaimed a hero.|$|E
5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the {{building}} by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E

For square-rigged ships, this maneuver is called wearing ship.|$|R
5|$|The first ferries {{crossing}} the Dordogne were flat-bottomed boats driven by oars or keelboats driven by <b>a</b> <b>sail.</b> The passage was very risky and accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide river. The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by}} a two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large paddle wheel. In good weather, the crossing time was improved to 30–45minutes, but in bad weather the trip remained uncertain.|$|E
5|$|After fleeing Aboukir Bay, Admiral Villeneuve {{had been}} delayed in the Eastern Mediterranean by northeasterly winds, and on 17 August {{he decided to}} split his forces, sailing for Malta with his {{flagship}} Guillaume Tell and the two frigates while Captain Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille on Généreux was ordered to Corfu. Before they departed, a number of men were transferred to Généreux, which was already carrying survivors from Timoléon, one of the ships destroyed in Aboukir Bay, giving Généreux a crew of 936 men. As Généreux rounded the island of Goza off the western tip of Crete (then known as Candia) on the following morning, his lookouts reported <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> to the northwest. This vessel was Leander. Learning of the strange ship to the southeast, Captain Thompson deduced {{that it must be}} one of Villeneuve's ships and immediately ordered all sails set in an effort to avoid an unequal combat: Généreux carried 30 more guns than Leander and was more strongly built, carrying a broadside of over 1,000lbs to Leanders 432lbs.|$|E
5|$|Dividing the {{captured}} British sailors, Lejoille transferred half to Généreux and left half on Leander with a French prize crew under Louis Gabriel Deniéport. In direct contravention {{of the established}} conventions of war, both sets of prisoners were immediately ordered to effect repairs to the vessels. Only once both ships were ready for the journey to Corfu were the prisoners given bread and water, although the wounded were still denied medical attention. For ten days after the engagement the battered ships sailed northwards against the wind, Généreux forced to attach a tow to Leander to avoid leaving the prize behind. On 28 August, <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> appeared to the south. Panic broke out on Généreux, and Lejoille ordered the prisoners confined below and for preparations {{to be made to}} abandon Leander and make all speed for Corfu. The new arrival was in fact the 16-gun British sloop HMS Mutine under Lieutenant Thomas Bladen Capel, carrying the second copies of Nelson's despatches to Britain. Capel sighted the ships to the north, but assumed that they were Généreux and Guillaume Tell and so passed by displaying French colours. Lejoille was not fooled by the disguise but did not pursue the small vessel, continuing his passage to Corfu once Mutine had sailed out of sight.|$|E
