50|$|The {{state of}} wearing a prison uniform {{in many cases}} provokes a {{distressful}} psychological response from the detained person, as unlike civilian clothes it is worn involuntarily, typically reluctant and is often perceived as stigmatizing. The imperative regulation of a person's outward appearance is typically perceived as a steep invasion into the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision.</b> As a consequence the loss of individuality particularly caused by having to wear a prison uniform can have a detrimental effect to a person's self-perception and self-esteem. Therefore a prison uniform is often perceived as an implicit element of punishment and a stigma, while the level of psychological distress and humiliation caused by the garment is in large part determined by its characteristic and overall design.|$|E

The need to achieve high quality economie performance brings about cooperative organizational patterns characterized by staff control over members, who progressively lose their <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision.</b> The acceptance of this model is determined by two reasons: the interest in members' for cooperative organizations capable of assuring them consistent returns from the agri-business activities and the need to eliminate the inefficiencies created by the competition between Catholic (righi or white) and Communist (left or red) cooperatives. The present economie crisis of many right and left cooperatives is the result of the ideological division that has influenced the cooperative movement and gradually drove them to be heavily dependent on political parties.

40|$|Within the {{tradition}} of ‘civil society tribunals’, the World Tribunal on Iraq (WTI) was an unprecedented endeavour in global scale, scope, structure and sophistication. Embedded within the global antiwar movement from 2003 to 2005, the WTI's praxis is provocative on several counts. While addressing the entanglement of cosmopolitan human rights ideals with imperial politics, this essay reflects on competing grammars of justice and legitimacy imagined by WTI activists {{in response to the}} occupation of Iraq. It also critiques what I call the instrumentalization thesis of human rights. Promulgators of this thesis typically posit that agents pursuing a distinctly imperial project are insincerely mobilizing cosmopolitan human rights ideals. Further, in order to enquire into cosmopolitan politics occasioned by the war in Iraq, and to magnify its tensions, the essay focuses on particular dilemmas faced by WTI activists while mobilizing several theorists and jurists of (cosmopolitan) democracy and (global) justice in this action. In particular, the essay interprets the ultimate controversy within the WTI network occasioned by Amnesty International's 2005 campaign for a ‘human rights based constitution in Iraq’, as well as disagreements on the ‘sources’ of the WTI's own legitimacy at its founding meeting. These debates and disagreements, the essay argues, evidence cosmopolitical tensions between the human and the citizen, between universal principles and constituted <b>autonomies</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision,</b> between universal and national paradigms of justice. Among the questions the essay raises are the following. How can one distinguish the cosmopolitan ethos of concern and responsibility predicating the legitimacy of the WTI, from the cosmopolitan ethos which conferred legitimacy, ex ante or ex post facto, to the constitution of a liberated, ‘democratic’ Iraq? On the threshold between the legal and the legitimate, the rule and the exception, what is the foundation, if any, of human rights politics...|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the reorientation of the Swiss as well as the European agricultural policy, prices for agricultural products drop and farmers have to reduce their production costs or will lose income. Therefore a lot of farmers have a high incentive to change their production structures. One of the most effective strategies to reduce production costs is going into cooperation and collaboration with other farmers. Therewith farmers can profit from scale effects without changing the property rights. Several case studies as well as results from modeling reveal that farmers have more income with less workload. In reality only 3 % of Swiss farmers have gone into a collective farming system. Weaker forms of cooperation like sharing machinery are more common between farmers. Their main reasons not going into cooperation are often the loss of <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> in combination with financial risks. And here trust can act as a counterbalance. Farmers with positive experiences from weaker forms of cooperation are able to assess their partners regarding trust.

40|$|A new {{approach}} of coordination of decisions in a multi site system is proposed. It is based this approach on a multi-agent concept {{and on the}} principle of distributed network of enterprises. For this purpose, each enterprise is defined as autonomous and performs simultaneously at the local and global levels. The basic component of our approach is a so-called Virtual Enterprise Node (VEN), where the enterprise network is represented as a set of tiers (like in a product breakdown structure). Within the network, each partner constitutes a VEN, which is in contact with several customers and suppliers. Exchanges between the VENs ensure the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision,</b> and guarantiee the consistency of information and material flows. Only two complementary VEN agents are necessary: one for external interactions, the Negotiator Agent (NA) and one for the planning of internal decisions, the Planner Agent (PA). If supply problems occur in the network, two other agents are defined: the Tier Negotiator Agent (TNA) working at the tier level only and the Supply Chain Mediator Agent (SCMA) working {{at the level of the}} enterprise network. These two agents are only active when the perturbation occurs. Otherwise, the VENs process the flow of information alone. With this {{new approach}}, managing enterprise network becomes much more transparent and looks like managing a simple enterprise in the network. The use of a Multi-Agent System (MAS) allows physical distribution of the decisional system, and procures a heterarchical organization structure with a decentralized control that guaranties the autonomy of each entity and the flexibility of the network...|$|E

40|$|The {{standard}} of review analysis for judicial review of administrative action developed by the Supreme Court of Canada before Dunsmuir v New Brunswick had two important features. First, it provided a bulwark against interventionist judges, thereby protecting the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> administrative <b>decision</b> makers and promoting deference. Second, it was substantive, rather than formal, and moved the focus of judicial review away from abstract concepts and towards the eccentricities of statutory schemes. However, in its more recent forays into the general principles of judicial review, the Court has threatened to reverse its deferential and substantive course by following a formalistic, categorical approach. In this article I describe the Court’s efforts to reshape the law of judicial review of administrative action, critique these efforts as favouring a formalistic approach to judicial review, and suggest that in its haste to simplify the law of judicial review, the Court has jeopardized the due deference that should be accorded to administrative decision makers: It has erroneously favoured form over substance...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – usual {{counseling}} methods seeking healthy {{life are}} less effective in contemporary society. Motivational interviewing is declared {{as one of}} the best ways for changing unhealthy behaviors in short time period. The aim of this literature review is to find out how the model of motivational interviewing is made-up and how it is working in practice. Design/methodology/approach – literature review about motivational interviewing theoretical model and working mechanism was made. Findings – motivational interviewing is a patient centered counseling style which aims to support individuals to make adjustments in unhealthy behavior by reducing ambivalence and promoting self-directed changes. It has a number of characteristics which when used flexibly are crucial to the success of the counseling process. These are the demonstration of empathy, the development of discrepancy, the ability to roll with resistance and the promotion of self-efficacy. Motivational interviewing uses a guiding communication style to engage with patients, clarify their strengths and aspirations, evoke their own motivations for change, and promote <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making. It has been successfully applied with cardiac patients, in particular for those who need to make lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise, alcohol and medication adherence. Research limitations/implications – since we didn’t find any motivational interviewing research in Lithuania a question rises – how this technique works with Lithuanians.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a model with three overlapping generations of which only the middle one {{is able to}} work. There is a trade-off between food and bio-fuel pro- duction. We try to study this trade-off, its influence on economic growth and on resource consumption. The paper should state that even, if the current generation has the total <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> about the usage of all resources, they will never use them completely. The memebers of the current generation will always leave some resources for production because in the phase of retirement they depend on the income of the next generation, the latter paying back the credit obtained when beeing young. Furthermore, it states {{that as long as}} land is an essential input for producing the final product (including food) the amount of land devoted to bio-fuel production will not raise endlessly. The pure consumption loan model by Samuelson (1958) serves as basis for our Overlapping-Generations-Model, which we will integrate into a model of endogenous economic growth with resources, exogenous technical progress and land as a further input. For realization of the optimal consumption pattern, which leads to the maximum of utility, individuals have to make four decisions. They have to commit themselves on the exploitation rate of the non-renewable resource and on the amount of renewable resource used for production. Coincidentally, the allocation of land, necessary for food production and for renewable resource regeneration, and the amount of leisure time devoted for resource production have to be determined. The results are confirmed by numerical examples and will be reviewed by empirical data...|$|E
40|$|India is {{undertaking}} the world’s largest biometric ID card project – Aadhaar, also {{dubbed the}} "the world's biggest mass surveillance project". The government seems unaware, or unconcerned, {{that because of}} an inadequate legal framework for protecting citizens’ privacy this project will have catastrophic consequences. This overzealous project is obtaining demographic and biometric information and being forced upon Indian citizens, with no choice for an individual to opt-out of the system. The Indian government has claimed that setting up Aadhaar would establish a system of protection against wastage and corruption in the dispensation of social benefits. This draconian ID system is linking with every aspect of an individual’s life, from booking train tickets, registering marriages, or seeking scholarships, to mobile phone numbers, bank accounts, and schools and colleges. In many of these cases, it is mandatory. Thus, the government can exert absolute control by cross-referencing all transactions authenticated by or linked with Aadhaar. Indian society and politics {{has gone through a}} tectonic shift and is now in the grip of ‘absolutism’. Amid mounting governmental pressure, more than a billion Indians have signed up for Aadhaar. The aggregation of this data, along with various other data sets interlinked to Aadhaar, will enable the government to trace the movements, social relationships, and interactions of residents so that their private lives are laid bare. Seemingly innocuous, data when collated is capable of profiling residents’ lives. Once such data is in the government’s hands, wide latitude in access and use facilitates government abuse. Indeed, coercive application of Aadhaar creates a potential for mass surveillance, which in turn threatens the privacy of Indian citizens. We argue that this systemic mass invasion of privacy will diminish citizens’ <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> making: the choice of what to make public or keep private will no longer be theirs. In a high-octane, emotionally charged democracy like India, the fear of backlash will stop individuals from expressing disagreement with the government; they will increasingly self-censor their speech and interactions. Subjecting citizens to greater scrutiny and control will tilt the already imbalanced dynamics between the administration and the citizens, leading to erosion of democracy...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Transgenic crops have being {{grown in}} Brazil since 1995, however {{regulation}} for such crops only came into force in 2005, granting {{a key role}} to CTNBio (National Technical Committee on Biosafety). There are currently 19 transgenic varieties growing in Brazil and the risk perception {{of the general public}} is virtually unknown. This paper presents the results of a survey regarding the public´s risk perception. The survey is part of LAC-Biosafety, a multi-country capacity building project in compliance with the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB) determinations. It is a pioneering initiative that seeks to promote cooperation among Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru, all of which are considered mega-diverse countries. Although some authors, such as Oda and Soares (2000), Vogt and Polino (2003), Massarani and Moreira (2005), Guivant (2006), Furnival and Pinheiro (2008) and Gonzales et al (2009 a and b), have studied the population´s risk perception, this paper is groundbreaking {{in the sense that it}} explicitly incorporates in the same sample both users of the technology, and those who do not use the technology but are in some way affected by it. The conceptual model adopted for this study, based on Costa-Font et al (2008), Gracia (2003) and the EUROBAROMETRO methodology, considers that the decision-making, the public´s perception, the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> and the subjective knowledge is a result of a combination of scientific information and objective knowledge and culture ? such as beliefs and values. The sample was made up of 1442 individuals who filled out an online questionnaire containing 15 questions. Among the main results, it can be highlighted that (1) the general public considers the terminology used for means of communication inadequate; (2) knowledge about the GMO regulations, the Cartagena Protocol and the CTNBio is insufficient; (3) The negative perception is higher for terms such as ´transgenic plant´ and ´GMO´ and lower for terms such as ´biotechnology´ and ´genetic engineering´; (4) the public´s perception of transgenic plants destined for drugs production is better than of those destined for food production; (5) the public is more confident about information supplied by scientists and professors than that supplied by the government, the media and NGOs, even though these are the main channels for spreading information these days. 201...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the NATO Advanced Research Workshop ARW-STP 97464 on Reform of Government Scientific Laboratories developed at the University of Manchester, 3 - 5 June 1999. To be published in Philip Gummett, ed., Reform of Government Scientific Research Laboratories, Amsterdam: IOS Press, 2000 (in press). For almost thirty years the Spanish infrastructure for research and technological development was dominated by a single type of actor: Public Research Centres. All State efforts in R&D were channelled through PRCs, dependent upon specific Ministries. However in the eighties and in the nineties, Spanish Public Research Centres faced changes in their environment that simultaneously pressed them to make choices and offered them the instruments to adapt. The transformation of {{the environment in which}} PRCs operated was a consequence of both conscious political design aiming to reorganise the State action in support of research (the emergence of strategic R&D programmes) and of changes in the economic context of public research activity. A basic building block and a symbolic milestone of this reforming strategies was the approval in 1986 of the Law for the Promotion and General Coordination of Scientific and Technical Research (Law 13 / 1986), popularly known as the Law of Science. The Law made the PRCs more flexible to cope with the changes, by opening the door for diversification their sources of funding and by slightly changing from direct budgetary to non direct-budgetary appropriations. But these changes also contributed to enhance PRCs <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>decision</b> vis à vis their ministries of affiliation and the independence of individual researchers from the authority of the PRCs directors. All these transformations, together with the stagnation and later reduction in real terms of direct budget appropriations in the nineties, resulted in new pressures and incentives for PRCs to adapt. How did these changes affect the funding strategies of Spanish PRCs? If we were to take the funding strategies of the PRCs as the behavioural variable to be explained, the question is to what extent did this new environment produce the "adaptive reaction" of the PRCs. If we were to take the funding strategies of the PRCs as the behavioural variable to be explained, the question is to what extent did this new environment produce the "adaptive reaction" of the PRCs. The response of PRCs to this new environment varied considerably. One group of PRCs did in fact begin to diversify its sources of income, increasing the importance of non-budgetary sources over the total income of the organisation. Other PRCs, on the contrary, remained much the same, despite the new opportunities opened by the new regulations. What we try tentatively to explain in this paper is this variation in the degree of adaptation of the PRCs, measured by the proportion of external non direct ministerial budgetary appropriations in their total expenditures. We argue that the diverse dynamics of change of the various PRCs, in response to the new environment, could be explained mainly through the analysis of the institutional arrangements and organisational variables. We assume relevance of historical processes, that is "path dependency" and "organisational inertia". In other words, the diversity of outcomes observed when PCRs are confronted with similar changes in their environment is attributable to the different institutional arrangements and trajectories of each organisation. Our task here is to find commonalties and differences. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The latter research theme is crucial for us and political science has produced literature on it that is as vast in its consistency as it is fragmented in its theoretical interpretations. The outcome of this research question would have been quite different if it had been asked a couple of thousand years ago, to the hypothetical experts of political matters of the Greek and Roman world. They would probably not have hesitated to reply, with a certain uniformity of opinion, that the city is the functional prerequisite of any form of government. Quoting Aristotle’s first book of Politics, they would have reached the point of maintaining that outside the city there is no space for a truly human life, since the city alone enables the flourishing of the associative virtues that characterise the development of community life.

Materials and Methods: Pregnant women between the 15 th and 21 st gestational week were randomized into control and experimental groups, {{and were asked to}} complete a questionnaire before and after genetic counselling provided by researchers. The primary endpoints were the perceived level of understanding of serum screening for Down syndrome and the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>decision</b> making for this serum screening.

Results: Participants in the experimental group (n = 96) had a significantly higher perceived level of understanding of antenatal serum screening for Down syndrome than participants in the control group (n = 97). There were significantly more respondents in the experimental group making the decision themselves to undergo serum screening than women in the control group. Anxiety and depression levels were not significantly different between the women in the two groups. Conclusion: Pregnant women should be offered more information to allow them to make an informed decision before they undergo antenatal serum screening for Down syndrome. Comprehensive genetic counseling improved pregnant women's autonomy in deciding whether to participate in serum screening.
