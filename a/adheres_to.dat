The passage resolves in melodic unison as the instruments together state a rhythmic cadence, or tihai, {{to close the}} middle segment. After this, the drone is again prominent as the rhythm returns to 16-beat tintal for the final verse and chorus. On the finished recording, the tonal and spiritual tension is relieved by the inclusion of muted canned laughter.|$|E

5|$|The {{high bulk}} density of some ash {{deposits}} can cause line breakage and damage to steel towers and wooden poles due to ash loading. This is most hazardous when the ash and/or {{the lines and}} structures are wet (e.g., by rainfall) {{and there has been}} ≥10 mm of ash fall. Fine-grained ash (e.g., <0.5 mm diameter) <b>adheres</b> <b>to</b> lines and structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines. Snow and ice accumulation on lines and overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of lines and other hardware.|$|E
5|$|To obtain enough protein, aphids need to suck {{large volumes}} of sap. The excess sugary fluid, honeydew, is {{secreted}} by the aphids.

Various chemical treatments are available to kill the aphids and organic growers can use a solution of soft soap.|$|E
5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively <b>adheres</b> <b>to</b> copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid <b>adheres</b> <b>to</b> the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E

5|$|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{defines a}} Malay as a Malaysian citizen {{born to a}} Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, <b>adheres</b> <b>to</b> Malay customs, and is {{domiciled}} in Malaysia or Singapore.

Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and social behaviour, is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic groups as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E
5|$|Halo {{departs from}} {{traditional}} FPS conventions by not forcing the player character to holster its firearm before deploying grenades or melee-range blunt instruments; instead, both attacks can be utilized while a gun is still equipped, supplanting or supplementing small-arms fire. All weapons {{may be used}} to bludgeon enemies, which allows Master Chief to silently kill opponents without alerting other nearby enemies. The Chief can also carry up to eight grenades at a time: up to four fragmentation and four plasma grenades each. Like the game's other weapons, the two types of grenades differ; the fragmentation grenade bounces and detonates quickly, whereas the plasma grenade <b>adheres</b> <b>to</b> targets before exploding, sometimes with blackly comic results.|$|E
5|$|In soil, {{microorganisms}} that {{reside in}} the rhizosphere (a zone that includes the root surface and the soil that <b>adheres</b> <b>to</b> the root after gentle shaking) carry out nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen gas to nitrogenous compounds. This serves to provide an easily absorbable form of nitrogen for many plants, which cannot fix nitrogen themselves. Many other bacteria are found as symbionts in humans and other organisms. For example, the presence of over 1,000 bacterial species in the normal human gut flora of the intestines can contribute to gut immunity, synthesise vitamins, such as folic acid, vitamin K and biotin, convert sugars to lactic acid (see Lactobacillus), as well as fermenting complex undigestible carbohydrates. The presence of this gut flora also inhibits the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria (usually through competitive exclusion) and these beneficial bacteria are consequently sold as probiotic dietary supplements.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{ability of}} thioglycollate (TG) -elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages <b>to</b> <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> a laminin {{substratum}} has been studied.

However, patients {{do not have the}} right <b>to</b> refuse <b>to</b> <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> treatment prescriptions if their non-adherence poses a significant threat to other people. This paper also discusses the use of written agreements between physi-cians and patients as a strategy for promoting patient adherence...|$|R
40|$|A {{cytotoxic}} T-cell line, CTLL- 2 cells, showed spreading after <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> {{extracellular matrix}} proteins such as fibronectin (FN), laminin (LN) and hyarulonic acid (HA). The adhesion of CTLL- 2 cells to LN was mediated by very late activation antigen- 6 (VLA- 6). Expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) mRNA was enhanced in CTLL- 2 cells, also when they <b>adhered</b> <b>to</b> extracellular matrix proteins; and the enhanced IFN-gamma mRNA expression by <b>adhering</b> <b>to</b> LN {{was blocked by}} anti-alpha 6 antibody. Calphostin C, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, markedly inhibited the enhancement of IFN-gamma mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner, which suggested that PKC acted as a second messenger in the IFN-gamma mRNA expression mediated by the interaction of VLA- 6 with LN in CTLL- 2 cells. Furthermore, confocal laser-microscopic analysis and Western blot analysis revealed that PKC-alpha was activated after CTLL- 2 cells <b>adhered</b> <b>to</b> LN. PKC activity translocated from the cytosol fraction to the particulate fraction, after CTLL- 2 cells <b>adhered</b> <b>to</b> LN. Altogether, we suggest that PKC {{plays an important role}} in the signal transduction for IFN-gamma mRNA expression after cytotoxic T cells <b>adhere</b> <b>to</b> LN...|$|R

5|$|The Joker is {{considered}} one of, if not, the most-recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture (Batman's arguable equal), {{one of the best}} comic villains, and one of the greatest villains of all-time. The character was well-liked following his debut, appearing in nine out of the first twelve Batman issues, and remained one of Batman's most popular foes throughout his publication. The character {{is considered}} one of the four top comic book characters, alongside Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man. Indeed, when DC Comics released the original series of Greatest Stories Ever Told (1987–1988) featuring collections of stories about heroes like Batman and Superman, the Joker was the only villain included alongside them. The character has been the focus of ethical discussion on the desirability of Batman (who <b>adheres</b> <b>to</b> an unbreakable code forbidding killing) saving lives by murdering the Joker (a relentless dealer of death). These debates weigh the positive (stopping the Joker permanently) against its effect on Batman's character and the possibility that he might begin killing all criminals.|$|E
