40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analytical and experimental validation of an improved pneumatic suspension. This improvement {{is based on}} the right selection of the suspension elements, that is, the right selection of the <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>reservoir</b> size. As a result of this kind of selection, the suspension stiffness ratio is increased. This conclusion is taken from a previous work of these authors and allows showing both analytically and experimentally how the suspension presents better performance. The system is evaluated by means of a controlled sinusoidal sweep...|$|R
40|$|Aims of {{this paper}} are to define testing methods for {{airspring}} characterisation, and to investigate mathematical modelling approaches suitable to reproduce the behaviour {{of this type of}} suspension and their effect on the accuracy of rail vehicle dynamics multi-body simulation. Two different modelling approaches are considered for the airspring: a quasi-static one, suitable for vehicle dynamics simulations in curve and/or in presence of crosswinds, and a dynamic model which is used for the estimation of ride quality, in conjunction with a flexible carbody vehicle model. The results of these models are compared with those provided by simpler models, often used in multi-body simulations: it is demonstrated that the quasi-static modelling of the airspring can have a large effect on the simulation of load transfer effects in curve and in presence of crosswinds. Furthermore, it is shown that a dynamic model of the <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> is required to correctly asses ride comfort, especially when the pneumatic layout of the suspension includes a long pipe between the <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> and the <b>reservoir...</b>|$|R

Another tributary, Laguna Creek, flows northwards from Woodside with its source on Edgewood County Park and Natural Preserve, and historically fed Laguna Grande and then joined San Mateo Creek just upstream from Crystal Springs Canyon, where San Mateo Creek turned east to flow through the canyon. Laguna Grande was submerged when an earthen dam (this was the first Crystal Springs Dam) was constructed in 1877, forming Upper Crystal <b>Springs</b> <b>Reservoir.</b> The old earthen dam became a causeway between Upper and Lower Crystal <b>Springs</b> <b>Reservoirs</b> when the latter was formed by Herman Schussler's concrete Crystal Springs Dam, which dammed up San Mateo Creek in 1888 to form the lower reservoir. The causeway is now crossed by Highway 92. In addition to San Mateo Creek and its San Andreas Creek and Laguna Creek tributaries, the waters of Crystal <b>Springs</b> <b>Reservoir</b> consist of runoff from the eastern slopes of the Montara block of the Santa Cruz Mountains and imported Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct water deriving from the Sierra Nevada.

40|$|In railway vehicles, <b>air</b> <b>springs</b> {{are used}} for {{isolating}} vibrations and improving comfort for the passengers. For the prediction of the vibrations in the car body, a valid model of the <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> is needed. A new model for simulation of the <b>air</b> <b>springs</b> behavior has recently been developed at the Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. The model is three-dimensional and consists of two parts, describing vertical and horizontal behavior. The thirteen input parameters of the model have, until now, been determined experimentally. Since experiments are time demanding and equipment expensive the question arose, in-house Bombardier, {{if there is a}} way to derive the parameters without experiments, using knowledge of the <b>air</b> <b>springs</b> physical behavior. The ambition of this report is to answer that question. The report begins with a literature study of <b>air</b> <b>springs.</b> Topics like history, behavior, thermodynamics and physical relations are covered. A few existing <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> models are investigated to give an understanding of <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> modeling. As for the rest, this report focuses on describing the new <b>air</b> <b>spring</b> model and determining the input parameters of it. Five of the model parameters are determined by means of thermodynamic and fluid dynamic constitutions. All of these belong to the vertical model. The parameters are calculated and simulated for a certain <b>air</b> <b>spring.</b> The simulation is made in a MATLAB code, developed in-house Bombardier. The result of the simulations is a plot of the total vertical stiffness versus frequency. This plot shows a sufficiently good agreement to the stiffness measurements for the specific <b>air</b> <b>spring.</b> The remaining eight parameters, which depend on rubber properties, are not dealt with in this report. These parameters need, even henceforth, to be determined with experiments and experimental analysis. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
