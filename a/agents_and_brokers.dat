2500|$|National Association of Registered <b>Agents</b> <b>and</b> <b>Brokers</b> Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 1155; 113th Congress) (...) {{is a bill}} {{meant to}} reduce the {{regulatory}} costs of complying with multiple states' requirements for insurance companies, {{making it easier for}} the same company to operate in multiple states. The bill would amend the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act to repeal the contingent conditions under which the National Association of Registered <b>Agents</b> <b>and</b> <b>Brokers</b> (NARAB) shall not be established. [...] The bill would transform the National Association of Registered <b>Agents</b> <b>and</b> <b>Brokers</b> (NARAB) into a clearing house that set up its own standards that insurance companies would be required to meet in order to do business in other states. In this new system, however, the insurance company would only have to meet the requirements of their home state and the NARAB (only two entities), not their home state and every other state they wished to operate in (multiple entities). [...] Proponents of the bill argued that it would help lower costs for insurance companies and make insurance cheaper for people to buy.|$|E

They must wear only black, and are obliged when they pass near mosques, or through streets {{in which there}} are sanctuaries, to walk barefoot. The lowest among the Moors imagines he has a right to ill-treat a Jew, nor dares the latter defend himself, because the Koran and the judge are always in favor of the Mohammedan. Notwithstanding this state of oppression, the Jews have many {{advantages}} over the Moors: they better understand the spirit of trade; they act as <b>agents</b> <b>and</b> <b>brokers,</b> and they profit by their own cunning and by the ignorance of the Moors. In their commercial bargains many of them buy up the commodities of the country to sell again. Some have European correspondents; others are mechanics, such as goldsmiths, tailors, gunsmiths, millers, and masons. More industrious and artful, and better informed than the Moors, the Jews are employed by the emperor in receiving the customs, in coining money, and in all affairs and intercourse which the monarch has with the European merchants, as well as in all his negotiations with the various European governments." ...|$|E
