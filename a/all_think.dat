500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is in the key of E, with what Inglis terms an [...] "easy melody" [...] that allows for Starr's {{limitations}} as a singer. Harrison's [...] "distinctive composing style" [...] is particularly evident, according to authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler, and Starr would later say of Harrison's role in their collaborations over this period: [...] "I only know three chords and he'd stick four more in, and they'd <b>all</b> <b>think</b> I was a genius." ...|$|E
500|$|The Allied {{delegation}} initially thought Article 231 to be a mundane {{addition to}} the treaty intended to limit German liability with regard to reparations, and were surprised at the vehemence of the German protests. Georges Clemenceau rebuffed Brockdorff-Rantzau's allegations, arguing that [...] "the legal interpretation [...] was the correct one" [...] and {{not a matter of}} political question. Lloyd George commented that [...] "the English public, like the French public, thinks the Germans must above all acknowledge their obligation to compensate us for all the consequences of their aggression. When this is done we come to the question of Germany's capacity to pay; we <b>all</b> <b>think</b> she will be unable to pay more than this document requires of her." ...|$|E

500|$|Back in 1939, as the British sailors {{fight the}} Nazis in the ballroom, Mulder tells [...] "Scully" [...] {{that she has}} to turn the ship around and return to the Bermuda Triangle {{in order to get the}} ship out of the rift in space. Mulder grabs [...] "Scully" [...] and kisses her, [...] "in case they never meet again". [...] "Scully" [...] punches him, and he jumps overboard. Mulder wakes up in 1998 in a hospital, {{surrounded}} by Scully, the Lone Gunmen and Skinner. Mulder attempts to tell them that he traveled to 1939, and of his encounter with Nazis, and tells Scully that she was there with him, but they <b>all</b> <b>think</b> he is delirious. After Skinner and the Gunmen leave, Mulder calls Scully back and tells her that he loves her. Scully thinks his confession is an effect of the drugs he has been given, rolls her eyes and leaves. As he lies down, Mulder winces as his cheek touches the pillow; the spot where [...] "Scully" [...] punched him in 1939 is still sore and visibly bruised. Mulder feels his eye-socket and breaks into a knowing smile, as the screen fades to black.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{discussed}} the idea {{with other members}} of the writing staff; they focused on the incident which caused Picard to require an artificial heart. It had previously been mentioned in the episodes [...] "Samaritan Snare" [...] and [...] "Final Mission". They compared Picard to Captain James T. Kirk, describing them as opposites in terms of development. They saw Picard being a wildchild during his time at Starfleet Academy, only to become more serious later. The reverse for true for Kirk, with the staff describing him as a [...] "bookworm" [...] while at the Academy and only becoming [...] "crazy" [...] once posted to a starship. Together, they sought for a way to support Picard's claim in [...] "Samaritan Snare" [...] that he laughed when he was stabbed. Story editor René Echevarria said that [...] "It made us <b>all</b> <b>think</b> we had really come up with the right story for the premise and tying that together, I think it's one of the finest efforts ever." [...] While Moore called the episode [...] "A Q Carol" [...] based on the original premise, but Piller was the one to suggest [...] "Tapestry" [...] as he said [...] "you have to learn to set your part of the tapestry of your life".|$|E

And everything you thought you knew, the older you get, you realize, 'Damn, I don't know nothing about this. I better pay attention, I better listen and keep learning.' So I think that, that's what I've been realizing these past few years." ...|$|E

[...] On his narrative intentions Oshii comments: [...] "I had a bigger budget than for Ghost in the Shell. I also had more time to prepare it.

2500|$|During {{his tenure}} at FEE, Skousen {{launched}} a non-partisan, libertarian conference, then titled [...] "FEEFest," [...] which premiered in Las Vegas in 2002. The {{goal was to}} bring <b>all</b> <b>think</b> tanks, organizations {{and people who are}} concerned about liberty, personal freedom, civil rights, free market principles and economic freedom, to meet and discuss important issues of the day. After Skousen left the presidency at FEE, the conference continued as [...] "FreedomFest," [...] first under the purview of Young America's Foundation, and later, under Skousen's own direction and ownership. The conference has grown to attract thousands of people each year, and focuses on issues of geopolitics and domestic politics, global economics, investing and personal finance, free markets and entrepreneurship, health and healthcare, education, arts and literature, science and technology, history, and philosophy. The conference is popular in the libertarian political movement. FreedomFest also houses the Anthem Film Festival, the world's only libertarian film festival, directed by Jo Ann Skousen.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2002 poll, BBC radio {{listeners}} voted Hancock their favourite British comedian. Commenting on this poll, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson {{observed that}} modern-day creations such as Alan Partridge and David Brent owed {{much of their}} success to mimicking dominant features of Tony Hancock's character. [...] "The thing they've all got in common is self-delusion" [...] they remarked, in a statement issued by the BBC. [...] "They <b>all</b> <b>think</b> they're more intelligent than everyone else, more cultured, that people don't recognise their true greatness – self-delusion in every sense. And there's nothing people like better than failure." [...] Mary Kalemkerian, Head of Programmes for BBC 7, commented: [...] "Classic comedians such as Tony Hancock and the Goons are obviously still firm favourites with BBC radio listeners. Age doesn't seem to matter – if it's funny, it's funny." [...] Dan Peat of the Tony Hancock Appreciation Society said of the poll: [...] "It's fantastic news. If he was alive he would have taken it one of two ways. He would probably have made some kind of dry crack, but in truth {{he would have been}} chuffed." ...|$|E

2500|$|With Winston {{only being}} added {{late to the}} show, the writers {{developed}} the Nick–Winston dynamic in season 1 and sought to figure out Winston's relationship with the other loftmates in season 2. The writers noticed late during the first season that Morris seemed better suited to play a smart character and act as the loft's voice of reason, although Meriwether found that when Winston [...] "finally does blow up, he's crazier than all of them" [...] and that he works better [...] "in these kind of crazy, comedic runners, small pieces of the episode" [...] that contrast the relationship dramas of the other main characters. The Winston–Schmidt friendship was developed significantly {{in the second half}} of season 2 when the story focus moved to Nick and Jess. The Nick–Jess relationship affects the three guys' friendship as Nick starts being more considerate of Jess' feelings regarding shenanigans. Damon Wayans Jr. was planned to reprise his role as Coach in at least four episodes in the third season, according to Meriwether [...] "at a time when the roommates are at odds with each other" [...] and [...] "The guys are all fighting for his friendship." [...] The three guys will get intimidated by Coach's return, as he has [...] "this alpha male aggression" [...] and is [...] "that macho, tough-talking guy that they <b>all</b> <b>think</b> is so cool".|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... What, you love this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will <b>all</b> <b>think</b> it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E
2500|$|The Toa {{emerge from}} Makuta's lair victorious, only to {{discover}} that the villain has unleashed a new threat to the island: the Bohrok Swarms. Six breeds of robotic bug-like drones designed to [...] "cleanse" [...] Mata Nui to its former barren state. The Bohrok rampage across the island and tear down the regions of each village, forcing the Turaga and Matoran to flee. While many of the villagers are placed {{under the influence of the}} Bohrok's brain-like Krana organisms, others find new ways to retaliate against the swarms. The Toa collect all eight varieties of Krana from each breed while combating the swarms and later reunite to travel down to the Bohrok's underground nests. There, they place the Krana in niches located in each breed's hive, but this alone fails to stop the swarms. The Toa then discover powerful, sentient battle armor named Exo-Toa. Donning them, they're directed to the chamber of the true Bohrok commanders: the Bahrag twins Cahdok and Gahdok. As the Toa battle the nest queens, they discover that the Exo-Toa are hampering their elemental abilities. Taking the robotic armor off, they are able to re-access them and trap the Bahrag in a cage of solid protodermis (a material created by all six Toa's elemental powers). On the surface, the swarms stop in mid-action. The Matoran begin the process of rebuilding their villages with help from the Bohrok robots now that their Krana are powerless. The Toa's victory is short-lived when the ground beneath them opens up and plunges each of them into tubes filled with energized protodermis, transforming the heroes into more powerful beings with new armor, masks and weapons; creating the Toa Nuva. At the same time, a set of new Kanohi masks are placed in secret hiding places all over Mata Nui for the heroes to find, six symbol plaques connected to the Toa's elemental abilities appear in each village, and a cube that can fit all the plaques together is formed near the Bahrag's prison. Emerging from the tubes and returning to the surface, the Toa Nuva engage in battle against one another to test their new powers, but their actions lead to anger amongst them and despite Gali's pleas, <b>all</b> <b>think</b> it best to go their separate ways.|$|E
