40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides an}} interdisciplinary analysis of expressions of <b>austerity</b> <b>policies.</b> It {{is argued that}} expressions of <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> are meaningful {{if and only if}} the intended addressees’ psychological states are adequately attuned and the conceptual preconditions for implementation met. Furthermore, it is argued that if the addressees are suitably psychologically attuned and these preconditions met, utility will, by definition, be maximised and successful economical recovery enjoyed in equal measure among austerity implementors. The paper is divided into five sections. In the first section, the political scene is set in which <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> are expressed and the terminology is introduced. In the second section, expressions of <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> are dissected and an analysis of the reference conditions of such expressions provided. The third section reviews a conceptual analysis of intending and acting together and relates it to jointly implementing <b>austerity</b> <b>policies.</b> In the fourth section, the economic rationale behind expressions of <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> is evaluated with reference to what in economic theory is called team-reasoning theory. It is concluded, in section five, that given suitably psychologically attuned implementors of <b>austerity</b> <b>policies,</b> expressions of <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> are economically rational. But we should be sceptical about their economic motivation: if the people referred to, to implement austerity, are different from those calling for <b>austerity</b> <b>policies,</b> then it might appear, in the long run, that the former bear a burden {{for the good of the}} latter...|$|R

Using a macroeconomic forecasting model we demonstrate that the dual aim of economic growth and increases in both male and female employment can be achieved via the adoption of gender-sensitive expansionary macroeconomic policies and by overturning <b>austerity</b> <b>policies.</b> Projections for our gendered expansionary {{macroeconomic scenario}} suggest that an additional 14 million jobs, of which 9 million are for women, could be created by 2030 in the Eurozone and the United Kingdom by reversing <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> and marshalling government expenditure and investment towards female and male employment. We also show that these positive results are not achieved at the expense of high levels of debts and fiscal deficits.

This article discusses the boom preceding the crisis, the ensuing <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> and the economic effects of these policies.

The downturn was so swift and deep that expansionary policies were unlikely to affect short-term outcomes. Growth returned {{towards the end of}} 2009, largely driven by exports. The export performance cannot be directly linked to the <b>austerity</b> <b>policies.</b> The main lesson from the Baltics is that increased macroeconomic stability must be attained by avoiding overheating and unsustainable financial exposure.

40|$|<b>Austerity</b> <b>policies</b> {{have been}} instituted in {{countries}} around the world attempting to address the fallout from the global economic crisis beginning in 2008 and still lingering through today. While the literature debates the economic impact of these policies, limited attention has been given to the effects of austerity at the local governmental level. It is posited that at the local government level, the effects of <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> are most noticeable and detrimental. States and local municipalities are “switching roles” with the federal government (Davidson, 2013, p. 1). They are providing jobs and social welfare services in the gap left by the departure of the federal government from a broad social welfare delivery perspective. The ideological rationale associated with state budgets being balanced through austerity-like reductions in revenue sharing and the reducing the social safety net will be highlighted. In the U. S., the majority of those states which implemented drastic and sometimes draconian budget reductions have been under majority Republican legislatures and governorships. Characteristics of <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> and the modern welfare-state are discussed in relationship to the reduction in public investment, particularly in government non-education employment through discretionary spending. The results of <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> on funding for social welfare services and public employment will be illustrated...|$|R

40|$|This article explores a gendered expansionary {{macroeconomic}} scenario for Europe {{as an alternative}} to the current <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> over the medium term. Using a non-equilibrium structuralist macroeconometric model we demonstrate that the dual aim of economic growth and increases in both male and female employment can be achieved via the adoption of gender-sensitive expansionary macroeconomic policies. We compare and contrast three scenarios for Europe: continued austerity, gender-neutral expansionary scenario and gendered expansionary scenario. Projections for our gendered expansionary scenario suggest that an additional 7. 4 million jobs for women could by created in the Eurozone and the United Kingdom by reversing <b>austerity</b> <b>policies,</b> by gendering and increasing government expenditure and private investment. Further, higher growth rates under the gendered expansionary scenario lead to significant reductions of debt-to-GDP ratios and lower budget deficits. The main recommendation is for Europe to roll back <b>austerity</b> <b>policies</b> and to embark on a new gender-focused economic trajectory...|$|R
