5|$|The Wagiman phonemic {{inventory}} {{is quite}} typical for a northern Australian language. It has six {{places of articulation}} with <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> a nasal in each. There are also a number of laterals and approximants, a trill and a phonemic glottal stop (represented in the orthography by 'h'). Wagiman also has a vowel inventory that is standard for the north of Australia, with a system of 5 vowels.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons {{had trouble}} moving {{the ball at}} first, but were helped by a 15-yard {{personal}} foul penalty against Virginia Tech that gave them a first down. Weiss completed a pass that gave the Falcons another first down and drove Air Force inside Tech territory. On the first play within Hokie territory, Weiss fumbled the ball, but fell {{on it for a}} loss, and Air Force retained possession. Weiss made up for his fumble two plays later when he scrambled for a first down that kept the drive going. Despite that effort, Tech was able to force <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> Air Force punted with 3:10 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|The BS {{struggled}} {{on for a}} time, {{funding the}} construction work by making calls on the unpaid portion of its shares, but activity eventually came to <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> the partly built tunnels were left derelict. Before its collapse, the L attempted to sell its interests in the BS for £500,000 to an American consortium headed by Albert L. Johnson, but was unsuccessful. However, it attracted the interest of another American consortium headed by financier Charles Yerkes. After some months of negotiations with the L's liquidator, Yerkes purchased the company for £360,000 plus interest (£ today). He {{was involved in the}} development of Chicago's tramway system in the 1880s and 1890s. He came to London in 1900 and purchased a number of the struggling underground railway companies, The BS became a subsidiary of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) which Yerkes formed to raise funds to build the tube railways and to electrify the District Railway. The UERL was capitalised at £5million with the majority of shares sold to overseas investors. Further share issues followed, which raised a total of £18million by 1903 (equivalent to approximately £ today) for use across all of the UERL's projects.|$|E
5|$|The next spring, a revitalized army {{emerged from}} Valley Forge in good order, {{thanks in part}} to a {{full-scale}} training program supervised by General von Steuben. The British evacuated Philadelphia for New York in June, 1778. Washington summoned a council of war with Generals Lee, Greene, and Wayne and Lafayette, and he decided to make a partial attack on the retreating British at the Battle of Monmouth. The British were commanded by Sir Henry Clinton, Howe's successor. On June 28, Lee and Lafayette moved with 4,000 men. Without Washington's immediate knowledge they attempted to launch but bungled the first attack at the British rear guard. Clinton came about and offered stiff resistance, also with 4,000 men and waiting in anticipation, keeping the Americans in check. After sharp words of criticism, Washington relieved Lee and continued fighting to an effective draw in one of the war's largest battles. When nightfall came, the fighting came to <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> the British continued their retreat and headed towards New York, where Washington soon moved his army just outside the city.|$|E

25|$|Warndarang has a {{consonant}} inventory {{similar to}} that of many Australian languages. There are five main places of articulation – bilabial, apico-alveolar, retroflex, lamino-alveolar, and velar – with <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> a nasal in each, {{with the addition of a}} rarely used interdental stop. There are also two laterals, two rhotics, and two semi-vowels. The presence of a glottal stop is debatable; the glottal stops that Heath heard were unstable and appeared to be optional.|$|E
25|$|By early 1861, settler {{opinion was}} evenly divided on Browne's stance against Māori and the {{fairness}} of the Waitara purchase and many believed the British had little hope of wearing the enemy down with further military campaigns. Even Pratt expressed doubts the war could be won. The district had also suffered great economic hardship, with emigration all but coming to <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> the destruction of three-quarters of farmhouses at Omata, Bell Block, Tataraimaka, and settlements nearer the town.|$|E
25|$|In the First World War, 13,878 {{members of}} the {{university}} served and 2,470 were killed. Teaching, and the fees it earned, came almost to <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> severe financial difficulties followed. As a consequence the university first received systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal Commission appointed in 1920 recommended that the university (but not the colleges) should receive an annual grant. Following the Second World War, the university saw a rapid expansion of student numbers and available places; this was {{partly due to the}} success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.|$|E

It then ran onto Olav Tryggvasons gate until Søndre gate. There it had <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> then continued along Søndre gate across the canal to Trondheim Central Station, the terminus.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will come to <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>and</b> roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy {{to get over the}} top of the hill to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.|$|E
25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to <b>a</b> <b>stop,</b> <b>and</b> the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E

The Crimson Tide scored the final points of the game late in the fourth when Croyle connected again with Hall, and this time it was on a five-yard pass to make the final score 24–13. For his 15 tackle performance, DeMeco Ryans was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Week; and for his 275 punting yards that included a 72-yard punt, Jeremy Schatz was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Week.|$|E
25|$|Łukasz Urban {{was found}} dead in the {{passenger}} seat of the truck cab; he had been stabbed and shot once {{in the head with a}} small-caliber firearm. Investigators initially believed that Urban might still have been alive when the truck reached Breitscheidplatz and might have been stabbed because he tried to stop the attack. Early media reports indicated that he grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the truck to veer left and crash to <b>a</b> <b>stop,</b> <b>and</b> was then shot at the scene of the crash. If this had been true, this act might have had saved many lives. However, later media reports have indicated that the truck was brought to a stop by its automatic braking system and Urban was stabbed and shot hours before the attack. No weapons were found at the scene.|$|E
