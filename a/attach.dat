At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this {{research}} is to assess whether performance on remembering faces with <b>attached</b> positive information and faces with <b>attached</b> negative information was enhanced when compared to faces with <b>attached</b> neutral information, or the control of faces with <b>attached</b> names only. It was hypothesised that likeability score would significantly differ for faces with <b>attached</b> positive information and <b>attached</b> negating information, an effect that was found in this research. In total, five measure of memory were used to assess the effect of <b>attached</b> social information on memory for faces- time taken to complete match pair grids, time taken between clicks on match pair grids, distance error on match pair grids, correct assisted name recall, correct assisted <b>attached</b> information recall and correct assisted type of <b>attached</b> information recall. Three conditions were used (positive/neutral <b>attached</b> information, negative/neutral <b>attached</b> information and control condition) to measure the effect of mate relevant information on memory test scores. For the three match pair measures, no significant effect of <b>attached</b> mate relevant information was found. Non-significant results were found for correct assisted name recall and correct assisted type of <b>attached</b> information, however for correct recall for <b>attached</b> information, a significant effect was found, suggesting that source memory of information can enhance subsequent memory for faces. Implications of research and future directions are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The general {{assumption}} {{has been}} that male batterers from clinical samples were mostly insecurely <b>attached</b> as compared to non-batterers. Recently, a large group was found (39. 4 % of batterers in a clinical sample) whose main attachment style was secure. No previous studies have examined specifically the securely <b>attached</b> batterer. The aim {{of the present study}} was to test whether antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), but not borderline personality disorder (BPD), traits may be related to battering among securely <b>attached</b> individuals. Twenty-seven securely <b>attached</b> batterers, 45 insecurely <b>attached</b> batterers, 40 securely <b>attached</b> controls, and 22 insecurely <b>attached</b> controls who lived in the Netherlands, filled in self-report measures of personality disorder traits (i. e., antisocial, narcissism, borderline) and attachment (i. e., avoidant and anxious).
