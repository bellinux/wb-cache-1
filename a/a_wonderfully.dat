The diary provides <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> full account of the small community in which the diarist lived – of the births and deaths, comings and goings, illnesses and annual celebrations.|$|E
25|$|Monty Panesar also {{demonstrated}} his promising talent, taking 3 wickets {{in the second}} innings {{to follow up on}} 3 wickets in the first, on a pitch not typically associated with assisting spinners. His dismissal of Younis Khan during the afternoon session was spectacular, with <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> flighted delivery that just clipped the bail of the off stump.|$|E
25|$|Wood-carving {{examples}} of the first eleven centuries of AD are extremely rare. The carved panels of the main doors of St Sabina on the Aventine Hill, Rome, are very interesting specimens of early Christian relief sculpture in wood, dating, as the dresses show, from the 5th century. The doors {{are made up of}} a large number of small square panels, each minutely carved with a scene from the Old or New Testament. A very fine fragment of Byzantine art (11th or 12th centuries) is preserved in a monastery at Mount Athos in Macedonia. It consists of two panels (one above the other) of relief sculpture, surmounted by a semicircular arch of conventional foliage springing from columns ornamented with animals in foliage of spiral form. The capitals and bases are square, each face being carved with a figure. It is <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> fine piece of work, conceived in the best decorative spirit.|$|E

6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] I asked, {{still staring}} at the thing which I {{perceived}} to be <b>a</b> most <b>wonderfully</b> fashioned likeness of the old dwarf himself as he appeared before me crouched upon the ground. There were the deepset eyes, the great head, the toad-like shape, the long hair, all.|$|R
25|$|Aboutrika helped Al-Ahly won {{his seventh}} {{continental}} title of CAF Champions League scoring 6 goals. His most impressive match was on 14 May 2012. Ahly were down 1–0 {{at home to}} Stade Malien in a second leg CAF Champions League match and were down 2–0 on aggregate. Aboutrika was subbed on in the 42nd minute for Mohamed Shawky {{and in the second}} half, he scored his first ever CAF Champions League hat-trick, 2 of which were scored in the last 8 minutes of the match. He scored the first from <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> curled free-kick from 28 yards out. He then scored the second from a penalty in the 82nd minute. Finally, he blasted the third from into the top right corner from 12 yards out to get the hat-trick, complete the comeback, and secure Al-Ahly a place in the 2012 CAF Champions League group stage. On 22 July 2012, he scored against Al-Zamalek to win 1–0 in the group stage match.|$|E
500|$|A georgeous, romantic {{moment from}} 's sorely underappreciated Erotica opus. A slow and seductive rhyme base {{surrounded}} by cascading, sparkling synths inspires a sweet and charming vocal. Though not as lyrically daring {{as the previous}} [...] "Bad Girl", this is <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> constructed, memorable tune that deserves as much attention (and airplay) as it can garner.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers paid {{particular}} attention to Araya's vocal contribution. Zach Hothorn of Prefix magazine said the song [...] "allows Araya to show his vocal range, deepening to build up tension and creating <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> chilling 3 and a half minutes", while Ian Robinson of musicOMH.com felt the track [...] "is a distinct but welcome change of pace, Dave Lombardo's machine-gun rhythms forming the backbone for Tom Araya's impressively intact scream." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] responded Julia stoutly. [...] "I don't see why I {{should be}} more afraid than you would be; I am weaker, of course, but when I found I must sleep {{alone in the house}} I bought <b>a</b> {{revolver}} <b>wonderfully</b> cheap, and made the man show me how to use it." ...|$|R

500|$|Sugarland's first holiday album, Gold and Green {{released}} on October 13, 2009 includes [...] "City of Silver Dreams" [...] and [...] "Little Wood Guitar", co-written by Paul and Kristian Bush. In {{his review of}} the album, Matt Bjorke wrote, [...] "City of Silver Dreams" [...] could actually find itself a seminal holiday song like Joni Mitchell's [...] "River" [...] as it tells <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> soft and melodic story of New York City {{and the beauty of}} a new romance within the context of Christmas." ...|$|E
500|$|Television reviews {{were even}} more enthusiastic. [...] Allan Jeffreys of ABC said the actors were [...] "the most talented hippies you'll ever see... {{directed}} in <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> wild fashion by Tom O'Horgan." [...] Leonard Probst of NBC said [...] "Hair is the only new concept in musicals on Broadway in years and it's more fun than any other this season". [...] John Wingate of WOR TV praised MacDermot's [...] "dynamic score" [...] that [...] "blasts and soars", and Len Harris of CBS said [...] "I've finally found the best musical of the Broadway season... it's that sloppy, vulgar, terrific tribal love rock musical Hair." ...|$|E
500|$|The Early English Gothic chapter house, built between 1230 and 1265, is {{rectangular}} {{and opens}} off a [...] "charming" [...] vestibule {{leading from the}} north transept. The chapter house has grouped windows of simple untraceried form. Alec Clifton-Taylor describes the exterior of this building as a [...] "modest but rather elegant example of composition in lancets" [...] while Nikolaus Pevsner says of the interior [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> noble room" [...] which is the [...] "aesthetic climax of the cathedral". To {{the north of the}} chapter house is the slype, also Early English in style, and the warming room, which contains two large former fireplaces. The monastic refectory {{to the north of the}} cloister is of about the same date as the chapter house.|$|E

"If the magnificence of {{the place}} was to be {{increased}} by any external cause, none could more superbly have adorned its numerous gilded canopies and turrets than the sun rising in full splendour directly opposite.

6000|$|... "Ah! Taking {{a look at}} {{our little}} collection, Mr. Peters? You will see that we have given the place of honor to your Cheops. It is {{certainly}} <b>a</b> fine specimen--a <b>wonderfully</b> fine specimen." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Christmas Scandal" [...] {{was written}} by series co-founder Michael Schur and {{directed}} by Randall Einhorn. The episode featured {{the last of a}} string of guest performances by stand-up comedian Louis C.K., who reprised his recurring role as Dave Sanderson, Leslie's police officer boyfriend. Louis C.K. left the show to devote more time to his own upcoming series, Louie, which was to air in early 2010. Louis C.K. was widely praised for his brief stint on the show, where he adopts a deadpan, technical tone of voice far different from his usual comedy persona. Matt Fowler of IGN said, [...] "Louis C.K., known for being a raucous, raunchy comic, is almost frightening in his ability to play against his stage persona and give us <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> caring, and deadpan, character".|$|E
500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I thought it was <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, {{but there was a}} quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great. If you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{species is}} edible, but {{opinions}} about its palatibility are mixed: one author says the fruit bodies are [...] "coarse {{and do not}} taste good"; another mentions the [...] "thin flesh hardly make this species worthwhile;" [...] yet another says [...] "The yellow cap may remind you of chicken fat; it has <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> savory mushroom flavor." [...] The slimy texture of the mushroom {{has been compared to}} okra. One cookbook author suggests that the mushroom is ideal for spreads, for use on bread or as a dip; baking the fruit bodies in an oven will dry them for future use, and concentrate the flavor. The odor and taste are mild; one field guide suggests it has a [...] "distinctive lemony tang". The slimy caps and the pore layer are typically removed before consumption.|$|E

6000|$|... ''Ere he be--house an' all!' Hobden dived {{into the}} prickly {{heart of the}} faggot and took out <b>a</b> dormouse's <b>wonderfully</b> woven nest of grass and leaves. His blunt fingers parted {{it as if it}} had been {{precious}} lace, and tilting it toward the last of the light he showed the little, red, furry chap curled up inside, his tail between his eyes that were shut for their winter sleep.|$|R
500|$|Phil Matson, East Perth premiership {{player and}} coach, {{regarded}} Harold Oliver {{as the best}} centre man he had met during his football career. Angelo Congear, whose career completely overlapped with Oliver, said that [...] "As an all-roundplayer, Harold Oliver is my pick. In his prime he played <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> clever game anywhere. He is also the fairest player {{it has been my}} pleasure to play with." [...] Tom Leahy, Magarey Medalist and captain of North Adelaide, once stated after a game at Alberton Oval that [...] "North Adelaide would certainly have won had Port not possessed a superman in Oliver." [...] Vic Richardson, captain of the Sturt Football Club and Australian cricket team, described Harold Oliver as being [...] "The finest all-round exponent of Australian football in my playing and watching experience of it".|$|E
500|$|... "Together Again" [...] {{was also}} {{compared}} to other singers' works. Jon Pareles from The New York Times described [...] "Together Again" [...] as [...] "a creamy Diana Ross homage", noting that Jackson [...] "deploys her small voice shrewdly" [...] in it. Billboard magazine called [...] "Together Again" [...] "a gorgeous disco ode to loved ones lost to AIDS-related illnesses". Jackson [...] "has clearly been studying Donna Summer records, delivering <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> nuanced performance that takes firm command of the track's vibrant house beat without sacrificing an ounce of emotion". Danyel Smith, while interviewing Jackson for Vibe in November 1997, elaborated that the song was a big, perfect ode to Donna Summer, and likened it to her songs [...] "MacArthur Park" [...] and [...] "Last Dance". In 1999, 'Together Again" [...] won the award for [...] "Most Played Song" [...] at the BMI Pop Awards.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the episode}} was {{promoted}} {{with the promise}} of answering questions, it caused increased media speculation. With the conclusion of [...] "One Son", many critics applauded the way the series was able to wrap up the Syndicate arc. A.M. Jamison of the Dayton Daily News wrote that [...] "'One Son' ends dramatically, drawing to a close one quest and opening a new set of challenges not only for Mulder but the Earth as well". Noel Holston and Justin of the Star Tribune awarded the episode four stars out of five, noting that it answered even more questions than [...] "Two Fathers". They also applauded the familial bonds that held the episode together. However, some critics felt that the answers were slightly rushed. Manuel Mendoza of The Dallas Morning News wrote that [...] "Mr. Carter and his co-writer Frank Spotnitz have <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> indirect way of setting up dramatic situations and an unbelievably shorthand way of resolving them".|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{takes me}} a long time to figure a thing out," [...] he said; [...] "and when I've a problem to solve a bit of <b>a</b> snooze helps <b>wonderfully.</b> Patsy, dear, it occurs to me we're lonely." ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{an appalling}} figure of Ciccio in war-paint strolled {{on to the}} stage. He was naked to the waist, wore scalp-fringed trousers, was dusky-red-skinned, had long black hair and eagle's feathers--only two feathers--and <b>a</b> face <b>wonderfully</b> and terribly painted with white, red, yellow, and black lines. He was evidently pleased with himself. His curious soft slouch, and curious way of lifting his lip from his white teeth, {{in a sort of}} smile, was very convincing.|$|R
5000|$|The Point of Departure {{review by}} Greg Buium says [...] "Hotel Grief is a 61-minute set of free improvisation, {{but it is}} <b>a</b> cleverly structured, <b>wonderfully</b> {{coherent}} series of musical gestures.. It is a magnificent, and endlessly rewarding, date." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} the first episode of the series was positive. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 10 reviews of the episode and judged 100% {{of them to be}} positive with an average score of 8.5 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, Winter is Coming' is an introduction to <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> bleak journey that honors its source material with stellar execution and an impressive cast." [...] James Poniewozik from Time considered it an [...] "epic win", and Jace Lacob from The Daily Beast deemed it [...] "unforgettable". HitFix's Alan Sepinwall wrote that while it was too early to say if Game of Thrones belonged to the HBO pantheon with shows like The Sopranos or The Wire, it had many things in common with those shows. IGN's Matt Fowler wrote that the pilot [...] "effortlessly takes us along, faithfully, through the book, but it also manages to capture the majestically morbid spirit of Martin's pages and turn them into thrilling television".|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Górecki {{approached}} the Polish folklorist Adolf Dygacz {{in search of}} traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work. Dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in the [...] Silesia region in south-western Poland. Górecki {{was impressed by the}} melody [...] "Where has he gone, my dear young son?" [...] (Kajże się podzioł mój synocek miły?), which describes a mother's mourning for a son lost in war, and probably dates from the Silesian Uprisings of 1919–21. Górecki had heard a version of the song in the 1960s and had not been impressed by the arrangement, but the words and the melody of Dygacz's new version made a lasting impression on him. He said [...] "for me, it is <b>a</b> <b>wonderfully</b> poetic text. I do not know if a 'professional' poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse, simple words. It is not sorrow, despair or resignation, or the wringing of hands: it is just the great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review, Down Beat magazine found Waters's singing [...] "forced and artificial", writing that Folk Singer {{suffers from a}} major flaw: [...] "He only begins to {{come close to the}} power and unforced intensity of the original numbers and style from time to time, as on 'You Gonna Need My Help' and 'My Home Is in the Delta'". In a retrospective review, Cub Koda, writing for AllMusic was more enthusiastic, deeming the record's sound fresh and vital. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Folk Singer number 280 on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of AllTime", writing that the [...] "unplugged" [...] playing was pioneering and has since been [...] "beloved by blues and folk fans alike". In a 1994 issue of Rolling Stone, a reviewer wrote, [...] "...There aren't too many blues albums that qualify as audiophile recordings, but Muddy Waters Folk Singer surely does. <b>A</b> <b>wonderfully</b> intimate session, it delivers Waters' voice in all its power and subtlety, while rendering his guitar work...with such vivid realism, you would think you were sitting in the studio...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I really don't see {{any harm}} {{in the book}} so far. It is by <b>a</b> famous author, <b>wonderfully</b> well written, as you know, and the {{characters}} so lifelike that I feel as if I should really meet them somewhere." ...|$|R

60|$|New York is the Caoutchouc City. There are many, of course, who {{go their}} ways, making money, without {{turning to the}} right or the left, but there is <b>a</b> tribe abroad <b>wonderfully</b> composed, like the Martians, solely of eyes and means of locomotion.|$|R
