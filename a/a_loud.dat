5|$|Frogs in the genera Heleioporus and Neobatrachus lack vocal sacs but {{can still}} produce <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> call. Their buccal cavity is {{enlarged}} and dome-shaped, {{acting as a}} resonance chamber that amplifies the sound. Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and {{that do not have}} <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, flowing water. They need to use an alternative means to communicate. The coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.|$|E
5|$|Another form of {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E
5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
60|$|She paused, {{and then}} spoke hurriedly in <b>a</b> <b>louder,</b> {{pleading}} tone.|$|R
60|$|Tommy {{immediately}} whistled, <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> {{and more}} glorious note than before.|$|R
60|$|A {{second and}} <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> murmur denoted the effect this {{suggestion}} had produced.|$|R
5|$|During the night, the {{electrical}} power suddenly turned {{off and the}} radios went silent. Just before 11:30pm, a huge stream of water swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people. <b>A</b> <b>loud</b> roar could be heard from the mountain, but the residents were panicked over what they {{believed to be a}} flood.|$|E
5|$|Elk {{range in}} forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating {{behaviors}} during the rut, including posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and bugling, <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females.|$|E
5|$|Most rails are secretive wetland {{birds that}} have made little {{cultural}} impression, but as a formerly common farmland bird with <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> nocturnal call that sometimes led to disturbed sleep for rural dwellers, the corn crake has acquired a variety of folk names and some commemoration in literature.|$|E

5|$|Sanjeev Bhaskar has a cameo role as <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> and {{offensive}} restaurant patron (who refers to Meg Ryan as the actress {{who has an}} orgasm every time she's taken out {{for a cup of}} coffee) in the restaurant Anna and Will visit.|$|E
5|$|The Hammond organ's {{technology}} {{derives from}} the Telharmonium, an instrument created in 1897 by Thaddeus Cahill. The telharmonium used revolving electric alternators which generated tones that could be transmitted over wires. The instrument was bulky, because the alternators had to {{be large enough to}} generate high voltage for <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> enough signal. The Hammond organ solved this problem by using an amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The {{call of the}} Siberian accentor is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of a bush or tree, is <b>a</b> <b>loud,</b> high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese accentor, the dunnock or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|E
60|$|Then, as Leo and Snipper came on, <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> peal {{of thunder}} {{attracted}} every one’s attention.|$|R
60|$|He had {{scarcely}} spoken {{when they}} heard the report of a gun, followed by <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> yelping than ever.|$|R
60|$|Here {{the voice}} uttered {{something}} in <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> key, but equally unintelligible to the now interested and fully awakened passengers.|$|R
5|$|The most usual call is <b>a</b> <b>loud,</b> short, {{and rapid}} caaw-caaw-caaw. Usually, the birds thrust their heads {{up and down}} as they utter this call. American crows can also produce a wide variety of sounds and {{sometimes}} mimic noises made by other animals, including other birds.|$|E
5|$|A {{few times}} during the film, <b>a</b> <b>loud,</b> ringing tone evocative of {{tinnitus}} is heard. This sound generally coincides {{with the death of}} a major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the tones as the last time you'll ever hear that frequency. In this way, then, the loss of the tones is symbolic of the loss of the characters.|$|E
5|$|A loon’s wail is a {{long call}} {{consisting}} of up to three notes, and is often compared to a wolf’s howl. It uses this call to communicate its location to other loons. The call is given {{back and forth between}} breeding pairs or an adult and its chick, either to maintain contact or in an attempt to move closer together after being separated. It is <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> aaoo, weee-wea weee-wea weee-wea, or ooo-aaah-éééé.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} Backward masking {{originated}} in psychoacoustics, referring to temporal masking of quiet sounds that occur moments before <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> sound.|$|R
60|$|There was no answer. The captain {{repeated}} the call in <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> tone, and presently the boatswain came hurrying down the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|This {{positive}} statement {{seemed to}} annoy the little fellow. He {{raised his eyes}} half shyly a moment and said, in <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> voice: ...|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>loud</b> {{and active}} bird, the red wattlebird {{is found in}} pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above {{the level of the}} tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Miller was out {{for four}} in the first innings, not {{offering}} a shot to an inswinger. In the second innings, Miller's first ball was a hat-trick ball from English captain Norman Yardley; he survived <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> leg before wicket appeal and then hit a six into the grandstand, {{on his way to}} 74. Australia declared at 7/460, 595runs ahead. Miller took three catches as Australia won by 409runs.|$|E
5|$|Bulls have <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles. Bugling {{is often associated with}} an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E

5000|$|... "Manifest Destiny/Sorority Tears" [...] is a {{combination}} of two clips from different songs by American alternative rock band Guster. After [...] "Manifest Destiny" [...] ends, it very softly slides right into [...] "Sorority Tears", which begins with a soft banjo opening featuring a harmonica. This gives it a [...] "bluesy" [...] feel, but then the song escalates slightly into <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> section featuring horns and <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> drum piece before softly fading back to the same type of music as the opening.|$|R
5|$|Diocletian was in Antioch in {{the autumn}} of 302, when the next {{instance}} of persecution occurred. The deacon Romanus visited a court while preliminary sacrifices were taking place and interrupted the ceremonies, denouncing the act in <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice. He was arrested and sentenced to be set aflame, but Diocletian overruled the decision, and decided that Romanus should have his tongue removed instead. Romanus would be executed on November 18, 303. The boldness of this Christian displeased Diocletian, and he left the city and made for Nicomedia to spend the winter, accompanied by Galerius.|$|E
5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|Jumpscares {{are present}} {{in all of the}} series' main games, and occur when any animatronic manages to reach and attack the player-{{character}}. Most jumpscares involve an animatronic character suddenly appearing in the player's view, followed by <b>a</b> <b>loud,</b> bellowing sound. Some jumpscares, including those of Golden Freddy, Nightmare, and Nightmarionne, consist of a single screen supplemented with shrill, distorted audio. These jumpscares usually crash or restart the game. The player can utilise the tools listed above to prevent attacks, thus preventing any jumpscares from occurring.|$|E
50|$|Mike Shoun {{joined the}} band {{as the new}} drummer after Baer's departure. Shoun's arrival coincided with the band's change into <b>a</b> <b>louder</b> garage punk based sound.|$|R
