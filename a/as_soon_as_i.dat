5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I {{just heard the}} track and loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E

5|$|Since Purple Tentacle's {{plans are}} {{flawless}} and unstoppable, Dr. Fred decides {{to use his}} Chron-o-John time machines to send Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge-o-Matic machine, thereby preventing Purple Tentacle's exposure to the sludge.Bernard: Isn't it a little late for that, Doctor?Dr. Fred: Of course! That's why I'll have to do it... YESTERDAY! To the time machine!}} However, because Dr. Fred used an imitation diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine, the Chron-o-Johns breaks down in operation. Laverne is sent 200 years in the future, where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules {{the world from the}} Edison mansion, while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past, where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution. Bernard is returned to the present. To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, hurry up and bring them back! Dr. Fred: I will, <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> get a new diamond! Then all your buddies have to do is plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} {{the streets of the}} three towns I {{surveyed}} were taken from Bishoprics and the way it was done was this; <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> completed the map I took it to Thomas who putting on his gold spectacles and opening his would read out a Bishop's name to hear if it sounded well. If I agreed with him that it did, I put the name to one of the streets requiring baptism.|$|E
25|$|I {{knew the}} Englishmen would test me out <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> walked out. Ian Botham. Bob Willis. I {{remember}} facing Ian Botham when I went out there, {{and he did}} test me out. Fortunately enough I did hook him for a six, but I must admit {{it was more of}} a top edge. Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few more times.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
500|$|Upon Mendelssohn's death Lind wrote, [...] " [...] {{the only}} person who brought {{fulfilment}} to my spirit, and almost <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> found him I lost him again". In 1849 she established the Mendelssohn Scholarship Foundation, which makes an award to a British resident young composer every two years in Mendelssohn's memory. The first winner of the scholarship was Arthur Sullivan, then aged 14, in 1856. In 1869 Lind erected a plaque in Mendelssohn's memory at his birthplace in Hamburg.|$|E

500|$|Webb's {{invitation}} to join Caedmon's Call came from Tate, {{who at the}} time was attending Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, TX. Shortly afterward, Webb made the trip to Fort Worth and met future band mate Cliff Young. Webb says, [...] "I essentially just joined that band immediately. And <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> joined the band, I quit college the same day." [...] As a result, for almost a full school year he pretended to go to class, with his family unaware he was actually pursuing the band in lieu of going to school.|$|E

500|$|Privately, Tolkien was {{attracted}} to [...] "things of racial and linguistic significance", and in his 1955 lecture English and Welsh, which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of [...] "inherent linguistic predilections", which he termed the [...] "native language" [...] {{as opposed to the}} [...] "cradle-tongue" [...] which a person first learns to speak. He considered the West Midlands dialect of Middle English to be his own [...] "native language", and, as he wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955, [...] "I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> set eyes on it)." ...|$|E

When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting.

500|$|After collaborating in 2002's Minority Report, Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise were {{interested}} in working together again. Spielberg stated about Cruise, [...] "He's such an intelligent, creative partner, and brings such great ideas to the set that we just spark each other. [...] I love working with Tom Cruise." [...] Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds. Spielberg chose The War of the Worlds and stated, [...] "We {{looked at each other}} and the lights went on. [...] <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> heard it, I said 'Oh my God!

500|$|Davey was {{initially}} uncomfortable with being {{described as a}} singer-songwriter but is now more accepting of the term. She describes her songwriting style: I write in short quick spurts of manic creativity, which are followed by spells of borderline writer's block where the writing comes really painfully and laboriously. I’m sure it's a universal experience for anyone who writes, but it's difficult to get out of, you can't just wish it away—it just disappears when it's had enough. It’s completely independent of whether I’m happy or blue, up or down. It tends to lift <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> stop fixating on it—I remember thinking my house was the problem, and I'd {{need to go to}} France in order to write, and I would have been scared without Rex [...] I got through it.

500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It {{took me a while}} to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's not the kind of song I would write myself. But <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E
