5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, organ {{builders}} began to incorporate digital components into their key, stop, and combination actions. Besides making these mechanisms simpler and more reliable, this <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> possible to record and play back an organist's performance via the MIDI protocol. In addition, some organ builders have incorporated digital stops into their pipe organs.|$|E
5|$|The Mendips {{are home}} {{to a wide range}} of outdoor sports and leisure activities, {{including}} hunting, caving, climbing, and abseiling. The rich variety of fauna and flora <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> attractive for hillwalking and those interested in natural history.|$|E
5|$|The {{effective}} {{radiated power}} (ERP) of the Green Pine <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> a possible candidate for conversion into a directed-energy weapon, by focusing pulses of radar energy on target missiles. The energy spikes are tailored to enter missiles through antennas or sensor apertures where they can fool guidance systems, scramble computer memories or even burn out sensitive electronic components.|$|E

5|$|The high {{non-linearity}} of {{lithium niobate}} <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> useful in non-linear optics applications. It is used extensively in telecommunication {{products such as}} mobile phones and optical modulators, for such components as resonant crystals. Lithium applications are used in more than 60% of mobile phones.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{peninsula}} makes accurate weather prediction difficult for the town; when driving down Melody Line, {{it is not uncommon}} to find it sunny between one set of tunnels, rainy between another, and foggy between yet another. Ikata's position, stretching out into the ocean, <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> a frequent target for typhoons.|$|E
5|$|Users of Microsoft Windows {{typically}} install one of {{the native}} binary distributions of Perl for Win32, most commonly Strawberry Perl or ActivePerl. Compiling Perl from source code under Windows is possible, but most installations lack the requisite C compiler and build tools. This <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> difficult to install modules from the CPAN, particularly those that are partially written in C.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{properties}} of rattan that <b>make</b> <b>it</b> suitable for furniture <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a popular choice for handicraft and art pieces. Uses include rattan baskets, plant containers, and other decorative works.|$|R
50|$|<b>Its</b> various {{properties}} <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> {{very useful}} as a material in additive manufacturing; specifically as a filament in consumer and professional grade fused deposition modeling 3D printers.|$|R
25|$|Matted {{coats and}} skin with lumpy lesions <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more {{difficult}} to find ticks. Some veterinarians perform a close clip of the entire coat to help find attached ticks.|$|R
5|$|As {{the second}} largest {{metropolitan}} area in Oklahoma and a hub for the growing Northeastern Oklahoma-Northwest Arkansas-Southwestern Missouri corridor, the city {{is also home to}} a number of the region's most sophisticated law, accounting and medical practices. Its location {{in the center of the}} nation <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> a hub for logistics businesses; the Tulsa International Airport (TUL) and the Tulsa Port of Catoosa, connect the region with international trade and transportation.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{described}} Aldfrith as a scholar, and {{his interest}} in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a sapiens, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It implies a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king. Bede <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> clear that the church in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated {{from the time of}} Aldfrith's death.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May 1937, Egypt {{became the}} last state {{to join the}} League. The first member to {{withdraw}} permanently from the League was Costa Rica on 22 January 1925; having joined on 16 December 1920, this <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> the member to have most quickly withdrawn. Brazil was the first founding member to withdraw (14 June 1926), and Haiti the last (April 1942). Iraq, which joined in 1932, was the first member {{that had previously been}} a League of Nations mandate.|$|E

5|$|Sherlock Holmes Baffled is a {{very short}} American silent film created in 1900 with {{cinematography}} by Arthur Marvin. It is the earliest known film to feature Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character Sherlock Holmes, albeit in a form unlike that of later screen incarnations. The inclusion of the character <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> the first recorded detective film. In the film, a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals a sack of items from Sherlock Holmes. At each point, Holmes's attempts to thwart the intruder end in failure.|$|E
5|$|The first volcanoes {{along the}} Juan de Fuca ridge, {{including}} Axial Seamount, were {{detected in the}} 1970s by satellite altimetry. Axial Seamount's proximity to the western coast and shallow depth make {{it one of the}} most easily accessible seamounts in the world, and its unique geological setting and active state <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> one of the most interesting, rivaling Davidson Seamount to the south in scientific interest.|$|E
5|$|The same {{isolation}} {{that produced}} Kohala's unique ecosystem <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> very vulnerable to invasive species. Alien plants and feral animals {{are among the}} greatest threats to the local ecology. Plants like the kahili ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum) and the strawberry guava (Psidium cattleinum) displace native species. Prior to human settlement, many major organisms such as conifers and rodents never made it onto the island, so the ecosystem never developed defenses against them, leaving Hawaii vulnerable to damage by hoofed animals, rodents, and predation.|$|E

50|$|The tough {{metal and}} thick blade of a cleaver <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a {{suitable}} tool for crushing {{with the side}} of the blade - wheras some hard, thin slicing knives could crack under such repeated stress.|$|R
5|$|The spiny scallop {{usually has}} a {{symbiotic}} relationship with an encrusting sponge which grows on its left valve. This is most often the orange Myxilla incrustans but is sometimes the purple or brown Mycale adherens. The sponge provides camouflage for the scallop and may deter predators from attacking it as sponges often produce a repulsive odour and tend to be distasteful. It <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> more difficult for a starfish to get the strong grip with its tube feet {{that it needs to}} force the two valves of the scallop apart.|$|E
5|$|Krabs' rival {{and former}} best friend Plankton {{operates}} the Chum Bucket, a failing restaurant {{across the street}} from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the series is Plankton's futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer sidekick Karen, under the assumption that they would be able to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent Plankton from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty legitimately out of fear that Plankton might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula. Krabs <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> his duty to ensure that the Chum Bucket never has any business whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Pokémon Red and Blue allow {{players to}} trade Pokémon between two {{cartridges}} via a Game Link Cable. This method of trading {{must be done}} to fully complete the Pokédex since certain Pokémon will only evolve upon being traded and each of the two games have version-exclusive Pokémon. The Link Cable <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> possible to battle another player's Pokémon team. When playing Red or Blue on a Game Boy Advance or SP, the standard GBA/SP link cable will not work; players must use the Nintendo Universal Game Link Cable instead. Moreover, the English versions of the games are incompatible with their Japanese counterparts, and such trades will corrupt the save files, as the games use different languages and therefore character sets.|$|E
50|$|Female {{sex workers}} have less {{access to medical}} {{services}} which makes prevention and treatment more difficult to acquire. The social stigma and poverty that often accompany sex work <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> difficult to get prevention measures and treatment.|$|R
50|$|The FTIs, of a {{contained}} size, {{would better}} {{correspond to the}} demands of the export markets according to the Directorate-General for Armaments and <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> possible to maintain the development and production capacities of the French shipyards.|$|R
50|$|Panda MultiEco is {{equipped}} with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine - future developments will <b>also</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix - combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.|$|R
5|$|Shepseskare is {{completely}} absent from another king list {{dating to the}} same period: the Abydos king list, written {{during the reign of}} Seti I (1294–1279 BC). He is also absent from the Turin canon (reign of Ramses II), although in this case a lacuna affects the papyrus on which the list is written at the place where Shepseskare and Neferefre's names should have been. Of the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list, only one reign length is still legible and it has been variously read as one year, eleven years or one to four months. The damaged state of the papyrus <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> impossible to decide safely whose reign length this is.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Up All Night: The Live Tour debuted {{at number}} one on Billboard Top Music Videos chart with first-week sales of 76,000 copies, surpassing sales of the Billboard 200 number one album, John Mayer's Born and Raised, which sold 65,000 copies. One Direction made US chart history as the feat {{marks the first time}} a music DVD had outsold the Billboard 200 number one album. Its opening figure <b>also</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> the highest music DVD debut of 2012 and the second highest debut {{in the past five years}} behind Adele's Live at the Royal Albert Hall, which {{launched}} at number one in December 2011, with 96,000 copies. In the week ending 27 January 2013, Up All Night: The Live Tour claimed its 30th week on top of the Top Music Videos Chart, which is longer than any other title since the chart originated in March 1995. It surpassed Ray Stevens' Comedy Video Classics, which logged 29 weeks on top in 1993-1994. The recording was ultimately certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 29 May 2013, indicating shipments of 500,000 copies. In Mexico the DVD debuted at number-one of the Music DVD Chart selling over 10,000 copies, being certified Gold in its first week. Two months after its release it had gone on to sell over 40,000 copies and was certified double platinum by Mexican Recording Industry Association (AMPROFON). Up All Night: The Live Tour ended up as the best selling International DVD of the year with sales of 50,000.|$|E
