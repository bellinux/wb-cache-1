C., he said [...] "Climate change occurs no matter what. The question is, can and should the federal government do something about it.(sic) And I would argue the federal government, with all its tax and regulatory schemes, can't." [...] On October 13, 2014, during a debate against Democratic challenger Rob Zerban in Kenosha, Wisconsin both candidates were asked if human activity was to blame for climate change, and Ryan answered: [...] "I don't know the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question.</b> I don't think science does, either." ...|$|E

In a talk on the Soviet threat that I heard him give in the 1980s at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, he {{reminded}} the audience of Machiavelli's observation in The Prince that 'all armed prophets have conquered and all unarmed ones failed.' But what happens, Aron asked, if the prophet, having conquered and then ruled by force of arms, loses faith in his own prophecy? In the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question,</b> Aron suggested, lay {{the key to understanding}} the future of the Soviet Union." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anderson is [...] With her English {{accent and}} background, she was mocked and felt {{out of place}} as a {{teenager}} in the American Midwest and soon adopted a Midwestern accent. To this day, she easily shifts between her American and English accents. In May 2013, during an interview with BlogTalkRadio, Anderson addressed the matter of her national identity: [...] "I've been asked whether I feel more like a Brit than an American and I don't know what the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> is. I know that I feel that London is home and I'm very happy with that as my home. I love London as a city and I feel very comfortable there. In terms of identity, I'm still a bit baffled." ...|$|E
2500|$|The metaphysical {{question}} is sometimes asked: [...] "Could quantum mechanics be extended by adding so-called [...] "hidden variables" [...] to the mathematical formalism, {{to convert it}} from an epistemic to an ontic theory?" [...] The Copenhagen interpretation answers this with a strong 'No'. It is sometimes alleged, for example by J.S. Bell, that Einstein opposed the Copenhagen interpretation because {{he believed that the}} <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> of [...] "hidden variables" [...] was [...] "yes". That allegation has achieved mythical potency, but is mistaken. Countering that myth, Max Jammer writes [...] "Einstein never proposed a hidden variable theory." [...] Einstein explored the possibility of a hidden variable theory, and wrote a paper describing his exploration, but withdrew it from publication because he felt it was faulty.|$|E

2500|$|Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: [...] "The Goldstone Report {{is a field}} court-martial, and its {{findings}} were prewritten. This is a prize for terror. The report {{makes it difficult for}} democracies to fight terror." [...] On another occasion, Netanyahu said that the report ignored Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza and the Palestinian rocket attacks that preceded the war. He also warned world leaders that they and their anti-terror forces could be targets for charges similar to those in the report. At the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu called the report biased and unjust, asking: [...] "Will you stand with Israel or will you stand with the terrorists? We must know the <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> now. Only if we have the confidence that we can defend ourselves can we take further risks for peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Milligan and Harry Secombe {{became friends}} while {{serving in the}} Royal Artillery during the Second World War. Famously, Milligan first {{encountered}} Secombe after Gunner Milligan's artillery unit accidentally allowed a large howitzer to roll off a cliff, under which Secombe {{was sitting in a}} small wireless truck: [...] "Suddenly there was a terrible noise as some monstrous object fell from the sky quite close to us. There was considerable confusion, {{and in the middle of}} it all the flap of the truck was pushed open and a young, helmeted idiot asked 'Anybody see a gun?' It was Milligan." [...] Secombe's <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> was [...] "What colour was it?" [...] Milligan met Peter Sellers after the war at the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and the three became close friends.|$|E
2500|$|The Labour Party came {{to power}} in 1997 with a {{manifesto}} saying, [...] "We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote animal welfare, including a free vote in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned." [...] A new private member's bill, introduced by Michael Foster MP, received a second reading with 411 MPs voting in support, but failed due to lack of parliamentary time. The Burns Report in 2000 concluded that forms of fox hunting [...] "seriously compromise the welfare of the fox", but (in line with its remit) did not draw any conclusion on whether hunting should be banned or should continue. In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, Lord Burns also stated that [...] "Naturally, people ask whether we were implying that hunting is cruel... The short <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>question</b> is no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area." [...] Following the Burns inquiry, the Government introduced an 'options bill' which allowed each House of Parliament to choose between a ban, licensed hunting, and self-regulation. The House of Commons voted for a banning bill and the House of Lords for self-regulation. The 2001 general election was then called and the bill ran out of parliamentary time.|$|E
