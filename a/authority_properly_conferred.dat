For this purpose, questionnaires were distributed to managers and responses were evaluated. The secondary purpose of this study is to identify if employees in tourism industry has the required qualifications. Also, if the sector has low efficiency, reasons are investigated. This study uses the survey method. Questionnaires were distributed to 222 managers in the tourism sector, who mainly work in Istanbul and Izmir. 183 managers in accommodation enterprises, 22 managers in travel agencies and 17 managers in food and beverage companies were interviewed face-to-face and questionnaire forms were filled. The survey includes 52 questions that collect information about managers and their organizations.

40|$|Rosalind Hursthouse, Mark LeBar, Martha Nussbaum, {{and other}} {{contemporary}} philosophers have brought virtue ethics into conversation with political philosophy. These philosophers agree with Aristotle that {{the function of}} political authority is to enable persons to live well. But we still lack an account of how the virtues, as characteristics of persons, relate to political authority as a property of institutions. I argue that the authority of political institutions depends on performing the function of enabling persons to live well, while the virtues require, but also limit, the authority of political institutions. According to the account I develop, living well consists {{in the exercise of}} practical wisdom within a socially embedded institutional context. Political institutions enable living well by means of institutionally defined rights such as property rights that protect the exercise of practical wisdom, and they promote its development through the institutions of civil society such as the family. But, I argue, political authority is limited by the individual virtue of justice, understood as balancing conformity to the existing social norms and laws of a community with their necessary updating through ideals of virtue. Ultimately, I conclude that political <b>authority</b> <b>properly</b> functions to promote an indirect conception of the common good, according to which persons relate to each other virtuously through their shared institutions...|$|R

40|$|Between {{the late}} 60 's and early 90 's {{intensive}} exploitation of residual soil for civil construction {{took place in}} the municipality of Ubatuba, North Coast of São Paulo State. Tropical climatic conditions associated with a hilly landscape bordered by the Atlantic Ocean gave rise to thick (10 - 30 m) weathering profiles derived from Precambrian granitic-gneissic rocks. Exploitation of large volumes of this material required only very simple technology, which on the other hand has caused highly adverse environmental impacts, such asdeforestation, soil erosion, land instability hazards, scenic eterioration, pollution and disturbance of local water flow regime. This paper deals with the devising of strategies thus identifying stakeholders and describing their roles both on the dereliction and reclamation processes related with residual soil exploitation. The evaluation approach focused on the analysis of the regulatory framework and its practical implications and issues in terms of licensing for mining operations, commercialization of construction materials, and the relations of such mining activities with regional and urban planning. A survey of stakeholderviewpoints was successfully achieved through a two-day workshop. The attendance included decision-makers, officials and representatives of governmental and regulatory bodies (Federal, State and Municipal), environmental research institutions, private miners (entrepreneurs) and consultants, public attorney, and NGOs. The outcomes have ndicated that State and local <b>authorities</b> <b>properly</b> managed to stop illegal exploitation of residual soil in the early 90 ´s. However no land reclamation was undertaken until present. One of the main problems would be related with the procedures for mining and environmental licensing that were considered to be too complex and long (usually involving up to seven decisional instances and 2, 5 years in average). Other key issues and needs identified included: a) organization of a database in a Geographic Information System; b) formulation of a Regional Mining Directive Plan consonant with the other Management Plans; c) regulation of land ownership; d) regulatory framework able to reconcile development and preservation so that to prevent illegal mining; e) development of integrated models for reclamation taking comprehensive consideration to aggregate production, reduction of risks and land recovering...|$|R

The results of this study are as follows. First, the concept of leadership in pituduh (hint) that fit into the category of divinity has two leadership instructions: (1) be applicable <b>authorities</b> <b>properly,</b> (2) the truth of God into a basic truth of the ruler. The concept of leadership in pituduh (hint) that fit into the category of nationality include (1) a good leader is a dreamer fair, spirited noble, able to give jobs to the people, (2) A good leader is a leader who can reassure the people, (3) A good leader is willing and able to fix the flaws and vices, (4) leadership is a trust from God, (5) A good leader wary of praise, (6) a good leader wary of bad temper, (7) the leader of the evil is the leader dangerous, (8) Choosing a good leader is not an evil leader, (9) the evil leader will declare evil is goodness. Second, the concept of leadership in wewaler (Prohibition) includes two categories, namely humanity and nationality. Category prohibition in humanitarian terms include a ban on the leaders of banned arrogant leader. The prohibition in respect of nationality shows that good leaders leaned pleasure and sadness on the basis pleasure and pain the people, not on personal pleasure and pain. </p...|$|R

25|$|Traditionally, a {{distinction}} was drawn between jurisdictional errors {{of law and}} non-jurisdictional errors of law. A jurisdictional error of law was committed when a public authority made a decision or took some action even though it lacked jurisdiction to do so, for example, if the process was tainted by simple ultra vires. In this event, the High Court could judicially review the matter. On the other hand, a non-jurisdictional error of law occurred when an <b>authority</b> was <b>properly</b> empowered {{to make a decision}} or take action, but it was alleged that the authority had exercised its discretion in breach of some administrative law principle. In such cases, the Court was not allowed to intervene by exercising judicial review, save in certain circumstances such as a breach of natural justice. This distinction applied both to the exercise of power by public authorities and to courts and tribunals.|$|R

The 1981 model bus was reconditioned in 2002 and had been given a road-worthiness certificate by the vehicle examination authorities until late December 2011. Concerns and questions were raised as to how an old and unfit bus was still allowed to be operational on the road and how the bus was allowed to be illegally overloaded in excess to its maximum passenger capacity. A large number of families and relatives of the affected victims soon gathered outside the school after listening to the news.

40|$|Due to the {{decreasing}} {{availability of}} water resources and the increasing competition for water between residential, industrial, and agricultural users, increasing irrigation efficiency, by methods like subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems, is a pressing concern for agricultural <b>authorities.</b> To <b>properly</b> manage SDI systems, and increase {{the efficiency of the}} water/fertilizer use while reducing water losses due to evaporation, the precise distribution of water around the emitters must be known. In this paper, the Windows-based computer software package HYDRUS- 2 D, which numerically simulates water, heat, and/or solute movement in two-dimensional, variably-saturated porous media, was used to evaluate the distribution of water around the emitter in a clay loam soil. The simulation results were compared with two sets of laboratory and field experiments involving SDI with emitters installed at different depths, and were evaluated using the root-mean-square-error (RMSE). The RMSE at different locations varied between 0. 011 and 0. 045 for volumetric water contents, and between 0. 98 and 4. 36 cm for wetting dimensions. Based on these values, it can be concluded that the correspondence between simulations and observations was very good. Subsurface drip irrigation HYDRUS- 2 D Wetting dimensions...|$|R
