5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's based on <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> never {{actually}} met {{and is therefore}} being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but I used to get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
2500|$|The {{couple was}} {{strongly}} criticized for the relationship, and Wrangler {{was accused of}} [...] "turning straight" [...] and entering the relationship simply for money. However, Wrangler always considered himself homosexual. [...] "I'm not bisexual and I'm not straight", Wrangler later said. [...] "I'm gay, but I could never live a gay lifestyle, because I'm much too competitive. When I was with <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> would {{always want to be}} better than him: what we were accomplishing, what we were wearing—anything. With a woman you compete like crazy, but coming from different points of view, and as far as I'm concerned, that was doable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{engaged in}} a feud with Don Frye during {{his career in the}} Pride Fighting Championships, whose {{background}} was Don Frye's trash talking. In 1999, Alicia Webb (also known as Ryan Shamrock) dated Ken Shamrock until early 2003. Frye made comments to the effect that Shamrock cheated on and divorced his wife to date a young girl (Alicia Webb was 19 and Ken Shamrock was 35 when they started dating). Frye also joked that Ken's (at the time) estranged father Bob and brother Frank would be in Frye's corner for the fight. Ken Shamrock was enraged by Frye's trash talk, causing a feud between Shamrock and Frye. Since then, Frye has stated that he only resorted to personal trash talk to make Ken want to fight him. Frye said: [...] "I saw Ken Shamrock whoop him (Dan Severn) at UFC 6 and I thought, [...] "That's <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> gotta fight. Anybody who can whoop Dan Severn like that has gotta be a man and I want to test my size against his size. I had the chance to talk trash and they gave me the fight; I crossed the line. I wasn't professional about it, but Ken was and after the fight, we shook hands and went our separate ways." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I dun'no'; you're so darn honest, {{and you got}} so {{much more}} sense than this bunch of Bronx totties. Gee! they'll make bum stenogs. I know. I've worked in an office. They'll keep their gum and a looking-glass in the upper {{right-hand}} drawer of their typewriter desks, {{and the old man}} will call them down eleventy times a day, and they'll marry the shipping-clerk first time he sneaks out from behind a box. But you got sense, and somehow--gee! I never know how to express things--glad I'm taking this English composition stuff--oh, you just seem to understand <b>a</b> <b>guy.</b> <b>I</b> never liked that Yid Weintraub till you made me see how darn clever and nice he really is, even if he does wear spats." ...|$|E
60|$|I wish, though, it {{were not}} so, and that one could be good, and respectable, and {{sensible}} without making one's self <b>a</b> <b>guy.</b> <b>I</b> look in the glass sometimes at my two long, cylindrical bags (so picturesquely rugged about the knees), my stand-up collar and billycock hat, and wonder what right I have to go about making God's world hideous. Then wild and wicked thoughts come into my heart. I don't want to be good and respectable. (I never can be sensible, I'm told; so that don't matter.) I want to put on lavender-colored tights, with red velvet breeches and a green doublet slashed with yellow; to have a light-blue silk cloak on my shoulder, and a black eagle's plume waving from my hat, and a big sword, and a falcon, and a lance, and a prancing horse, so that I might go about and gladden {{the eyes of the}} people. Why should we all try to look like ants crawling over a dust-heap? Why shouldn't we dress a little gayly? I am sure if we did we should be happier. True, it is a little thing, but we are a little race, and what is the use of our pretending otherwise and spoiling fun? Let philosophers get themselves up like old crows if they like. But let me be a butterfly.|$|E

I ain't any more an' haven't been for a long time; but before I took a tumble to myself I'd have hated you, Bridge.

5000|$|By the '80s, Small {{had become}} {{dissatisfied}} with life in New York, the grueling schedule of performing in local clubs {{and on the}} road, and the music business in general. Bad decisions and unfair contracts had soured him on the industry. When the sight in his good eye started to go and everything got fuzzy, he signed away the rights {{to one of his}} songs. [...] "It was to <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> had taken a liking to, <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> trusted," [...] he said. Small moved back to New Orleans and took his music to the streets, where it would belong only to him and to the passersby who heard it.|$|E
5000|$|I didn't do {{any sport}} outside school, and I {{certainly}} didn't do any at university. Eventually though, I got into triathlon when I started work, because <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> worked with did {{them and he}} seemed to be having a lot of fun. The triathletes I met were such nice people I just sort of got hooked.|$|E

He was quite <b>a</b> tricky <b>guy.</b> <b>I</b> don't think he was {{deliberately}} lying but if you asked him the same question three times he would just get irritated and refuse to answer." ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{freshman}} year of college, Morrison already {{was a regular}} performer on Broadway. He said in Details, [...] "There were all these beautiful, beautiful dancers. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> straight <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> had some room. There were the shared interests in singing and dancing, and I always find dancing with someone very erotic and sexual.

And then I just believe him as <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> would know around Omaha or meet in Billings. He has a very, very believable quality. And I also think for the character of David {{he is capable of}} communicating a certain wide-eyed quality toward life and also damage - like he's been damaged somehow, somewhere.|$|E

Her forename is an alternate spelling of Belinda and was chosen by her grandfather.

5000|$|Kevin Moran, one of Prendergast's teammates, said of him {{upon his}} retirement: [...] "He {{was one of}} the true greats, he {{was one of the}} team’s great leaders. He led on and off the field. His hurling did the talking and then when needed he would offer the {{required}} words off the field. In the last couple of years he took the panel’s younger members under his wing, showed them ropes. His experience was vital. Seamus was <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>I</b> looked up to and who showed me the ropes when I came on board.".|$|E

After the firing, Dudley was asked if Cunneyworth could possibly return to the team and responded, [...] "I'm not going to commit to (looking at Cunneyworth).
