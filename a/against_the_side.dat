5|$|During the 18th century, Stokesay Castle {{continued}} to be leased by the Baldwyn family, although they sublet the property {{to a range of}} tenants; after this point it ceased {{to be used as a}} domestic dwelling. Two wood and plaster buildings, built <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the hall, were demolished around 1800, and by the early 19th century the castle was being used for storing grain and manufacturing, including barrel-making, coining and a smithy.|$|E
5|$|State Route364 (SR364) is a north–south state {{route in}} Ohio. It starts from SR705 near Yorkshire. The route moves north across several counties, then {{northeast}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the Grand Lake. SR 364 then travels west along a concurrency with SR 703, and ends at SR29 near St. Marys. The route was designated in1934, from SR 219 to SR 29. It was extended southwards to SR 705 in 1936 and completely paved by 1940. SR 364 was also extended in 1973 {{to the new}} alignment of SR 29.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{tries to}} shoot West with a shotgun, but the blasts {{do not stop}} West, who throws the sheriff over the railing into power lines, killing him. West hits Nelson and knocks him over the railing, leaving the doctor hanging on the side. Nelson appeals to West, {{reminding}} him that they were friends, and West decides to pull Nelson to safety. Two armed security guards then arrive and, in a panic, fatally shoot Nelson in the face {{as he tries to}} protect West. An infuriated West kills the security guards and stumbles away. After collapsing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of a building, he slowly melts completely away. The next morning, a janitor finds his gory remains and casually mops them into a garbage can. The film ends with a radio news report about another astronaut team being sent to Saturn.|$|E

5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} a {{courtship}} flight conducted above the trees. The pair fly on a strongly oscillating path with one bird ascending {{while the other}} is descending, both calling constantly. After display, the birds land on a branch for a mating ritual which starts with locking bills, followed by the female hanging upside-down for a variable period of time, and then copulation while the male holds the female's neck. The flight and mating rituals have been recorded for three-coloured and red-throated parrotfinches, and may be typical for the genus. The nest is built with fresh grass blades, and is domed with a side entrance. It is always hidden in thick foliage, but can be at any height from the ground. The normal clutch is four spherical whitish eggs. Chicks are naked and have pinkish skin; the distinctive gape has blue nodular spots technically termed as papillae or tubercles at {{the upper and lower}} corners, and the yellow palate has a ring of five black spots. Most young estrildid finches beg for food with their wings held <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> but juvenile parrotfinches lift the wing on the side away from the feeding parent. This behaviour may restrict competition for food from other nestlings.|$|E
25|$|The main {{magazine}} was constructed of off-form concrete, with a corridor around three sides of two rooms that are built <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the hill. Markings remain of the storage racks that held ammunition for the guns.|$|E

5000|$|De Wit {{played no}} first class rugby in 2013, but did score eight tries in 13 {{appearances}} during the 2013 Under-21 Provincial Championship competition, including a hat-trick <b>against</b> <b>the</b> [...] <b>side</b> and a brace <b>against</b> <b>the</b> [...] <b>side.</b>|$|R
25|$|After the 2007 Cricket World Cup, {{carrying}} a highly aggressive and respected reputation, Nel joined the English County of Essex, making his debut for the 2005 and 2006 Pro 40 Champions <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> he first experienced the English game with, Northamptonshire.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} {{depth of}} the game, however, derives {{to a large extent}} from blocking strategies designed to limit the opponent's mobility. It can be advantageous to pin one or more enemy checkers <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of board by moving in the second row or column.|$|E
25|$|To {{grip the}} ball for a leg-spinning delivery, the ball is placed into the palm with the seam {{parallel}} to the palm. The first two fingers then spread and grip the ball, and {{the third and fourth}} fingers close together and rest <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the ball. The first bend of the third finger should grasp the seam. The thumb resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> is up to the bowler, but should impart no pressure. When the ball is bowled, the third finger will apply most of the spin. The wrist is cocked as it comes down by the hip, and the wrist moves sharply from right to left as the ball is released, adding more spin. The ball is tossed up to provide flight. The batsman will see the back of the hand when the ball is released.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's the man, sir.' The maids and men {{sitting under}} the cows were all attentively {{listening}} to this discourse, milking irregularly, and softly directing <b>the</b> jets <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> pail.|$|R
50|$|A {{bladder press}} {{consists}} of a large cylinder, closed at each end, into which the fruit is loaded. To press the grapes, a large bladder expands and pushes <b>the</b> grapes <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> <b>The</b> juice then flows out through small openings in the cylinder. The cylinder rotates during the process to help homogenize the pressure that {{is placed on the}} grapes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quick, Tantor!" [...] {{shouted the}} ape-man, {{and the beast}} swung him to his head. [...] "Hurry!" [...] and the mighty pachyderm lumbered off through the jungle, guided by kicking of naked heels <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of his head.|$|R
25|$|After wartime {{experiences}} suggested improvements, Consolidated PBY Catalina aircraft {{were given}} extra features to augment their air-sea rescue capability. One such invention {{was a small}} platform that could be braced <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the flying boat's hull to allow a team of two Catalina crewmen to lean out {{into the water and}} rescue a swimmer.|$|E
25|$|When the {{antennae}} of rockpool prawns Palaemon elegans are rubbed with {{sodium hydroxide}} or acetic acid (both are irritants in mammals), they increase grooming and rubbing of the afflicted area <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the tank; this reaction is inhibited by benzocaine (a local anaesthetic in mammals), even though control prawns treated with only anaesthetic {{do not show}} reduced activity.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound {{provides}} {{visualization of}} the thoracic and abdominal structures, and can sometimes rule out or narrow down a diagnosis. Information {{that may be}} gleaned from ultrasonographic findings include the presence of sand, distention, entrapment, strangulation, intussusception, and wall thickening of intestinal loops, as well as diagnose nephrosplenic entrapment, peritonitis, abdominal tumors, and inguinal or scrotal hernias. Abdominal ultrasound requires an experienced operator to accurately diagnose the cause of colic. It may be applied <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the horse, as well as transrectally.|$|E
50|$|After {{conclusion}} of the group stage the four runners-up with <b>the</b> best record <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> first, third, fourth and fifth in their groups played home and away matches, to determine the last participant in the FIFA World Cup.|$|R
25|$|Rail anchors or Anticreepers are {{spring steel}} clips that {{attach to the}} {{underside}} of the rail baseplate and bear <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> sleepers to prevent longitudinal movement of the rail, either from changes in temperature or through vibration.|$|R
50|$|Sidemounting stages: Sidemount stages is the {{practice}} of using sidemount configuration (bungee loops and/or buttplate rails) {{as a means for}} stowing stage/deco cylinders in a streamlined manner <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> torso, when otherwise diving in back-mounted doubles or CCR.|$|R
25|$|When the {{antennae}} of rockpool prawns (Palaemon elegans) are rubbed with {{sodium hydroxide}} or acetic acid (both are irritants), the animals show increased grooming and rubbing of the afflicted area <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the tank. Furthermore, this reaction is inhibited {{by a local}} anaesthetic, even though control prawns treated with only anaesthetic did not show reduced activity. Other scientists suggested the rubbing may reflect an attempt to clean the affected area as application of anaesthetic alone caused an increase in grooming.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
25|$|The first rescue {{attempts}} were made {{on the following day}} when two tugboats tried to turn the stern of Sampo towards open water together with the icebreaker's own engine and rudder. However, the task was deemed impossible and the tugboats evacuated the pilot and the women working in the icebreaker's kitchen to Mäntyluoto. On 8 January Sampo was further damaged when the wind pushed a large ice floe <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the icebreaker and the waves began pounding her hull against the rocks. Both engine rooms flooded and the pumps stopped. In the following night Sampo slowly settled in the bottom, listing the partially submerged icebreaker approximately 20 degrees starboard. The remaining crew members were evacuated in heavy weather and freezing temperatures on the following day. The salvaging Sampo was awarded to the Finnish salvage company Neptun Oy, but the task was deemed impossible in the presence of ice.|$|E
60|$|All {{the while}} {{the boys were}} eating, the small cakes of ice thumped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> steamer. But this did no damage, although, as the {{professor}} explained, there was danger of some ice getting caught in the propeller.|$|R

50|$|A hold fast {{is shaped}} like a shepherd's hook. In use, the shank fits loosely into a hole in <b>the</b> top or <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> bench and {{the tip of the}} hook is pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> work. The hold fast is set by rapping the top with a mallet, which causes the shaft to wedge <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> hole. It is {{released}} by hitting <b>the</b> back <b>side.</b>|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{international}} break {{at the start of}} September it was almost two weeks before the next round was played. A timeout well needed by the club that played two matches per week {{for the better part of}} the season. After the break Maribor bounced back with another home victory, 5–2 against Celje. In the ninth round they salvaged a point against Koper who took the lead twice during the match. The final score at Bonifika stadium was 2–2. After the first quarter of the season Maribor was on first place, with three-point lead over Olimpija. Poor form continued when the club won only one point in matches against Gorica (1–1) and Nafta (2–0). The loss <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> from Lendava was the first home league defeat since 16 March 2011 when Maribor was defeated 1–0, also by Nafta. The final league match in September, against Rudar Velenje, was postponed as Maribor had obligations in the UEFA Europa League where they faced Birmingham City.|$|E
25|$|After the serve, {{the players}} take turns {{hitting the ball}} against the front wall, above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, {{as long as it}} hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting the front wall. A ball landing on either the out line or the line {{along the top of the}} tin is {{considered}} to be out. After the ball hits the front wall, it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> or back walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.|$|E
25|$|An English side led by H. H. Stephenson toured {{later in}} the 1861–62 season, the first {{overseas}} tour of Australia. Moore played a number of matches <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> – one for a New South Wales XXII, and two for a combined New South Wales and Victoria XXII. He opened the bowling {{in the first two}} matches, bowling over 30 four-ball overs in each of the English side's first innings, but was later overshadowed by his brother George, who took seventeen wickets in the final two matches in Sydney. Jemmy Moore once again played for New South Wales when another English side led by George Parr toured during the 1863–64 season, and also featured in a match against a Queensland XXII, finishing with 9/14 in Queensland's second innings. Moore subsequently went to Brisbane to play and coach professionally, but he returned to Maitland after a few years, looking after the local cricket pitch. He died in Maitland in 1890 after a brief illness. A number of Moore's relations went on to play at high levels – two sons, Leon and Bill, a grandson, Frank Cummins, and a grandnephew, Charlie Macartney, all played for New South Wales.|$|E
50|$|The player {{controls}} Andrew, {{the one man}} team. Ord and Clee are robots whose goal is {{to destroy}} him any way they can (by driving him <b>against</b> <b>the</b> boards, into a spinner, or by hitting him with a supercharged ball). Knock out Ord and Clee with your ball or by hitting them <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> Points are also scored by hitting the goal and hitting the targets on <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
60|$|He was {{conducted}} to the large council-room which was above the hall.
