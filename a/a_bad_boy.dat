500|$|Although Paul {{changed his}} ways to an extent, he still {{shows signs of}} being evil. Dennis has stated that he and fellow cast member, Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) {{purposely}} portray hints of his former self. Of this Dennis stated: [...] "I like to keep that boiling under the surface so that the audience will always think 'what is he up to next?'. You never quite know if he will burst out into Mr. Evil or stay as the character {{he is at the}} moment. Alan Fletcher keeps it alive as well, by always looking out {{the corner of his eye}} and thinking 'I just don't trust you!'" [...] Dennis later defended his character to the Birmingham Post after he was branded an evil character, describing him in his early years: [...] "Paul started out as a university student, which people have forgotten, he was studying engineering then, much to his father's disgust, left to join an airline and became a trolley dolly.

Dennis has also stated that he loves playing Paul as a [...] "baddie", because in his opinion he is so colourful, not just an average bad guy, adding: [...] "He's not just a black and white bad guy, he's a sneaky bastard.

At the debate (moderated by the head of George Takei) Bender gives a heartfelt speech, which the audience applauds. The Professor follows with his rebuttal, relaying a story from his past where {{he was in love with}} a fellow scientist named Eunice whom he later discovered in bed with a robot, breaking his heart. Because of this, the Professor hates robosexuals. [...] This does not impress the audience. [...] Frustrated by the audience's lack of sympathy for his cause, he accidentally admits that Eunice was actually a robot. [...] Having suppressed the truth for so long, Farnsworth reveals that the robot's name was actually Unit C and that he caught her in bed with another robot. [...] With his heart broken, he takes his anger out on other robosexuals. After admitting the truth, the Professor withdraws his argument, now fully in support of Proposition Infinity.

[...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault.

[...] As the chorus begins, the background incorporates synthesized string chords, and she sings, [...] "Hey, I just met you, And this is crazy, But here's my number, So call me maybe." [...] Melody Lau of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Call Me Maybe" [...] is a [...] "Taylor Swift meets Robyn" [...] song. The title track, [...] "Curiosity", has a similar sound to [...] "Call Me Maybe", and features heavy dance beats and catchy hooks. In the song, Jepsen sings about being poorly treated by <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>boy,</b> and begs for more of his love. [...] "Picture" [...] is a ballad that focuses on patience in a relationship. Critics noted that the song would work well during the climax of a motion picture due to its lyrical content. [...] "Talk to Me" [...] and [...] "Just a Step Away" [...] were both described as mid-tempo pop songs that alludes to summer love, teen love and that first crush. Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada noted that in both tracks, Carly is able to transcend the listener [...] "to a porch swing or riding a bicycle along an old dirt road in the countryside’s summer sunshine. Her voice sings the highs and lows of love and everything that comes along with it." [...] The final song is a cover of Joni Mitchell's [...] "Both Sides Now". Musically, the song is also an upbeat ballad, and differs from the original version {{in the sense that}} Jepsen's version is [...] "fresh and modern with her unique bubblegum twist." [...] Critics also added that Jepsen will be able to [...] "attract a new generation to this widely recognized hit" [...] with her [...] "unique version." ...|$|E

Instead, a raw version of this song (and entire concert) appeared on the bootleg <b>A</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>Boy</b> from a Good Family, and other versions have appeared on bootleg records such as A Kind of Loving (a rip of a performance in Oxford recorded and broadcast by the BBC).

The sixth and seventh tracks [...] "Drop Dead (Beautiful)" [...] and [...] "Seal It With a Kiss" [...] were commented as [...] "fillers" [...] by Christopher Kostakis of Samesame.com.au. [...] "Big Fat Bass" [...] is Femme Fatales eighth track, and it was said that it [...] "sticks to dancefloor essentials". The song was further noted as being catchy, but repetitive by Idolator. [...] "Trouble for Me", the ninth song on the album, features a pre-chorus filled with [...] "melting, wheezing synths" [...] likened to a [...] "Wiley grime wobble," [...] segueing into a [...] "Janet Jackson vocal." [...] Spears' voice had been Auto-Tuned, but her voice was described as [...] "raw" [...] and the tones and wines as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "one of a kind". [...] "Criminal", the last track on the album's standard edition, is a guitar-driven midtempo song, which incorporates a folk-style flute melody. Erin Thompson of the Seattle Weekly said the song [...] "takes a breather from aggressive, wall-to-wall synths, driven instead by a steady guitar rhythm and an oddly Asian folky-sounding flute melody." [...] In the verses, Spears sings about being in love with <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>boy</b> and outlaw, in lyrics such as [...] "He is a hustler / He's no good at all / He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum" [...] and [...] "He is <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> <b>boy</b> with a tainted heart / And even I know this ain't smart".
