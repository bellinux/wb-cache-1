40|$|The {{functioning}} of a solar still {{is governed by}} two combined phenomena: (i) a component in the mixture is brought up to evaporation by absorption of solar radiation; (ii) the respective vapor is condensed onto a colder surface from where pure liquid is collected and extracted to the outside.

30|$|The first {{approach}} {{solves the}} total energy balance {{and the flow}} equations of the outside cooling air. In this case, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis has been performed, producing detailed results for the flow field around the pillar, the temperature distribution and the cooling power. However, this approach is more complex and requires more computational resources than the others, {{but it can be}} considered as a rigorous model for the actual heat dissipation mechanism. The second approach assumes that heat flux from solid to air is not enough large to induce fluid density changes and consequently laminar convection cells initiation; in this frame, air is considered as a still medium where heat is dissipated only by conduction. The third approach describes the outside heat flux by means of a heat transfer coefficient function, that is automatically calculated by the software as function of surface <b>area,</b> <b>geometry</b> and orientation. This assumption is generally valid for macroscopic objects and has been numerically verified in this work for micrometric and sub-micrometric structures. The fourth approach is carried out with the aim to evaluate the relative influence of the radiative heat exchange, compared to the other mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|The design goal is {{to develop}} a 118 - 157 MHz, {{vertically}} polarized, low-profile (or conformal) antenna as a replacement for VHF AM blade antennas on aircraft. This design is to be arrived at by scaling the dimensions of an antenna designed for a center frequency of 1. 1 GHz. The design prior to scaling may have the following maximum dimensions: diameter less than 3. 70 in. and thickness less than 0. 50 in. Although a four-arm spiral design was originally suggested, a two-arm spiral may also be used, as both mode- 1 and mode- 2 (sum and difference) radiation patterns aren't required. While a four-arm spiral can easily be designed should both sum and difference patterns be required, the two-arm design will provide the required sum pattern and simplify the design problem somewhat: only one feed is required, and the feed <b>area</b> <b>geometry</b> is more straightforward. Polarization requirements dictate that a slot spiral be used, as opposed to a wire spiral. Two similar radiating structures were considered. The first is the standard archimedean spiral antenna.

40|$|International audienceIn epileptic {{patients}} {{candidate to}} surgery, {{the interpretation of}} EEG signals recorded either within (depth EEG) or at the surface (scalp EEG) of the head is a crucial issue to determine epileptogenic brain regions and to define subsequent surgical strategy. This task remains difficult {{as there is no}} simple relationship between the spatiotemporal features of neuronal generators (convoluted cortical dipole layers) and the electric field potentials recorded by the electrodes. Indeed, this relationship depends on the complex interaction of several factors regarding involved cortical sources: location, <b>area,</b> <b>geometry,</b> and synchronization of neuronal activity. A computational model is proposed to address this issue. It relies on a neurophysiologically relevant model of EEG signals, which combines an accurate description of both the intracerebral sources of activity and the transfer function between dipole layers and recorded field potentials. The model is used, on the one hand, to quantitatively study the influence of source-related parameters on the properties of simulated signals, and on the other hand, to jointly analyze depth EEG and scalp EEG signals. In this article, the authors review some of the results obtained from the model with respect to the literature on the interpretation of EEG signals in the context of epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to assess the {{mechanism}} of directional coronary atherectomy using different methods of analysis. Quantitative coronary angiography was used as the gold standard to assess the immediate results of atherectomy, and a comparative quantitative analysis of atherectomy and balloon angioplasty was made. To determine whether the post-atherectomy cross-sectional area is close to a circle, we compared the area measurements obtained by edge detection with those obtained by videodensitometry. Finally, the extent of a 'Dotter' effect was established by quantitative angiography following crossing the stenosis with the atherectomy device. For the purpose of this study, the results of the first 113 successful atherectomy procedures were reviewed. In matched lesions, directional atherectomy induced a greater increase in minimal luminal diameter than balloon angioplasty (1. 6 mm vs 0. 8 mm; P < 0. 0001). However, this luminal improvement is due to a substantial 'Dotter' effect induced by the bulky atherectomy device. Following atherectomy, only a slight difference in cross-sectional area measurements between edge detection and videodensitometry (mean difference: 0. 28 mm 2) was found. Histologic examination of an atherectomized coronary artery showed a near-circular postatherectomy <b>area</b> <b>geometry.</b> In conclusion, directional atherectomy is a very effective device with a substantially better initial result than balloon angioplasty. However, insertion of this bulky device itself causes an important 'Dotter' effect...|$|E
