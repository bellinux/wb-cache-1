5|$|I {{was playing}} the nice girl. It's really hard to play. All the other {{characters}} came from somebody <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Mike , 'Where do I come from?' And he said, 'You were the fantasy girl.' I {{found it hard to}} make anything of that. In the end I felt the only thing I could do was to make it as hyper real as I could. I'm not a natural comedienne.|$|E
25|$|I'm sick of Wilson... He {{hailed the}} Russian Revolution {{six months ago}} as the new Golden Age, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Page, 'What does he know of Russia?' to which Page replied, 'Nothing'. As for his talk about a union of hearts after the war, {{the world is not}} made like that.|$|E
500|$|I saw the Statue of Liberty. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> myself, [...] "Lady, you're such a beautiful! You opened {{your arms}} and {{you get all the}} foreigners here. Give me a chance to prove that I am worth it, to do something, to be someone in America." [...] And always that statue was on my mind.|$|E
6000|$|This first squad was {{followed}} by a veritable swarm of the painted murderers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nervously <b>to</b> Sergeant Corney, who was standing near me at the moment: ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the face}} of a man could be seen close <b>to</b> the ground, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> eagerly, <b>to</b> my companion, who, perforce, had his head turned in the {{opposite}} direction: ...|$|R
60|$|I FALL INTO THE HANDS OF PIRATES--HOW THEY TREATED ME, <b>AND</b> WHAT <b>I</b> <b>SAID</b> <b>TO</b> THEM--THE RESULT OF THE WHOLE ENDING IN A MELANCHOLY SEPARATION AND IN A MOST UNEXPECTED GIFT.|$|R
500|$|.....I {{thought about}} what I had been offered <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> myself, [...] "What am I being so damn grand about? I have two {{children}} to support, the part {{they want me to}} play has a lot of dignity, the show is already on the air, I wouldn't have to film a pilot, and they have a sponsor. This is really a great gift that has been offered me. I'd be stupid not to at least look into it." ...|$|E
500|$|About the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: [...] "It took such a {{long time}} to film the 'Mama' video, but it was nice that our mums were there and could see what we're doing. It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} day <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> my mum: 'Ha! Now you know how I feel every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E
500|$|... "You know, it's amazing {{cause in}} one point {{we were like}} in the arcade <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Beyoncé let's just do this. You wanna {{open the door and}} you're gonna perform and we're just gonna walk out and see what happens and she was like 'Yeah, let's go for it'. And {{literally}} we came out the door and it was like just hundreds of people sort of coming around us. People everywhere, cameras, people yelling her name. It was incredible, I have never experienced anything like that. It was really reportage, loose, not planned, we went with feeling, we went with instinct... It's a beautiful cycle of energy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Moore's biographical book <b>I</b> admired; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> so <b>to</b> {{my little}} [...] world, in two {{somewhat}} lengthy articles, which many approved, <b>and</b> [...] some, <b>I</b> {{am sorry to}} know, condemned.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'll be as damn colloquial as I want to. How do you {{get that}} 'thanks to you'? Here {{about a year ago}} you jump me for not remembering to give you money. Well, I'm reasonable. I didn't blame you, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>SAID</b> <b>I</b> was <b>to</b> blame. But have I ever {{forgotten}} it since--practically?" ...|$|R
500|$|Following George W. Bush's {{reelection in}} 2004, she urged {{her husband to}} run again for President, later saying: [...] "I {{literally}} wore black for a week. I just {{could not believe that}} he won, because I felt that things were already so bad. I was so against the [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Joe, 'You've got to change this, you have to change this.'" [...] During Joe Biden's 2008 campaign to be the Democratic nominee, she continued to teach during the week and would join him for campaigning on weekends. She said that she would have taken an activist role in addressing education as her chief focus of concern as a potential First Lady. She also said that she was basically apolitical and would not seek inclusion in Cabinet meetings.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Anggun began a {{relationship}} with Michel de Gea, a French engineer, whom she had met the year before in Kalimantan while touring. The couple married, despite a rumoured objection by Anggun's family, reportedly because they felt Anggun was too young [...] Georgea later became Anggun's manager. The following year, Anggun became the youngest Indonesian singer to found her own record company, Bali Cipta Records, and took complete creative control over her work. She produced her final Indonesian studio album, Anggun C. Sasmi... Lah!!! (1993), which yielded number-one single [...] "Kembalilah Kasih (Kita Harus Bicara)". By age nineteen, Anggun had sold over four million albums in Indonesia. She began to feel dissatisfied with her success in her country and began considering an international music career. Anggun later recalled: [...] " [...] I was 20, I'd made five albums. I'd built my own record company. I'd produced my last album and produced some Indonesian acts as well. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> myself: 'I'm tired! I cannot achieve more than I already have. There's no challenge anymore'." ...|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'" [...] The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse.|$|E
60|$|Jim Freeman and {{his friends}} seemed {{to be of the}} same mind as Jerry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>to</b> them lest I be accused of faint-heartedness, when {{everything}} was apparently going our way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where are you going?" [...] asked he, as I edged off sideways. I {{had already}} noticed that Mr. Hunsden indulged in abrupt forms of speech, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> perversely <b>said</b> <b>to</b> myself-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well! I {{am going}} to tell you," [...] replied Caddy, {{crossing}} her hands confidentially upon my arm. [...] "So we talked {{a good deal about}} it, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Prince, 'Prince, as Miss Summerson--'" ...|$|R
500|$|Producer Kevin Shirley {{was brought}} in {{on the advice of}} Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. [...] As Rich explained, [...] "We really wanted to work with someone who can come in and say, 'That's not good.'... If Kevin says {{something}} I disagree with, he'll {{be the first one to}} say, 'Hey, it's your song,' but it's healthy for me and Chris to have him come in and be as excited about our songs as we are and say, 'Okay, that's cool, but what if we tried this?'" [...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E
500|$|While {{his group}} escapes from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Jenner whispers to Rick about {{the virus that}} has caused the zombie apocalypse. Initially there was no {{indication}} as to what Jenner said to him; the dialogue was previously inserted into the episode's script but was later removed. [...] "I'm so pleased they didn't reveal it," [...] said Andrew Lincoln, [...] "because it was scripted, and extremely powerful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> everyone, 'Burn this page: No one should know apart from Rick and Frank.' It's brilliant that they left it —it's perfect, it's so classy." [...] Kirkman was content with the idea of teasing Jenner's revelation in lieu of blatantly revealing anything about the origins of the virus. [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} addition. I'm very much opposed to showing what the actual cause [...] is and explaining how things work, but teasing a little bit is a great thing. If it adds an extra layer to the drama, then I'm all for it," [...] he stated. [...] "It also led up to the fantastic mystery of the whisper Jenner gives to Rick at the end of that scene. That's going to play into Season 2 quite a bit. I know where that's going and it's really a cool bit." [...] It is not until the second season finale, [...] "Beside the Dying Fire", that Rick reveals Jenner's message to the group.|$|E
500|$|... "You do {{appreciate}} {{the absurdity of}} a group of rabbis in Israel claiming that I'm being blasphemous about someone when they haven't heard the record, right? And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's a little weird. But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So I called it [...] "Isaac" [...] It's interesting how their minds work, those naughty rabbis. [...] He's saying, [...] "If all of the doors of all of the generous peoples' homes are closed to you, the gates of heaven will always be open." [...] The words are about 1,000 years old. [...] is an old friend of mine. He's never made a record. He comes from generations of beautiful singers. Stuart and I asked him to come into the studio one day. We said, [...] "We're just going to record you. We don't know what we're going to do with it." [...] He's flawless. One take, no bad notes. He doesn't even need a microphone. We took one of the songs he did <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Stuart, [...] "Let's sample these bits. We'll create a chorus and then I'll write lyrics around it." [...] That's how we constructed it." ...|$|E

60|$|Those were awkward questions. He had {{certainly}} left both our letters unanswered--thus far. Still, the next post might bring his reply. I persisted in taking this view; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> so <b>to</b> Oscar. He persisted just as obstinately on his side.|$|R

2500|$|Clapton also {{singled out}} Buddy Holly as an influence. The Chirping Crickets {{was the first}} album Clapton ever bought; he later saw Holly on Sunday Night at the London Palladium. In his autobiography, Clapton recounted {{the first time he}} saw Holly and his Fender, saying, [...] "I thought I'd died and gone to heaven...it was like seeing an {{instrument}} from outer space <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> myself: 'That's the future – that's what I want'".|$|E
2500|$|... (Mary) said, [...] "I saw the Lord in {{a vision}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> him, ‘Lord, I saw you {{today in a}} vision.’" [...] He {{answered}} and said to me: “Blessed are you, {{that you did not}} waver at the sight of me.

6000|$|... "No, ma'am; {{but they}} be gone {{to take the}} places of them who may, which is very close connected. <b>And</b> so <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> myself, Fanny's young man {{was one of the}} regiment, and she's gone after him. There, ma'am, that's it in black and white." ...|$|R
60|$|What harm had I done Mr. Marx, and {{why should}} he seek to injure me? It seemed improbable, almost ridiculous. So in the end {{a certain sense of}} {{fairness}} induced me to respect his postscript, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>to</b> Mr. Ravenor about his secretary's warning.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was telling}} him," [...] {{answered}} Perrine, simply, [...] "that {{it was time}} to change the bandages on his arm; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> also <b>said</b> <b>to</b> him, what <b>I</b> have often <b>said</b> before, that he must never play at that terrible game of the Soule again." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ed Rollins, however, {{stated in}} the 2008 {{documentary}} , that [...] " [...] was telling this story about how a Living Bible was what was giving him faith <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Mary , 'I really, sincerely hope that he found peace.' She said, 'Ed, when we were cleaning up his things afterwards, the Bible was still wrapped in the cellophane and had never {{been taken out of}} the package', which just told you everything there was. He was spinning right to the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "He told me he'd kill me, yeah. I didn't {{think he}} was {{completely}} serious, but I didn't {{think he was}} entirely joking either. Look, he could be pretty scary. He did threaten to kill me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> him: 'Well, you'd better {{make sure that your}} assassin gets me first because, if he misses, you better know I won't miss you.' He could be a complete pig, you know. He could charm the birds out of the trees, but he could be a brute." ...|$|E
2500|$|A puppet {{version of}} Garofalo {{appeared}} (and was graphically killed off) in the 2004 movie while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, {{she was more}} upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. [...] "I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America bothered me, the fact they didn't send me my puppet, that bothered me even more." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{perspiration}} {{came out}} upon my forehead in great drops, caused, {{not by the}} heat, but by the mental anguish, and again <b>and</b> again <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> myself that Jacob had labored for naught, since {{it would be impossible}} I could crawl undetected even over the short distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mind ye," [...] said Tammas, a drop {{of water}} hanging to the point of his nose, [...] "I {{disclaim}} all responsibility in the business.

6000|$|... "Scribe Ana, I {{ask your}} pardon if, being vexed <b>and</b> wearied, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> you <b>and</b> of you to-day what I now wish I had left unsaid.
