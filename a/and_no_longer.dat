5|$|First {{the hopeful}} note: There are faint signs the {{tinkering}} with Temperatures format {{could make the}} series funny later on, {{but only if the}} writing improves. The show now leaves most of the mugging to Lynde <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is vastly improved and the new approach portends to better things ahead.|$|E

In modern times there is a history of conflict between San José (the former Itza town of Chakok'ot) and neighbouring San Andrés (the former Kowoj-allied town of Chak'an), and this mutual hostility probably represents ancient hostility between the Itza and the Kowoj.|$|E

5|$|Three years elapsed between series VI and VII, {{partly due}} to the {{dissolving}} of the Grant and Naylor partnership, but also due to cast and crew working on other projects.

5|$|Ai {{initially}} {{refuses to}} see a connection between his sexuality and his mode of consciousness, preventing him from truly understanding the Gethenians; thus {{he is unable to}} persuade them of the importance of his mission. Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of the advice that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able to converse directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> requires direct communication.|$|E
5|$|But {{apart from}} the {{clerical}} business, Las Casas had also traveled to Spain for his own purpose: to continue the struggle against the colonists' mistreatment of the Indians. The encomienda had, in fact, legally been abolished in 1523, {{but it had been}} reinstituted in 1526, and in 1530 a general ordinance against slavery was reversed by the Crown. For this reason it was a pressing matter for Bartolomé de las Casas to plead once again for the Indians with Charles V who was by now Holy Roman Emperor <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a boy. He wrote a letter asking for permission to stay in Spain a little longer in order to argue for the Emperor that conversion and colonization were best achieved by peaceful means.|$|E
