Throughout his career, Schmid has received praise from critics for his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> new talent. His defensive tactics are also highly regarded in the press and often cited as a factor in his success. However, their deployment in his final two seasons with Los Angeles led directly to the termination of his contract.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. The <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development {{and the ability to}} take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E

When Scully is kidnapped by the Bounty Hunter, Mulder is forced to trade Samantha for her. During a botched attempt to kill the Bounty Hunter, Samantha is killed. However, it is discovered that this was simply one of many alien clones of Samantha. With the help of X, Mulder pursues the Bounty Hunter to a submarine in the Arctic. Mulder is nearly killed when exposed to the Bounty Hunter's toxic blood, but is saved by Scully.|$|E
5|$|Georges, an only child, showed early {{aptitude}} {{for music and}} quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons. By listening {{at the door of}} the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> and analyse complex chordal structures. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by Joseph Meifred, the horn virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.|$|E

At BSC, {{we have begun}} to examine the benefits of requiring community-based pre-clinical student observations and whether the costs of this requirement outweigh the benefits. This study, a prospective, nonrandomized survey using a Likert-type rating scale, examined how students rated their observational skill during community-based versus classroom-based observations of videotaped sessions. Research Questions: 1. How do students rate their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> critical elements of a speech-language pathology treatment session during instructor-guided classroom observations? 2. How do students rate their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> critical elements of a speech-language pathology treatment session during community-based observations? Results Mean agreements with the item statements ranged from 3. 8 to 4. 6, with a mean agreement of 4. 32. Highest mean agreements occurred for statements regarding students’ perceived skills identifying task expectations (4. 61), off-task client behaviors (4. 6), and transitions between tasks (4. 54). Lowest mean agreements were for statements related <b>to</b> <b>identifying</b> the language domain targeted in the session (3. 79), and the clinicians’ {{method of data collection}} (3. 97). Implications of survey results will be considered as a basis for creation of an evidence base to support policy and procedure decisions regarding our undergraduate pre-clinical observation program...|$|R

Using fMRI EI was measured in correlation with left insular activity. The subjects were shown various pictures of facial expressions and tasked with deciding to approach or avoid {{the person in the}} picture. The results of the social decision task yielded that individuals with high EI scores had left insular activation when processing fearful faces. Individuals with low EI scores had left insular activation when processing angry faces.|$|E

50|$|Forked tongues {{have evolved}} in these Squamate {{reptiles}} (lizards and snakes) for various purposes. The advantage {{to having a}} forked tongue is that more surface area is available for the chemicals to contact {{and the potential for}} tropotaxis. The tongue is flicked out of the mouth regularly to sample the chemical environment. This form of chemical sampling allows these animals to sense non-volatile chemicals, which cannot be detected by simply using the olfactory system. This increased <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> sense chemicals has allowed for heightened <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> prey, recognize kin, choose mates, locate shelters, follow trails, and more.|$|R

In addition, witnesses’ <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> provide descriptive information about a target from various distances was examined. In line with prior findings, lineup identification accuracy decreased as distance increased. Furthermore, witnesses who viewed the target from further distances reported fewer accurate details about the individual. Surprisingly, distance had a small effect on the amount of inaccurate information witnesses reported. Witnesses’ performances on other diagnostic measures (e. g., willingness to testify and confidence) are also discussed. Department of Psychological ScienceThesis (M. A. ...|$|R
