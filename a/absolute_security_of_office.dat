50|$|The Köprülü rise {{to power}} was precipitated by a {{political}} crisis resulting from the government's financial struggles combined with a pressing need to break the Venetian blockade of the Dardanelles in the ongoing Cretan War. Thus, in September 1656 Valide Sultan Turhan Hatice selected Köprülü Mehmed Pasha as grand vizier, as well as guaranteeing him <b>absolute</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>office.</b> She hoped that a political alliance {{between the two of}} them could restore the fortunes of the Ottoman state. Köprülü was ultimately successful; his reforms enabled the empire to break the Venetian blockade and to restore authority to the rebellious Transylvania. However, these gains came at a heavy cost in life, as the grand vizier carried out multiple massacres of soldiers and officers he perceived to be disloyal. Regarded as unjust by many, these purges triggered a major revolt in 1658, led by Abaza Hasan Pasha. Following the suppression of this rebellion, the Köprülü family remained unchallenged politically until their failure to conquer Vienna in 1683. Köprülü Mehmed himself died in 1661, when he was succeeded in office by his son Fazıl Ahmed Pasha.|$|E

The security and the reliability are vital for safety control system. Inspired by the principle of quantum entanglement, we put forward a theoretical quantum safety control protocol which is based on two-step command transmission. In the two-step protocol, a quantum switch and a classical switch are fixed in the safety control process. Quantum switch and the classical switch are in charge of the transmission of cryptogram command and the transmission of execution command respective. Quantum principle guarantees the <b>absolute</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> this protocol. Besides, this is the first quantum safety control system...|$|R

40|$|Encryption {{is the art}} of {{preserving}} confidentiality of digital information. It is considered {{to be one of the}} most ideal solutions for providing data confidentiality and safety of computer hard disk. Many disk encryption software are commercially available with a variety of features. But how much effective security is provided by those software is the ultimate question. Encryption algorithms used by those software are vulnerable to known cryptanalysis. Design and implementation weaknesses critically leave backdoors inside those software themselves. Easy and smart methods are used to defeat the software’s security either by manipulating external hardware or by exploiting user unawareness. This thesis evaluates the potential vulnerabilities of commercial hard disk encryption software that are claimed to provide <b>absolute</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> hard disk content...|$|R

30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of modern wireless communication technology and network, especially the global 4 G, {{and even the}} 5 G mobile network development, communication security is an important problem to be solved urgently. Because of the openness of the wireless communication media, the transmission of information is easily stolen, tampered, or attacked. In order to solve this problem, a new solution is proposed, which is the physical layer security technology. The physical layer security technology is not dependent on the encryption and encapsulation of data, but it has the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> information transmission [1, 2], which has the advantage that the encryption processing of the upper layer of the protocol stack can not be compared. In recent years, the physical layer security technology has become a hot topic in the field <b>of</b> information <b>security.</b>|$|R
