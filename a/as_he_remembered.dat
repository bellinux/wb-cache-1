25|$|A {{decade after}} the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, {{contacted}} him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project, and eventually the two settled on a sequel to The Way We Were. In it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed {{they did not want}} Pollack {{to be part of the}} equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script but, aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never heard from him again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written, and decided she wanted to produce and direct it as well as co-star with Redford, but did not want to work with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as good <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> it being, and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he was interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring Kathie Lee Gifford. Laurents declined, and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo ever since.|$|E

In 1965, he contributed [...] "I Need You" [...] and [...] "You Like Me Too Much" [...] to the album Help! ...|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Wearing {{was able}} to persuade the then-controller of BBC Two, Alan Yentob, to {{commission}} Peter Flannery to write scripts for {{a new version of}} the project. However, Yentob had no great enthusiasm for Our Friends in the North, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> a meeting with Flannery in 1988, when the writer had left him unimpressed by stating that Our Friends in the North was about [...] "post-war social housing policy." [...] As Wearing was now a head of department at the BBC he was too busy overseeing other projects to produce Our Friends in the North personally. George Faber was briefly attached to the project as producer before he moved on to become Head of Single Drama at the BBC. Faber was succeeded by a young producer with great enthusiasm for the project, Charles Pattinson.|$|E

500|$|Southdale Center was {{developed}} by the Dayton Company and designed by Victor Gruen, an Austrian immigrant and socialist. Gruen was a European-style socialist; he found individual stores in downtown venues to be inefficient, and the suburban lifestyle of 1950s America too [...] "car-centric" [...] and wanted to design a building that would be a communal gathering place, where people would shop, drink coffee, and socialize, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> from his native Vienna. Southdale Center was loosely modeled on the arcades of several heavily populated European cities and purposely included [...] "eye-level display cases" [...] to [...] "lure customers into stores". Gruen imaged that Southdale would eventually include [...] "a medical center, schools and residences, not just a parade of glitzy stores." [...] The first plans unveiled for the shopping center were announced in 1952 by Gruen and Minnesota native, Donald Dayton.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{described}} the episode as [...] "a nasty episode that doesn't quite cohere into the level of nasty it could", but that the series [...] "doesn't do horror/action all that often, and it serves as a good change of pace if nothing else". He gave [...] "Conspiracy" [...] a score of four out of ten. Zack Handlen, who reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, thought that while [...] "Conspiracy" [...] was a [...] "hard episode to forget", it was not quite as good <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> and did not quite [...] "fit" [...] with the rest of the season. He thought that certain parts of the plot were [...] "idiotic", and the Admirals reminded him of a [...] "Bond villain convention". He gave the episode an overall grade of B, writing, [...] "fingers crossed that next time we encounter a danger this sinister, the writers know how to handle it".|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, the Al Green-styled [...] "Thinking of You", was {{one that}} the group {{conceived}} and recorded together at 3 a.m. in Saadiq's Pookie Labs studio. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> it, [...] "I was just playing around and started singing {{off the top of}} my head. I never wrote anything down, it was just what came out." [...] "Annie May", one of Wiggins' songs for House of Music, had Saadiq's backing vocals pre-recorded and then overdubbed to the track's final mix. One of Saadiq's songs for the album, [...] "Me and the Blind Man", was excluded from the final mix because, as Saadiq told Yahoo! Music, [...] "they didn't want anybody playing favorites, so one of my songs had to come off." [...] The recording was a moody blues piece with surrealistic lyrics about lust, longing, and a fictitious blind man's secret powers. Saadiq wanted to show [...] "a darker side... some depth" [...] to listeners with the song. [...] "To me songs like 'Blind Man,' make the whole sound, the House of Music", he remarked. It was featured on an album sampler sent by the group's label to music journalists.|$|E

Wolves gobbled sheep and geese, so they hunted and trapped wolves. They also held organized raids on rattlesnakes on the mountainside. There was plenty of game. Many a time have I seen a deer jump the fence into my back yard, and there were millions of pigeons which we clubbed as they flew low." ...|$|E

[...] Returning to Europe in 1914, Biddle spent time in Munich and Madrid, {{studying}} printmaking in the Spanish capital, before trying his hand at impressionism in France. [...] <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered,</b> “I gobbled up museums, French Impressionism, cubism, futurism, and the old masters; I copied Velasquez in Madrid and Rubens in Munich….” [...] In 1917, with the United States' entry into the First World War, Biddle enlisted in the army.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1788 and 1793, the townships at the Head-of-the-Lake were {{surveyed}} and named. The area was first known as The Head-of-the-Lake for its location {{at the western}} end of Lake Ontario. John Ryckman, born in Barton township (where present day downtown Hamilton is), described the area in 1803 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered</b> it: [...] "The city in 1803 was all forest. The shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick, almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth...Bears ate pigs, so settlers warred on bears.

2500|$|Leaving Company A {{behind to}} secure the MACV Compound, the Marine {{battalion}} commander took Company G, reinforced by the three M-48 tanks from the 3rd Tank Battalion and a few ARVN light M-24 tanks from the 7th Armored Squadron, and attempted to cross the Trường Tiền Bridge, the main bridge over the Perfume River. Gravel left the armor behind on the southern bank to provide direct fire support. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>remembered,</b> the American M-48s were too heavy for the bridge and the ARVN tankers [...] "refused to go." [...] As the Marine infantry started across, an enemy machine gun {{on the other end}} of the bridge opened up, killing and wounding several Marines. One Marine, Lance Corporal Lester A. Tully, later awarded the Silver Star for his action, ran forward, threw a grenade, and silenced the gun. Two platoons successfully made their way to the other side. They turned left and immediately came under automatic weapons and recoilless rifle fire from the Citadel wall. The Marines decided to withdraw. This was easier said than done. The enemy was well dug-in and firing from virtually every building in Huế city north of the river. The number of wounded was rising, the Marines commandeered some abandoned Vietnamese civilian vehicles and used them as makeshift ambulances to carry out the wounded. Among the casualties on the bridge was Major Walter M. Murphy, the 1st Battalion S-3 or operations officer, who later died of his wounds.|$|E
