5|$|During the Reformation, Martin Luther {{rejected}} {{many of the}} Catholic Church's seven sacraments, but retained baptism and the Lord's Supper. He {{saw many}} practices of the medieval church as <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone. Luther attached the promise of salvation to baptism, and taught that life after baptism should be spent in recollection {{of it and the}} dying to sin it signified.|$|E

40|$|<b>Abuse</b> <b>of</b> Public Law in Judicial Decisions This thesis {{discusses}} the relevance {{and meaning of}} the principle of "abuse of law" in Czech public law, and consists of six chapters. A brief opening chapter sets out the aim of the thesis, namely to provide a theoretical analysis of the concept <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> law, using conclusions that are established in Czech jurisprudence. The second chapter deals with the substantial rulings of the Czech Supreme Court viewing the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> law concept in terms of civil law, because the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> law principle came to light firstly in Czech civil law. The prospective enactment <b>of</b> the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> law principle in the Czech Civil Code Bill is also mentioned. The third chapter is crucial to this thesis, and reflects the approach of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court (the SAC) to the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> law. The first Czech ruling in which the concept <b>of</b> the <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> tax law occurred was Divers, no. 1 Afs 107 / 2004 - 48.

Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989.

5|$|By 1790, on the {{political}} front, the Commonwealth had deteriorated into such a helpless condition that it was forced into an unnatural and ultimately deadly alliance with its enemy, Prussia. The Polish-Prussian Pact of 1790 was signed, giving false hope that the Commonwealth might have at last found an ally that would shield it while it reformed itself. The May Constitution of 1791 enfranchised the bourgeoisie, established {{the separation of the}} three branches of government, and eliminated the <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> Repnin Sejm. Those reforms prompted aggressive actions on the part of its neighbours, wary of the potential renaissance of the Commonwealth. Again Poland dared to reform and improve itself without Russia's permission, and again the Empress Catherine II was angered; arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France. Russian forces invaded the Commonwealth in 1792.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{childhood}} marked by ostracism from his family, {{as a young}} man Rainilaiarivony was elevated to a position of high authority and confidence in the royal court, serving alongside his father and brother. He co-led a critical military expedition with Rainivoninahitriniony at the age of 24 and was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the army following the death of the queen in 1861. In that position he oversaw continuing efforts to maintain royal authority in the outlying regions of Madagascar and acted as adviser to his brother, who had been promoted to Prime Minister in 1852. He also influenced the transformation of the kingdom's government from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one, in which power was shared between the sovereign and the Prime Minister. Rainilaiarivony and Queen Rasoherina worked together to depose Rainivoninahitriniony for his <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> office in 1864. Taking his brother's place as Prime Minister, Rainilaiarivony remained in power as Madagascar's longest-serving prime minister for the next 31years by marrying three queens in succession: Rasoherina, RanavalonaII and RanavalonaIII.|$|E

5|$|In 1204, John lost Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou to Philip II of France, leaving English {{power on}} the {{continent}} limited to Gascony and Poitou. John raised {{taxes to pay for}} military campaigns to regain his lands, but unrest grew among many of the English barons; John sought new allies by declaring England a Papal fiefdom, owing allegiance to the Pope. In 1215, John and the rebel barons negotiated a potential peace treaty, the Magna Carta. The treaty would have limited potential <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> royal power, demobilised the rebel armies and set up a power-sharing arrangement, but in practice neither side complied with its conditions. John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the Magna Carta and the First Barons' War erupted, with the rebel barons aided by Philip's son, the future Louis VIII, who claimed the English throne for himself. The war soon settled into a stalemate, with neither side able to claim victory. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry as his heir.|$|E
5|$|In the Junta, Alberti {{was aligned}} {{with most of}} the reformist {{proposals}} of Mariano Moreno, as well as Juan Larrea and Juan José Castelli. He signed most of the rulings that shaped the new political system, such as those related to popular sovereignty, representative and republican principles, separation of powers, publicity of the government actions, freedom of speech and the bases of political federalism. However, he did not support the actions of the Junta that contradicted his religious formation, regardless of the context. He refused to sign the death penalty for Santiago de Liniers, captured after the defeat of his counter-revolution. He signed the harsh commands given to Castelli for the first Upper Peru campaign, but noticing next to his signature that he made an exception with the articles involving capital punishment. He was also concerned by the role of the church in the new political system and headed a dispute against the Cabildo about it. He considered that the Cabildo should not have any authority over the Junta in ecclesiastic topics, to prevent the former <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> the absolutist governments.|$|E

40|$|The Chinese Anti-monopoly Law (AML) {{entered into}} force on August 1, 2008 and <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> {{administrative}} power to eliminate or restrict competition is prohibited and dealt in Chapter Five <b>of</b> this law. <b>Abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power {{is one of}} the most significant ways to eliminate or restrict competition in China. Great concerns had been focused on the rules <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power before the AML was promulgated. However, its progress in practice is slow and experiences difficulties after this law took effect. Little research has been undertaken outside <b>of</b> China on <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition due to the specific background and situation pertaining in China. Concerning to <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power, the AML have close relationships with EU competition law and free movement rules. This thesis aims to provide a critical comparison between the AML, Article 106 TFEU of EU competition law and free movement rules, and draws on the EU’s experience as a source of criticism and guidance in relation to the application <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition in the AML. This study first provides a background introduction on the development of the AML and <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition and analyses the complicated causes <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power in competition through three areas: the history of China’s economic system, economic theory and legislation. The main comparative and critical research are held in Chapters Four and Five which examine the relationships between <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power in the AML, Article 106 TFEU and EU free movement rules respectively. In Chapter Six a case study is taken in telecommunications sector. The application <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power provisions of the AML in telecommunications sector is examined through three areas: market access, interconnection and universal services. This thesis concludes by noting that (1) <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power to eliminate or restrict competition provisions in the AML should be revised on the content of these provisions and their exemption rules; (2) a dual-structure <b>of</b> controlling <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power based on monopolistic conduct and free circulation is held in the AML; (3) the inapplicability <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power provisions in these telecommunications issues requires a revise for <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> administrative power in the AML. ...|$|R

5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{parliamentary}} reform plummeted {{after the}} launch of the French Revolution in 1789. Many English politicians became steadfastly opposed to any major political change. Despite this reaction, several Radical Movement groups were established to agitate for reform. A group of Whigs led by James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale and Charles Grey founded an organisation advocating parliamentary reform in 1792. This group, known as the Society of the Friends of the People, included 28 MPs. In 1793, Grey presented to the House of Commons a petition from the Friends of the People, outlining <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> the system and demanding change. He did not propose any specific scheme of reform, but merely a motion that the House inquire into possible improvements. Parliament's reaction to the French Revolution was so negative, that even this request for an inquiry was rejected by a margin of almost 200 votes. Grey tried to raise the subject again in 1797, but the House again rebuffed him by a majority of over 150.|$|E

Harlan countered by faulting the state's Democratic politicians for continuing to dwell on war issues almost a decade after the war's end. He also attacked what he perceived as Democratic financial extravagance and the high number of pardons granted by sitting Democratic governor Preston Leslie. Harlan claimed these as evidence of widespread corruption in the Democratic Party. McCreary received solid support from the state's newspapers, nearly all of which had Democratic sympathies.

Drawing on qualitative research with carers/carees from South Asian and African-Caribbean backgrounds, this paper explores a different conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> which moves away from an interpersonal understanding, to one that recognizes structural inequalities as a form <b>of</b> ‘institutional’ <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> carers and those who receive care. This reconceptualization <b>of</b> <b>abuse</b> gives particular attention to forms of racism and discrimination {{in the provision of}} services to minoritized carers/cared-for people.

5|$|The Sejm's great {{achievement}} was {{the adoption of}} the Constitution of May 3, 1791, often described as Europe's first modern written national constitution, and the world's second, after the United States Constitution. The Polish Constitution was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the federative Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and its system of Golden Liberties. The Constitution introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> serfdom. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the liberum veto, which at one time had placed a sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be bribed by an interest or foreign power, to undo all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm. The May 3rd Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's reactionary magnates, with a more egalitarian and democratic constitutional monarchy.|$|E
