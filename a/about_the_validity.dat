5|$|In March 1848, Garrison, the Motts, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster {{and others}} hosted an Anti-Sabbath meeting in Boston, {{to work toward}} the {{elimination}} of laws that apply only to Sunday, and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil than just one day of rest per week. Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee, and Mott spoke to the assemblage. Lucretia Mott raised questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of blindly following religious and social tradition.|$|E

Sue made a similar argument, saying that the sections allowing disputes by petition and the sections allowing disputes by the relevant house of Parliament were not mutually exclusive and that elections could be disputed by either the Parliament or the people.|$|E
5|$|Townsend was arraigned on 20 August, but {{strongly}} {{questioned the}} view that his writings were subversive {{as well as the}} legal foundations of the charges. Along with the other defendants, Townsend was as before strongly defended by senators with anti-interventionist sympathies, including Gerald Nye who said the defendants were no more guilty of sedition than he had been for speaking out against intervening in the war. In fact there were from the beginning many concerns even within the US government <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of the proceedings and their constitutionality as no clear evidence had yet been uncovered to demonstrate that the defendants were in collusion with Nazi Germany or with each other.|$|E

5|$|While {{supporting}} change, Trường Chinh in his Political Report talked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of the party's organizational principles, {{which had}} governed Vietnam's economy. Democratic centralism was to remain unchanged, and centralized management of certain sectors {{were to be}} retained. In a closed session, the Presidium of the 6th National Congress on 18 December acknowledged {{the importance of the}} continued transformation of private industry and commerce and the validity of economic contracts between production and business units. He endorsed the state's role as a supplier of goods produced by state-owned enterprises and supported the long-time policy of labour distribution. These policies were passed, and underwrote the economic policies initiated at the 4th and 5th National Congresses. The party leadership's immediate goals set forth in the Political Report were: To restructure the production system; readjust the investment outlay within the system; continue the building and strengthening of the socialist relations of production; to utilize and develop the economic sectors in the correct way; to renovate the way economy was managed; to emphasize the role of science and technology in the economy; and to expand and to increase the effectiveness of Vietnam's foreign economic relations.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, the {{plaintiff}} {{in the first}} action in 1934 was Olive Ida Burke, who brought the suit {{on behalf of a}} property owners' association to enforce racial restrictions. Her husband, James Burke, later sold a house to Carl Hansberry (Lorraine's father) when he changed his mind <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of the covenant. Mr. Burke's decision may have been motivated by the changing demographics of the neighborhood, but it was also influenced by the Depression. The demand for houses was so low among white buyers that Mr. Hansberry may have been the only prospective purchaser available.|$|E
25|$|For instance, de Haan (1999, 2001, 2005) {{states that}} evidentiality asserts {{evidence}} while epistemic modality evaluates evidence and that evidentiality is {{more akin to}} a deictic category marking the relationship between speakers and events/actions (like the way demonstratives mark the relationship between speakers and objects, see also Joseph 2003). Aikhenvald (2003) finds that evidentials may indicate a speaker's attitude <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of a statement {{but this is not}} a required feature of evidentials. Additionally, she finds that evidential-marking may co-occur with epistemic-marking, but it may also co-occur with aspectual/tense or mirative marking.|$|E

25|$|In 1838, {{under the}} Municipal Corporations Act 1835, the townships of Great Bolton and Little Bolton, {{along with the}} Haulgh area from Tonge with Haulgh township, were {{incorporated}} as a municipal borough, making it the second to be created in England (after Devonport). However, there was doubt <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of the charter, with the local Conservatives refusing to stand for the first council elections, and the magistrates of Salford Hundred disputing {{the jurisdiction of the}} new corporation. The first elections to the town council were uncontested, with Whigs and Radicals holding all seats. The council was highly supportive of The People's Charter.|$|E
25|$|Sourav Ganguly (51) {{given out}} by Mark Benson – While the TV {{evidence}} was inconclusive {{as to the}} correctness of the decision, {{the manner in which}} it was delivered has generated controversy. Sourav Ganguly edged the ball to Michael Clarke at slip who was engulfed by his team-mates in celebration of an apparent catch. Umpire Benson appeared unsure as to whether it carried and instead of referring to third umpire asked captain Ricky Ponting for clarification. There was a prior agreement between the teams that the fielders would be honest about whether the catch had carried. Ponting, having already consulted Clarke <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of the catch, raised his finger, telling the umpire that he thought the catch was cleanly taken.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{observations}} of the specific heat capacities of gases also raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of the equipartition theorem. The theorem predicts that the molar heat capacity of simple monatomic gases should be roughly 3cal/(mol·K), whereas that of diatomic gases should be roughly 7cal/(mol·K). Experiments confirmed the former prediction, but found that molar heat capacities of diatomic gases were typically about 5cal/(mol·K), and fell to about 3cal/(mol·K) at very low temperatures. Maxwell noted in 1875 that the disagreement between experiment and the equipartition theorem was much worse than even these numbers suggest; since atoms have internal parts, heat energy should go into the motion of these internal parts, making the predicted specific heats of monatomic and diatomic gases much higher than 3cal/(mol·K) and 7cal/(mol·K), respectively.|$|E

40|$|How {{much should}} we trust our first {{impressions}} of other people?

Thin slices researchers argue that performance can be accurately predicted using the conclusions untrained judges reach {{after a few}} moments of observation, whereas interview validity researchers argue that interviewers cannot reliably predict a job applicant 2 ̆ 7 s future performance after a single one-on-one interaction. Drawing from research on perception, cognition, and multilevel aggregation, I hypothesize that previous investigations may have reached different conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> of first impressions because of differences in the dyadic observation process and the levels of analysis that researchers have used in their investigations. ^ Data from three laboratory studies provide mixed support for my hypotheses. The results of these studies suggest that <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> of observers 2 ̆ 7 evaluations increases when observers 2 ̆ 7 evaluations are aggregated. The presence of idiosyncratic biases appears to make individual observers much less reliable predictors of performance than the aggregated evaluations of multiple observers.

Biographical information has the potential to either increase or decrease <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> of performance evaluations, but {{does not appear to have}} a consistent effect on predictive validity of these evaluations. ...|$|R
