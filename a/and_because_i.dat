5|$|After I {{released}} my solo record I {{felt really}} disappointed, I {{believed in the}} record I made but if you don't have the back-up of your record company investing and marketing it. It's a really tough job <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wrote the whole thing I really believed in this record, as did Nellee Hooper, I was jaded and disappointed.|$|E
25|$|Because that {{protest and}} my {{communications}} to the United States Government immediately thereafter expressly declare that I yielded my {{authority to the}} forces of the United States in order to avoid bloodshed, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> recognized the futility of a conflict with so formidable a power.|$|E
25|$|Of those 25 years, I {{spent nine}} as {{prisoner}} of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I {{was able to}} withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to live—no matter how painful that became—because I love my country and never lost faith in her, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had dreams of what {{my life would be}} like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.|$|E

500|$|With word of {{the episode}} out, {{backlash}} began. The studio received at least one bomb threat and Driscoll received a telephone call informing him {{he was going to}} Hell. DeGeneres was followed by car to the studio on at least one occasion by a [...] "suspicious man". Some within the entertainment industry assumed that the coming out was simply a ratings stunt, to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I did it selfishly for myself <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{thought it was a great}} thing for the show, which desperately needed a point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} partly autobiographical. Like her narrator, Müller {{comes from the}} German-speaking {{minority}} in Romania, the Banat Swabians, with a father who had been former SS man during World War II. Trained as a teacher, she lost her position after refusing {{to cooperate with the}} Securitate. She emigrated to Germany in 1987. In a 1998 interview she mentioned that real persons can be recognized in some of her characters, including one in The Land of Green Plums: [...] "That [...] was already the case in my previous book [...] Because my best girlfriend died young, and because she had betrayed me, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had to despise her and could not stop loving her." ...|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{turned down}} a video {{treatment}} for lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] proposed by Spike Jonze, who had previously helped raise the band's status with his videos for [...] "Undone – The Sweater Song" [...] and [...] "Buddy Holly". Cuomo explained: [...] "I really don't want the songs to come across untainted this time around... I really want to communicate my feelings directly <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was so careful in writing that way. I'd hate for the video to kinda misrepresent the song, or exaggerate certain aspects." [...] The final video featured the band playing in an assembly hall in Los Angeles, surrounded by light fixtures flashing {{in time to the}} music. Mark Romanek, the video's director, quit after numerous arguments with Cuomo, leaving Cuomo to edit the video himself. The video debuted on MTV's 120 Minutes and received moderate airplay.|$|E

500|$|By early 1887, 13 African Americans {{were playing}} in the [...] "white" [...] minor leagues, {{including}} four in the Ohio State League. [...] Weldy began the season with the Akron Acorns of the Ohio State League. [...] However, he appeared in only four games for the Acorns. During the 1887 season, racial segregation began to become the official policy in certain minor leagues. [...] Weldy was outraged by a report that the Tri-State League (successor to the Ohio State League) had abandoned racial integration. [...] In March 1888, {{he wrote a letter}} to the league's president protesting the decision. [...] In his 1970 history of racial segregation in baseball, Robert Peterson described Weldy's letter as [...] "perhaps the most passionate cry for justice ever voiced by a Negro athlete." [...] In the letter, Walker wrote:The law is a disgrace to the present age, and reflects very much upon the intelligence of your last meeting, and casts derision at the laws of Ohio– the voice of the people– that say all men are equal. I would suggest that your honorable body, in case that black law is not repealed, pass one making it criminal for a colored man or woman to be found on a ball ground... There should be some broader cause– such as lack of ability, behavior and intelligence– for barring a player, rather than his color. [...] It is for these reasons <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think ability and intelligence should be recognized first and last– at all times and by everyone– I ask the question again, 'Why was the law permitting colored men to sign repealed, etc.?' ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "It wasn't a perfect episode, mainly because Vivian remains a fairly muddled, bratty villain, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't {{feel like the}} show ever really used Ray Wise to his full potential. But {{so much of it}} was so satisfying, both emotionally and comedically, that, until Vivian called Chuck during the rehearsal dinner, I actually thought to myself, 'You know, this would be a pretty damn good finale in and of itself. Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B on an A+ to F scale. McGee wrote, [...] "The last act was fairly phenomenal, but we had to get through a lot of troubling material in order to achieve true liftoff on the hour. With so many loose ends to wrap up, the hour felt overstuffed: the impending wedding, The Norseman, Agent X, Morgan's first field assignment...I mean, that's a lot of stuff. And it doesn't help that Vivian Volkoff {{is at the center of}} three of those things, and inserted herself into the fourth at the last moment. And in thinking about the clunkiness of aspects of this episode, I thought about the clunkiness of this latter half of the season as a whole." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that it was a mistake not to include Timothy Dalton as Alexei Volkoff after the plot twists of the previous episode. Sarah Stegall of SFScope wrote, [...] "Chuck is killing me by inches. So close, so close to the Chuck/Sarah wedding, but things keep going wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, casting calls {{revealed}} the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots. In March 2011, scenes involving Adriana Barraza {{were removed from}} the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future. In response Barraza stated, [...] "It saddens me because the movie is great <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut". Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. In that same month, Douglas Tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants. On his hiring, Tait said [...] "I am 6'5" [...] and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7" [...] and taller, and weighed over [...] When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants". In April 2011, the IMAX Corporation, Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in IMAX 3D, continuing the partnership which began on Iron Man 2. Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said [...] "We came to feel that in our case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the [...] "special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D". The post-credits scene that sees Nick Fury approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by The Avengerss director, Joss Whedon.|$|E

500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the thing that had kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house – even though there are days when I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E
2500|$|When {{interviewed in}} May, 2002, former Tuzla mayor Selim Beslagic stated about the holiday “No one {{is forced to}} {{celebrate}} May 15; I will celebrate on my own if necessary, because I stayed alive <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> helped that many people stay alive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ghiorso {{earned an}} AB, MS, and PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. He chose Berkeley for {{practical}} reasons: [...] "I went to Berkeley {{because it was}} the local school, because tuition was essentially free, <b>and</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was fascinated as a high school student with hot springs, volcanos, and, in particular, the work of Howell Williams and Arthur L. Day." ...|$|E

2500|$|The final document, engrossed by Jacob Shallus, {{was taken}} up on Monday, September 17, at the Convention's final session. Several of the delegates were {{disappointed}} in the result, a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises. Some delegates left before the ceremony, and three others refused to sign. Of the thirty-nine signers, Benjamin Franklin summed up, addressing the Convention: [...] "There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them."
