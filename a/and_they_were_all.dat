5|$|By October, Moreno's {{measures}} {{started to}} generate resistance among some who initially supported the May Revolution. Traders {{did not like}} the protectionist policy, and some members of the military had close ties with rich people and opposed their punishment. On October 16 it was discovered that ten members of the Cabildo had sworn loyalty to the Regency Council the past July, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> jailed. This included Julián Leiva and Juan José de Lezica. Moreno and Saavedra had a dispute when the Junta was deciding what to do. Moreno proposed executing them as a deterrent, accusing them of working with the Montevideo Cabildo, the enemy of the Junta. Saavedra replied that the government should promote leniency, and rejected the use of the Patricians Regiment to carry out such executions. The prisoners were finally exiled to Luján, Ranchos, and Salto, and Leiva was housed by Gregorio Funes in Córdoba.|$|E

5|$|During the {{bombardment}} a small naval engagement occurred when, at 09:05, the obsolete Glasgow fired upon the St George using her armament of 7 nine-pounder guns and a Gatling gun, {{which had been}} a present from Queen Victoria to the sultan. The return fire caused Glasgow to sink, though the shallow harbour meant that her masts remained out of the water. Glasgows crew hoisted a British flag as a token of their surrender, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> rescued by British sailors in launches. Thrush also sank two steam launches whose Zanzibari crews shot at her with rifles. Some land fighting occurred when Khalid's men fired on Raikes' askaris, with little effect, {{as they approached the}} palace. The fighting ceased {{with the end of the}} shelling. The British controlled the town and the palace, and by the afternoon Hamud bin Muhammed, an Arab favourable to the British, had been installed as sultan with much reduced powers. The British ships and crews had fired around 500 shells, 4,100 machine gun rounds and 1,000 rifle rounds during the engagement.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} took direct {{aim at the}} U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial. The case hinged {{on whether or not}} mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill to outlaw picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.|$|E

The 11 missiles launched killed six Americans and a number of German citizens in nearby towns, but failed to damage the bridge.

25|$|There was a {{complete}} collapse on Saturday morning with only Alim, who scored 50, playing with any confidence. Pakistan were all out for 131 and Cowdrey enforced the follow-on. England's best bowler was Dexter, nominally the third seamer, who took four for 10. Titmus, who bowled only four overs, took two for 3, including the key wicket of Alim. Alim again played well in the second innings but his only support came from Saeed. They both made half-centuries {{but the rest of}} the team were dismissed cheaply <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> out for 180, Statham taking four for 50.

25|$|Sri Lanka {{got off to}} a bad {{start with}} wicketkeeper Rohan Jayasekera dropped opening batsman Graham Gooch off the very first {{delivery}} from Ashantha de Mel. The English opening pair took their team's score to 55 before Geoff Cook was dismissed as their first wicket. When the next batsman, David Gower, was run out with England's total on 83, Ian Botham joined Gooch at the crease and put together a strong partnership. At one stage, these two batsmen scored 43 runs off 5 overs. Gooch was dropped two more times before he was dismissed for 64 with the total on 152, followed by Botham with their team total on 191. However, the English batting collapsed after this, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> out for 211 in the last over of the innings.|$|E

Even so, four wickets fell before close of play and Pakistan went into the rest day on 158 for four, still 140 in arrears. On the fourth day (Monday), Brian Statham took two quick wickets and Pakistan's fate was sealed despite resistance by Saeed Ahmed, who scored 65. England's bowlers shared the wickets: Statham took six in the match, Allen and Tony Lock five each and Fred Trueman four. The match ended on Monday afternoon, Pakistan all out for 274 and England winning by an innings and 24 runs.|$|E
25|$|VOC’s dire {{situation}} {{after the}} Battle of Tugu in July 1741 did {{not escape the}} king’s attention, but– like Amangkurat II– he avoided any open breach with VOC since his own kraton was not lacking of factions against him. He ordered Patih Natakusuma {{to do all the}} dirty work, such as ordering the Arch-Regent (Adipati) of Jipang (Bojonegoro), one Tumenggung Mataun, to join the Chinese. In September 1741, the king ordered Patih Natakusuma and several regents to help the Chinese besiege Semarang and let Natakusuma attack VOC garrison in Kartasura, who were starved into submission in August. However, reinforcement from VOC’s posts in Outer Islands were arriving since August <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> wisely concentrated to repel the Chinese around Semarang. In the beginning of November, the Dutch attacked Kaligawe, Torbaya around Semarang, and repulsed the alliance of Javanese and Chinese forces who were stationed in four separate fortress and did not co-ordinate with each other. At the end of November, Cakraningrat IV had controlled the stretch of east coast from Tuban to Sedayu and the Dutch relieved Tegal of Chinese rebels. This caused Pakubuwana II to change sides and open negotiations with the Dutch.|$|E
25|$|Leicestershire {{prevailed in}} a match at Old Trafford where 726 runs were scored in four {{completed}} innings and Leicestershire's young bowler Stuart Broad and captain HD Ackerman starred. Leicestershire chose to bat {{after winning the}} toss, and were taken apart by Glen Chapple and Murali Kartik, who shared nine wickets, while the highest partnership for Leicestershire was worth 53. The lack of veteran bowler Dominic Cork {{did not seem to}} bother Lancashire unduly, as Chapple got five wickets for 22 runs and Kartik four for 43. Only Jon Maunders and HD Ackerman passed 20 for the visitors, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> out for 165. Lancashire accumulated runs slowly, and their score was 61 for 2 at the close of play on the first day. With Mal Loye out with an injury, Lancashire posted 191, Maunders taking four for 28 and Stuart Broad three for 57 to limit Lancashire's lead to 26 runs. An opening partnership of 63 saw Leicestershire take the lead, but spinners Murali Kartik and Andrew Symonds took two wickets each, while the three seamers Chapple, Sajid Mahmood and Anderson took one each to round off the day. Ackerman was left overnight on 37 - 11 short of the highest score in the match so far.|$|E
