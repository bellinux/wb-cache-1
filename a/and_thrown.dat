5|$|Al-Muwaffaq, {{suffering}} from gout, was already visibly nearing his end; the vizier Isma'il ibn Bulbul {{and the city}} commander of Baghdad, Abu'l-Saqr, called al-Mu'tamid and his sons, including the heir-apparent al-Mufawwad, into the city, hoping to exploit al-Muwaffaq's imminent death for their own purposes. Nevertheless the attempt to sideline Abu'l-Abbas failed due to his popularity with the soldiers and the common people. He was set free to visit his father's deathbed, {{and was able to}} immediately assume power when al-Muwaffaq died on 2 June. The Baghdad mob ransacked his opponents' houses, and Ibn Bulbul was dismissed <b>and</b> <b>thrown</b> in prison, where he died from maltreatment after a few months. Similar fates awaited any of his supporters that Abu'l-Abbas could lay his hands on.|$|E

5|$|Hand grenade, {{explosive}}: Before explosive grenades, incendiary grenades {{were used}} by the Eastern Roman Empire, incorporating Greek fire. Early prototypes to the modern explosive grenade, according to British scientist and sinologist Joseph Needham, appear in the military book, Wujing Zongyao ("Compilation of Military Classics"), by 1044. During the Song Dynasty, weapons known as Zhen Tian Lei were created when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or metal containers <b>and</b> <b>thrown</b> at the enemy. Further descriptions and illustrations of early Chinese hand grenades are provided in the Huolongjing.|$|E

5|$|Bishop (Lance Henriksen), {{the android}} {{executive}} officer {{assigned to the}} Sulaco, is primarily responsible for planetary maneuvering. When he introduces himself to Ripley, he says that his programming demands complete loyalty and an inability to harm humans (unlike Ash); Ripley is initially distrustful. After most of the Colonial Marines are wiped out by the Aliens on LV-426, Bishop is a medic and technician who ensures that the company's dropship receives Ripley, Newt and Hicks. When he boards the Sulaco, he is impaled and bisected by the stowaway Alien Queen. When Ripley defeats the Queen by opening the airlock, Bishop saves Newt. He is placed into cryosleep with Ripley, Newt and Hicks. When the Sulaco crashes into Fury 161 in Alien 3, Bishop is damaged beyond repair <b>and</b> <b>thrown</b> into the prison's landfill. Although his speech and memory are repaired by Ripley so he can disclose the events leading to the crash, he asks Ripley to shut him down permanently, to which Ripley obliges.|$|E
5|$|By 5 December, the Australians {{had managed}} to {{stockpile}} enough supplies in forward areas to enable the 2/24th Infantry Battalion, which had been engaged in moving the stores, {{to be released from}} this task <b>and</b> <b>thrown</b> back into the fighting. In order to bypass the Japanese position, elements from the 2/23rd along with one company from the 2/24th carried out flanking manoeuvres {{to the west of the}} track were undertaken before the Australians established themselves in defensive positions short of Peak Hill. On 6 December, the remaining three companies of the 2/24th came up and as the Australians continued to advance towards Peak Hill they found considerable Japanese positions which had been abandoned. As movement was seen in Wareo, which was visible in the distance, an artillery bombardment was called in by the Australians. In the afternoon, the Australians cut the branch track that turned towards Kwatingkoo before an attack was put in on Peak Hill. The Japanese defences held and the attack beaten off, the Australians attempted to outflank to the north but they were prevented from doing so by the thick jungle and as the sun set, they had to be content to dig-in on the western approach to Peak Hill.|$|E
