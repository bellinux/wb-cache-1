5|$|The seven-minute long video depicts Beyoncé {{playing a}} beauty pageant contest {{representing}} Third Ward, Houston, {{the area in}} which she grew up. It opens with the sound of a poignant piano and shots of Beyoncé sporting short hair, looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror. It transitions to a segment of her fellow contestants preparing for the pageant backstage, combing their hair, fitting their dresses and analyzing their bodies; one scene during the preparations shows Beyoncé arguing with another contestant over a hair dryer. Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict her sitting on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy for him {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} who is {{competent to}} stand trial is therefore also competent to plead guilty, waiving the full panoply of trial rights, but not necessarily competent enough to represent <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> trial <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of a state procedural rule requiring {{a higher standard of}} competence for pro se representation.|$|R
25|$|Painters {{depicting}} someone {{gazing into}} a mirror often also show the person's reflection. This {{is a kind}} of abstraction—in most cases the angle of view is such that the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies and still photography an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking <b>at</b> him- or <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, and yet the reflection faces <b>the</b> camera. <b>In</b> reality, <b>the</b> actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not their own reflection.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the program}} Ally McBeal first ran, many women lauded its {{portrayal}} of the lead character. Sharon Waxman, writing for The Washington Post, commented that Kelley had a keen insight into the human nature of both men and women. She quoted Dyan Cannon: [...] "This man understands the way a woman thinks, ... the complex ways we've found to hide our fears." [...] A New York Times writer used the character {{as an example of}} a strong television woman's role, another saw <b>herself,</b> <b>at</b> times, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> character's portrayal of self-absorption and reflection, her crafted neuroses, her vulnerabilities.|$|R
2500|$|After a three-day-long cocaine binge in 2005, Carlisle {{says she}} looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror and [...] "didn't see a light or a soul" [...] in her eyes: [...] "I just thought, ‘I know I don’t look like myself anymore.'" [...] The same morning, {{she had an}} {{auditory}} hallucination telling her she would be found dead {{in a hotel room}} if she did not stop using drugs. The incident jarred Carlisle into seeking sobriety, and she has been sober since 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Anna Lizas success, Vega {{was dubbed}} the [...] "Original Soap Opera Princess". Director Ruel Bayani, the {{producer}} of ABS-CBN's remake of Anna Liza, commended Vega, calling her portrayal of the role [...] "iconic" [...] and that she set a high standard on being a [...] "child star". Judy Ann Santos once stated on StarStudio's special issue about Santos herself {{that she is a}} fan of Vega, and when she learned about the latter's death, she first disappeared into her room and then into the bathroom. She turned the bathroom's doorknob quietly, pushed the door shut then {{stood in front of the}} sink. She then looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror and cried.|$|E
60|$|She {{dismissed}} her secretary, gazed <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{glass and}} made a grimace.|$|E
2500|$|Booth {{was still}} {{scarcely}} {{more than a}} young girl when a friend suggested to her that no complete history {{of the city of}} New York had ever been written, and that it might be well to prepare such a one for the use of schools. Although without ambition to attempt the impossible, yet never daunted by the possible, she <b>at</b> once busied <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> undertaking, and, after some years spent in preparation, finished one that became, on the request of a publisher, the basis of a more important work upon the same subject, her material having far outgrown the limits proposed, and her experience having taught her the best way of using it. She knew that it was no petty work, as many of the most stirring events of colonial and national history were connected with its story. During the course of her historical work, Booth had full access to libraries and archives. Washington Irving sent her a letter of cordial encouragement, and D. T. Valentine, Henry B. Dawson, W. J. Davis, E. B. O'Callaghan, and numerous others showered her with documents and every assistance. [...] "My Dear Miss Booth," [...] writes Benson G. Lossing, [...] "the citizens of New York owe you a debt of gratitude for this popular story {{of the life of the}} great metropolis, containing so many important facts in its history, and included in one volume accessible to all. I congratulate you on the completeness of the task and <b>the</b> admirable manner <b>in</b> which it has been performed." [...] <b>The</b> history appeared <b>in</b> one large volume, and met at once with a generous welcome, whose pecuniary results were very considerable. So satisfactory, indeed, was its reception, that the publisher proposed to her to go abroad and write popular histories of the great European capitals, London, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna. It was a bright vision for the young writer, but the approach of war and other fortuitous circumstances prevented its becoming a reality.|$|R

60|$|She did not answer. She {{was looking}} <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror; and Stangrave, {{in spite of}} his almost doting affection, flushed with anger, almost contempt, at her vanity.|$|E

25|$|Scottish author George MacDonald {{also wrote}} a fantasy novel {{entitled}} Lilith, {{first published in}} 1895. MacDonald employed the character of Lilith in service to a spiritual drama about sin and redemption, in which Lilith finds a hard-won salvation. Many of the traditional characteristics of Lilith mythology are present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> author's depiction: Long dark hair, pale skin, a hatred and fear of children and babies, and an obsession with gazing <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> a mirror. MacDonald's Lilith also has vampiric qualities: she bites people and sucks their blood for sustenance.|$|R
