5|$|Planets {{also have}} {{varying degrees of}} <b>axial</b> tilt; they lie {{at an angle to}} the plane of their stars' equators. This causes the amount of light {{received}} by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star, the southern hemisphere points towards it, and vice versa. Each planet therefore has seasons, changes to the climate over the course of its year. The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice. Each planet has two in the course of its orbit; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice, when its day is longest, the other has its winter solstice, when its day is shortest. The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet. Jupiter's <b>axial</b> tilt is very small, so its seasonal variation is minimal; Uranus, on the other hand, has an <b>axial</b> tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side, which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices. Among extrasolar planets, <b>axial</b> tilts are not known for certain, though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no <b>axial</b> tilt {{as a result of their}} proximity to their stars.|$|E
5|$|The <b>axial</b> tilt of Jupiter is {{relatively}} small: only 3.13°. As a result, {{it does not}} experience significant seasonal changes, in contrast to, for example, Earth and Mars.|$|E
5|$|The <b>axial</b> tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its orbital plane, {{which is similar}} to the <b>axial</b> tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars, they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the next perihelion came in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|The <b>axial</b> tilt of Neptune is 28.32°, {{which is}} similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, Neptune {{experiences}} similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years. Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11hours. Because its <b>axial</b> tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long year is not any more extreme.|$|E
5|$|The development, eruption, {{and close}} {{monitoring}} of <b>Axial</b> Seamount provided a fertile model on submarine volcanic eruptions to scientists; several scientific {{papers on the}} topic were published soon after.|$|E
5|$|The first volcanoes {{along the}} Juan de Fuca ridge, {{including}} <b>Axial</b> Seamount, were {{detected in the}} 1970s by satellite altimetry. <b>Axial</b> Seamount's proximity to the western coast and shallow depth make {{it one of the}} most easily accessible seamounts in the world, and its unique geological setting and active state also makes {{it one of the most}} interesting, rivaling Davidson Seamount to the south in scientific interest.|$|E
5|$|Tius's allenyl {{substrates}} can exhibit <b>axial</b> to tetrahedral chirality transfer if enantiopure allenes are used. The example below {{generates a}} chiral diosphenpol in 64% yield and 95% enantiomeric excess.|$|E
5|$|With Murray Gell-Mann, Feynman {{developed}} {{a model of}} weak decay, which showed that the current coupling in the process {{is a combination of}} vector and <b>axial</b> currents (an example of weak decay is the decay of a neutron into an electron, a proton, and an antineutrino). Although E. C. George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak developed the theory nearly simultaneously, Feynman's collaboration with Murray Gell-Mann was seen as seminal because the weak interaction was neatly described by the vector and <b>axial</b> currents. It thus combined the 1933 beta decay theory of Enrico Fermi with an explanation of parity violation.|$|E
5|$|A {{specification}} {{was issued}} by the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) for a single-seat, carrier-based fighter powered by a Westinghouse 24C (later J34) <b>axial</b> turbojet on 5 September 1944. Chance Vought was awarded a contract for three V-340 (company designation) prototypes on 29 December 1944.|$|E
5|$|It {{should be}} noted that convergency is {{considered}} responsible for uniquely tetrapod features found also in other non-elpistostegalian fish from the period like Sauripterus (finger-like jointed distal radial bones) or Tarrasius (tetrapod-like spine with 5 <b>axial</b> regions).|$|E
5|$|Its {{rotation}} {{is relatively}} fast for an asteroid (5.342h) and prograde, {{with the north}} pole pointing {{in the direction of}} right ascension 20h32min, declination +48° (in the constellation Cygnus) with an uncertainty of about 10°. This gives an <b>axial</b> tilt of 29°.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's low <b>axial</b> tilt {{means that}} the poles {{constantly}} receive less solar radiation than at the planet's equatorial region. Convection within {{the interior of the}} planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.|$|E
5|$|The Moon and Earth orbit {{a common}} {{barycenter}} every 27.32days {{relative to the}} background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, {{the period of the}} synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their <b>axial</b> rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and <b>axial</b> planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|The {{angle of}} Earth's <b>axial</b> tilt is {{relatively}} stable {{over long periods}} of time. Its <b>axial</b> tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.|$|E
5|$|Work on the Peace Centre {{commenced}} in 1950. In {{addition to}} the <b>axial</b> nature of the design, the layout is similar to Tange's early competition arrangement for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Memorial Hall.|$|E
25|$|Many <b>Axial</b> fan {{failures}} {{have happened}} after controlled blade <b>axial</b> fans {{were locked in}} a fixed position and Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) were installed. The VFDs are not practical for some <b>Axial</b> fans. <b>Axial</b> fans with severe instability regions should not be operated at blades angles, rotational speeds, mass flow rates, and pressures that expose the fan to stall conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{hinge points}} along an entire folded surface form a hinge line, {{which can be}} either a crest line or a trough line. The trend and plunge of a linear hinge line gives you {{information}} about {{the orientation of the}} fold. To more completely describe the orientation of a fold, one must describe the <b>axial</b> surface. The <b>axial</b> surface is the surface defined by connecting all the hinge lines of stacked folding surfaces. If the <b>axial</b> surface is a planar surface then it is called the <b>axial</b> plane and can be described by the strike and dip of the plane. An <b>axial</b> trace is the line of intersection of the <b>axial</b> surface with any other surface (ground, side of mountain, geological cross-section).|$|E
25|$|The angular {{velocity}} vector (an <b>axial</b> vector) also describes {{the direction of}} the axis of rotation. Similarly the torque is an <b>axial</b> vector.|$|E
25|$|Tail: It is {{the longest}} part(50×10−6 m) having <b>axial</b> {{filament}} surrounded by cytoplasm and plasma membrane, but at the posterior end <b>axial</b> filament is naked.|$|E
25|$|Substituents on a {{cyclohexane}} ring {{prefer to}} reside in the equatorial position to the <b>axial.</b> The difference in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) between the higher energy conformation (<b>axial</b> substitution) and the lower energy conformation (equatorial substitution) is the A-value for that particular substituent.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} electrodynamics, {{the charge}} density ρ is a scalar, the electric field, E, and current j are vectors, but the magnetic field, H is an <b>axial</b> vector. However, Maxwell's equations are invariant under parity because the curl of an <b>axial</b> vector is a vector.|$|E
25|$|Lenticular {{galaxies are}} {{unique in that}} they have a visible disk {{component}} as well as a prominent bulge component. They have much higher bulge-to-disk ratios than typical spirals and do not have the canonical spiral arm structure of late-type galaxies, yet may exhibit a central bar. This bulge dominance {{can be seen in the}} axis ratio (i.e. the ratio between the observed minor and major <b>axial</b> of a disk galaxy) distribution of a lenticular galaxy sample. The distribution for lenticular galaxies rises steadily in the range 0.25 to 0.85 whereas the distribution for spirals is essentially flat in that same range. Larger <b>axial</b> ratios can be explained by observing face-on disk galaxies or by having a sample of spheroidal (bulge-dominated) galaxies. Imagine looking at two disk galaxies edge-on, one with a bulge and one without a bulge. The galaxy with a prominent bulge will have a larger edge-on <b>axial</b> ratio compared to the galaxy without a bulge based on the definition of <b>axial</b> ratio. Thus a sample of disk galaxies with prominent spheroidal components will have more galaxies at larger <b>axial</b> ratios. The fact that the lenticular galaxy distribution rises with increasing observed <b>axial</b> ratio implies that lenticulars are dominated by a central bulge component.|$|E
25|$|The {{curves of}} the lumbar, thoracic, and {{cervical}} exhibit mild <b>axial</b> extension.|$|E
25|$|Calculations {{predict that}} the point group of {{molecular}} UO3 is C2v, with an <b>axial</b> bond length of 1.75 Å, an equatorial bond length of 1.83 Å and an angle of 161° between the <b>axial</b> oxygens. The more symmetrical D3h species is a saddle point, 49 kJ/mol above the C2v minimum. The authors invoke a second-order Jahn–Teller effect as explanation.|$|E
25|$|In about 13,000 years, {{the north}} pole will be tilted toward the Sun when the Earth is at perihelion. <b>Axial</b> tilt and orbital {{eccentricity}} will both contribute their maximum increase in solar radiation during the northern hemisphere's summer. <b>Axial</b> precession will promote more extreme variation in irradiation of the northern hemisphere and less extreme variation in the south.|$|E
25|$|Antiform: linear, strata dip {{away from}} <b>axial</b> center, age unknown, or inverted.|$|E
25|$|Synform: linear, strata dip toward <b>axial</b> centre, age unknown, or inverted.|$|E
25|$|Anticline: linear, strata {{normally}} dip {{away from}} <b>axial</b> center, oldest strata in center irrespective of orientation.|$|E
25|$|Syncline: linear, strata {{normally}} dip toward <b>axial</b> center, youngest strata {{in center}} irrespective of orientation.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{turbines}} {{power the}} <b>axial</b> and centrifugal flow compressors {{that are part}} of jet engines.|$|E
25|$|Other {{diagnostic}} tests include {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) and computerized <b>axial</b> tomography (CAT, or CT).|$|E
25|$|Folds are {{classified}} by their size, fold shape, tightness, and dip of the <b>axial</b> plane.|$|E
25|$|Diagonal or {{mixed-flow}} compressors {{are similar}} to centrifugal compressors, but have a radial and <b>axial</b> velocity component {{at the exit from}} the rotor. The diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to an <b>axial</b> rather than radial direction. Comparative to the conventional centrifugal compressor (of the same stage pressure ratio), the value of the speed of the mixed flow compressor is 1.5 times larger.|$|E
25|$|Earth {{currently}} has an <b>axial</b> tilt of about 23.4°. This value remains {{about the same}} relative to a stationary orbital plane throughout the cycles of <b>axial</b> precession. But the ecliptic (i.e., Earth's orbit) moves due to planetary perturbations, and the obliquity of the ecliptic is not a fixed quantity. At present, it is decreasing {{at a rate of}} about 47″ per century (see details in Short term below).|$|E
25|$|Bivectors and <b>axial</b> vectors {{are related}} by Hodge dual. In a real vector space the Hodge dual relates a {{subspace}} to its orthogonal complement, so if a bivector {{is represented by}} a plane then the <b>axial</b> vector associated with it is simply the plane's surface normal. The plane has two normals, one on each side, giving the two possible orientations for the plane and bivector.|$|E
25|$|Like all trilobites, {{the body}} {{is divided into three}} {{functional}} segments known as tagmata (singular: tagma), which in turn are divided into three lobes - the central lobe (<b>axial)</b> and two lateral lobes (pleural). Aside from faint depressions in the thorax, Bumastus is unusual in that the three lobes are barely discernible from each other. The <b>axial</b> lobe of Bumastus is also very broad in comparison to the pleural lobes.|$|E
