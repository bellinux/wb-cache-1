5|$|The game {{offers a}} number of {{traditional}} Mario items, such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Starman, along with new power-ups that bestow special suits onto Mario and grant him new abilities. Returning from Super Mario Bros. 3 is the Super Leaf power-up, which gives Mario the Tanooki suit, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> to float {{in the air and}} attack with his tail, with a later variant also <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> to transform into a statue upon performing a ground pound. The player is able to reserve an extra power-up, which can be retrieved by tapping the item visible on the touchscreen.|$|E
5|$|A {{designer}} named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, {{claiming he}} developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a Solid State, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> {{to move into the}} society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal.|$|E
5|$|After Ottawa {{lost the}} Stanley Cup to the Montreal Wanderers in 1906, McGee retired at just 23years old. His {{retirement}} {{is attributed to}} his government position not <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> to travel. He had briefly retired after his brother Jim's death in 1904. McGee retired after scoring 135 goals in only 45games (both league and challenge). Only Russell Bowie rivals his average of 3 goals per game.|$|E

50|$|While {{conceding that}} Marinol can be {{effective}} for treatment of hypertension and would <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to travel briefly without medical marijuana, it does not <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to have an acceptable quality of life, Kubby said.|$|R
50|$|Jonathan Drew {{has limited}} powers of telepathy, which <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> to sense emotions, read minds (only surface thoughts), and telekinesis, which <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> to fly, {{generate}} force fields, and lift heavy objects through force of mind alone.|$|R
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E

5|$|Clippard {{was drafted}} in the ninth round of the 2003 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, with the 274th overall selection, by the New York Yankees. Though he had signed a National Letter of Intent {{in the fall of}} 2002 to attend the University of South Florida on a {{baseball}} scholarship, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> to play college baseball for the South Florida Bulls, he chose to turn professional due to his draft position and the opportunity to play for the Yankees.|$|E

5|$|Cody {{signed a}} four-year, $3.385 million maximum value {{contract}} with the Ravens on July 26, 2010.

5|$|Gelimer {{was given}} an ample estate in Galatia, {{and would have been}} raised to patrician rank if he had not steadfastly refused to renounce his Arian faith.

50|$|Pulisic is {{a modern-day}} number 10. His low {{center of gravity}} <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> to dribble at high speeds. Recently, he has played more of a winger role for Dortmund. His adept weak foot skills <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to play {{on either side of}} the field.|$|R
5000|$|Grey: Grey's passive {{abilities}} <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to walk farther in one turn {{than most}} other characters, and his spear <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> to strike two enemies at the same time.

This title would give his photographs increased recognition and raise their price.|$|E
5|$|Homesick for Florida, Valencia {{sought to}} {{transfer}} to the University of Miami after his freshman year, even though it only offered him a modest scholarship.

Max's ABC Special <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> to catch, hold onto, and throw back projectiles; and Kim Dragon's ABC Special <b>allows</b> <b>him</b> to perform counters while blocking.|$|R
50|$|His {{knowledge}} of chemistry, learnt during his university studies, <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to undertake research on photographic toning {{in the late}} 1970s. This <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to be amongst the first photographers in Italy {{to become involved in}} the study of colour, freeing himself from the predominance of black-and-white photography.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{he moved}} to Pandharpur. The {{traditional}} story is that the upper castes here did not <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to enter the temple, nor did they <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> {{to stand in the}} door of the temple. So he built a hut {{on the other side of}} the river Chandrabhaga.|$|R

5|$|Nkrumah-Acheampong only {{received}} partial {{funding from}} the Ghana Olympic Committee, <b>allowing</b> <b>him</b> to travel to Vancouver, but not covering the travel costs of his support team.
