50|$|The Dibucaine {{number is}} used to {{differentiate}} individuals who have substitution mutations of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme resulting in decreased enzyme function. At least one substitution mutation has been characterized {{that is capable of}} altering the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis. Reduced butyrylcholinesterase activity may occur as a result of inherited or acquired causes. Inherited reductions in butyrylcholinesterase activity occur because of mutations at a single <b>autosomal</b> <b>location</b> on the long arm of chromosome 3. Physiologic reductions may occur with extremes of age and during pregnancy. Other acquired causes of decreased activity include kidney and liver disease, malignancy (cancer), malnutrition, and burns. In the inherited type, an individual receives a gene from each parent, one of which may be the wild type butyrylcholinesterase, or the mutant. Thus, there may be individuals who are homozygous for the wild type butyrylcholinesterase (normal) or the mutant butyrylcholinesterase (incidence 1/3200), and there is the group of heterozygotes with one of each (incidence 1/480).|$|E
40|$|Many {{eukaryotic}} cell surface proteins {{are bound to}} the membrane via the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor that is covalently linked to their carboxy-terminus. The GPI anchor precursor is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and post-translationally linked to protein. We cloned a human gene termed PIG-B (phosphatidylinositol glycan of complementation class B) that is involved in transferring the third mannose. PIG-B encodes a 554 amino acid, ER transmembrane protein with an amino-terminal portion of approximately 60 amino acids on the cytoplasmic side and a large carboxy-terminal portion of 470 amino acids within the ER lumen. A mutant PIG-B lacking the cytoplasmic portion remains active, indicating that the functional site of PIG-B resides on the lumenal side of the ER membrane. The PIG-B gene was localized to chromosome 15 at q 21 -q 22. This <b>autosomal</b> <b>location</b> would explain why PIG-B {{is not involved in}} the defective GPI anchor synthesis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, which is always caused by a somatic mutation of the X-linked PIG-A gene...|$|E
40|$|The variegating {{mutation}} brown(Dominant) (bw(D)) of Drosophila melanogaster {{is associated}} with an insertion of heterochromatin into chromosome arm 2 R at 59 E, {{the site of the}} bw gene. Mutagenesis produced 150 dominant suppressors of bw(D) variegation. These fall into two classes: unlinked suppressors, which also suppress other variegating mutations; and linked chromosome rearrangements, which suppress only bw(D). Some rearrangements are broken at 59 E, and so might directly interfere with variegation caused by the heterochromatic insertion at that site. However, most rearrangements are translocations broken proximal to bw within the 52 D- 57 D region of 2 R. Translocation breakpoints on the X chromosome are scattered throughout the X euchromatin, while those on chromosome 3 are confined to the tips. This suggests that a special property of the X chromosome suppresses bw(D) variegation, as does a distal <b>autosomal</b> <b>location.</b> Conversely, two enhancers of bw(D) are caused by translocations from the same part of 2 R to proximal heterochromatin, bringing the bw(D) heterochromatic insertion close to the chromocenter with which it strongly associates. These results support the notion that heterochromatin formation at a genetic locus depends on its location within the nucleus...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila roX 1 gene is X-linked and {{produces}} RNAs that are male-specific, somatic, and preferentially {{expressed in the}} central nervous system. These RNAs are retained in the nucleus and lack any significant open reading frame. Although all sexually dimorphic characteristics in Drosophila {{were thought to be}} controlled by the sex determination pathway through the gene transformer (tra), the expression of roX 1 is independent of tra activity. Instead, the dosage compensation system is necessary and sufficient for the expression of roX 1. Consistent with a potential function in dosage compensation, roX 1 RNAs localize specifically to the male X chromosome. This localization occurs even when roX 1 RNAs are expressed from <b>autosomal</b> <b>locations</b> in X-to-autosome translocations. The novel regulation and subnuclear localization of roX 1 RNAs makes them candidates for an RNA component of the dosage compensation machinery...|$|R
40|$|The {{genetic linkage}} of {{coronary}} artery disease is well-established. However, the transmission of this disease is not clearly defined. Although the Mendelian autosomal dominant pattern has been seen in familial hypercholesterolemia and mutant MEF 2 A induced familiar myocardial infarction, and a multifactorial genetic model has been proposed for non-familial CAD, the gender difference in this disease is not well explained. We hypothesized that CAD is a multifactorial inherited disorder with a sex-influenced trait, which shows an autosomal dominant pattern in men and autosomal recessive transmission in women. This hypothesis is supported by the facts including an age-dependent higher prevalence in men, the <b>autosomal</b> <b>locations</b> of CAD associated genes, the gender difference seen even in familiar CAD, and the potential gene-gene interactions between CAD associated genes on autosomal chromosomes and those found on the X chromosome. Further investigation of genetic components will provide not only the critical information about the etiology of CAD, but also help to clarify the confusion in the use of exogenous female hormones in the prevention and/or the treatment of the disease...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{autosomal}} insertions of chromosomal fragments derived {{from around the}} X linked white eye color locus have been examined for male specific lethal (MSL) complex binding using both immunostaining and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) techniques. The results show that the transposing elements (TEs) composed of several genes in the white region (3 C 2 - 3 C 5) do not recruit the MSL complex when inserted into an autosome. The same result is found for the Tp(1 : 3) wzh insertion, a fragment of the X chromosome inserted into the third chromosome. Two other insertions, Dp(1 : 2) w 70 h (3 A 7 - 3 C 2 - 3) and Dp(1 : 2) 51 b (3 C 2 - 3 D 6), which extend more distally or proximally beyond the TE insertion, respectively, display a binding pattern of the MSL complex at the <b>autosomal</b> <b>location.</b> These insertions were also examined in females ectopically expressing MSL- 2 and show similar binding activity. In addition, the Tp(3 : 1) O 5 transposition strain containing an autosomal segment in the X chromosome was examined for spreading of the MSL complex. Limited spreading of the MSL complex into autosomal regions was indicated by immunostaining and FISH. This spreading was further confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the MSL complex covering the autosomal sequences...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{mapping of}} the progeny of an F 2 intercross between WKY and WKHA rats had {{previously}} {{allowed us to}} detect male-specific linkage between locus Cm 24 and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). By further expanding that analysis, we detected additional loci that were all linked to LVMI in a sexspecific manner despite their <b>autosomal</b> <b>location.</b> In males, we detected one additional locus (Lvm 8) on Chromosome 5 (LOD = 3. 4), the two loci Lvm 13 (LOD = 4. 5) and Lvm 9 (LOD = 2. 8) on Chromosome 17, and locus Lvm 10 (LOD = 4. 2) on Chromosome 12. The locus Lvm 13 had the same boundaries as locus Cm 26 previously reported by others using a different cross. None of these loci showed linkage to LVM in females. In contrast, we identified in females the novel locus Lvm 11 on Chromosome 15 (LOD = 2. 8) and locus Lvm 12 (LOD = 2. 7) that had the same boundaries on Chromosome 3 as locus Cm 25 detected previously by others using a cross of other normotensive strains. In prepubertal males, {{there were no differences}} in the width of cardiomyocytes from WKY and WKHA rats, but cardiomyocytes from WKHA became progressively wider than that of WKY as sexual maturation progressed. Altogether, these results provide evidence that distinct genes may influence LVMI of rats in a sexdependent manner, maybe by involving sex-specific interactions of sex steroids with particular genes involved in the determination of LVMI and/or cardiomyocyte width.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} traffic of male-biased genes {{out of the}} mammalian and Drosophila X-chromosomes, {{and there are also}} reports of an under-representation of male-biased genes on the X. This may reflect an adaptive process driven by natural selection where an <b>autosomal</b> <b>location</b> of male-biased genes is favored since male genes are only exposed to selection one-third of the time when X-linked. However, there are several alternative explanations to “out-of-the-X” gene movement, including mutational bias and a means for X-linked genes to escape meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) during spermatogenesis. As a critical test of the hypothesis that genomic relocation of sex-biased genes is an adaptive process, I examined the emergence, and loss, of genes on the chicken Z-chromosome, i. e., a female heterogametic system (males ZZ, females ZW). Here, the analogous prediction would be an emergence of male-biased genes onto, not a loss from, the Z-chromosome because Z is found more often in males than autosomes are. I found that genes expressed in testis but not in ovary are highly over-represented among genes that have emerged on the Z-chromosome during avian evolution. Moreover, genes with male-biased expression are similarly over-represented among new Z-chromosomal genes. Interestingly, genes with female-biased expression have more often moved from than to the Z-chromosome. These observations show that male and female heterogametic organisms display opposing directionalities in the emergence and loss of sex-biased genes on sex chromosomes. This is consistent with theoretical models on the evolution of sexually antagonistic genes in which new mutations are at least partly dominant...|$|E
50|$|Although X {{chromosomes}} {{have been}} considered as hot spots for accumulating sexually antagonistic alleles, other <b>autosomal</b> <b>locations</b> have also been reported to harbor sexually antagonistic alleles. The XY, XX and ZW, ZZ system of sex determination allows accelerated fixation of alleles that are sex-linked recessive, male-beneficial and female-detrimental due to constant exposure to positive selection acting on heterogametic sex (XY, ZW) as compared to purifying selection removing the alleles only in homozygous state. In case of partial or completely dominant sex linked traits which are detrimental to male, the probability of selecting for the allele would be 2/3 as compared to selecting against probability of 1/3. Considering the above scenario its likely that X and W chromosomes would harbor many sexually antagonistic alleles. However, recently Innocenti et al. identified sexually antagonistic candidate genes in Drosophila melanogaster that contributed about 8% of the total genes. These were distributed on X, second and third chromosomes. Accessory gland proteins which are male biased and shows positive selection reside entirely on autosomes. They are partially sexually antagonistic as they are not expressed in females and dominant in nature and hence under represented on X.|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{elements}} are most {{abundant in the}} mammalian genome, comprising at least 40 - 50 % of the DNA. They are differentiated into two most prominent families: the LINE elements, which are preferentially located in the G-bands, and SINES, which are clustered in the R-bands. We report here a novel mammalian non-L 1 -retroposon, which invaded the genome of Microtus agrestis {{in a very short}} time from an evolutionary viewpoint. No relevant sequence homology could be demonstrated to known sequences in the NCBI database. However, cross-hybridizing sequences exist in the genomes of all other Microtus species analyzed, but not in Mus musculus, indicating the recent evolutionary origin of this element. This retroposon is enriched in the entire heterochromatin of the X and Y chromosomes, but is also interspersed in <b>autosomal</b> <b>locations</b> in euchromatic portions of the genome. We show that the retroposon is heavily transcribed from the heterochromatin during female meiosis prerequisite for the subsequent retrotransposition. The estimated rate of retrotransposition is at least 1 - 2 × 10 - 2 per generation, which is hundred-fold higher than that of the majority of invertebrate retroposons and also higher than the transposition rate of a murine L 1 element, which was calculated to be 3 × 10 - 3 per generation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMSL {{complexes}} bind {{hundreds of}} sites along the single male X chromosome to achieve dosage compensation in Drosophila. Previously, we proposed that ∼ 35 “high-affinity” or “chromatin entry” sites (CES) might nucleate spreading of MSL complexes in cis {{to paint the}} X chromosome. This was based on analysis of the first characterized sites roX 1 and roX 2. roX transgenes attract MSL complex to <b>autosomal</b> <b>locations</b> where it can spread long distances into flanking chromatin. roX 1 and roX 2 also produce noncoding RNA components of the complex. Here we identify a third site from the 18 D 10 region of the X chromosome. Like roX genes, 18 D binds full and partial MSL complexes in vivo and encompasses a male-specific DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS). Unlike roX genes, the 510 bp 18 D site is apparently not transcribed and shows high affinity for MSL complex and spreading only as a multimer. While mapping 18 D, we discovered MSL binding to X cosmids that do not carry one of the ∼ 35 high-affinity sites. Based on additional analyses of chromosomal transpositions, we conclude that spreading in cis from the roX genes or the ∼ 35 originally proposed “entry sites” cannot be the sole mechanism for MSL targeting to the X chromosome...|$|R
40|$|Dosage {{compensation}} in male Drosophila {{relies on}} the X chromosome-specific recruitment of a chromatin-modifying machinery, the dosage compensation complex (DCC). The principles that assure selective targeting of the DCC are unknown. According to a prevalent model, X chromosome targeting is initiated by recruitment of the DCC core components, MSL 1 and MSL 2, to {{a limited number of}} so-called "high-affinity sites" (HAS). Only very few such sites are known at the DNA sequence level, which has precluded the definition of DCC targeting principles. Combining RNA interference against DCC subunits, limited crosslinking, and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to probing high-resolution DNA microarrays, we identified a set of 131 HAS for MSL 1 and MSL 2 and confirmed their properties by various means. The HAS sites are distributed all over the X chromosome and are functionally important, since the extent of dosage compensation of a given gene and its proximity to a HAS are positively correlated. The sites are mainly located on non-coding parts of genes and predominantly map to regions that are devoid of nucleosomes. In contrast, the bulk of DCC binding is in coding regions and is marked by histone H 3 K 36 methylation. Within the HAS, repetitive DNA sequences mainly based on GA and CA dinucleotides are enriched. Interestingly, DCC subcomplexes bind a small number of <b>autosomal</b> <b>locations</b> with similar features...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a screening approach that utilizes an inverse {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) to detect P element insertions in or near previously cloned genes in Drosophila melanogaster. We used this approach {{in a large scale}} genetic screen in which P elements were mobilized from sites on the X chromosome to new <b>autosomal</b> <b>locations.</b> Mutagenized flies were combined in pools, and our screening approach was used to generate probes corresponding to the sequences flanking each site of insertion. These probes then were used for hybridization to cloned genomic intervals, allowing individuals carrying insertions in them to be detected. We used the same approach to perform repeated rounds of sib-selection to generate stable insertion lines. We screened 16, 100 insert bearing individuals and recovered 11 insertions in five intervals containing genes encoding members of the kinesin superfamily in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, we recovered an insertion in the region including the Larval Serum Protein- 2 gene. Examination by Southern hybridization confirms that the lines we recovered represent genuine insertions in the corresponding genomic intervals. Our data indicates that this approach will be very efficient both for P element mutagenesis of new genomic regions and for detection and recovery of ``local'' P element transposition events. In addition, our data constitutes a survey of preferred P element insertion sites in the Drosophila genome and suggests that insertion sites that are mutable at a rate of ~ 10 (- 4) are distributed every 40 - 50 kb...|$|R
