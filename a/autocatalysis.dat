25|$|A {{catalyst}} is {{a substance}} that alters the rate of a chemical reaction but remains chemically unchanged afterwards. The catalyst increases {{the rate of the}} reaction by providing a different reaction mechanism to occur with a lower activation energy. In <b>autocatalysis</b> a reaction product is itself a catalyst for that reaction leading to positive feedback. Proteins that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions are called enzymes. Michaelis–Menten kinetics describe the rate of enzyme mediated reactions. A catalyst does not affect the position of the equilibrium, as the catalyst speeds up the backward and forward reactions equally.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that life initially arose as autocatalytic chemical networks. British ethologist Richard Dawkins wrote about <b>autocatalysis</b> as a potential explanation for {{the origin of life}} in his 2004 book The Ancestor's Tale. In his book, Dawkins cites experiments performed by Julius Rebek, Jr. and his colleagues in which they combined amino adenosine and pentafluorophenyl esters with the autocatalyst amino adenosine triacid ester (AATE). One product was a variant of AATE, which catalyzed the synthesis of themselves. This experiment demonstrated the possibility that autocatalysts could exhibit competition within a population of entities with heredity, which could be interpreted as a rudimentary form of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|One classic study {{involves}} an experiment {{that takes place}} in the laboratory. When sodium chlorate is allowed to crystallize from water and the collected crystals examined in a polarimeter, each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the L form or the D form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of L crystals collected equals the amount of D crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively L or exclusively D. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver D-crystals and 18 others L-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to <b>autocatalysis</b> taking place in the nucleation process.|$|E

Proteins can also be circularly permuted via post-translational modification, without permuting the underlying gene. [...] Circular permutations can happen spontaneously through <b>autocatalysis,</b> {{as in the case}} of concanavalin A. Alternately, permutation may require restriction enzymes and ligases.|$|E
500|$|Teller {{became part}} of the Theoretical (T) Division. He was given a secret {{identity}} of Ed Tilden. He was irked at being passed over as its head; the job was instead given to Hans Bethe. Oppenheimer had him investigate unusual approaches to building fission weapons, such as <b>autocatalysis,</b> in which the efficiency of the bomb would increase as the nuclear chain reaction progressed, but proved to be impractical. He also investigated using uranium hydride instead of uranium metal, but its efficiency turned out to be [...] "negligible or less". He continued to push his ideas for a fusion weapon even though it had been put on a low priority during the war (as the creation of a fission weapon proved to be difficult enough). On a visit to New York, he asked Maria Goeppert-Mayer to carry out calculations on the Super for him. She confirmed Teller's own results: the Super was not going to work.|$|E
500|$|The {{experimental}} {{findings of}} the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment were quickly confirmed, and extended to other hereditary characteristics besides polysaccharide capsules. [...] However, there was considerable reluctance to accept the conclusion that DNA was the genetic material. [...] According to Phoebus Levene's influential [...] "tetranucleotide hypothesis", DNA consisted of repeating units of the four nucleotide bases and had little biological specificity. [...] DNA was therefore {{thought to be the}} structural component of chromosomes, whereas the genes were thought likely to be made of the protein component of chromosomes. [...] This line of thinking was reinforced by the 1935 crystallization of tobacco mosaic virus by Wendell Stanley, and the parallels among viruses, genes, and enzymes; many biologists thought genes might be a sort of [...] "super-enzyme", and viruses were shown according to Stanley to be proteins and to share the property of <b>autocatalysis</b> with many enzymes. [...] Furthermore, few biologists thought that genetics could be applied to bacteria, since they lacked chromosomes and sexual reproduction. [...] In particular, many of the geneticists known informally as the phage group, which would become influential in the new discipline of molecular biology in the 1950s, were dismissive of DNA as the genetic material (and were inclined to avoid the [...] "messy" [...] biochemical approaches of Avery and his colleagues). [...] Some biologists, including fellow Rockefeller Institute Fellow Alfred Mirsky, challenged Avery's finding that the transforming principle was pure DNA, suggesting that protein contaminants were instead responsible. [...] Although transformation occurred in some kinds of bacteria, it could not be replicated in other bacteria (nor in any higher organisms), and its significance seemed limited primarily to medicine.|$|E

The simplest example of <b>autocatalysis</b> is a reaction of type A + B → 2 B, in one or in several steps. The overall reaction is just A → B, so that B is a product. But since B is also a reactant, it may be present in the rate equation and affect the reaction rate. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of B increases and can accelerate the reaction as a catalyst. In effect, the reaction accelerates itself or is autocatalyzed.|$|E
