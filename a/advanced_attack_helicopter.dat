5|$|But as American {{involvement}} in Vietnam was winding down, the Army canceled the Cheyenne program on 9 August 1972. By this time, the AH-1 Cobra was widely deployed by the Army during the Vietnam War and {{equipped with the}} TOW anti-tank missile. Controversy with the United States Air Force over the Cheyenne's role in combat {{as well as the}} political climate regarding military acquisition programs had caused the Army to amend the service's attack helicopter requirements in favor of a twin-engine conventional helicopter, viewed as less technical and more survivable. The Army announced a new program for an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (AAH) on 17 August 1972, which {{led to the development of}} the AH-64 Apache.|$|E
5|$|The Apache {{originally}} {{started as}} the Model 77 developed by Hughes Helicopters for the United States Army's <b>Advanced</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> program {{to replace the}} AH-1 Cobra. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the Bell YAH-63 in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, McDonnell Douglas continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The first production AH-64D Apache Longbow, an upgraded Apache variant, was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by Boeing Defense, Space & Security; over 2,000 AH-64s have been produced to date.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (AAH) was a United States Army {{program to}} develop an {{advanced}} ground attack helicopter beginning in 1972. The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> program followed cancellation of the Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne. After evaluating industry proposals, the AAH competition was reduced to offerings from Bell and Hughes. Following a flight test evaluation of prototypes, Hughes' YAH-64 was selected in December 1976.|$|E
25|$|With the {{reduction}} {{of the size of the}} ROC armed forces in recent years, the Army has endured the largest number of cutbacks as ROC military doctrine has begun to emphasize the importance of offshore engagement with the Navy and Air Force. Subsequent to this shift in emphasis, the ROC Navy and Air Force have taken precedence over the ROC Army in defense doctrine and weapons procurement. Recent short-term goals in the Army include acquisition and development of joint command and control systems, <b>advanced</b> <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> and armored vehicles, Multiple Launch Rocket System and field air defense systems. The Army is also in the process of transitioning to an all volunteer force.|$|R
25|$|Under the Bill Clinton {{administration}} in the 1990s, the US government made efforts to bolster the Israeli government's military edge by allowing it to purchase $700m of the latest U.S. military equipment, including <b>advanced</b> fighters, <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> and the Joint Direct Attack Munition system. A series of major joint military technology development projects was also instituted.|$|R

25|$|The Bell YAH-63 (Model 409) was an {{experimental}} attack helicopter for the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (AAH) competition. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64, later developed into the AH-64 Apache, was selected over Bell's entry.|$|E
25|$|Based on the Model 309 and AH-1 Cobra, Bell derived a new {{prototype}} attack helicopter, the Model 409/YAH-63, for the Army's <b>Advanced</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (AAH) competition {{beginning in}} 1972. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64 was selected over Bell's Model 409/YAH-63 in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the AH-56 Cheyenne the US Army sought an aircraft to fill an anti-armor attack role. The Army wanted an aircraft better than the AH-1 Cobra in firepower, performance and range. It would have the maneuverability to fly nap-of-the-earth (NoE) missions. On 17 August 1972, the Army initiated the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (AAH) program. AAH sought an attack helicopter based on combat experience in Vietnam, with a lower top speed of 145 knots (269km/h) and twin engines for improved survivability. To this end, the US Army issued a Request For Proposals (RFP) for an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (AAH) on 15 November 1972.

Many <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> are also capable of carrying air-to-air missiles, though mostly for purposes of self-defense. Today's <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> has two main roles: first, to provide direct and accurate close air support for ground troops, and the second, in the anti-tank role to destroy enemy armor concentrations. <b>Attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> are also used to supplement lighter helicopters in the armed scout role. In combat, an <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter</b> is projected to destroy around 17 times its own production cost before it is destroyed.|$|R
500|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the AH-56 Cheyenne in 1972, in favor of projects like the U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II and the Marine Corps Harrier, the United States Army sought an aircraft to fill an anti-armor attack role that would still be under Army command. The 1948 Key West Agreement forbade the Army from owning combat fixed-wing aircraft. The Army wanted an aircraft better than the AH-1 Cobra in firepower, performance and range. It would have the maneuverability for terrain following nap-of-the-earth (NoE) flying. To this end, the U.S. Army issued a Request For Proposals (RFP) for an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (AAH) on 15 November 1972. As {{a sign of the}} importance of this project, in September 1973 the Army designated its five most important projects as the [...] "Big Five", with the AAH included.|$|E

2500|$|During the mid-1960s, the United States Army {{initiated}} the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) program, {{which led to}} the development of the Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne for use in the anti-tank gunship role. The US Army pursued the AH-1G HueyCobra as an [...] "interim type" [...] for the [...] "jungle fighting" [...] role. However, the Army's broader concern was the task of protecting Western Europe from the legions of Warsaw Pact armor to the east. The main scenario used by NATO throughout the Cold War was that, if the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact forces were to conduct a massive tank offensive attack on Western Europe, they would probably cross either the Fulda Gap (capturing Frankfurt first and then aiming for the westward bend of the Rhine south of Wiesbaden: a total distance of just 85miles), or cross the North German Plain (see map). The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Attack</b> <b>Helicopter</b> was conceived from the need to defend against such an attack.|$|E
50|$|In the air, <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{armed with}} {{anti-tank}} missiles, {{and one or}} more unarmed, or lightly armed scout helicopters operate in concert. The scout helicopter, flying at low level in a nap-of-the-earth approach, attempts to both locate the enemy armoured columns and to map out approaches and ambush positions for the <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters.</b> Late-model scout helicopters include laser designators to guide missiles fired from the <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters.</b> After finding a target, the scout helicopter can locate it and then direct the <b>attack</b> <b>helicopter's</b> missile where to fire. The <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters</b> have only to rise from cover briefly to fire their missiles before returning to a concealed location. Late-development of <b>attack</b> <b>helicopters,</b> such as the Mil Mi-28N, the Kamov Ka-52, and the AH-64D Longbow, incorporate sensors and command and control systems to relieve the requirement for scout helicopters.|$|R
