30|$|Furthermore, we {{estimate}} fixed effects regression models {{which account for}} anticipation and <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction to <b>job</b> changes independent <b>of</b> a change in self-employment. Due to our data base, anticipation encompasses not only a lookahead to self-employment but also other influences prior to becoming self-employed. Our results show that negative anticipation effects are a general and pronounced effect preceding any change <b>of</b> <b>jobs.</b> Individuals who become self-employed experience less distinctive negative anticipation. A positive effect <b>of</b> self-employment on <b>job</b> satisfaction lasting 3 years {{is also found in}} this model.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{outlined}} {{an adaptation}} procedure for the Job Descriptive Index Subscale of “type of work”. The cross-translation or committee translation procedure asks {{two or more}} translators to translate a text from source to target language, and then an expert assesses the validity of these translations. Empirically, this method has three or more translators translate the instrument from English to Arabic and then an expert assesses the translations made by the three translators. A selection of 180 bilinguals attempt the source language and later attempt the target language instrument or the translated instrument supported by this method. The two versions are then compared through the ANOVA, correlation analyses and factor analyses. The results indicated a high reliability for the Arabic and English versions. The committee translation approach provides a valid method for translation, the results however, showed that the instrument in both languages do not show item-to-item similarity or equivalence.

For this purpose we consider flexibility characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>job</b> and derive hypotheses about which flexibility measures allow for or impede adaptation processes. Hypotheses are tested using data from up to 18 waves of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). We estimate fixed-effects panel models to test adaptation processes based on intra-individual changes in job satisfaction. Our results show no adaptation to rotating shift work, little adaptation to temporary employment, but full adaptation to flextime regulations. job satisfaction, adaptation, hedonic treadmill model, rotating shift work, temporary employment, flextime, British Household Panel Study, fixed-effects panel estimation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Grid {{presents}} a continuously changing environment. It also introduces {{a new set}} of failures. The data grid initiative has made it possible to run data-intensive applications on the grid. Data-intensive grid applications consist of two parts: a data placement part and a computation part. The data placement part is responsible for transferring the input data to the compute node and the result of the computation to the appropriate storage system. While work has been done on making computation adapt to changing conditions, little work has been done on making the data placement adapt to changing conditions. In this work, we have developed an infrastructure which observes the environment and enables run-time <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> data placement <b>jobs.</b> We have enabled Stork, a scheduler for data placement jobs in heterogeneous environments like the grid, to use this infrastructure and adapt the data placement job to the environment just before execution.

40|$|Motivated by {{applications}} in batch scheduling <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> in manufacturing systems and distributed computing, we study two related problems. Given {{is a set}} <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> {J 1, [...] ., Jn}, where Jj has the processing time pj, and an undirected intersection graph G = ({ 1, 2, [...] ., n}, E), with an edge (i, j) whenever the pair <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> Ji and Jj cannot be processed in the same batch.

The goal is to minimize the sum <b>of</b> <b>job</b> completion times. Our two problems differ {{in the definition of}} completion time <b>of</b> a <b>job</b> within a given batch.

The algorithms are of widely different genres (LP, greedy, subgraph covering), yet they curiously share a common feature in their use of randomized geometric partitioning. ...|$|R
40|$|Workload Control (WLC) is a {{production}} planning and control concept which {{is suitable for}} the needs <b>of</b> make-to-order <b>job</b> shops.

However a detailed analysis also reveals that the reduction is realized at the cost of extreme delays for a small set <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> with high processing time requirements.

When order routings are long or assembly structures exist, performance problems arise in the application <b>of</b> traditional <b>job</b> shop control concepts based on workload control (WLC). This paper investigates how to adapt the WLC concept to the needs <b>of</b> these <b>job</b> shops. A first review of literature provides only few studies considering long or assembly type routings. Consequently field research is executed, analyzing and capitalizing the influences of a control approach applied in a successful company. The derived guidelines for <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> the WLC concept aim at improving the synergy between controlled release, to avoid irresolvable delays at early stages, and priority dispatching at later stages of the long order routings.

Methods: A general demographic information questionnaire, job adaptation obstacle scale and perceived social support scale were used to investigate 290 community nurses in Changchun. Results: The score <b>of</b> <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> obstacle was 20. 85 ± 5. 18; the score of perceived social support was 64. 25 ± 10. 32, the score of support in the family was 20. 01 ± 3. 58, and the score of the support out of family was 42. 57 ± 6. 86; the job adaptation obstacle was negatively correlated with the perceived social support, the support in the family, and the support out of family. Conclusion: The <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> situation <b>of</b> the nurses in the survey communities was generally poor and the perceived social support was at a moderate level. Therefore, community nursing managers should actively understand the situation <b>of</b> nurse <b>job</b> <b>adaptation,</b> and then take effective measures to improve the community nurses social support, improve the current situation <b>of</b> the poor <b>job</b> <b>adaptation</b> <b>of</b> the community nurses, and prevent loss of nursing talents, for the improvement of the quality of nursing service...|$|R
