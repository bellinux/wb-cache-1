50|$|Leyritz {{was also}} <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte's</b> {{personal}} catcher in 1995-96 {{and again in}} 1999-2000.|$|R
50|$|This was <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte's</b> 19th {{career and}} final postseason win and Mariano Rivera's 41st postseason save; both are all-time postseason {{pitching}} records. Also, {{this was the}} 11th straight postseason loss for the Twins and eighth straight postseason loss against the Yankees.|$|R
50|$|On February 16, the Yankees signed pitcher Jared Burton to a {{minor league}} {{contract}} and invited him to spring training. In February, the Yankees announced they will retire Bernie Williams number 51 on May 24, Jorge Posada's number 20 on August 22, and <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte's</b> number 46 on August 23.|$|R
5|$|Hughes first {{committed}} to Santa Clara University, but {{he chose to}} sign with the New York Yankees when they selected {{him in the first}} round, with the 23rd overall selection, of the 2004 Major League Baseball draft. The Yankees were awarded this pick as compensation when free agent pitcher <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> signed with the Houston Astros.|$|E
5|$|Several {{records were}} tied, extended, or broken during this World Series, {{including}} team championships (Yankees with 27), career postseason wins (<b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> with 18), career World Series saves (Mariano Rivera with 11), career World Series home runs (Chase Utley with seven), {{home runs in}} a postseason series (Chase Utley with five), strikeouts by a hitter in a World Series (Ryan Howard with 13), and runs batted in in a single World Series game (Hideki Matsui with six).|$|E
5|$|The Orioles {{reached the}} playoffs {{for the first time since}} 1997, {{claiming}} one of the AL Wild Card spots and defeating the Rangers in the 2012 AL Wild Card Game. In Game 2 of the 2012 AL Division Series (ALDS) against the Yankees, Davis had a two-run single against <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> in the Orioles' 32 victory. Those were his only RBI of the series; he had four hits in 20 at bats as the Yankees defeated the Orioles in five games.|$|E
2500|$|After {{losing its}} Major League Baseball {{broadcast}} rights again, {{this time to}} Fox, ABC counterprogrammed against Fox's postseason coverage by airing a mix of miniseries and TV-movies aimed at female viewers. [...] One of the movies aired on ABC, Unforgiven, aired opposite <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte's</b> shutout in Game 5 of the 1996 World Series (Fox's first World Series, and the final game in Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium history).|$|R
50|$|Looking to clinch, the Yankees scored {{first on}} a Bernie Williams solo {{home run in}} the second inning. In the bottom half, however with runners on second and third and two outs, <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte's</b> fielding error on Al Leiter's bunt attempt allowed the Mets to tie the game. Benny Agbayani's RBI single then put them up 2-1. In the top of the sixth, Derek Jeter homered to tie the game at 2-2.|$|R
25|$|Pettitte was 19–10 with a 3.83 ERA and 173 {{strikeouts in}} the postseason (1995–2003, 2005, 2007, 2009–2010), with the most postseason wins in MLB history. He also holds the all-time postseason record for most starts (42) and innings pitched {{in the postseason}} (263). He was the second {{starting}} pitcher in history to win three series-clinching games (ALDS, ALCS and World Series) in the same postseason (2009). Derek Lowe did the same in 2004, but {{with one of the}} wins in relief, and additionally, Pettitte won the regular season game in which the Yankees clinched the division. When Pettitte started Game 3 of the 2009 World Series, he passed Christy Mathewson and Waite Hoyt, with the second most World Series starts. Whitey Ford is in front with 22 starts. Pettitte has played in 8 different World Series (7 with the Yankees, and one with the Astros), and been on the winning end of 19 postseason series– both of which are tops among active players. <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte's</b> final postseason appearance was on Saturday, October 13, 2012 which was game one of the 2012 ALCS. Pettitte received a no decision in the game which the Yankees would lose in 12 innings.|$|R
5|$|Before the 2004 season began, the Houston Astros signed <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> {{to boost}} their {{starting}} rotation. As a result, Robertson found himself battling with Tim Redding, Jared Fernandez, Carlos Hernández and Brandon Duckworth for the final spot in the rotation. After Roger Clemens was signed as well, the Astros decided before spring training began that Robertson would pitch out of the bullpen for the season. By the end of spring training, Robertson failed to crack the bullpen, and was to be demoted to the Zephyrs. On March 31, just before the season started, the Astros traded Robertson to the Cleveland Indians for Luke Scott and Willy Taveras.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{defeated}} the Phillies, four games to two, {{to win the}} franchise's record 27th World Series championship. The Yankees had home field advantage for the series, due to an American League victory in the 2009 All-Star Game. In addition to the 27th championship for New York, several records were tied, extended, or broken during the Series, including postseason wins (<b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> with 18), home runs in a World Series (Utley with 5), strikeouts by a batter in a World Series (Howard with 13), World Series saves (Mariano Rivera with 11), and RBI in a single World Series game (Hideki Matsui with 6).|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{made the}} game closer {{in the top}} of the sixth inning, as Chase Utley drew a walk and Ryan Howard {{followed}} him with a two-run home run, bringing the score to 7–3. After Raúl Ibañez hit a double into right field, Joba Chamberlain relieved <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> and closed the sixth without scoring. Chan Ho Park came in for Happ, ending any Yankees threat that inning. Chamberlain was relieved by Dámaso Marte {{in the top of}} the seventh after allowing two baserunners, but Marte struck out Utley to end the inning scoreless. After Park allowed a single to Rodriguez, Scott Eyre replaced him. Eyre allowed Rodriguez to steal second and intentionally walked Jorge Posada but escaped the inning without allowing a run.|$|E
50|$|After {{dropping}} the first 2 games of a 3-game series to the Texas Rangers, the Yankees salvaged {{the final game}} 18-7 before losing the first two of a four-game series to the Red Sox 7-0 and 6-4. With Mike Mussina on the hill for game 3, they would rebound behind his 6 shutout innings to barely win 2-1 and then earn a split when rookie Brett Gardner hit a game-winning single {{in the bottom of}} the 10th inning for a 5-4 victory. In an important 2-game series against the Rays, they would win the first game 5-0 behind <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte's</b> stellar pitching performance and then complete the sweep on Bobby Abreu's game-winning double. The Yankees would go to Pittsburgh to play a make-up interleague game against the Pirates and lose 2-4. Next, they traveled to Toronto to play three against the Blue Jays. They would be shut out by Roy Halladay in the opener, getting only two hits but then they rebounded and won their next game 9-4 behind home runs by Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. It was their 50th win of the season. After the game, the Yankees learned that former broadcaster Bobby Murcer died of cancer. After losing 4-1 to the Blue Jays on Sunday, the Yankees head into the All-Star break 6 games behind the Red Sox in the AL East and 5½ games behind the Rays in the Wild Card race. After the break, Yankees won 8 in a row including back to back sweeps of the Twins and A's, extending their winning streak to 10 games at home. After defeating the Boston Red Sox 1-0 in Joba Chamberlain's first career start at Fenway Park, the Yankees acquired Pittsburgh Pirates corner outfielder Xavier Nady and left-handed reliever Dámaso Marte for four minor league prospects. The Yankees then traded Kyle Farnsworth to the Detroit Tigers for catcher Iván Rodríguez.|$|R
5|$|Nick Swisher {{opened the}} top of the fifth inning with a double and scored on a single to center field by <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte.</b> This was Pettitte's first career postseason RBI and the first RBI by a Yankees pitcher in a World Series since Jim Bouton in 1964. Derek Jeter {{followed}} Pettitte with another single, and both runners scored on a two-run double by Johnny Damon. Cole Hamels then walked Teixeira and was relieved by J.A. Happ. Happ closed out the fifth without allowing further scoring, but Nick Swisher added to the Yankees lead with a solo home run off of him in the sixth. Werth hit his second solo home run of the game leading off the bottom of the sixth to close the Yankees lead to 6–4, becoming the second Phillies player to hit multiple home runs in this World Series.|$|E
25|$|On January 26, the Yankees re-signed <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> to a 1-year deal worth $5.5 million {{contract}} with performance-based incentives.|$|E
25|$|On November 6, Roger Clemens and <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> {{filed for}} free agency on Monday, {{five days before}} the Nov. 11 deadline.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 2013, both <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> and Mariano Rivera were {{included}} in the roll call, despite Pettitte being the starting pitcher and Rivera being a relief pitcher.|$|E
25|$|The Yankees won Game 3 behind 6 gritty innings from <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte,</b> {{coupled with}} the first instant replay-overturned home run in World Series history by Alex Rodriguez and homers from Nick Swisher and Matsui.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{had also}} {{developed}} an excellent pitching staff, anchored by Roy Oswalt, <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte,</b> Roger Clemens (who had a league-low ERA of only 1.87), and Brandon Backe. Rookie starters Ezequiel Astacio and Wandy Rodríguez were also successful.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 2002, {{he became}} the fifth Royal in club history to record a {{straight}} steal of home and the first since Fred Patek versus Minnesota on June 18, 1977, with a stolen base off the New York Yankee's <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte.</b> His stolen base came on a 1-2 count with left-hander Aaron Guiel at the plate and gave the Royals a 2-1 lead, but KC lost the game 3-2 in 14 innings.|$|E
25|$|Clemens faced steroid {{scrutiny}} when it {{was reported}} that pitcher Jason Grimsley had named him, as well as <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte,</b> as a user of performance-enhancing drugs. According to a 20-page search warrant affidavit signed by IRS Special Agent Jeff Novitzky, Grimsley told investigators he obtained amphetamines, anabolic steroids and human growth hormone from someone recommended to him by former Yankees trainer Brian McNamee. McNamee was a personal strength coach for Clemens and Pettitte, hired by Clemens in 1998. At the time of the Grimsley revelations, McNamee denied knowledge of steroid use by Clemens and Pettitte. Despite initial media reports, the affidavit made no mention of Clemens or Pettitte.|$|E
25|$|The Angels {{returned}} the favor in Game 3 with a walk-off win of their own. Vladimir Guerrero hit a huge game tying two-run homer off <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> with two {{out in the}} bottom of the 6th, and Jeff Mathis laced a game-winning RBI double {{in the bottom of}} the 11th to win the game for the Angels, 5-4. This came after a controversial decision from manager Joe Girardi to lift David Robertson for Alfredo Aceves with two out and no one on in the 11th. Aceves served up a single to Howie Kendrick, followed by the Mathis double. Four solo home runs accounted for the Yankees' scoring, hit by Derek Jeter, Rodriguez, Johnny Damon and Jorge Posada.|$|E
25|$|Clemens {{came out}} of retirement, signing a one-year deal with his adopted {{hometown}} Houston Astros on January 12, , joining close friend and former Yankees teammate <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte.</b> On May 5, , Clemens recorded his 4,137th career strikeout to place him second on the all-time list behind Nolan Ryan. He was named the starter for the National League All-Star team but ultimately was the losing pitcher in that game after allowing six runs on five hits including a three run home run to Alfonso Soriano. Clemens finished the season with 4,317 career strikeouts, and his 18–4 record gave him a career record of 328–164. After the season he won his seventh Cy Young Award, extending his record number of awards, and also becoming the oldest player ever to win the Cy Young at age 42. This {{made him one of}} six pitchers to win the award in both leagues, joining Gaylord Perry, Pedro Martínez, and Randy Johnson and later joined by Roy Halladay and Max Scherzer.|$|E
25|$|Martínez's {{record was}} 18–6, but {{could have been}} even better. In his six losses, Martínez had 60 strikeouts, 8 walks, and 30 hits allowed in 48 innings, with a 2.44 ERA and an 0.79 WHIP, while {{averaging}} 8 innings per start. Martínez's ERA in his losing games was less than the leading ERA total in the lower-scoring National League (Kevin Brown's 2.58). The Yankees' <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> outdueled Martínez twice; Martínez's other four losses were each by one run. Martínez's first loss {{of the year was}} a 1–0 complete game in which he had 17 strikeouts and 1 walk. All of Martínez's losses were quality starts, and he pitched 8 or more innings in all but one of his losses. Martínez received 2 runs or fewer of run support in 10 of his starts (over one third of his starts), in which his ERA was a minuscule 1.25 with 4 complete games and 2 shutouts, but his win-loss record was 4–5.|$|E
25|$|Wakefield {{entered his}} 16th {{season with the}} Boston Red Sox in 2010. He began {{the year in the}} {{starting}} rotation until Daisuke Matsuzaka came off the disabled list. He later rejoined the rotation due to an injury to Josh Beckett. On May 12, Wakefield recorded his 2000th career strikeout against Vernon Wells of the Toronto Blue Jays in a 3-2 loss. He joined Jamie Moyer, Javier Vázquez, and <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> as the only active pitchers with at least 2000 career strikeouts. On June 8, Wakefield passed Roger Clemens for the most innings pitched by a Red Sox pitcher. He went on to win that game 3-2 over the Cleveland Indians. On June 13, Wakefield joined Moyer and Pettitte as the only active pitchers with 3,000 innings pitched. He accomplished this feat by retiring Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies on a fly ball to left. On July 2, he surpassed Clemens for another record, this for starts at Fenway; he went 8 innings to win 3-2 over the Baltimore Orioles.|$|E
25|$|After two fairly {{successful}} seasons {{without a}} playoff appearance, at midseason in 2004 the Astros were floundering. Before the season, the Astros had added star pitchers <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> and Roger Clemens {{to a team}} that already included stars like Lance Berkman and Jeff Kent {{as well as the}} nucleus of Bagwell and Biggio. They were quickly anointed one of the favorites to win the National League. However, at the All-Star Break, they were 4444 largely due to an inability to score runs, and a poor record in 1-run games. After being booed at the 2004 All-Star Game held at Minute Maid Park while serving as a coach for the National League, Williams was fired and replaced by Phil Garner, who had been a star for the Astros' second division winner in 1986. Though many people were highly skeptical of Garner, who had a mediocre track record in his prior managerial stints in Milwaukee and Detroit, with only one winning season at either stop (in 1992), the team responded to Garner, who led the team to a 46–26 record in the second half and the National League's Wild Card. They would go on to win their first playoff series in eight attempts, beating the Braves in five games of the National League Division Series to advance to the National League Championship Series for the third time. However, they would lose to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games, most dramatically on a walk-off home run by Jim Edmonds in the twelfth inning of Game 6.|$|E
500|$|This {{game was}} the first Game6 in a World Series since the 2003 World Series six years earlier, the longest such gap {{in the history of}} the World Series. Prior to the game, Mary J. Blige, a Bronx native, {{performed}} [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner". <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> started on three days rest, the third straight game in which the Yankees fielded a pitcher on short rest. The Phillies started Pedro Martínez, who called himself and opposing pitcher <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> [...] "old goats" [...] and acknowledged that Red Sox fans were rooting for him: [...] "I know that they don't like the Yankees to win, not even in Nintendo games." ...|$|E
500|$|In August, Thome broke a bone in {{his right}} hand and spent several weeks on the {{disabled}} list, missing 35 games. He finished the year with 30 home runs and 85 RBIs while posting a [...]293 batting average. In Game 3 of the AL Championship Series against the New York Yankees, he hit two home runs off <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> en route to a 6–1 Cleveland victory. Cleveland subsequently lost the series to the Yankees.|$|E
500|$|The Yankees {{promoted}} Jeter to the Greensboro Hornets of the Class A South Atlantic League (SAL) to {{give him}} more at-bats. He batted [...]247 in his first 11 games with Greensboro, and struggled defensively, making nine errors in 48 chances. Weighing , Jeter had a scrawny appearance that did not match his reputation as the Yankees' future leader. Jorge Posada and <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte,</b> who played for the Hornets that season, at first questioned the hype surrounding Jeter, but recognized his talent and poise.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of Héctor Sánchez, Whiteside did not expect to return to the Giants after 2012. [...] "I didn't really think I'd be back with the Giants. Love that team and love that organization. They've got a good thing going there. Good group of guys and I've enjoyed the time I've spent there." [...] On November 5, 2012, Whiteside was claimed off waivers by the New York Yankees, agreeing to terms with them on a one-year contract worth $625,000 in the Major Leagues and $200,000 in the Minors on November 26. [...] Just two days later, the Yankees designated Whiteside for assignment to make room for <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte.</b> On December 3, he was claimed off waivers by the Toronto Blue Jays.|$|E
500|$|The Yankees' {{victory was}} {{credited}} {{to a number}} of different sources. Many players drew praise for their performances, including Series MVP Hideki Matsui; free agents signed the previous offseason including Mark Teixeira, CC Sabathia, and A. J. Burnett; and the so-called [...] "Core Four" [...] of Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte,</b> and Jorge Posada, who had all played a large role in the Yankees' past success in the 1990s. Manager Joe Girardi was also credited for his management of the team, particularly in his decision to use only three starting pitchers in the Yankees postseason starting rotation. The Yankees were the first team to use only three starters in a World Series since the San Diego Padres in the 1998 Series.|$|E
500|$|After an 80-minute rain delay, the Phillies scored {{first in}} the second inning with Jayson Werth's lead-off home run {{followed}} by a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly. In the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez hit a ball down the right field line, which struck a camera at the fence and was ruled a home run after review. Nick Swisher opened the top of the fifth inning with a double and scored on a single to center field by <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte.</b> Jeter followed with a single, and both he and Pettite were driven in by a Johnny Damon double. J. A. Happ replaced Hamels and [...] allowed a solo home run to Swisher in the sixth inning. Werth answered with a second home run of the game leading off the bottom of the sixth. Mariano Rivera recorded his 38th career postseason save to close out the Yankees' second consecutive win.|$|E
500|$|Before the 2005 season, Lieber {{signed as}} a free agent with the Philadelphia Phillies for three years and $24 million with a team option for the fourth year. He was named the Phillies' Opening Day starter in 2005. He won his first four starts with the team. From May 12 through June 30, Lieber had a 37 record and a 7.48 ERA. 88 by the end of that stretch, he managed to post a 95 record and a 3.32 ERA to finish the season. Lieber gave up one run in eight innings on July 21 but took the loss as the Los Angeles Dodgers {{defeated}} the Phillies 10. On September 22, he threw eight shutout innings in a 40 victory over the Braves. Lieber finished the season with a 1713 record, a 4.20 ERA, 149 strikeouts, 41 walks, and 223 hits allowed in [...] innings pitched. Lieber led the team with 17 wins, which tied with <b>Andy</b> <b>Pettitte</b> for fifth in the league. He tied with six other pitchers for the league lead with 35 starts.|$|E
