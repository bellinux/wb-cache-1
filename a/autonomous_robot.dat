30|$|Indoor {{iterative}} localization algorithm of <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> is {{an active}} subject because of the environmental complexity. The coordinates of <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> are the fundamental parameters of robot control [1]. Due {{to the absence of}} Global Positioning System signals in an indoor-like environment, the <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> need an iterative localization algorithm to provide their position information. Laser, sonar, infrared, visual sensors, or some combinations of these methods are used to locate the robots [2]. However, those technologies may fail in some harsh environments, such as a firing building which is dusty, smoky, and dark.|$|R

2500|$|A {{self-replicating}} {{machine is}} a type of <b>autonomous</b> <b>robot</b> that is capable of reproducing itself autonomously using raw materials found in the environment, thus exhibiting self-replication in a way analogous to that found in nature. The concept of self-replicating machines has been advanced and examined by Homer Jacobsen, Edward F. Moore, Freeman Dyson, John von Neumann and in more recent times by K. Eric Drexler in his book on nanotechnology, Engines of Creation (coining the term clanking replicator [...] for such machines) and by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle in their review Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines which provided the first comprehensive analysis of the entire replicator design space. The future development of such technology {{is an integral part of}} several plans involving the mining of moons and asteroid belts for ore and other materials, the creation of lunar factories, and even the construction of solar power satellites in space. The possibly misnamed von Neumann probe is one theoretical example of such a machine. Von Neumann also worked on what he called the universal constructor, a self-replicating machine that would operate in a cellular automata environment.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the possible limits of reactive control architectures for <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots,</b> {{in terms of}} their non-linear dynamics. This validates work [Gat 94] which has suggested that such systems can manifest chaotic dynamics in their response to unstructured environments. Our work has involved two parallel activities, the first being research and development of two B 12 robots, which use a Behaviour Synthesis Architecture, (B. S. A) for reactive control, [Barnes et al 93], while the second has been studies of this behavioural control using a dynamic simulator of the B. S. A system, [Eustace 94]. Results from the simulation are presented which appear to confirm Gat's hypothesis that <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots</b> can display sensitivity to initial conditions, and which display a fractal structure in the system dynamics. From these results we offer several conclusions regarding the control of <b>autonomous</b> <b>robots.</b> Keywords Mobile <b>Robots,</b> <b>Autonomous</b> systems, <b>Robot</b> Dynamics, Robot Control.
