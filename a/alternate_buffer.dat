25|$|In practice, PCR {{can fail}} for various reasons, {{in part due}} to its {{sensitivity}} to contamination causing amplification of spurious DNA products. Because of this, a number of techniques and procedures have been developed for optimizing PCR conditions. Contamination with extraneous DNA is addressed with lab protocols and procedures that separate pre-PCR mixtures from potential DNA contaminants. This usually involves spatial separation of PCR-setup areas from areas for analysis or purification of PCR products, use of disposable plasticware, and thoroughly cleaning the work surface between reaction setups. Primer-design techniques are important in improving PCR product yield and in avoiding the formation of spurious products, and the usage of <b>alternate</b> <b>buffer</b> components or polymerase enzymes can help with amplification of long or otherwise problematic regions of DNA. Addition of reagents, such as formamide, in buffer systems may increase the specificity and yield of PCR. Computer simulations of theoretical PCR results (Electronic PCR) may be performed to assist in primer design.|$|E
40|$|A design {{approach}} to formatting multispectral image data {{in real time}} at very high data rates is presented for future onboard processing applications. The approach employs a microprocessor-based <b>alternating</b> <b>buffer</b> memory configuration whose formatting function is completely programmable. Data are read from an output buffer in the desired format by applying the proper sequence of addresses to the buffer via a lookup table memory. Sensor data can be processed using this approach at rates limited by the buffer memory access time and the buffer switching process delay time. This design offers flexible high speed data processing and benefits from continuing increases {{in the performance of}} digital memories...|$|R

40|$|Ion {{channels}} are membrane proteins responsible for an enormous range of biological functions. Ion selectivity and permeation {{are based on}} simple laws of physics and chemistry. Ion {{channels are}} therefore ideal candidates for physical investigation. A reduced model generates the selectivity of voltage-gated L-type calcium channel under {{a wide range of}} ionic conditions using only two parameters with unchanging values. The reasons behind the success of this reduced model are investigated. Monte Carlo simulations are performed investigating the role of flexibility of the side chains in the selectivity of calcium channels under a wide range of ionic conditions. Results suggest that the exact location and mobility of oxygen ions have little effect on the selectivity behavior of calcium channels. The first order determinant of selectivity in calcium channels is the density of charge in the selectivity filter. Flexibility seems a second order determinant. Single channel planar lipid bilayer experiments are performed to determine the selectivity, permeation, and sialic acid specificity of a bacterial outer-membrane channel NanC of Ecoli. NanC exhibits a large unit conductance varying with the applied voltage polarity, anion selectivity, and voltage gating. Unitary conductance of NanC decreases significantly in presence of the <b>buffer</b> HEPES. <b>Alternate</b> <b>buffers</b> are tested. Results suggest that the sialic acid specificity of NanC should be performed in low concentration salt solutions without pH buffers adjusted to neutral pH 7. 0. Neu 5 Ac changes the gating and considerably increases the ionic conductance of NanC. The effect of Neu 5 Ac on the unitary current through NanC saturates at higher Neu 5 Ac concentrations. Interestingly, Neu 5 Ac reduces the ionic conductance of OmpF: frequent, long closures are seen. Thus, in E. coli sialic acid translocation is specifically facilitated by NanC, and not by OmpF...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{circuit design}} of buffered routing switches in symmetrical, island-style FPGAs. The effects of switch size, tile length, level-restoring, and slow input slew rates are examined. Two new fanin-based switch designs {{are used to}} eliminate {{nearly all of the}} increase in delay that arises from fanout with a previous switch design. <b>Alternating</b> between <b>buffers</b> and pass transistors is shown to improve connection delay without fanout by 25 %. To take advantage of this, we propose schemes to replace some buffers with pass transistors to simultaneously reduce area and delay. Routing a suite of MCNC benchmark circuits shows that 14 % in area  delay, or 7 % in delay can be saved using the new switch schemes. Alternatively, approximately 13 % in area can be saved with no degradation to delay. 1...|$|R
50|$|Amber (390538-03) {{was used}} in the A3000(T) and on the A2320 flicker fixer {{expansion}} for the A2000. Amber <b>buffers</b> <b>alternate</b> video fields in three 256K×4 field memory chips (OKI MSM514221) to convert interlaced output to progressive format ('weaving') at 31 kHz, twice the normal scan frequency. Amber can accurately sample Lores and Hires modes but drops every other horizontal pixel in SuperHires (35 ns pixels) mode (for simplicity, it always runs in Hires mode). Non 15 kHz modes are automatically bypassed to the monitor without buffering or changing frequencies. Amber was also designed to work without expensive field memory as a simple scan doubler, but has not been marketed that way.|$|R
40|$|Piezoelectric {{injectors}} {{allow to}} inject precise proportional quantities of fuel at extremely high speed. Controlled by pulses {{from the engine}} management unit, they work like solenoid valves, opening and closing back very rapidly, spraying the exact quantity of fuel determined by the injection computer into the engine combustion chambers. However, {{for this type of}} injectors an impulse of a hundred volts is applied in order to actuate them. This is a big concern in automotive environment, where the 12 V battery voltages is still the main power source available. Therefore, a power converter is needed to interface battery voltage and piezo actuator; for mechanical and electrical reasons (weight, dimensions and power losses) a switching amplifier is preferred with respect to linear amplifier, especially for this type of applications where efficiency and weight are the main issues. Fig. 1 presents a switching amplifier for piezo actuator: it consists of two components, a unidirectional DC/DC converter with a small input power that loads a large buffer capacitor and a bidirectional DC/DC converter, which controls the energy <b>alternating</b> between the <b>buffer</b> capacitor and the piezo actuator. The requirements on the unidirectional DC/DC converter are few. It only needs to compensate for the power losses of the two stages plus the energy dissipated in the actuator and the connected mechanical system [6]. Conventional DC/DC boost converter is not the best solution in piezoelectric based applications where a high step up ratio (more than 20) and high efficiency power conversion is required. Flyback converter could be an alternative topology but presents high switching losses and it has an insulated output, so not compliant with electrical load specification. An efficient high-step up DC/DC converter is presented for interfacing the standard 12 V battery with the high voltage DC-bus used for piezoelectric actuators system. In the proposed converter, two coupled inductor boost converters are interleaved and controlled by an FPGA. Different types of control techniques could be used to limit the input current [7]; the solution presented herein allows fast transient response and best performances with respect to traditional control techniques. Moreover the implemented technique has the advantages of lower electromagnetic emission and higher operating frequency capability, compared to the standard fixed frequency control; on the other hand it is difficult to design the EMI filter due to the intrinsic variable frequency. The high computational load of the control algorithms forces the use of an FPGA implementation in order to achieve the desired accuracy in real time control at the frequency of the PWM signal needs for the DC/DC converter, which will be 200 kHz. Design and analysis of the proposed converter are presented. Finally, experimental results are reported in order to validate the proposed converte...|$|R
