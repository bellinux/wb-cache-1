5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers felt strongly about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E

5|$|Following President John F. Kennedy's September 1962 speech, {{in which}} he {{described}} his goal of accomplishing a manned space flight to the moon {{by the end of}} the decade, the space program grew in importance and scope in Central Florida because of its proximity to Cape Canaveral. Prominent residents and local leaders began lobbying the Florida State Legislature to increase <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> on the Space Coast. With the help of former State Senate President William A. Shands and Senator Beth Johnson, the legislature passed and Governor Farris Bryant signed into law Senate Bill No. 125 on June 10, 1963, which authorized the Florida Board of Regents to create a new state university in East Central Florida. The university was founded as a non-segregated and coeducational university, with the mission of educating students for promising space-age careers in engineering and other technological professions.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{influential}} factor shaping this new class was the competitive nature of scholarly candidates entering civil service through the imperial examinations. Although not all scholar-officials came from the landholding class, sons of prominent landholders had better <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> and thus greater ability to pass examinations for government service. Gaining a scholarly degree by passing prefectural, circuit-level, or palace exams in the Song period {{was the most important}} prerequisite in being considered for appointment, especially to higher posts; this was a departure from the Tang period, when the examination system was enacted on a much smaller scale. A higher degree attained through the three levels of examinations meant a greater chance of obtaining higher offices in government. Not only did this ensure a higher salary, but also greater social prestige, visibly distinguished by dress. This institutionalized distinction of scholar-officials by dress included the type and even color of traditional silken robes, hats, and girdles, demarcating that scholar-official's level of administrative authority. This rigid code of dress was especially enforced during the beginning of the dynasty, although the prestigious clothing color of purple slowly began to diffuse through the ranks of middle and low grade officials.|$|E

30|$|Income per se (i.e., not parental {{education}} and not ethnicity or urbanity or {{the host of}} other demographic factors) was also associated with early science achievement.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the reasons why women choose <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> in the twenty first century. It uses a feminist {{research}} lens, noting that women are newcomers <b>to</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> since it was only in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that women began <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> as a direct result of active feminist campaigning and their determination. Their determination is underscored by the reasons identified for their choice <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education.</b> These include, among others, the need to develop their socialisation capabilities and their aspiration to be liberated from been tagged ‘domestic engineers’. This paper, leaning on the gender–inclusive culture conceptual framework and extensive reviewed literature, also suggest that <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> has a direct impact on women's empowerment as it creates in them an awareness of their rights, their capabilities and the choices and opportunities available to them...|$|R
