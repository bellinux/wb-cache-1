Ultimately, however, <b>a</b> <b>seventh</b> game was needed, and thus ABC did not air the final two episodes of the series.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> supermajor <b>seventh</b> is <b>an</b> {{interval}} intermediate between <b>a</b> major <b>seventh</b> and <b>an</b> augmented <b>seventh.</b> It is {{the inverse}} of a subminor second.

5000|$|The diminished seventh chord {{normally}} {{possesses a}} [...] "dominant" [...] function, {{and this is}} most straightforwardly shown when the root of <b>a</b> dominant <b>seventh</b> chord is omitted. The remaining third, fifth and seventh of that chord form a diminished triad (whose new root is the third of the former chord), to which <b>a</b> diminished <b>seventh</b> can be added. Thus in C (major or minor), <b>a</b> dominant <b>seventh</b> chord consisting of G, B, D, F can be replaced by <b>a</b> diminished <b>seventh</b> chord B, D, F, A. (In jazz harmony, {{a combination of the}} original chord with its substitute (with G in the bass and A simultaneously in an upper voice) yields the very common [...] "79" [...] chord, which intensifies the dominant function of either <b>a</b> diminished <b>seventh</b> or dominant seventh chord.) Other transformations of this kind facilitate a variety of substitutions and modulations: any of the four notes in <b>a</b> diminished <b>seventh</b> chord are raised by a semi-tone, that raised note is then the flat-seventh of <b>a</b> half-diminished <b>seventh</b> chord. Similarly, if any of the four notes in the diminished seventh chord are lowered by a semi-tone, that lowered note is then the root of <b>a</b> dominant <b>seventh</b> chord.|$|R

5000|$|Adding <b>a</b> minor <b>seventh</b> to <b>a</b> major triad creates <b>a</b> {{dominant}} <b>seventh</b> (denoted V7). In music theory, the [...] "dominant seventh" [...] {{described here}} is called <b>a</b> major-minor <b>seventh,</b> emphasizing the chord's construction {{rather than its}} usual function. Dominant sevenths are often the dominant chords in three-chord progressions, in which they increase the tension with the tonic [...] "already inherent in the dominant triad".|$|R
5000|$|In {{classical}} music from Western culture, <b>a</b> diminished <b>seventh</b> (...) is <b>an</b> interval produced by narrowing <b>a</b> minor <b>seventh</b> by <b>a</b> chromatic semitone. For instance, the interval from A to G is <b>a</b> minor <b>seventh,</b> ten semitones wide, {{and both the}} intervals from A to G, and from A to G are diminished sevenths, spanning nine semitones. Being diminished, it is considered a dissonant interval.|$|R

After he becomes an apprentice to the arch ("ExtraOrdinary") wizard of the series, Marcia Overstrand, he must study for seven years and a day until his apprenticeship ends. In the first book, he is known as Young Army Expendable Boy 412, until his great-aunt, Zelda Zanuba Heap reveals his true identity. His adventures are placed {{in the context of}} the warmth and strength of his family, and developed alongside those of Jenna, his adoptive sister, who is heir to the throne of the Castle, the community where they live. The novels, set in an elaborate fantastic world, describe the many challenges that Septimus and his friends must overcome.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme and}} its broken seventh chord (G-B-D-F) which {{characterize}} this movement is stated first as <b>a</b> major <b>seventh</b> {{in the two}} first passages of the first section A with a discreet accompaniment.

50|$|In {{classical}} music from Western culture, <b>an</b> augmented <b>seventh</b> is <b>an</b> interval produced by widening <b>a</b> major <b>seventh</b> by <b>a</b> chromatic semitone. For instance, the interval from C to B is <b>a</b> major <b>seventh,</b> eleven semitones wide, {{and both the}} intervals from C to B, and from C to B are augmented sevenths, spanning twelve semitones. Being augmented, it is classified as a dissonant interval. However, it is enharmonically equivalent to the perfect octave.|$|R
5000|$|Frequent {{use of the}} {{harmonic}} seventh chord {{is one of the}} defining characteristics of blues and barbershop harmony; barbershoppers refer to it as [...] "the barbershop seventh". Since barbershop music tends to be sung in just intonation, the barbershop seventh chord may be accurately termed <b>a</b> harmonic <b>seventh</b> chord. The harmonic seventh chord is also widely used in blues-flavored music. As guitars, pianos, and other equal-temperament instruments cannot play this chord, it is frequently approximated by <b>a</b> dominant <b>seventh.</b> <b>As</b> a result, it is often called <b>a</b> dominant <b>seventh</b> chord and written with the same symbols (such as the blues progression I7-V7-IV7).|$|R
5|$|The {{team had}} very little success in the single-day races in 2011. Near the {{beginning}} of the season, Nocentini rode to a podium finish and <b>a</b> <b>seventh</b> place, respectively, at the Gran Premio dell'Insubria-Lugano and the similarly named Gran Premio di Lugano the next day. Ravard also took <b>a</b> <b>seventh</b> place that day, at Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne. In March, Mondory rode to sixth place at Le Samyn. Later in March, Hinault took eighth at the E3 Prijs Vlaanderen – Harelbeke, a race dominated by 's Fabian Cancellara. The next day, Mondory took the team's best result in a single-day race which counted towards the UCI World Tour rankings by finishing fifth at Gent–Wevelgem.|$|E
5|$|The tour led to {{the release}} of a new {{compilation}} album, entitled Somewhere Back in Time, which included a selection of tracks from their 1980 eponymous debut to 1988's Seventh Son of <b>a</b> <b>Seventh</b> Son, as well as several live versions from Live After Death.|$|E
5|$|After a {{subsequent}} tour, Iron Maiden {{started working on}} their next studio effort, Seventh Son of <b>a</b> <b>Seventh</b> Son, which featured more progressive rock elements than the band's previous records. Although it became their second release to top the UK charts, it was also Dickinson's first album with the band that did not achieve platinum status in the US. Unlike Somewhere in Time, Dickinson was much more enthusiastic about this album due to its concept and has several song-writing credits. After the following tour in 1988, the band {{decided to take a}} year off.|$|E

5|$|Despite early success, the series, {{along with}} the overall rhythm game genre, {{suffered}} from poor sales starting in 2009. Company spokesman Eric Hollreiser said consumer research suggested continued solid demand for the series. Still, by early 2011, Activision stated that the series was on hiatus for 2011, while <b>a</b> <b>seventh</b> main title in the series was under development; this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product. Activision later shut down sales of the series' downloadable content, although users who purchased material from it previously may still play what they bought.|$|E
5|$|Despite the band's intent, {{a future}} album {{from the group}} was uncertain.

50|$|In music theory, the half-diminished seventh chord—also {{known as}} a half-diminished chord or <b>a</b> minor <b>seventh</b> flat five (m75)—is formed by a root note, a minor third, a diminished fifth, and <b>a</b> flat <b>seventh.</b> Its {{consecutive}} intervals are minor third, minor third, major third.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> diminished <b>seventh</b> chord is <b>a</b> four note chord that {{comprises}} {{a diminished}} triad plus the interval of <b>a</b> diminished <b>seventh</b> (alternatively regarded enharmonically {{as a major}} sixth) above the root. Thus it is (1, 3, 5, 7), or enharmonically (1, 3, 5, 6), of any minor scale; for example, C diminished-seventh would be (C, E, G, B), or enharmonically (C, E, G, A). It occurs as <b>a</b> leading-tone <b>seventh</b> chord in harmonic minor and can be represented by the integer notation {0, 3, 6, 9}.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} effect of dissonance is {{perceived}} relatively within musical context: for example, <b>a</b> major <b>seventh</b> interval alone (i.e., C up to B) may be perceived as dissonant, but the same interval as part of <b>a</b> major <b>seventh</b> chord may sound relatively consonant. A tritone (the interval of the fourth step to the seventh step of the major scale, i.e., F to B) sounds very dissonant alone, but less so within the context of <b>a</b> dominant <b>seventh</b> chord (G7 or D7 in that example).|$|R
