40|$|The Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) to {{identify}} and consider the actuarial issues property/casualty insurance companies may encounter by presenting financial results under a fair value accounting standard. The foundation of International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) proposals is that insurance assets and liabilities should be shown in the financial statements at ‘fair values ’ (i. e. market values where a market exists), which differs from current U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This study focuses strictly on the impact fair value accounting could have on loss and loss adjustment expense reserve levels for three specified lines of property/casualty business. We have not considered the impact fair value accounting may have on unexpired risk reserves, <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>liabilities,</b> or any assets...|$|E

50|$|Generally speaking, risk-neutral pricing in {{structural}} {{models of}} financial interconnectedness requires unique equilibrium prices at maturity in {{dependence of the}} exogenous asset price vector, which can be random.While financially interconnected systems with debt and equity cross-ownership without derivatives are fairly well understood {{in the sense that}} relatively weak conditions on the ownership structures in the form of ownership matrices are required to warrant uniquely determined price equilibria, the Fischer (2014) model needs very strong conditions on derivatives - which are defined in dependence on <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>liability</b> of the considered financial system - to be able to guarantee uniquely determined prices of all system-endogenous liabilities. Furthermore, it is known that there exist examples with no solutions at all, finitely many solutions (more than one), and infinitely many solutions. At present, it is unclear how weak conditions on derivatives can be chosen to still be able to apply risk-neutral pricing in financial networks with systemic risk. It is noteworthy, that the price indeterminacy that evolves from multiple price equilibria is fundamentally different from price indeterminacy that stems from market incompleteness.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{intellectual}} capital (IC) paradigm {{appears to be}} stuck at a crossroads of relevance. This paper aims to explore a way forward by examining the power of IC narratives. The prevailing use of narrative as {{an explanation for the}} reasons underpinning an organisation's management of IC is too narrow since narrative can have an emancipatory impact. This enhanced view of narrative allows the opportunity to explore how narrative may be used to understand and mobilise IC both inside and outside organisations and thus improve its relevance as a working discipline. Design/methodology/approach – An analysis of three case studies is presented, each offering different insights on the emancipatory potential of IC narratives. Findings – In order to progress IC beyond the crossroads of relevance, organisations should not blindly implement “frameworks” or “guidelines” that seek to measure and control IC as if it were <b>any</b> <b>other</b> asset (or <b>liability).</b> Instead organisations may benefit from considering how the development of IC fits with the strategic intent of the organisation and be proactive, thinking beyond “accepted” practice to create new insights through critical reflection. Originality/value – The paper is novel because it extends the understanding of how IC can be utilised by providing exemplars of a failed IC implementation as well as two cases where the implementation of IC has brought benefits. Thus, we see IC in action, rather than from a distance. 32 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Private {{entrepreneurship}} as {{a response}} to the social challenges of society is a hot topic today. As a consequence, during the last two decades the public sector has been in competition with private actors delivering welfare services funded by public financing. At the same time, public opinion poll figures indicate an increasing distrust against private for-profit actors in tax-financed industries. A way of solving the equation could be found in the social enterprise; a company with a social purpose, but which runs and finances its activities by using businesslike methods. However, the social enterprise has a challenge in finding a suitable legal body to represent its activities. A not-for-profit purpose combined with businesslike methods must be both theoretically possible and feasible to sustain through the regulations of the legal body. The setup of a limited liability company is an optimal match when it comes to the methods, providing possibilities for self-financing and sustainable business without donations, but the social purpose is not so easily incorporated, since shareholder supremacy allows the purpose to be changed if it is the will of the owners. An alternative to the traditional limited liability company can be found in the (svb) company; a particular type of limited liability company. The important ingredient is a limitation on how much of the yearly profit can be transferred out of the company. The (svb) company can utilize the same businesslike methods as <b>any</b> <b>other</b> limited <b>liability</b> company, but with a social purpose. This means that the (svb) company could be appealing to the public in a unique way and serve as a better alternative for the social enterprise than the limited liability company does. Nevertheless, there are only 89 (svb) companies registered at Bolagsverket today, even though the possibility to start a company of (svb) type has existed since 2006, when chapter 32 was introduced to the Companies Act. However, the failure is not in the lack of demand or impossible rationale of not-for-profit, but in the political implementation of the (svb) company, which has made it unappealing to the social entrepreneur. The function of the (svb) company is still a good match for the needs of a social enterprise that should not be forgotten in the Swedish company landscape...|$|R

30|$|Specifically, Johnson and Stulz [3] {{think that}} the option is the writer’s sole liability. When the {{counterparty}} defaults, the option holder will receive all {{the assets of the}} option writer. Hull and White [5] extend the model, assume that the counterparty has <b>other</b> <b>liabilities,</b> the payout rate is exogenous, and the option holder will obtain part of the option’s intrinsic value when the counterparty defaults, thereby deriving the vulnerable option’s pricing formula. Jarrow and Turnbull [6] propose a risk neutral evaluating mechanism of derivative securities exposed to default risk. Klein [7] provides an analytical solution of the European vulnerable option’s price, taking into account the interrelationship between the option writer’s asset and the underlying asset. They also assume that the option writers have <b>other</b> <b>liabilities,</b> and when the counterparty defaults, some of the nominal claims will be paid.|$|R

30|$|This {{paper will}} extend {{the results of}} [10] and [11] for valuing {{vulnerable}} options when the option writer suffers the financial crisis. As in [11], the asset prices are driven by jump-diffusion processes. The jump {{is divided into two}} parts: the trait part of each asset price and the part of the system that affects the price of all assets. Following Klein and Inglis [10], we assume that there are interrelations between the option’s underlying asset and the option writer’s assets, and the option writers have <b>other</b> <b>liabilities.</b> The value growth of the option itself may also give rise to financial distress. The default barrier is divided into a stochastic part that measures the option’s potential payoff and the fixed part that represents the option writer’s <b>other</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Furthermore, we make the assumption that only variations {{in the value of the}} asset underlying the option or the writer’s assets can cause financial distress. By the Taylor expansion, we derive an approximate explicit valuation for vulnerable options.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} pricing {{behavior}} of both debts and call options in a unified context, where the issuer can possibly default.

It is likely that a security with priority status junior to <b>other</b> <b>liabilities</b> is worth more than a security with priority status ranking equally with <b>other</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Such a situation occurs when the issuer's firm value is low and the dynamics of the firm value is positively correlated with that of the option's underlying stock value. If the market participants ignore this feature, an astute investor can make arbitrage in such a speculative security.
