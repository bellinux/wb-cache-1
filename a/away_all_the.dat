Lisa remains perfect in her picks for eight weeks, earning her father {{more and more}} money as the Super Bowl approaches. With his new money, Homer starts buying expensive presents for the family and treating them to fine dining. When Lisa asks Homer if they can go hiking the Sunday following the Super Bowl, he tells her that Daddy-Daughter Days are over until next football season. Lisa realizes that all Homer wanted was to exploit her prognostic abilities to help him gamble. Completely heartbroken, Lisa gives <b>away</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> toys Homer bought for her.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{dynamic characteristic}} of a planet {{is that it has}} cleared its neighborhood. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep <b>away</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> planetesimals in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the IAU's official definition of a planet in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets. Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.|$|E

25|$|The {{change in}} the tenancy {{condition}} in the state through Operation Barga has brought some degree of economic stability among farmers. Unlike in other Indian states, West Bengal has hardly seen any farmer suicides or starvation deaths arising from crop failure.

Taylor wore two pairs of thin Chamois inners and Mitre wicket-keeping gloves from which he cut <b>away</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> padding from inside the palms and removed the webbing. His reasoning for this was that he liked to feel the ball in his palm and if taking the ball correctly {{most of the time}} the bruising wasn't too troublesome.

Diogo de Torralva's work was continued in 1571 by Jérôme de Rouen (also called Jerónimo de Ruão) who added some classical elements.

25|$|The seventh {{game was}} played on 17 November 2014. The opening was the highly {{theoretical}} Berlin Defence of the Ruy Lopez. Carlsen retained a slight advantage, despite sacrificing a pawn. At move 31 Carlsen was poised to win back the e5-pawn, thereby establishing connected passed pawns, but Anand instead sacrificed his bishop for two pawns and cleared <b>away</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> pawns on the kingside. With an extra knight, Carlsen tried to win but {{he was unable to}} penetrate Anand's defenses. Eventually the players traded down into a rook and knight versus rook endgame that is a theoretical draw and Anand made no mistakes while defending it. Carlsen finally acquiesced to a rook exchange on move 121, drawing immediately. With this draw, Carlsen still led by one point.|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania {{departed}} Liverpool for Philadelphia at 2:30pm February 21, 1874, with {{a typical}} small winter-passage complement of two saloon and twelve steerage-class passengers, and some $250,000 of cargo. On {{the night of}} February 27, the ship ran into a hurricane on the open sea. Giant waves swept everything from the ship's decks and flooded the passenger saloon, while the ship struggled to retain headway. At around midnight, a mammoth wave slammed down upon the vessel, sweeping <b>away</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> lifeboats and liferafts, and breaking the foreboom and {{all four of the}} ship's forward hatches. Water began pouring into the holds, until they were about one quarter full. Tragically, the huge wave had also swept away the wheelhouse, the mate's house, and part of the wooden ship's bridge, taking with them the captain of the ship and four crew members, none of whom were ever seen again.|$|E

The BC Lions signed Allen in May 1991 to compete for one of these spots. Despite suffering a bruised knee during the preseason, Allen succeeded in making the active roster. He struggled in July and August, with Lions head coach Bob O'Billovich saying [...] "he's been a step or two <b>away</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time on pass coverage". In late August, the Lions moved Allen to the practice squad and replaced him with new signing Bruce Holmes, who had led the CFL in tackles the previous season with the Ottawa Rough Riders. Allen finished his rookie season with 31 tackles, two sacks, and a fumble recovery over six games played.|$|E

Jim Trageser of The Press-Enterprise, in a review of one of the San Diego performances, praised Taylor, saying he [...] "has the lung power to simply take over any show, especially his own" [...] and [...] "shows surprising grace and athleticism as well as the kind of leonine masculinity that certain big men (Orson Welles, Babe Ruth) possess".

500|$|In 1996, a {{previously}} unpublished private account written in 1972 by Aldo Lampredi for the Communist Party's archives, appeared in L'Unità. In it, Lampredi confirmed the key facts of Audisio's story {{but without the}} embellishments. Lampredi was undoubtedly an eyewitness and, because he prepared his narrative for the private records of the Communist Party – and not for publication – it was perceived {{that he had no}} motivation other than to tell the truth. Furthermore, he had had a reputation for being reliable and trustworthy; he was also known to have disliked Audisio personally. For all these reasons it was seen as significant that he largely confirmed Audisio's account. After Lampredi's account was published, most, but not all, commentators were convinced of its veracity. The historian Giorgio Bocca commented that [...] "it sweeps <b>away</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> bad novels constructed over 50 years {{on the end of the}} Duce of fascism ....
