After they had been repaired, Budapest's government decided that they would return them to Siemens. However, this did not happen because of contractual terms.

25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
500|$|According to Leslie C. Orr, the Saptamatrika, {{who first}} {{appeared}} in South India in the eighth century, had once temples dedicated exclusively to them, but the ninth century onwards, they were demoted to status of [...] "deities of the entourage" [...] (parivara devata) of Shiva. Their images moved from the sanctums to corners of temple complexes <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> as guardian deities in small village shrines. The Saptamatrikas are worshipped as Saptakanyakas (the celestial nymphs) in most South Indian Shiva temples. But the Selliyamman temple at Alambakkam in Tiruchirapalli district (In 1909 called Trichonopoly district) is important in worship of the Matrikas. Here once stood a temple dedicated to the Saptamatrika, which {{was replaced by the}} present temple.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the bombing campaign, Harris said, quoting the Old Testament: [...] "The Nazis entered this war under the rather childish {{delusion}} {{that they were going to}} bomb everyone else, and nobody was going to bomb them.

[...] Pei commented, [...] "The Bujue Dugu and Li often submitted their best thoughts, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> finally being promoted.

2500|$|On 7 November 1941, Sir Richard Peirse, head of RAF Bomber Command, {{launched}} a large raid on Berlin, sending over 160 bombers to the capital. More than 20 {{were shot down}} or crashed, and again little damage was done. This failure led to the dismissal of Peirse and his replacement by Sir Arthur Travers Harris, who believed in both the efficacy and necessity of area bombing. Harris said: [...] "The Nazis entered this war under the rather childish delusion {{that they were going}} to bomb everyone else, and nobody was going to bomb them.

2500|$|Corry was {{a staunch}} {{advocate}} of Irish republicanism, strongly opposed to Partition, antipathetic to the United Kingdom, and sometimes bluntly outspoken within the Dáil chamber. In 1928, he criticised the Cumann na nGaedheal government's expenditure on the diplomatic corps, stating [...] "These salaries of £1,500 {{have to be}} paid so that they might squat like the nigger when he put on the black silk hat and the swallow-tail coat and went out and said he was an English gentleman." [...] His opposition to the Blueshirts in the early 1930s provoked an attempt to burn down his house. In the 1938 debate on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement which ceded the Treaty Ports to the Irish state, Corry expressed regret that Northern Ireland remained excluded, suggesting [...] "I personally am in favour of storing up sufficient poison gas, so that when you get the wind in the right direction you can start at the Border and let it travel, and follow it." [...] In a 1942 debate on exporting food to Great Britain during World War II, Corry remarked about food shortages there that [...] "They have no more rabbits to get, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> on the crows", and [...] "I would not like to see too many crows going out to feed them. I think the crows are too good for them". Patrick Giles called Corry a [...] "", and Alfie Byrne persisted in demanding an apology for the [...] "unchristian" [...] comments to the point of himself being suspended from the chamber.|$|E
