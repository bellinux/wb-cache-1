40|$|In {{the process}} of foreign {{language}} acquisition the mother tongue is constantly present. The use of a phonetic system of a foreign language may be disrupted by the <b>articulation</b> <b>base</b> of the mother tongue. To what extent the <b>articulation</b> <b>base</b> may disrupt the learning process of a foreign language, {{depends on how much}} the native and the foreign language correspond phonetically. In other words, this learning process depends on similarities and dissimilarities between these two languages. It is very difficult to accomplish the pronunciation of particular sounds of a foreign language which are either minimally dissimilar compared to a phoneme of the mother tongue, or sounds which differ extremely in their way of articulation (for instance, some Arabic pharyngeal and glottal sounds, etc.). Prosodic elements are differently expressed from language to language: sometimes stronger (for example, French and Hungarian), sometimes weaker. If prosodic elements are extremely marked in the native language, they will interfere with the learning process and will be harder to remove from the foreign language...|$|E

50|$|The maxillae had {{overhanging}} lips {{along their}} outer margins, and the tooth row was set {{away from the}} margin. One maxilla has an oval puncture mark, 5 millimeters by 6.5 millimeters (0.2 by 0.26 in), probably made by a larger predator. The snout was short and flat. The vertebrae were procoelous in the neck, back, {{and part of the}} tail, and the procoelous shape was most strongly developed in the neck vertebrae. Procoely is a type of vertebral <b>articulation,</b> <b>based</b> on the shape of the anterior and posterior faces of the vertebral centrum. In procoelous vertebrae, the vertebrae articulate with a concave leading surface and a convex posterior surface. The vertebrae of Pachycheilosuchus had a slight dimple or concavity on the posterior surface as well, making these bones different from the procoelous vertebrae that are a hallmark of derived eusuchian crocodilians. Because of this difference, and because Pachycheilosuchus did not have many of the other features of eusuchians, it probably evolved procoely independently. The ulna, the major bone of the forearm, is strongly curved. Pachycheilosuchus had among its armor a unique shield of bony scutes for its neck, composed of six individual fused scutes.|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) tongue {{model has}} been developed using MR images of a reference subject producing 44 artificially sustained Swedish <b>articulations.</b> <b>Based</b> on the difference in tongue shape between the articulations and a reference, the six linear parameters jaw height, tongue body, tongue dorsum, tongue tip, tongue advance and tongue width were determined using an ordered linear factor analysis controlled by articulatory measures. The first five factors explained 88 % of the tongue data variance in the midsagittal plane and 78 % in the 3 D analysis. The six-parameter model is able to reconstruct the modelled articulations with an overall mean reconstruction error of 0. 13 cm, and it specifically handles lateral differences and asymmetries in tongue shape. In order to correct articulations that were hyperarticulated due to the artificial sustaining in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition, the parameter values in the tongue model were readjusted based on a comparison of virtual and natural linguopalatal contact patterns, collected with electropalatography (EPG). Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) data was collected to control the kinematics of the tongue model for vowel-fricative sequences and an algorithm to handle surface contacts has been implemented, preventing the tongue from protruding through the palate and teeth.

Let me begin by contrasting two illness experiences of my own; this contrast isthe first in a sequence of attempts to specify this most elusive quality, suffer-ing. 1 The discussion I hope to initiate begins with the idea that suffering is what makes illness worth studying, just as illness is what makes health care a topic of con-cern. I propose that research has a problem encountering suffering, and in its eva-sions of suffering, research can create more suffering for ill people. I begin with my own suffering.

40|$|Taxonomically {{organized}} data pervade science, {{business and}} everyday life. Unfortunately, taxonomies are often under-specified, limiting their utility in contexts such as data inte-gration, information navigation and autonomous agent com-munication. This work formalizes taxonomies and relation-ships between them as formulas in logic. This formalization concretizes notions such as consistency and inconsistency of taxonomies and articulations (inter-taxonomic relations) between them, enables the derivation of new <b>articulations</b> <b>based</b> {{on a given}} set of taxonomies and articulations and provides a framework for testing assumptions about under-specified taxonomies. Given the typical intractability of reasoning with tax-onomies and articulations, this research investigates many optimizations: from those that reduce the search space, to those that leverage parallel processing, to those investigat-ing logics more tractable than first-order logic (e. g., monadic first-order logic, propositional logic, description logics, and subsets of the RCC- 5 spatial algebra). Finally, in addition to reasoning with taxonomies and articulations, this research investigates how to repair inconsistent taxonomies and ar-ticulations, how to explain inconsistencies and discovered relations, and how to merge taxonomies given articulations.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigate}} {{the timing of}} pre-answer inbreaths in order {{to shed light on}} the time course of response planning and execution in conversational turn-taking. Using acoustic and inductive plethysmography recordings of seven dyadic conversations in Dutch, we show that pre-answer inbreaths in conversation typically begin briefly after the end of questions. We also show that the presence of a pre-answer inbreath usually co-occurs with substantially delayed answers, with a modal latency of 576 ms vs. 100 ms for answers not preceded by an inbreath. Based on previously reported minimal latencies for internal intercostal activation and the production of speech sounds, we propose that vocal responses, either {{in the form of a}} pre-utterance inbreath or of speech proper when an inbreath is not produced, are typically launched in reaction to information present in the last portion of the interlocutor’s turn. We also show that short responses are usually made on residual breath, while longer responses are more often preceded by an inbreath. This relation of inbreaths to answer length suggests that by the time an inbreath is launched, typically during the last few hundred milliseconds of the question, the length of the answer is often prepared to some extent. Together, our findings are consistent with a two-stage model of response planning in conversational turn-taking: early planning of content often carried out in overlap with the incoming turn, and late launching of <b>articulation</b> <b>based</b> on the identification of turn-final cue...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper offers}} {{a summary of}} the results of two earlier {{experiments}} (Nawrocki and Gonet 2004; Nawrocki 2004), in which acoustic properties of the voiceless velar fricative phoneme /x/ in Southern Polish were investigated. As is found in both studies (Nawrocki and Gonet 2004; Nawrocki 2004), speakers of both genders favour glottal articulation, with partial or full voicing. Word final contexts are decisively in favour of [x]. The word initial, prevocalic positions seem to allow quite a number of allophonic variants of /x/. These are: [x], [ɦ], [ç] and, additionally, the voiceless glottal, the pharyngeal or the epiglottal [h]/[ħ]/[ʜ]. Another factor taken into account is the coarticulation effect of the vocalic context on the choice of <b>articulation.</b> <b>Based</b> on the results of the experiments, a reformulated allophonic composition is proposed for Polish /x/. It makes room for previously unconsidered pharyngeal and glottal allophones. In order to inspect the acoustic properties of the allophones of Polish /x/ further, their static and dynamic spectral features are compared to those of phonetically similar sounds in other languages where they have the status of independent phonemes. Special attention is paid to the distribution of spectral peaks and their intensity. The fact that in Polish there are no 'back' fricative phonemes that would contrast with /x/ creates a wide range of acceptable allophonic articulations that cannot be challenged from either articulatory or perceptual points of view...|$|R

That bureaucratic <b>articulation,</b> <b>based</b> on processing of files and orders, and obeying a repetitive, mechanical logic, was combined with a quasi-military implementation of the forced displacement once everything had been planned on paper, which enabled the mass scale of these operations.

They are studied through the case of a mass operation in Lithuania, code-named “Spring” by the Soviet authorities, for which preparations began in mid-February 1948 and which was completed over two days in mid-May of the same year.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to verify, {{through the use of a}} descriptive approach and a content analysis, the nature and degree of proximity of discursive stereotypes in journalistic writings from both Quebec and English Canada, more specifically, in the organization of the enunciation processes, the use of authentication and persuasion standards and the positioning of different points of view and centres of interest. The corpus of sixty articles is drawn from six mainstream newspapers: two English Canadian dailies and two Quebec newspapers, as well as two French newspapers serving as a control sample. A comparative analysis of the corpus reveals a proximity between the articles found in the Quebec newspapers and those from the English Canadian dailies. This similarity takes on several aspects. Regarding the enunciation processes, the four Canadian newspapers use more direct quotations than the two French dailies, in which there is a greater tendency to use the commentary function. An analysis of the transitional elements shows that the English and French newspapers in the Canadian corpus use a particular <b>articulation</b> <b>based</b> on an alternation between a direct or indirect quotation of a protagonist and an account of the facts, while the French newspapers use this type of construction less frequently. Moreover, a review of the rhetorical processes demonstrates a general tendency towards the respective homogeneity of the French and Canadian corpuses. Finally, an analysis of the focalization is based on a much smaller "sample" (one article from each newspaper), such that it would be more risky to assert any emerging trends. It is still a fad that a review of the modalizers well illustrates the impressionistic propensity of the French articles, compared to the Canadian ones. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
