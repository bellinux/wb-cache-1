5|$|This {{structure}} {{was built in}} the mid-15th century. At the southern end is a shallow raised dais on which the Lytes and favoured guests would have sat <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> table, facing the rest of the hall where the servants would have dined. The roof has arch-braced-collar trusses, with double purlins, and cusped curved windbraces. Typical of West Country design, these carved windbraces are both decorative and practical. Beneath is a cornice of pierced quatrefoils, and at the base of each main rafter is a carved wooden angel with a shield with the Lyte arms. The fireplace is 15th century, while the windows and the stained glass in them date from the early 16th century. The hall is entered from the east front porch via the screens passage, which would have divided the Hall from the kitchen and servants quarters' which would have lain {{to the left of the}} hall. The screen and gallery are not original, having been inserted by Sir Walter Jenner in 1907. He based the decoration on that of the arch from the Great Hall through to the Oriel Room. At the time of Jenner's arrival in 1907 the Great Hall was being used as a cider store.|$|E
5|$|Towers {{scored the}} first Welsh try, which was {{converted}} by Jim Webb. The Natives {{replied with a}} spirited run by Ellison, but he failed {{to break through the}} Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half-way line, which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd. Webb, playing in out of position at full-back, missed the conversion and then failed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> distance goal from a mark. The Natives continued to push, with Elliot coming within five-yards of the try line, and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25-yard line before he could touch down. In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives' 25; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed to get the ball across the try line, allowing Jim Hannan to score. Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game.|$|E
25|$|Friedman {{was married}} in February 1931 to Shirley Immerman, a {{resident}} of Brooklyn. The wedding was held <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Long</b> Island country club with Guy Lombardo and his orchestra providing the entertainment. They were married for more than 50 years.|$|E

It was unusual for him to drop off the film since he [...] "had always developed his own film".|$|R
25|$|A {{ruling grade}} is often found <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> climb up to a summit. Ideally, the cutting {{at the summit}} should be as deep as possible, such as at Shap, as this helps {{reduce the amount of}} climb, and the {{steepness}} of the gradient. Alternately, a summit tunnel should be provided, such as at Ardglen.|$|E
25|$|The Slingsby CAMCO V-Liner was a {{proposed}} advertising aircraft of unusual {{design of the}} 1960s. It was intended to display advertising using electric lights to be viewed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> distance, and as such consisted of a long triangular frame carried between two sets of wings and fuselages. The prototype V-Liner was destroyed in a factory fire before completion and the type was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Four {{games into}} the 1995–96 season, Mario Tremblay {{was hired as}} Montreal's new head coach, {{replacing}} Jacques Demers. Roy and Tremblay, who had roomed together while playing together, had a notably strained relationship, with Tremblay regularly mocking Roy's English-speaking abilities. Roy was a frequent target of Tremblay during the latter's sports radio career. The two had almost come to blows in two incidents in 1995, one <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Long</b> Island coffee shop before Tremblay was announced as a coach and after Tremblay allegedly fired a shot at Roy's throat during practice.|$|E

25|$|In July 2015, one of {{the largest}} leaks in Canada’s history spilled 5,000 cubic metres of {{emulsion}} — about 5 million litres of bitumen, sand and wastewater — from a Nexen Energy pipeline <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Long</b> Lake oil sands facility, south of Fort McMurray. The subsidiary of China’s CNOOC Ltd. automated safety systems had not detected the pipeline fault that caused the spill to cover an area of about 16,000 square metres prior to manual inspection. Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) revealed the number of pipeline “incidents” in Alberta increased 15% last year, despite the regulator’s well-publicized efforts to reduce ruptures and spills.|$|E
25|$|In any {{analysis}} of spacetime, evidence of gravitation requires that one observe the relative accelerations of two bodies or two separated particles. In Fig.5‑1, two separated particles, free-falling in the gravitational {{field of the}} Earth, exhibit tidal accelerations due to local inhomogeneities in the gravitational field such that each particle follows a different path through spacetime. The tidal accelerations that these particles exhibit with {{respect to each other}} do not require forces for their explanation. Rather, Einstein described them in terms of the geometry of spacetime, i.e. the curvature of spacetime. These tidal accelerations are strictly local. It is the cumulative total effect of many local manifestations of curvature that result in the appearance of a gravitational force acting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> range from Earth.|$|E
25|$|Former sidekick Andy Richter, who re-joined O'Brien when he {{took over}} The Tonight Show in June, joined O'Brien onstage for two segments, {{watching}} clips and reminiscing about the show. Among the clips shown, O'Brien noted that his all-time favorite Late Night piece was when he attended a re-enactment of an American Civil War-era baseball game, played <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Long</b> Island NY museum, Old Bethpage Village Restoration. During the course of the final week, O'Brien began violently dismantling and handing out pieces of the production set to the audience. In the final show, a large piece of the stage's frame was pulled down and chopped into pieces. O'Brien then promised to give each audience member in attendance a piece of the set.|$|E

25|$|One {{theory was}} {{submitted}} that Princess Doe {{may have been}} a runaway and could have been an individual using false names while employed at a hotel in Ocean City, Maryland. Six people have recently come forward with suspected identities of Princess Doe. In 2012, a sample of her hair and a tooth were examined through isotope analysis and indicated that the victim was most likely born in the United States. The sample of her hair indicated that she had lived at least seven to ten months in the Midwestern or Northeastern United States. The tooth sample indicated she could possibly be from Arizona. It is also believed that the girl had spent {{a long period of time}} in Long Island, New York. After seeing images of the girl's clothing on a newspaper, a woman reported to officials that she remembered seeing a girl wearing the same clothing as Princess Doe on July 13, 1982, just two days before her body was found. The woman claimed that she was shopping with her daughter at a store across from the cemetery and observed the victim's unique clothing. The shirt and skirt themselves were traced to a manufacturer in the Midwestern United States, although the brand labels were missing. Three people reported that they bought similar clothes, after viewing photos, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Long</b> Island store, which is now closed. It is unknown if the store was specifically located in Long Island or possibly in other locations. The 2012 composite of the victim also generated new tips, as it resembled several missing girls from the country.|$|E

[...] Chanté abwè are {{performed in a}} game in which the singers, seated <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> table, take turns singing a new song each time their turn comes. Those who lasted the entire evening won prizes, often a bottle of rum.|$|E
500|$|At the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne, Australia, Lochte won {{his first}} {{individual}} gold medal <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> course world championships in the 200-meter backstroke against compatriot Aaron Peirsol, breaking Peirsol's world record and his seven-year win streak in the event. [...] This was Lochte's first world record in a long course event. A little more than 90 minutes later, Lochte went on to set a world record in the 4×200-meter freestyle relay with Phelps, Keller and Vanderkaay. [...] He also won silver medals in the 100-meter backstroke, and 200-meter and 400-meter individual medley, making his medal total for the meet second only to Phelps.|$|E

As they increased in number, Algonquin manager Frank Case moved them to the Rose Room and a round table. Initially the group called itself [...] "The Board" [...] and the luncheons [...] "Board meetings". After being assigned a waiter named Luigi, the group re-christened itself [...] "Luigi Board". Finally they became [...] "The Vicious Circle" [...] although [...] "The Round Table" [...] gained wide currency after a caricature by cartoonist Edmund Duffy of the Brooklyn Eagle portrayed the group sitting at a round table and wearing armor.|$|E
500|$|Soni won {{her first}} {{gold medal in}} the 100-meter breaststroke. [...] After posting the top times in the heats (1:05.54) and semi-finals (1:04.91), Soni {{recorded}} a time of 1:05.05 in the final for the win. [...] Her winning time was over a second ahead of second-place finisher Leisel Jones. In her second event, the 200-meter breaststroke, Soni won with a time of 2:21.47, her first {{gold medal in the}} event <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> course World Championships. [...] However, her time in the final was slightly slower than her semi-final time of 2:21.03. In the 4×100-meter medley relay, Soni won gold with Natalie Coughlin, Dana Vollmer, and Missy Franklin with a time of 3:52.36, over three seconds ahead of second-place finisher China. [...] Swimming the breaststroke leg, Soni had a split of 1:04.71. [...] The final time of 3:52.36 for the medley relay was the second-fastest effort of all time, just behind the Chinese-owned world record of 3:52.19. In her last event, the 50-meter breaststroke, Soni finished in third place behind Jessica Hardy and Yuliya Yefimova.|$|E
500|$|The gatefold's inner left panel, {{opposite}} the album's production credits, showed Harrison {{and his fellow}} musicians – Starr, Horn, Voormann, Hopkins, Keltner and Wright – <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> table, laden with food and wine. A deliberate parody of da Vinci's The Last Supper, the picture was taken in California at the mock-Tudor home of entertainment lawyer Abe Somers, by Hollywood glamour photographer Ken Marcus. As with the US coinage used on the back cover, various details in the photo represent what Harrison termed the [...] "gross" [...] aspects {{of life in the}} material world. Clayson has speculated about the symbolism and hidden messages within the photo: whether the nurse with a pram, set back from and {{to the left of the}} table, was a reference to Boyd's inability to conceive a child; and the empty, distant wheelchair in memory of Harrison's late mother. Theologian Dale Allison observes the anti-Catholic sentiment within this inner-gatefold photo, following on from Harrison's lyrics to his 1970 song [...] "Awaiting on You All". Harrison is dressed as a priest, all in black, sporting an Old West six-shooter – [...] "a slam at the perceived materialism and violence of the Roman church", Allison writes.|$|E

500|$|The Long Branch Saloon Shootout, {{involving}} Levi Richardson, {{a buffalo}} hunter, and [...] "Cockeyed Frank" [...] Loving, a professional gambler, happened on April 5, 1879. Richardson had developed some affection for Loving's wife Mattie, {{and the two}} began to argue about her. In the saloon, Frank sat down <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> table, Richardson turned around and took {{a seat at the}} same table. The two were then heard speaking in low voices. After the conversation, Richardson drew his pistol, and Loving drew his in response. The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke. Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett, who was in Beatty & Kelley's Saloon, heard the shots and came running. Both men were still standing, although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving's Remington No. 44 was empty. Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down in a chair and took his gun, while Bassett disarmed Loving. Richardson then got up and started toward the billiard table, when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest, as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm. Frank Loving, who had only a slight scratch on the hand, was immediately taken to jail. Two days later, the coroner's inquest ruled that the killing had been in self-defense and Loving was immediately released.|$|E
