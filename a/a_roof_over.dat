5|$|In early 1949, {{volunteer}} {{construction work}} began on a municipal stadium in Saint John Famagusta parish. The stadium—the first in Cyprus with <b>a</b> <b>roof</b> <b>over</b> the stands—was built by {{supporters of the}} club and footballers and completed in 1952. It served as Nea Salamina's headquarters from 1952 to 1953.|$|E
5|$|In 1872 a major {{programme}} of building works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided <b>a</b> <b>roof</b> <b>over</b> the central {{court of the}} Exchange and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear to {{have been made in the}} late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the Exchange in 1907. These included the provision of a lift from the basement and cellars to the first floor and major alterations to the cellars under the central part of the Exchange. Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal of the clock tower at the back of the building and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E

The latter allowed for the Toronto Argonauts to move to BMO Field beginning with the 2016 CFL season, which also saw the 104th Grey Cup played at the stadium.|$|E
25|$|Many {{youngsters who}} had {{experienced}} the living conditions in China's slum {{had grown up in}} a culture of poverty and often saw criminal offences, such as petty theft, as {{the only way to get}} regular meals. These meals were provided in the warmth of a prison cell, conditions many were unfamiliar with. Living conditions were so bad in China's slums that for many young offenders sent to prison, the prospect of regular meals and <b>a</b> <b>roof</b> <b>over</b> their head was an improvement on their normal living conditions.|$|E
25|$|Derrick Cave {{began as}} an open channel of lava flowing south from a large {{volcanic}} vent. Eventually, a lava crust solidified {{over the top of}} the flowing lava. This formed <b>a</b> <b>roof</b> <b>over</b> the river, enclosing it in a lava tunnel or tube. When the eruption from the vent stopped, the lava drained out of the tube leaving a lava tube cave behind. After the cave cooled, several sections of its roof collapsed. These collapsed ceiling sections provided entrances to both the uphill (northeast) and downhill (southwest) parts of the cave.|$|E

500|$|Next to {{the main}} house was a two-story kitchen house that was called [...] "Ma'am Anna House" [...] while Anna Jai was on Fort George Island. It was {{probably}} built in the 1820s and doubled as a center for food preparation {{on the ground floor}} and Anna Jai's residence with her children on the second. In West Africa, polygamy was not uncommon, and wives often lived in separate quarters from their husbands. Kingsley's nephew and his wife also lived on the grounds and Gibbs probably used a part of the second floor for an office. The main house and Ma'am Anna House were surrounded by a grove of orange, lemon, and banana trees with occasional ornamental crepe myrtles. Between 1869 and 1877 Rollins built <b>a</b> <b>roof</b> <b>over</b> the walkway between the kitchen house and the main house.|$|E

50|$|The {{house is}} not typical of Dickey's {{residential}} work, but displays fine craftsmanship and is well adapted to an indoor-outdoor lifestyle.

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 16, 1910. It states: [...] "A shot that found a fortune! Jack Hunt, {{the son of a}} wealthy woman, falls in love with Nell Horsley, who is in the chorus of a musical comedy. They are married, but when Jack's mother is informed she declares she'll {{have nothing to do with}} Nell, although she is willing to forgive her son. But Jack sticks to his wife, and for a time they are very happy. Then Jack, who is in the militia, is called out on strike duty, and meets his death during a fight with strikers. The widow takes the news to her mother-in-law, who nevertheless retains her hatred for Nell, despite the tragedy. As time passes, Mrs. Hunt becomes a miser. She disposes of all of her property, receiving in exchange money and jewels which she hides in a secret place in her room. In the meantime Nell has a hard time to get along and keep <b>a</b> <b>roof</b> <b>over</b> her head and that of her little boy. So desperate are her circumstances that she finally sinks her pride and appeals to her mother-in-law. The old woman repulses her again; her fit of rage brings on a stroke of apoplexy and she drops dead after Nell leaves. All her property goes to little George, as the woman left no will, but search fails to locate anything except the family homestead. Nell is about to sell that, when she makes a discovery. Playing 'Indian' with her boy, she shoots arrows aimlessly about the room. One of them hits the secret spring of the treasure vault, and the accident puts the boy and his mother beyond want for the rest of their lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|The notion was {{initially}} ill-received due to {{concerns for the}} boys' safety. [...] A mother has been quoted saying, [...] "Camp! My children have always had <b>a</b> <b>roof</b> <b>over</b> their heads, {{and as long as}} I live, always will!". They did have <b>a</b> <b>roof</b> <b>over</b> their heads because William Smith proceeded with the idea and 1st Glasgow Company held its inaugural one-week camp beginning on Friday, 16 July 1886, at Auchinlochan Hall, Tighnabruaich in a hall. In later years they took to canvas camping on a site at Portavadie in the Kyles of Bute. The First Glasgow continued to attend summer camp at the same location until the summer of 1974 when Portavadie was selected as the location of a proposed yard for the construction of oil production platforms. However the new camp is located only 100 yards away at Stilliag farm. This camp site is now used by many companies of the BB every summer for their camping trip.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{completion}} of the cell block meant <b>a</b> <b>roof</b> <b>over</b> a prisoner's head, the amenities of the facility were sparse. [...] The cells measured 6 × , were constructed of soft brick, and had no plumbing or artificial lights. The building had no heating or ventilation, and, in a region which often experienced temperatures below [...] in the winter and above [...] in the summer, this made for very uncomfortable tenants. [...] To alleviate the discomfort, the administration used wood stoves to heat the building and oil lamps to light it, the smoke from which combined with the stench of bucketed human waste and unwashed bodies to make the environment rank.|$|E

Each stand had seating for 23,000 spectators. Most of the fans (about 12,000) went to the East Stand, which was closer to the Metro station. There were approximately 100 Dutch supporters; the vast majority of fans in attendance were fans of Spartak Moscow.|$|E
