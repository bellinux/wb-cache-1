5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade {{are difficult to}} determine and may change with further research. All three <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E

5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

5|$|Pavo is {{the radiant}} of two annual meteor showers: the Delta Pavonids and August Pavonids. Appearing from 21 March to 8 April and {{generally}} peaking around 5 and 6 April, Delta Pavonids <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{be associated with}} Comet Grigg-Mellish. The shower was discovered by Michael Buhagiar from Perth, Australia, who observed meteors on six occasions between 1969 and 1980. The August Pavonids peak around August 31 and <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{be associated with the}} Halley-type Comet Levy (P/1991 L3).|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the agents}} in Coley's Toxin that <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> biologically active is a {{lipopolysaccharide}} which causes fever.

5|$|A basic {{sub-division}} is a {{grouping of}} the eight inner regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator and <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have formed with Jupiter. The remainder of the moons consist of {{an unknown number of}} small irregular moons with elliptical and inclined orbits, which <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. Irregular moons that belong to a group share similar orbital elements and thus may have a common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} subtypes of Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} are recognized. Despite this, {{many people have}} overlapping symptoms that can make the classification difficult in individual cases.

5|$|All known extinct lemurs from Madagascar {{are known}} from recent, subfossil remains.
