5|$|Erythromycin {{and other}} {{macrolides}} or clindamycin are recommended {{for people with}} severe penicillin allergies. First-generation cephalosporins {{may be used in}} those with less severe <b>allergies</b> <b>and</b> some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to penicillin. Streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if untreated. These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of <b>allergies,</b> <b>and</b> fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Allergies</b> <b>and</b> intolerances {{to a food}} {{group may}} coexist with {{separate}} pathologies; for example, cow's milk allergy (CMA) and lactose intolerance are two distinct pathologies.|$|E

25|$|An ED {{requires}} different {{equipment and}} different approaches {{than most other}} hospital divisions. Patients frequently arrive with unstable conditions, and so must be treated quickly.

25|$|Itch (pruritus) {{has many}} causes. <b>Allergies</b> <b>and</b> {{inflammatory}} skin disease all produce itch as a symptom.
