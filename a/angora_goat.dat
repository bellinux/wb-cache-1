50|$|Until 1849, the Turkish {{province}} of Ankara {{was the sole}} producer of <b>Angora</b> <b>goats.</b> Charles V {{is believed to be}} the first to bring <b>Angora</b> <b>goats</b> to Europe. Due to the great demand for mohair fiber, throughout the 1800s there was a great deal of crossbreeding between <b>Angora</b> <b>goats</b> and common goats. The growing demand for mohair further resulted in attempts on a commercial scale to introduce the goat into South Africa (where it was crossed with the native goat) in 1838, the United States in 1849, Australia from 1856-1875, and later still New Zealand. In 1849, <b>Angora</b> <b>goats</b> made their way to America as a gift from Turkey.|$|R

2500|$|Certain {{authors have}} {{postulated}} that the markhor is the ancestor of some breeds of domestic goat. The <b>Angora</b> <b>goat</b> has been regarded {{by some as}} a direct descendant of the Central Asian markhor. Charles Darwin postulated that modern goats arose from crossbreeding markhor with wild goats. Evidence for markhors crossbreeding with domestic goats has been found. One study suggested that 35.7% of captive markhors in the analysis (ranging from three different zoos) had mitochondrial DNA from domestic goats. Other authors have put forth the possibility of markhor being the ancestor of some Egyptian goat breeds, due to their similar horns, though the lack of an anterior keel on the horns of the markhor belies any close relationship. The Changthangi domestic goat of Ladakh and Tibet may derive from the markhor. The Girgentana goat of Sicily is thought to have been bred from markhor, as is the Bilberry goat of Ireland. The Kashmiri feral herd of about 200 individuals on the Great Orme limestone headland of Wales are derived from a herd maintained at Windsor Great Park [...] belonging to Queen Victoria.|$|E

40|$|Body {{condition}} scoring {{is widely}} used for sheep and cattle but the practice is included in only one Code of Practice {{for the welfare of}} goats in Australia. There is no published scientific evidence to support or defend its use in the assessment of welfare risks to farmed goats. PROCEDURE: The significance of stocking rate, grazing system, body condition score (CS) and live weight were investigated in explaining the risk of mortality of individual and flocks of grazing <b>Angora</b> <b>goats</b> from hypothermia following a severe weather event in April. This event occurred 5 weeks after shearing the <b>goats.</b> <b>Angora</b> <b>goats</b> and Saxon Merino sheep were grazed alone, or mixed together in equal numbers at each of three stocking rates. RESULTS: There was no mortality amongst <b>Angora</b> <b>goats</b> provided they grazed at the lowest stocking rate even when their CS was or = 2. 5 and mortality increased sharply at mean CS < 2. 0. For individual <b>Angora</b> <b>goats,</b> mortality increased as CS declined and stocking rate and grazing combinations were additive in effect on mortality. Grazing with sheep increased mortality of <b>Angora</b> <b>goats</b> at higher stocking rates. The individual goat mortality rate was not dependent on individual plot effects suggesting that these results are applicable widely. Live weight loss was not related to mortality rates of goats once CS had been accounted for. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that CS and stocking rate were highly significant determinants of welfare risk in <b>Angora</b> <b>goats.</b> <br /...|$|R
