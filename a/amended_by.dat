5|$|House Democrats had {{expected}} {{to be able to}} negotiate changes in a House-Senate conference before passing a final bill. Since any bill that emerged from conference that differed from the Senate bill would have to pass the Senate over another Republican filibuster, most House Democrats agreed to pass the Senate bill on condition that it be <b>amended</b> <b>by</b> a subsequent bill. They drafted the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which could be passed by the reconciliation process.|$|E

5|$|Like other U.S. states, the {{structure}} of the government of South Dakota follows the same separation of powers as the federal government, with executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

5|$|In May 1995, Belarus held a {{referendum}} on changing its national symbols; the referendum also made the Russian language equal to Belarusian, and forged closer economic ties to Russia. Lukashenko was also given the ability to disband the Supreme Soviet by decree. In the summer of 1996, deputies of the 199-member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges of violating the Constitution. Shortly after that, {{a referendum}} was held on 24 November 1996 in which four questions were offered by Lukashenko and three offered {{by a group of}} Parliament members. The questions ranged from social issues (changing independence day to 3 July, abolition of the death penalty) to the national constitution. As a result of the referendum, the constitution that was <b>amended</b> <b>by</b> Lukashenko was accepted and the one <b>amended</b> <b>by</b> the Supreme Soviet was voided. The new document dramatically increased Lukashenko's power and transformed his presidency into a de facto legal dictatorship. His decrees now had the force of law, and he also acquired near-total control over government spending. On 25 November, it was announced that 70.5% of voters, of an 84% turnout, had approved the amended constitution. The US and the EU, however, refused to accept the legitimacy of the referendum.|$|E

5|$|John Jackson, Patrick Martin and Harriet Hughes, {{all members}} of the Countryside Alliance, sought {{judicial}} review of the use of the Parliament Acts to pass the Hunting Act. They claimed that the 1949 Act had not been lawfully passed either because the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself or because it provided a method of making delegated or subordinate legislation which could not alter the process of legislating. Consequently, they claimed, the 1949 Act had not reduced the delay specified in the 1911 Act and the Hunting Act, which was passed only in accordance with the requirements as <b>amended</b> <b>by</b> the 1949 Act, was invalid.|$|E

5|$|In the House, {{desultory}} {{debate on}} Fraser's censure motion ended with it being <b>amended</b> <b>by</b> the ALP majority into a condemnation of Fraser and passed on a party line vote. By 2.34pm, when Fraser rose {{and announced that}} he had been commissioned as Prime Minister, word of the dismissal had spread through the House. Fraser announced his intent to advise a double dissolution, and moved that the House adjourn. His motion was defeated. Fraser's new government suffered repeated defeats in the House, which passed a motion of no confidence in him, and asked the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to urge the Governor-General to recommission Whitlam. Scholes, attempting to communicate this to the Governor General, was initially told that an appointment might not be possible that day, but after stating that he would reconvene the House and tell them of the refusal, was given an appointment with Kerr for 4.45pm.|$|E

5|$|Section 207 {{repealed}} obsolete {{limitations on}} wastage in the Mint's operations, but directed that administrative regulations be developed on the subject, {{which could be}} more easily changed. Section 208 repealed a provision of the 1873 act requiring coinage dies for the obverse, which are dated, to be destroyed {{at the end of}} each year. Section 209 rephrased statutory provisions allowing the Treasury to sell silver at a price not less than $1.292929 per ounce, and allowed it to sell silver to other government departments for less. Section 210 repealed the 1933 provision regarding the legal tender status of coins.The law prior to 1965 made it a felony to forge silver coins; this was <b>amended</b> <b>by</b> section 211 to forbid the counterfeiting of coins with denomination greater than five cents. Section 212 made using coins as security for loans a misdemeanor if the secretary hasemade a proclamation in the Federal Register proscribing their use as collateral.|$|E

5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as <b>amended</b> <b>by</b> the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E
