5|$|Brown entered Massillon Washington High School in 1922. Although {{he played}} {{football}} as a child, Brown was undersized {{for the game}} at less than 150 pounds <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> focused his athletic energies on the pole vault. Harry Stuhldreher, {{who went on to}} be one of Notre Dame's legendary Four Horsemen, was then the high school quarterback. But Massillon coach Dave Stewart saw Brown's determination to be a good vaulter despite his small size and brought him onto the football team; as a junior in 1924, he took over as the starting quarterback. Massillon posted a win-loss record of 15–3 in Brown's junior and senior years as the starter.|$|E
5|$|Charlton {{arrived at}} C Company of the regiment's 1st Battalion in early 1951, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> was {{regarded}} with suspicion by officers and leaders in his unit. A Sergeant, {{he was made}} a squad leader in the 3rd Platoon, and quickly impressed his unit's company commander with his natural leadership ability, and soon his squad was considered a model unit. In May 1951, Charlton was made the platoon sergeant and his commander had recommended him for a battlefield commission.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} {{started in}} March 1990, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> two technical methods for constructing the pontoon bridge were considered: a continuous concrete floating caisson between the abutments, and a steel version incorporating a truss bridge carrying concrete pontoons. However, {{they were both}} rejected {{in favor of a}} concrete or steel box section borne on concrete pontoons.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Richard Maibaum {{provided}} the screenplay, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> {{he tried to}} incorporate ideas {{from all of the}} other writers into his script. Maibaum's original script featured an alliance of international terrorists attacking SPECTRE's headquarters and deposing Blofeld, before trying to destroy the world for themselves {{to make way for a}} New World Order. However, this was shelved.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the planet Saturn, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> mistook its rings for planets, {{thinking it was}} a three-bodied system. When he {{observed the}} planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think {{that two of the}} bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.|$|E
5|$|Kisnorbo's {{first goal}} for Leicester came on 15 October 2005 against Watford at Vicarage Road, {{which turned out}} to be the match winner. His initial {{appearances}} for Leicester were as a midfielder, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> he failed to adjust and was booed by his own fans during a 2–1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday. However, a move back to defence resulted in a change in fortunes for Kisnorbo, and his partnership with then-teammate Paddy McCarthy was instrumental in helping Leicester avoid relegation to League One that season.|$|E

Each station {{has at least one}} Passenger Help Point and all stations and car parks have CCTV. All stations on the branch are unstaffed, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> lacked any ticket issuing facilities; but in late 2009 a Scheidt & Bachmann Ticket XPress self-service ticket machine was installed at each station.|$|E
5|$|One {{large group}} of fires {{was known as the}} Snake River Complex. These fires were in the {{southern}} section of the park, in the headwaters region of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.|$|E
5|$|Other legal {{troubles}} {{were left}} over in {{wake of the}} expansion collapse. Louisiana courts eventually ordered the Gliebermans to repay Shreveport US$1 million with interest; the dispute centered over whether the city had agreed to share losses or simply lent money to the ownership group. Art Williams, enraged after discovering some American owners had received discounts and extended payment periods on their franchise fees, threatened litigation <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> refused to honour the balance of Matt Dunigan's sizable contract before the matter was dragged through court.|$|E

5|$|The District {{also had}} {{parliamentary}} permission to extend westward from Brompton and, on 12 April 1869, it opened a single-track line to West Brompton on the WLR. There were no intermediate stations <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> this service operated as a shuttle. By summer 1869 separate tracks {{had been laid}} between South Kensington and Brompton and from Kensington (High Street) to a junction with the line to West Brompton. During the night of 5 July 1870 the District secretly built the disputed Cromwell curve connecting Brompton and Kensington (High Street).|$|E
5|$|Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport A/S {{was founded}} on 26 March 1946 by Ludvig G. Braathen through his {{shipping}} company Braathens Rederi. Share capital was , plus loans from the shipping company. Braathens had made good money during World War II with the participation in the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission, and received permission to use US$1 million to purchase aircraft. The idea to start an airline had occurred to Braathen in 1936, when the ship Brajara had engine trouble while en route to Japan. The Japanese shipyards could not guarantee that they could repair the ship, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> it was considered whether the ship should be towed to Europe for repairs. The solution chosen was instead to have the necessary piece made in Amsterdam and flown by KLM. Braathen wanted to have an airline that {{would be able to}} fly crew and supplies to his and other ships throughout the world—primarily in the Far East.|$|E
5|$|Fruit, {{fish and}} wild pigs provide {{plentiful}} food, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> the boys' {{life on the}} island is idyllic. They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions: a broken telescope, an iron-bound oar, and a small axe. Their first contact with other humans comes after several months when they observe two large outrigger canoes in the distance, one pursued by the other. The two groups of Polynesians disembark {{on the beach and}} engage in battle; the victors take fifteen prisoners, and kill and eat one immediately. But when they threaten to kill one of the three women captured, along with two children, the boys intervene to defeat the pursuers, earning them the gratitude of the chief, Tararo. The next morning they prevent another act of cannibalism. The natives leave, and the boys are alone once more.|$|E

5|$|In 1666 as the Great Fire of London {{swept through}} the city, Derby Place, the College's home since 1555, was {{completely}} gutted and destroyed. Fortunately the College's library was saved, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> was stored in the Palace of Whitehall, then later moved to the Palace of Westminster, where a temporary office was opened in an apartment called the Queen's court. An announcement was also made in the London Gazette to draw public notice to the situation. Due to a shortage of funds, the planned rebuilding of a new College was delayed until 1670. It was then that Francis Sandford, the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant and Morris Emmett, the King's bricklayer, were together able to design and begin {{construction of a new}} structure on the old site. The costs of the rebuilding was financed in stages, and the structure was erected slowly in parts.The heralds contributed significantly out of their own pockets; at the same time, they also sought subscriptions among the nobility, with the names of contributors recorded into a series of splendid manuscripts known as the Benefactors Books.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, McCaw started {{attempts}} to sell either Orca Bay or the Grizzlies, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> negotiated {{an agreement with}} Dennis Washington, owner of Seaspan, who had {{a large portion of}} his operations in Vancouver. Washington initially agreed to purchase 50% of Orca Bay, with the intent of keeping the teams in Vancouver. Instead, McCaw used Washington's bid to leverage a higher sales price with Bill Laurie, who offered US$148million for the Grizzlies, and a US$52million bonus if the team ultimately relocated to St. Louis. The announcement was made in September1999, one month after Laurie had bought the NHL team St. Louis Blues and their home venue Kiel Center (now Scottrade Center). St. Louis had not been the home of an NBA franchise since the Hawks franchise relocated to Atlanta in 1968. Kiel Center had annual sell-out for 15 to 17 basketball games for the Saint Louis University Billikens.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E

5|$|Instability and {{violence}} marked the family: it moved frequently, {{and much of}} Lépine's early childhood was spent in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, where his father was working for a Swiss mutual funds company. The family returned to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before a stock market crash led {{to the loss of}} much of the family's assets. Rachid was an authoritarian, possessive and jealous man, frequently violent towards his wife and his children. He had contempt for women and believed that they were intended only to serve men. He required his wife to act as his personal secretary, slapping her if she made any errors in typing, and forcing her to retype documents in spite of the cries of their toddler. He was also neglectful and abusive towards his children, particularly his son, and discouraged any tenderness, as he considered it spoiling. In 1970, following an incident in which Rachid struck Gamil so hard that the marks on his face were visible a week later, his mother decided to leave. The legal separation was finalized in 1971, and the divorce in 1976. Following the separation, Gamil lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia; soon after, their home and possessions were seized when Rachid defaulted on mortgage payments. Gamil was afraid of his father, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> saw him on weekly supervised visits. The visits ended quickly, as Rachid ceased contact with his children soon after the separation. Gamil never again saw his father, and in the future refused to discuss him with others.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the causes}} of the Breeders' hiatus, by early 1995 Deal {{believed}} her next album would be a solo one, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first</b> intended to play all instruments on it herself. Back at her home in Dayton, Ohio, she practiced the drums and initially prepared six songs for recording. Around the same time, she produced some tracks for Guided by Voices at Easley Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. While there, Deal used a portion of the studio time to record demos for some of her new songs. As an attempt to distract her sister from her drug problems, Deal recruited Kelley to play on three songs at this initial recording session. Kelley's involvement changed Deal's mind about playing all the instruments herself, and she began to conceptualize the album as a band project.|$|E
5|$|Their {{frustration}} clearly apparent, the Virginia Tech offense fared {{no better}} on their next possession. Two plays were stopped for no gain, {{and the only}} positive play—a five-yard pass to Eddie Royal—was negated by a false start penalty. The Hokies were again forced to punt the ball away to Florida State, their fifth of the game. The punt allowed FSU to start at their own 46-yard line, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>first,</b> the Seminoles were able to capitalize on that opportunity, showing some of the effectiveness that characterized their prior drive. Lorenzo Booker ran for 24yards on two plays, but afterwards, Drew Weatherford threw two incompletions. A false start penalty backed up the Seminoles, who were forced to punt after failing {{to pick up the}} first down. The kick was an excellent one, and Florida State's special teams were able to get downfield and stop the ball inside the Virginia Tech one-yard line, again hurting the Hokie offense.|$|E
