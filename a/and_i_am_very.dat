[...] This meant he was easily persuaded to sign official statements, including a denunciation of Andrei Sakharov in 1973; {{on the other hand}} he was willing to try to help constituents in his capacities as chairman of the Composers' Union and Deputy to the Supreme Soviet. Oleg Prokofiev commented that [...] "he tried to help so many people that... less and less attention was paid to his pleas."

I am pro-environment: I think that climate change is a major threat that we need to address. I am pro-free trade: I think we should be concluding new trade treaties rather than pulling out of old ones. I am strong on defense: I {{think we need to}} beef up our military to cope with multiple enemies. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> much in favor of America acting as a world leader: I believe it is in our own self-interest to promote and defend freedom and free markets as we have been doing {{in one form or another}} since at least 1898." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Bill Shankly {{was asked}} after the match whether Leeds United had failed during the season: [...] "Failed? Second in the championship. Cup finalists.

500|$|Some {{well-known}} British actors, {{who have}} not appeared in the series, were asked in jest why {{they had not been}} cast. When David Yates was directing the fifth film, Bill Nighy (who knew Yates personally) said that he hoped the director would cast him in Harry Potter. [...] "But nobody called", Nighy added. However, in 2009, Yates cast Nighy as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in the seventh film. Nighy said, [...] "I am no longer the only English actor not to be in Harry Potter <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> pleased." [...] Jude Law once quipped, [...] "Nobody's asked me.

After a prolonged absence, during which Crawford was accused of feigning illness, Aldrich was forced to replace her with Olivia de Havilland. Crawford claimed to be devastated, saying [...] "I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed ... I cried for nine hours." [...] Crawford nursed grudges against Davis and Aldrich {{for the rest of}} her life, saying of Aldrich, [...] "He is a man who loves evil, horrendous, vile things", to which Aldrich replied, [...] "If the shoe fits, wear it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> fond of Miss Crawford."

500|$|Lane {{was born}} near Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on July 15, 1864, {{the first of}} four {{children}} of Christopher Lane and the former Caroline Burns. [...] Christopher Lane was a preacher who owned a farm outside Charlottetown; when his voice began to fail, he became a dentist. The elder Lane, disliking the island colony's cold climate, moved with his family to Napa, California in 1871, and to Oakland in 1876, where Franklin graduated from Oakland High School. [...] Franklin Lane was hired to work in the printing office of the Oakland Times, then worked as a reporter, and in 1884 campaigned for the Prohibition Party. From 1884 to 1886, he attended the University of California at Berkeley, though he did not graduate. [...] Lane later wrote, [...] "I put myself through college by working on vacation and after hours, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> glad I did it." [...] He later received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of California, from New York University, Brown University, and the University of North Carolina. [...] After leaving college, he worked as a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle. In 1889, he was admitted to the California Bar, having attended Hastings Law School.|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{of all four}} classes appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Tréluyer was delighted with the victory, saying: [...] "What a race, It was a tough lights-to-flag job, just like at Silverstone, but it was huge fun and we’re already looking forward to Le Mans." [...] He further stated: [...] "We did it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> happy for the team {{because we had a}} really strong weekend and it feels great to win in this fashion." [...] Lotterer said of the result: [...] "It's no holds barred all the time and is very fun, especially at Spa-Francorchamps. It's for this type of race that we hit track." [...] Dumas, who finished in second alongside Lieb and Jani, stated he found driving in dry weather conditions difficult because he was not experienced participating in such conditions. Lieb said his battle with Tréluyer was [...] "great" [...] and said the contact between the two drivers was part of motor racing. Jani stated while he did not win the race he praised his car. Third-place co-finisher Webber said that his team had [...] "too many own goals" [...] and that they did not wanted to be [...] "gifted results" [...] if they were not performing at the highest level. Bernhard said that despite taking the stop-and-go penalty his team did not give up and gave it their best effort to stand on the podium.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was against}} Wimbledon. Wright after six minutes gave Arsenal the lead, only for Vinnie Jones to {{head in the}} equaliser, close to half time. Merson scored Arsenal's second, but Marcus Gayle replied immediately, [...] "bund the ball past (David) Seaman". An own goal by Nigel Winterburn against Manchester United ended the champions run of three matches without a win and {{extended}} a barren run of Arsenal failing to score at Old Trafford since {{the creation of the}} Premier League. Wenger told the press he was not despondent about his first defeat as Arsenal manager: [...] "Obviously, the way we lost was difficult to accept, but I'm happy with the way we played. Our organisation was excellent, we kept fighting <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>very</b> optimistic for the future." [...] Attention soon turned to the North London derby, where Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur on 24 November 1996. Arsenal had not beaten their neighbours in over three years and Tottenham were unbeaten at Highbury since September 1991. The match had ramifications in the league: a win potentially placed Arsenal in a position to move into first spot, if other results went in their favour. In the match, Wright put Arsenal into the lead through a penalty, but after 57 minutes, Sol Campbell headed on a long throw for Tottenham and the ball fell to Andy Sinton, whose shot [...] "cannoned off the inside of the near post, then hit Lukic on the head and rebounded into the net". Two minutes before the 90-minute mark, Tony Adams scored the winner and in injury time, Bergkamp added a third: he controlled a high ball with his left foot and evaded his marker Stephen Carr in a tight area to shoot. A 2–1 win against title challengers Newcastle United, having played three-quarters of the match with ten men, moved Arsenal back {{to the top of the}} table.|$|E
