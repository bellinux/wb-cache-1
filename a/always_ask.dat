25|$|In Pushkin's time, {{the early}} 19th century, duels were very {{strictly}} regulated. A second's primary duty was {{to prevent the}} duel from actually happening, and only when both combatants were unwilling to stand down were they {{to make sure that}} the duel proceeded according to formalised rules. A challenger's second should therefore <b>always</b> <b>ask</b> the challenged party if he wants to apologise for his actions that have led to the challenge.|$|E

500|$|The video depicts {{an ongoing}} {{conflict}} between gangs, which Ferreira attempts to remedy upon her arrival; she is eventually taken {{in for questioning}} by law enforcement, although she resists her arrest and later escapes from jail. She commented that its concept was inspired by real events, and elaborated that [...] "people <b>always</b> <b>ask</b> me questions about certain things, and it's kind of like my response." [...] Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork Media interpreted Ferreira's commentary to be referencing her arrest in September 2013, {{in which she was}} charged with possession of ecstasy. Ferreira was criticized on social media networks for allegedly objectifying African American people in the music video, with whom she was seen dancing with during several scenes interspersed throughout the clip. On her Facebook account, Ferreira commented that [...] "I never have and never will look at any human being as a prop" [...] and criticized false assumptions of the [...] "rich little white girl exploiting the black people and the ghetto".|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{was unsure}} {{as to what}} to call the Christmas exchange. He had heard the names [...] "Nasty Christmas", [...] "White Elephant", and [...] "Yankee Swap" [...] used to {{describe}} the game, and so he wrote all three into the script in order [...] "to cover all regions of the country". Schur created a list of who receives what gift in order to preserve continuity in the episode. Gifts featured in the episode include Toby giving Angela a baby poster, Kelly getting Oscar a shower radio, Michael buying Ryan an iPod, Kevin buying a foot bath for himself, Creed giving Jim an old shirt, Oscar buying Creed a keychain, and Jim purchasing Pam a teapot. The teapot was chosen because it needed to fit other gifts inside of it, as well as be something that Dwight could have a use for later on in the episode. Fischer was allowed to pick the color of the teapot featured in the episode. She picked teal, due to it being her then-husband James Gunn's favorite color. Jenna Fischer recalled that fans <b>always</b> <b>ask</b> her what Jim wrote in Pam's note. Fischer noted that John Krasinski wrote the note himself and that the contents are [...] "a secret". Jim finally gives Pam the note in the penultimate ninth season episode [...] "A.A.R.M." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, {{some people}} have {{considered}} that the song's opening guitar arpeggios bear a close resemblance to the 1968 instrumental [...] "Taurus" [...] by the Los Angeles-based rock band Spirit, written by Spirit guitarist Randy California. In the liner notes to the 1996 reissue of Spirit's self-titled debut album, California wrote: [...] "People <b>always</b> <b>ask</b> me why [...] "Stairway to Heaven" [...] sounds exactly like [...] "Taurus", which was released two years earlier.

2500|$|Bardeen was a {{man with}} a very unassuming personality. While he served as a {{professor}} for almost 40years at the University of Illinois, he was best remembered by neighbors for hosting cookouts where he would cook for his friends, many of whom were unaware of his accomplishments at the university. He would <b>always</b> <b>ask</b> his guests if they liked the hamburger bun toasted (since he liked his that way). [...] He enjoyed playing golf and going on picnics with his family. [...] Lillian Hoddeson, a University of Illinois historian who wrote a book on Bardeen, said that because he [...] "differed radically from the popular stereotype of 'genius' and was uninterested in appearing other than ordinary, the public and the media often overlooked him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both Johnny Marr and Morrissey have {{repeatedly}} {{said that they}} will not reunite the band. In 2006, Morrissey declared, [...] "I would rather eat my own testicles than reform the Smiths, and that's saying something for a vegetarian." [...] When asked why in another interview the same year, he responded, [...] "I feel as if I've worked very hard since the demise of the Smiths and the others haven't, so why hand them attention that they haven't earned? We are not friends, we don't see each other. Why on earth would we be on a stage together?"

2500|$|As Headmaster of Choate, George St. John's chapel talks {{included}} a recurring phrase that was widely remembered by Choate alumni. In 2008, school archivist Judy Donald found the phrase in St. John's notebooks, and in 2011 journalist Chris Matthews published the discovery in his biography of JFK. St. John's phrase (borrowed from Harvard dean LeBaron Briggs) was, [...] "The youth who loves {{his alma mater}} will <b>always</b> <b>ask</b> not 'What can she do for me?' but 'What can I do for her?'" [...] Speculation {{that this was the}} original of JFK's inaugural address [...] "Ask not" [...] goes back {{at least as far as}} a 1966 Time magazine article, and several of JFK's Choate contemporaries noticed the echo in 1961. Kennedy graduated from Choate in 1935. In senior class polling for the yearbook (of which he was business manager), Kennedy was voted Most Likely to Succeed.|$|E
2500|$|I soon {{got used}} to this singing; for the sailors never touched a rope without it. Sometimes, when no one {{happened}} to strike up, and the pulling, whatever it might be, {{did not seem to}} be getting forward very well, the mate would always say, [...] "Come, men, can't any of you sing? Sing now, and raise the dead." [...] And then some one of them would begin, and if every man's arms were as much relieved as mine by the song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a cheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath expended on it. It is a great thing in a sailor to know how to sing well, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal of popularity among his shipmates. Some sea-captains, before shipping a man, <b>always</b> <b>ask</b> him whether he can sing out at a rope.|$|E
2500|$|Following Gödel, we can {{interpret}} the dust particles as galaxies, {{so that the}} Gödel solution becomes a cosmological model of a rotating universe. Besides rotating, this model exhibits no Hubble expansion, {{so it is not}} a realistic model of the universe in which we live, but can be taken as illustrating an alternative universe which would in principle be allowed by general relativity (if one admits the legitimacy of a nonzero cosmological constant). Less well known solutions of Gödel's exhibit both rotation and Hubble expansion and have other qualities of his first model, but travelling into the past is not possible. According to S. W. Hawking, these models could well be a reasonable description of the universe that we observe, however observational data are compatible only with a very low rate of rotation. The quality of these observations improved continually up until Gödel's death, and he would <b>always</b> <b>ask</b> [...] "is the universe rotating yet?" [...] and be told [...] "no, it isn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Outhwaite {{has been}} asked {{numerous}} times {{about the possibility of}} Mel returning to EastEnders since her departure. At various stages she replied [...] "never say never" [...] when asked if she would return but also insisted the time was not right. Although she has always refused to rule out the possibility of a future return, in 2010 she pondered that a return would be unlikely as the character did not have links in the current cast, and that she had never been asked back anyway, stating: [...] "People <b>always</b> <b>ask</b> me, but I've never been asked! It looks like I'm turning it down on a yearly basis, but I'm not. They've never asked me! So they don't want me back for one and I don't have any family left on the show. There's nobody on the Square she knows, I don't even think any of Mel's friends are still in it ... I could walk down the market and be an extra, I suppose! [...] I don't know how Mel would return because there's no-one there for her to return to. She doesn't really know anyone apart from Ian Beale and Phil Mitchell. So unless she was coming back to see one of them..." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, who worshiped {{and taught}} Islamic studies at Dar Al-Hijrah, {{for which he}} also was a camp counselor, was charged by U.S. {{prosecutors}} with plotting with members of al-Qaeda to assassinate President George W. Bush, Abdul-Malik said in February 2005: [...] "Our whole community is under siege. They don't see this as a case of criminality. They see it as a civil rights case. As a frontal attack on their community." [...] He added: [...] "The feeling I get here on a daily basis must be {{what it was like to}} be a member of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church following the case of Rosa Parks. People <b>always</b> <b>ask,</b> 'What is the latest from the courthouse?'" [...] Abdul-Malik accused the government of singling out Abu Ali to stir anti-Muslim sentiment. Abu Ali was convicted in 2005 of providing material support to the al-Qaeda terrorist network, and conspiracy to assassinate President Bush, and is serving a life sentence. [...] When in April 2005 Ali al-Timimi of Fairfax, Virginia, an American-born Muslim cleric, was convicted of inciting followers to wage war against the US just days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and of recruiting for the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the paintball terrorist cell, Abdul-Malik said: [...] "There is a view many Muslims have when they come to America that you could not be arrested for something you say. But now they have discovered they are not free to speak their minds. And if our opinions are out of vogue in the current climate, we feel we are all at risk." [...] Al-Timimi was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} adapt Pettibon's artwork {{to meet the}} layout {{requirements}} of their albums and flyers, the members of Black Flag would alter it by cutting and pasting and adding their name, logo, and gig details to it. They would then make photocopies and put up dozens of flyers to promote their shows. Rollins recalls {{going out on a}} flyering mission with roadie Mugger in 1981 in which the pair would put a layer of paste onto a telephone pole, stick up the flyer, and then cover it with an additional coat of paste so that it would last for up to a year. The band members and their crew would do this for miles around, using dozens of flyers to promote a single performance. Pettibon, however, did not always appreciate the band's treatment of his art, which he provided to them largely for free. [...] "To me my work was the equivalent of a band like Black Flag or any other band who was righteously self-protective of recordings. I would give them original art and it would come back to me scrawled upon and taped over or whited out, and I'd <b>always</b> <b>ask</b> nicely, 'Could you please make a copy of this first and then do that?' Their master tapes were deemed sacrosanct, while my work was seen as completely disposable, but I'm not venting or complaining, just stating fact." [...] Pettibon also felt pigeonholed by his association with the band, and had a falling out with them in 1985 over artwork used {{on the cover of the}} Loose Nut album, which had been used for a flyer several years earlier. Ginn resurrected it without telling his brother and turned it over to drummer Bill Stevenson to do the layout, who cut it into pieces and used them as elements for the cover and lyric sheet. Pettibon became irate and he and Ginn stopped speaking for some time, though his artwork continued to be used for the remainder of the band's career.|$|E
