25|$|The 1839 Treaty of London {{recognised}} Belgium as {{an independent}} and neutral state. Until 1911, Belgian strategic analysis anticipated that if war came, the Germans would attack France across the Franco-German border and trap the French armies against the Belgian frontier, as they had done in 1870. British and French guarantees of Belgian independence were made before 1914 but the possibility of landings in Antwerp was floated by the British military attaché in 1906 and 1911, which led the Belgians {{to suspect that the}} British had come to see Belgian neutrality as a matter of British diplomatic and military advantage, rather than <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> The Agadir Crisis (1911) left the Belgian government in little doubt as to the risk of a European war and an invasion of Belgium by Germany. In September 1911, a government meeting concluded that Belgium must be prepared to resist a German invasion, to avoid accusations of collusion by the British and French governments. Britain, France and the Netherlands were also to continue to be treated as potential enemies. In 1913 and 1914, the Germans made inquires to the Belgian military attaché in Berlin, about the passage of German military forces through Belgium. If invaded, Belgium would need foreign help but would not treat foreign powers as allies or form objectives beyond the maintenance of Belgian independence. Neutrality forced the Belgian government into a strategy of military independence, based on a rearmament programme begun in 1909, which was expected to be complete in 1926. The Belgian plan was to have three army corps, to reduce the numerical advantage of the German armies over the French, intended to deter a German invasion.|$|E

500|$|The {{election}} in 1860 {{for the position}} of Boden Professor of Sanskrit at the University of Oxford was a hotly contested affair between two rival candidates offering different approaches to Sanskrit scholarship. One was Monier Williams, an Oxford-educated Englishman who had spent 14 years teaching Sanskrit to those preparing to work in British India for the East India Company. The other, Max Müller, was a German-born lecturer at Oxford specialising in comparative philology, the science of language. He had spent many years working on an edition of the Rig Veda (an ancient collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns), and had gained an international reputation for his scholarship. Williams, in contrast, worked on later material and had little time for the [...] "continental" [...] school of Sanskrit scholarship that Müller exemplified. Williams regarded the study of Sanskrit {{as a means to}} an end, namely the conversion of India to Christianity. For Müller, his work, while it would assist missionaries, was also valuable <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b>|$|E
500|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin. It is {{a profile of}} an Illinois Christian {{fundamentalist}} school—its policies, practices, and participants. Peshkin, then Professor of Education at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, intended his account to be both impartial and [...] "empathetic". He presents the fundamentalists as disciplined, dedicated, and determined with [...] "formulas for success" [...] opposite [...] "fragmented and defensive" [...] detractors. They believe in [...] "one Truth"—God's plan—and reject philosophies of multiple truths. A teacher told Peshkin that {{their job is to}} prepare students for this [...] "one pattern" [...] of thought. In turn, the community's constituents do not wish to leave, but appreciate conformity <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> Peshkin describes the school as a [...] "total institution": a place where many similar people live by their own formal rules apart from outside society, as based on Erving Goffman's 1961 essay. Peshkin asserts that this was a natural conclusion from a school [...] "based on absolute truth". God's Choice was the third book in his series of studies on school–community relationships. It was published by the University of Chicago Press.|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} is notable for both its adherence to academic tradition (the {{mastery of the}} figure <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself),</b> and its uniqueness in transposing the male nude to an outdoor setting. The depiction of someone diving into water was very rare {{in the history of}} Western art. The other figures are artfully arranged to imply a continuous narrative of movement, the poses progressing [...] "from reclining to sitting to standing to diving"; at the same time, each figure is carefully positioned so that no genitalia are visible. As in his previous works, Eakins chose to include a self-portrait, here as the swimmer at bottom-right. Unlike his appearances in The Gross Clinic or Max Schmitt in a Single Scull, here the artist's presence is more ambiguous—he may be seen as companion, teacher, or voyeur. The ripple in the water next to Eakins, and the bubbles around the diver, are the only indications of movement in a painting where motion is otherwise arrested; the water next to the red-headed figure in the lake is still enough to offer a clear reflection. This contrast underscores the tension in the picture between classical prototypes and scientific naturalism.|$|E

500|$|Virtue {{ethics is}} a form of ethical theory which {{emphasizes}} the character of an agent, rather than specific acts; many of its proponents have criticised Kant's deontological approach to ethics. Elizabeth Anscombe criticised modern ethical theories, including Kantian ethics, for their obsession with law and obligation. As well as arguing that theories which rely on a universal moral law are too rigid, Anscombe suggested that, because a moral law implies a moral lawgiver, they are irrelevant in modern secular society. In his work After Virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre criticises Kant's formulation of universalisability, arguing that various trivial and immoral maxims can pass the test, such as [...] "Keep all your promises throughout your entire life except one". He further challenges Kant's formulation of humanity <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> by arguing that Kant provided no reason to treat others as means: the maxim [...] "Let everyone except me be treated as a means", though seemingly immoral, can be universalized. Bernard Williams argues that, by abstracting persons from character, Kant misrepresents persons and morality and Philippa Foot identified Kant as one of a select group of philosophers responsible for the neglect of virtue by analytic philosophy.|$|E
500|$|Kantian ethics {{refers to}} a deontological ethical theory {{ascribed}} to the German philosopher Immanuel [...] Kant. The theory, developed {{as a result of}} Enlightenment rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will; an action can only be good if its maximthe principle behind itis duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalizability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. [...] If a contradictions occur the act violates Aristotle's [...] "Non-contradiction" [...] concept which states that just actions cannot lead to contradictions. Kant's formulation of humanity, the second section of the Categorical Imperative states that <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> humans are required never to treat others merely as a means to an end, but always additionally, as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. A perfect duty, such as the duty not to lie, always holds true; an imperfect duty, such as the duty to give to charity, can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place.|$|E

[...] Kant's theory looks at the act only, and not at its outcomes and consequences, and claims that one is ethically required to consider whether one would be willing to universalise the act: to claim everyone should behave that way. Kant argues that choosing to commit suicide entails considering oneself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means to <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> which he rejects: a person, he says, must not be used [...] "merely as means, but must in all actions always be considered <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>in</b> himself."
