5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find <b>and</b> <b>kill,</b> <b>the</b> quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E

5|$|Phase {{contrast}} and {{differential interference contrast}} (DIC) microscopy are important tools in biology and medicine. Most animal cells and single-celled organisms have very little color, and their intracellular organelles are almost totally invisible under simple bright field illumination. These structures can be made visible by staining the specimens, but staining procedures are time-consuming <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> <b>the</b> cells. As seen in Figs.24 and25, phase {{contrast and}} DIC microscopes allow unstained, living cells to be studied. DIC also has non-biological applications, for example {{in the analysis of}} planar silicon semiconductor processing.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} machinations of Yelü Yixin, {{the only other}} event of note from Emperor Daozong's rule was a war fought between 1092 and 1102 between the Liao and a Mongolian, {{possibly}} Tatar tribe, group known as the Zubu. The Zubu were located at the northwest border of Liao territory and had fought several wars with the Liao when the Liao tried to expand in that direction. In 1092 the Liao attacked several other tribes in the northwest, and by 1093 the Zubu attacked the Liao, striking deep into Khitan territory. It took until 1100 for the Liao to capture <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> <b>the</b> Zubu chieftain, and another two years to fight off the remaining Zubu forces. The war against the Zubu was the last successful military campaign waged by the Liao dynasty.|$|E

5|$|During the 18th century, {{there was}} a frenzy of vampire {{sightings}} in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> <b>the</b> potential revenants. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, {{the first to be}} officially recorded, involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevich and Miloš Čečar from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have {{died at the age of}} 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.|$|E
5|$|In New York, Kilo and Lily {{land in the}} Downzone {{where the}} unchipped, lower-class {{population}} lives.

After his chips regain function, Kilo is given orders to either capture or kill Lily. After fighting off subverters, Kilo learns their leader Kris—Lily's ex-boyfriend and colleague—is responsible for instigating a war between the syndicates. Kris reveals he started the war so he could hack into the dataverse <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> <b>the</b> syndicates and their chipped populations as punishment for abandoning the unchipped. Lily, who wants to find a peaceful solution and make the syndicates care about the unchipped, opposes the idea. Kilo fights Kris, who attempts to suicide bomb him but kills himself instead.

5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> <b>the</b> dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his dead body.|$|E
5|$|Keen gets to {{the girl}} first but loses her in a daring raid by Zamani's forces. Now aware of Keen, Zamani attacks her husband, Tom, in their home, gravely {{wounding}} him. Keen notes a stamp on the man’s hand and deduces the attack {{will take place at}} a zoo. Reddington briefly escapes custody to meet with Zamani, revealing that unbeknownst to the FBI, he masterminded the ploy, as well as the attack on Tom. Reddington removes the tracking device and places it with Zamani, which helps the FBI track down <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> <b>the</b> latter. Keen finds the daughter and a bomb in her backpack. Reddington calls in a clandestine bomb tech to disable the bomb, who then escapes with it. Reddington tells Elizabeth that her husband, with whom she is trying to adopt a baby, is not what he appears to be.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} genera of ants. Myrmecia ants usually display {{defensive}} behaviour only around their nests, and are more timid while foraging. However, most species are extremely aggressive towards intruders; a few, such as M. tarsata, are timid, and the workers retreat into their nest instead of pursuing the intruder. If a nest is disturbed, a large force of workers rapidly swarms out of their nest to attack <b>and</b> <b>kill</b> <b>the</b> intruder. Some species, particularly those of the M. nigrocincta and M. pilosula species groups, are capable of jumping several inches when they are agitated after their nest has been disturbed; jumper ants propel their jumps by a sudden extension of their middle and hind legs. M. pyriformis is considered the most dangerous ant in the world by the Guinness World Records. M. inquilina is the only species of this genus that is considered vulnerable by the IUCN, although the conservation status needs updating.|$|E
