Their function is to help control riots. Modified stock cars will have caged windows for protection against objects thrown at them and could include mini-buses, 4x4s or prisoner transport vans. APCs usually will not require any added protection but their modifications might include some sort of tear gas ejecting method or shields that unfold to create barriers. The water cannon vehicles are used either to break up riots or extinguish fires set by the rioters. Although plain water is usually used some variations might include tear gas or special dye (to mark {{the people that are}} present for later apprehension). Previously fire trucks were used as anti-riot vehicles of this type. As a non lethal, and effective method of clearing out protesters or rioters, the Long Range <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Device</b> (LRAD) can be used. The LRAD is a device that can send announcements, warnings, and harmful pain-inducing tones.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of a resonant tube {{on the performance of}} acoustic standing wave-based levitation <b>device</b> (<b>acoustic</b> levitation <b>device</b> hereinafter) is studied by analyzing the acoustic pressure and levitation force of four types of <b>acoustic</b> levitation <b>devices</b> without a resonance tube and with resonance tubes of different radii R using ANSYS and MATLAB. Introducing a resonance tube either enhances or weakens the levitation strength of <b>acoustic</b> levitation <b>device,</b> depending on the resonance tube radii. Specifically, the levitation force is improved to a maximum degree when the resonance tube radius is slightly larger than the size of the reflector end face. Furthermore, the stability of <b>acoustic</b> levitation <b>device</b> is improved to a maximum degree by introducing a resonance tube of R= 1. 023 λ. The experimental platform and levitation force measurement system of the <b>acoustic</b> levitation <b>device</b> with concave-end-face-type emitter and reflector are developed, and the test of suspended matters and liquid drops is conducted. Results show that the Φ 6. 5 -mm steel ball is suspended easily when the resonance tube radius is 1. 023 λ, and the Φ 5. 5 -mm steel ball cannot be suspended when the resonance tube radius is 1. 251 λ. The levitation capability of the original <b>acoustic</b> levitation <b>device</b> without a resonance tube is weakened when a resonance tube of R= 1. 251 λ is applied. These results are consistent with the ANSYS simulation results. The levitation time of the liquid droplet with a resonance tube of R= 1. 023 λ is longer than without a resonance tube. This result is also supported by the MATLAB simulation results. Therefore, the performance of <b>acoustic</b> levitation <b>device</b> can be improved by introducing a resonant tube with an appropriate radius...|$|R
