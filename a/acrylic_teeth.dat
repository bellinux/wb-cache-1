MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty disc-shaped specimens (40 mm x 3 mm) were fabricated from two different brands (Artiplus and Trilux) of denture <b>tooth</b> <b>acrylic</b> resin. The specimens from each brand (n= 30) were randomly divided into 6 groups (n= 5) and immersed in the following solutions: distilled water (control group) and 5 disinfecting solutions (1 % sodium hypochlorite, 2 % sodium hypochlorite, 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite, 2 % glutaraldehyde, and 4 % chlorhexidine gluconate). Tooth color measurements were made by spectrophotometry. Before disinfection, the initial color of each tooth was recorded. Further color measurements were determined after subjecting the specimens to 7, 21, 30, 45, 60, and 90 immersion cycles in each tested solution. Color differences (&# 916;E*) were determined using the CIE L*a*b* color system. Data were analyzed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey tests.

40|$|Introduction: The most {{commonly}} used materials for prosthetic denture base are acrylic resins - polymethyl methacrylate, which has all the important physical and chemical properties. The bond between a denture base and an acrylic tooth has a significant functional value. Aim: To evaluate the influence of various procedures on bonding quality between the denture base and the artificial tooth, the measurement of gaps when connecting the tooth and the denture base using an optical or electron microscope, and evaluating the mechanical properties by compressive testing. Materials and methods: Forty eight acrylic models with bonds between <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth</b> and prosthetic denturebases, and 12 models for compressive testing were created as the materials in this in vitro study. The acrylic models were allocated to four groups (with 12 samples) for microscopy, and three groups for compressive testing. The samples for microscopy contained denture bases with fixed, unprocessed <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth,</b> mechanically processed <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth,</b> chemically processed <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth,</b> and mechanically and chemically processed <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth,</b> respectively. The acrylic models had the same dimensions, and the surface of each model was prepared using a slow speed saw, abrasive diamond paste, and special paper grinders. A special metal cast was created for compressive testing with internal dimensions of 20 x 9 mm. The size of a gap was measured on the light inverse microscope (Nikon Epiphot 300) and pressure testing was performed on a Zwick/Roell Z 010 pressure machine. Results: The average value of the gap on mechanically and chemically treated samples was 68. 250 μm, which was {{significantly lower than the}} gap on the untreated samples with the average value of 103. 75 μm. The compressive strength was 3200 N/mm 2 on untreated samples and above 6000 N/mm 2 on the mechanically and chemically treated ones. Conclusions: It can be concluded that surfaces which come into contact must be mechanically and chemically processed.

A mechanical bond is created by boring retention holes (diatorics) into the tooth structure. Concerns are that this form of retention might be insufficient. The {{purpose of this study}} is, firstly, to compare the retention of acrylic denture teeth in pure nylon dentures with that of teeth in conventional acrylic denture bases (the acrylic test pieces serving as the control standard), and secondly, to explore whether the technique prescribed for creating diatorics in <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth</b> for use with pure nylon denture bases potentially has a weakening effect on the acrylic tooth structure. Two sets of 26 identical anterior one-tooth test pieces were created. The first set, labelled N, comprises two different pure nylon denture base materials labelled N 1 and N 2 – all have diatorics in the <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth.</b> The second set, labelled A, comprised the same acrylic denture base. The set labelled A 1 is the control standard without diatorics in the <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth</b> and the set labelled A 2 has diatorics within the <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth.</b> A compressive load was applied to these test pieces at an angle of 45 degrees on the palatal surface of the tooth until fracture occurred or maximum load was reached. Resulting data from {{the first part of the}} research was analysed by One-Way ANOVA analysis. Resulting data for the second part of the research was analysed via the Chi-square cross- tabulation method. The One-Way ANOVA test revealed that there is no statistical difference in the mean fracture or maximum load in Newton values between the two A (acrylic denture base) groups. There is also no statistical difference in the mean fracture or maximum load in Newton values between the two N (pure nylon denture base) groups. There is, however, a statistically significant difference in the mean fracture or maximum load in Newton values of Group A in comparison to Group N. The Chi-square cross-tabulation indicated that the A groups have very similar breakage patterns, and the N groups have similar breakage patterns respectively. It is concluded that the mechanical retention of acrylic denture teeth in pure nylon denture bases is weaker than the mechanical and chemical retention of acrylic denture teeth in acrylic denture bases.

The objective of the study is to investigate and compare the wear resistance of three different commercially available <b>acrylic</b> resin denture <b>teeth.</b> 60 specimens were tested for wear resistance in terms of loss of weight and loss in volume on a wear and friction monitor for 5, 000 cycle wear periods (total of 10, 000 cycles) under a 0. 20  kg load. Statistical analysis used: The findings were analyzed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD test. Comparison of weight loss and volume loss between Surana ultradent, Premadent and Dentek showed highly significant difference, Surana ultraddent having better wear resistance. Surana ultradent acrylic resin denture had highest wear resistance amongst the three groups of tested samples...|$|R

With no immediate intervention to rehabilitate the patient, definitive mandibular guidance prostheses with a metal guiding flange and <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth</b> on the resected side can be used successfully to stabilize the occlusion and correct the deviation. The present case report describes the prosthodontic rehabilitation of a patient with a segmental mandibulectomy using a mandibular prosthesis with a metal guide flange and a maxillary stabilizing metal framework...|$|E
40|$|Statement of Problem: The {{effect of}} {{porcelain}} surface on the antagonist <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth</b> {{has not been}} widely studied. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effect of polished porcelain, glazed porcelain, and natural teeth (as the control group) on the acrylic resin teeth. Materials and Methods: In this experimental-laboratory study, a total of 60 specimens of glazed and polished porcelain, natural teeth, and acrylic resin teeth were prepared; in groups of 15 samples each. The denture teeth specimens were examined in terms of tooth wear against glazed or polished or enamel surfaces. After the abrasion test using the polishing machine, the wear of each sample was measured based on the weight lost by a digital scale. The wear surfaces of <b>acrylic</b> <b>teeth</b> were observed by SEM to evaluate the wear characteristic. The {{data were analyzed using}} Independent Sample t-test. Results: The glazed and polished porcelain teeth abraded the denture teeth significantly more than the natural teeth (P= 0. 001). Although there was not {{a significant difference between the}} glazed and polished porcelain (P= 0. 059), the polished porcelain caused less tooth wear than the glazed porcelain. Conclusions: According to the results of this study, glazed porcelain caused less tooth wear on denture teeth than both of the polished porcelain and natural teeth...|$|E

The pre-treatments included abrading and grooving the teeth, the application of monomer {{and the application of}} a proprietary bonding agent. Each of the 360 specimens was tensile-tested until fracture, using a universal testing machine. When bonded to heat-cured resin, the grooved teeth had the highest mean {{bond strength}} while the grooved monomer-treated group had the lowest. When bonded to cold cure resin, the unabraded monomer-treated teeth had the highest mean bond strength and the unabraded group the lowest...|$|E
40|$|The color {{stability}} and staining of <b>acrylic</b> resin denture <b>teeth</b> remains an esthetic problem for complete denture wearers. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the long-term clinical {{color stability}} and stainability of <b>acrylic</b> resin denture <b>teeth</b> in complete denture wearers over a period of 5 years. Fifty participants rehabilitated with complete dentures from February 2008 to December 2013 were selected. The demographic data and the clinical characteristics of participants were recorded. Color change (ΔE) in 3 regions of the denture teeth (incisal, middle, and cervical) was evaluated by spectrophotometry in the CIE L*a*b* system. Participants were asked whether they had noticed any changes in the coloring of the teeth in their dentures. Hierarchical clustering analysis was used to identify groups formed from variables related to demographic questions and color analysis. Two-way ANOVA among the color cluster groups was performed and the Tukey-Kramer test was used as a post hoc test (α=. 05). A chi-square test and Fisher exact test were used to identify the association between the study variables and color changes in the participants' responses (α=. 05). Four cluster groups from 50 participants were identified in the clustering analysis. The ΔE was statistically significant for the interaction between the dental third and cluster groups (P. 05). Although the <b>acrylic</b> resin denture <b>teeth</b> exhibited color instability and staining in vivo, the participants were unable to identify the color change. The cluster groups with higher color change values consumed more staining solutions...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: The {{problem of}} <b>acrylic</b> resin denture <b>teeth</b> {{separating}} from their denture base remains {{a major problem}} in prosthodontic practice and is frustrating to the patients as well as the dentists. Purpose: This study investigated the influence of tin foil substitute contamination on bond strength between <b>acrylic</b> resin denture <b>teeth</b> and their denture base. Materials and Methods: A total of 80 modified acrylic resin maxillary left central incisors were processed to their denture base material. The 80 specimens were divided into two groups of 40 specimens each: the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group had the denture tooth ridge lap area contaminated with tin foil substitute. The 40 specimens in the control group were not contaminated. After 7 days of storage at room temperature, the bond strengths of the two groups were tested with a universal testing machine. The nature of failure was noted as adhesive (interface) or cohesive (in tooth or denture base material). The Welch test and z-test were performed to identify significant differences. Results: The uncontaminated specimens (group I) showed superior bond strength as compared to the contaminated specimens (group II); the difference in bond strength between the groups was highly significant (P< 0. 0001). Also the contaminated specimens exhibited predominantly adhesive failure (89. 74 %), whereas the uncontaminated specimens exhibited 55 % adhesive failure and 45 % cohesive failure. Conclusion: Tin foil substitute contamination of the ridge laps of <b>acrylic</b> resin denture <b>teeth</b> greatly reduced the bond strength...|$|R
