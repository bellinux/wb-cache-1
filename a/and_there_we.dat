25|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the site}} starts at ~600 BCE and lasts until ~1500 CE The first two phases are weakly defined and things don’t solidify until the Ichpa phase, which lines up with the Early Classic Period and is consequently the first agreed upon phase. There is polychrome pottery characteristic of the region in that time period, and hieroglyphics. The Noheb phase lines up with the Middle Classic <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> see polychrome pottery disappears along with any sort of stone inscriptions, {{and the construction of}} large pyramids begins. In the Ukmul phase, hieroglyphics re-emerge and there is an abundance of rich detailed iconography. The Nak phase is a high point, with the building of the most 'glamorous' architecture, and Pre-pizarran ceramics emerge, characterized by supporting conical feet but displaying a broad diversity in design otherwise. Finally the Tokoy phase is defined by a disappearance in all evidence of human activity, except for pottery with a deterioration in materials and in consistency in technique, which fades out completely towards 1500 CE.|$|E
500|$|In Northern Rhodesia (now called Zambia), Achebe {{found himself}} {{sitting in a}} whites-only section of a bus to Victoria Falls. Interrogated by the ticket taker {{as to why he}} was sitting in the front, he replied, [...] "if you must know I come from Nigeria, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> sit where we like in the bus." [...] Upon {{reaching}} the waterfall, he was cheered by the black travellers from the bus, but he was saddened by their being unable to resist the policy of segregation at the time.|$|E

500|$|According to Jean-Claude Déquéant, Farmer showed limited enthusiasm {{during the}} demo {{recordings}} and declared: [...] "The voice was surprisingly present {{and she laughed}} after each take when listening". Dahan was satisfied, because Farmer had a clear and deep voice and could easily reach high notes. Initial rehearsals were held at Dahan's home. Dahan has said of these rehearsals: [...] "There was a large room with a piano <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> repeated the staging of the song. Mylène {{had a hard time}} understanding all this, we had to teach her everything, starting with the choreography [...] This probably did not look very professional." ...|$|E
500|$|After President Nixon {{told his}} family he would resign {{the office of}} the presidency, she replied, [...] "But why?" [...] She {{contacted}} White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat {{sat on the edge of}} a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw her arms around him, kissed him, and said, [...] "We're all very proud of you, Daddy." [...] Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, [...] "Our hearts were breaking <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> are smiling." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wrote the}} initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and I stopped and said, 'I really wanna {{do this with}} Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm {{a big fan of}} theirs and I just thought that the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, so I put it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because I want it to be our song if we ever do it together. [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then <b>and</b> <b>there.</b> <b>We</b> were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the evening}} we bade them adieu and took horse, being {{resolved}} that, {{instead of the}} race which fails us, {{we would go to}} Epsom When we come there we could hear of no lodging, the town so full, but which was better, I went towards Ashsted, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> got a lodging in a little hole we could not stand upright in While supper was getting I walked up and down behind my cosen [...] Pepys's house that was, which I find comes little short of what I took it to be when I was a little boy.|$|E
2500|$|Now for the ritorno. [...] The landmark, as noted, is WSW of {{the ship}}'s morning {{position}} (C). [...] So to [...] "return" [...] to the landmark, the ship must change its bearing {{from its current}} NW bearing to a WSW bearing – that is, 6 quarter-winds below NW. [...] However, the toleta specifies quarter winds in terms of [...] "intended" [...] direction (in this case, West), and WSW is two quarter winds below West, {{so we need to}} look at the q = 2 row. This means the ritorno is 26 miles for every 10 miles alargar. [...] Since the alargar is 28.4, that means the ritorno is 26 [...] 2.84 = 73.84. [...] <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> have it.

2500|$|The House of Shammai and the House of Hillel {{disagreed}} {{about how}} far one should recite into the Hallel, [...] The House of Shammai maintained that one recited until the words [...] "as a joyous mother of children" [...] in [...] while the House of Hillel said that one recited until the words [...] "the flint into a fountain of waters" [...] in [...] And one concluded with a blessing of redemption. Rabbi Tarfon used to say (that the blessing included), [...] "who redeemed us and redeemed our fathers from Egypt," [...] but one did not conclude with a blessing. Rabbi Akiva said (that one added to Rabbi Tarfon's version the following), [...] "So may the Lord our God and the God of our fathers allow us to reach other seasons and festivals in peace, rejoicing in the rebuilding of Your city and glad in Your service, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> will eat the sacrifices and the Passover-offerings [...] [...] [...] ," [...] (and one proceeded) as far as, [...] "Blessed are You, o Lord, who have redeemed Israel." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} take {{decision}} the envoys of the Eastern Patriarchs asked the Bulgarian delegated the following question: [...] "When you took [...] Motherland, tell us under which authority {{it used to be}} and were there Latin or Greek priests?". They gave the prepared answer: [...] "We took [...] Motherland with arms from the rule of the Greeks <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> found not Latin but Greek priests." [...] In compliance with the response of the Bulgarian envoys, the Eastern Patriarchates pronounced their decision: [...] "If you have found Greek priests, it is clear that this land was under the rule of Constantinople... Therefore we adjudge, because the Bulgarian motherland, as we got to know, was previously under Greek ruler and had Greek priests, to be now returned again through Christianity to the holy Church of Constantinople, from which it was separated through paganism." [...] The protests of the Roman legates were futile. They forged a letter in which the Pope allegedly warned the Patriarch of Constantinople not to interfere with the Bulgarian matters, but Ignatius ignored it. After the Council (in the very same year) the Latin priests had to leave Bulgaria and were substituted by Byzantine missionaries.|$|E
2500|$|After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, John Sayer, {{a member}} St Peter's {{congregation}} was appointed chief cook to King Charles II. Sayer was {{a wealthy man}} and lived in Berkhamsted Place and benefactor of the town. He was known to Samuel Pepys, who wrote of him in his Diary. In 1661, Pepys wrote [...] "...I went with Captain Morrice at his desire into the King's Privy Kitchen to Mr. Sayres, the Master Cook, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> had a good slice of beef or two to our breakfast, and from thence he took us into the wine cellar where, by my troth, we were very merry, and I drank too much wine, and all along had great and particular kindness from Mr. Sayres, but I drank so much wine that I was not fit for business." [...] Upon his death in 1682, John Sayer left £1000 in his will {{for the construction of}} a row of almshouses on Berkhamsted High Street, containing twelve rooms for the habitation of six poor widows. The endowment also provided for a weekly allowance of two shillings and a fuel allowance for each widow. The almshouses, which are still in existence today, were completed in 1684 and bear an inscription on the front, [...] "A gift of John Sayer, 1684". Sayer's elaborate marble tomb stands in the Lady chapel of St Peter's.|$|E

60|$|I {{took her}} to the little boat-house, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>we</b> hired a boat, and I rowed in silence under the bridge and into the shade of a tree.
