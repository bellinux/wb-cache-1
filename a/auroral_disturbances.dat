30|$|One of {{the most}} dynamic ionospheric {{disturbances}} at high latitudes is the auroral substorm. These substorms are characterized by the sporadic precipitation of energetic electrons from the magnetotail that leads to explosive activations of aurora (Akasofu 1964). Aarons et al. (2000) first reported that fluctuations in a GPS signal phase correlate well with substorm-associated <b>auroral</b> <b>disturbances</b> as identified by the Polar Ultraviolet Imager instrument and local ground magnetometers. Recently, statistical maps of amplitude and phase scintillations at high latitudes were derived by Spogli et al. (2009) by using data from a regional network of a GPS scintillation monitoring system in northern Europe. They showed that, in the high-latitude ionosphere, phase scintillation is much more pronounced than amplitude scintillation and its occurrence frequency is clearly higher in the nighttime auroral region during the disturbance. This tendency has been confirmed by more recent statistical analyses of GPS ionospheric scintillation measurements (Li et al. 2010; Alfonsi et al. 2011; Tiwari et al. 2012). These {{studies suggest that the}} occurrence of phase scintillations is closely related to substorms. However, to date, investigations of the relationship between scintillation and substorm-related <b>auroral</b> <b>disturbances</b> have been primarily statistical; thus, the temporal evolution of the scintillation during a substorm has not yet been clarified.|$|E

40|$|This review {{emphasis}} <b>disturbances</b> in <b>auroral</b> {{emissions and}} ionospheric currents and {{their relation to}} interplanetary conditions and the overall level of geomagnetic activity. <b>Auroral</b> zone <b>disturbances</b> are divided into three fundamentally different types: poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs), substorms, and effects of solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements. The {{most common type of}} auroral-zone disturbance is the PBI, which occurs during all levels of geomagnetic activity. PBIs have an auroral signature that often can be seen to move equatorward from the magnetic separatrix. They are typically associated with ground magnetic perturbations of few tens of nT, but perturbations can be as high as ~ 500 nT. Individual PBIs are longitudinally localized, associated with the longitudinally localized flow bursts in the tail plasma sheet, and occasionally traverse essentially the entire latitudinal extent of the plasma sheet. PBIs appear to generally be the dominant type of <b>auroral</b> zone <b>disturbance</b> during periods of enhanced magnetospheric convection, including the growth phase of substorms, convection bays, and the main phase of magnetic storms.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 Plasma {{within the}} {{ionosphere}} affects technology, such as long distance communications and satellite navigation, by scattering and altering {{the propagation of}} radio waves sent through the ionosphere. Understanding the structure and dynamics of the ionosphere that may interfere with modern technology is therefore {{an important aspect of}} Space Weather research. In this thesis, the average characteristics and dynamics of the nighttime E-region (90 - 150 km in altitude) are investigated during <b>auroral</b> <b>disturbances</b> and near extreme solar minimum. The near-continuous data on electron density obtained with the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) near Fairbanks, Alaska are utilized. A number of correlation analyses between E-region electron content and AE index are performed in order to examine the influence of geomagnetic conditions on the E-region in relation to time of the day as well as seasonal and solar cycle effects. It is shown that E-region electron content and AE index exhibit significant positive correlation, particularly near local magnetic midnight, with greater correlation generally occurring in spring and autumn. The midnight feature is interpreted as an indication that the electrojet system near midnight is mostly controlled by electric conductance. The presented statistical results on the current-conductance relationship utilizing a new dataset strengthen conclusions derived from previous studies. The extent of E-region contribution to the total electron content (TEC) is also estimated and investigated for various conditions for the first time using the full altitude profile of PFISR. The estimates ranged between 5 %- 60 % and more active periods generally displayed a more significant contribution from the E-region to TEC. Additionally, using the AE index as an indicator of auroral disturbance onset, the evolution of auroral density enhancements is explored using the superposed epoch analysis technique. The behavior of E-region electron content, peak density, height of peak density, and layer thickness is considered and three discernible phases in response of the thick E-layer to <b>auroral</b> <b>disturbances</b> are found.

30|$|For {{smaller scale}} waves, several airglow imagers {{investigated}} thermospheric and ionospheric waves identified as MSTIDs near the auroral zone through the 630 nm airglow emissions at altitudes of 200 to 300  km. Kubota et al. (2011) reported characteristics of MSTIDs observed by an airglow imager at Alaska. They concluded that these southwestward-moving MSTIDs are {{not caused by}} ionospheric instabilities, as usually suggested at middle latitudes, but {{are likely to be}} caused by <b>auroral</b> <b>disturbances</b> as TADs because the observed background thermospheric wind was poleward, stabilizing the ionospheric instability. On the other hand, Shiokawa et al. (2013) reported similar southwestward-moving MSTIDs over Norway and northern Canada and suggested that they are caused mainly by the Perkins and E-F coupling instabilities (Perkins 1973; Yokoyama et al. 2009) similar to those at middle latitudes and that an additional source by atmospheric gravity waves from lower altitudes also comes into play. Shiokawa et al. (2012, 2013) reported sudden movements of these MSTIDs at subauroral latitudes concurrent with auroral activity, indicating instantaneous penetration of auroral electric fields to subauroral latitudes.|$|E
40|$|Poleward {{boundary}} intensifications are nightside geomagnetic disturbances {{that have}} an auroral signature that moves equatorward from the poleward boundary of the auroral zone. They occur repetitively, so that many individual disturbances can occur during time intervals of ~ 1 hr, and {{they appear to be}} the most intense <b>auroral</b> <b>disturbance</b> at times other than the expansion phase of substorms. We have used data from three nightside conjunctions of the Geotail spacecraft in the magnetotail with the CANOPUS ground-based array in central Canada to investigate the relation between the poleward boundary intensifications and bursty plasma-sheet flows and to characterize the bursty flows associated with the disturbances. We have found a distinct difference in plasma she t dynamics between periods with, and periods without, poleward boundary intensifications. During periods with identifiable poleward boundary intensifications, the plasma sheet has considerable structure and bursty flow activity. Dur ng periods without such poleward boundary intensifications, the plasma sheet was found to be far more stable with fewer and weaker bursty flows. This is consistent with the intensifications being the result of the mapping to the ionosphere of the electric fields that give rise to bursty flows within th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Auroral zone {{observations}} often show significant ULF power. We have analyzed auroral and plasma-sheet observations {{during two}} prolonged periods of strongly southward and relatively steady IMF. We find evidence that auroral poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs), which have large intensity and occur repetitively throughout such periods, {{may be a}} manifestation of a large-scale ULF oscillation mode that strongly perturbs the plasma sheet and the auroral ionosphere. If this is correct, then ULF modes {{would be a major}} component of tail dynamics, of magnetosphere coupling to the ionosphere, and of <b>auroral</b> zone <b>disturbances</b> during periods of enhanced convection. They would simultaneously affect a large region of the nightside, extending along auroral-zone field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet and extending from field lines that lie near the magnetic separatrix to, at times, as close to the Earth as synchronous orbit. They would also occasionally have amplitudes as large as the changes that occur in association with other <b>auroral</b> zone <b>disturbances</b> such as substorms. Here we have found peak-to-peak amplitudes as high as several hundred nT in ground X, an order of magnitude in synchronous energetic proton fluxes, ~ 20 - 40 nT in synchronous magnetic field components, ~ 20 nT in tail magnetic field components, ~ 1000 km/...|$|R

The convection inhomogeneity leads to appearance of the currents across and along the magnetic field lines.

The ionosphere is assumed as a thin conductive layer, and the processes of ionization and recombination of the charged particles have been considered. The ionospheric processes have been considered as non-linear. In the magnetosphere the linear approximation has been used. The linear equation for the Alfven waves propagating along the magnetic field from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere has been solved with the realistic change of the velocity along the magnetic field lines.

40|$|International audienceGlobal {{ultraviolet}} auroral {{images from}} the IMAGE satellite were used to investigate {{the dynamics of the}} dayside auroral oval responding to a sudden impulse (SI) in the solar wind pressure. At the same time, the TV all-sky camera and the EISCAT radar on Svalbard (in the pre-noon sector) allowed for detailed investigation of the auroral forms and the ionospheric plasma flow. After the SI, new discrete auroral forms appeared in the poleward part of the auroral oval so that the middle of the dayside oval moved poleward from about 70 ° to about 73 ° of the AACGM latitude. This poleward shift first occurred in the 15 MLT sector, then similar shifts were observed in the MLT sectors located more westerly, and eventually the shift was seen in the 6 MLT sector. Thus, the <b>auroral</b> <b>disturbance</b> "propagated" westward (from 15 MLT to 6 MLT) at an apparent speed of the order of 7 km/s. This motion of the middle of the auroral oval was caused by the redistribution of the luminosity within the oval and was not associated with the corresponding motion of the poleward boundary of the oval. The SI was followed by an increase in the northward plasma convection velocity. Individual auroral forms showed poleward progressions with velocities close to the velocity of the northward plasma convection. The observations indicate firstly a pressure disturbance propagation through the magnetosphere at a velocity of the order of 200 km/s which is essentially slower than the velocity of the fast Alfvén (magnetosonic) wave, and secondly a potential (curl-free) electric field generation behind the front of the propagating disturbance, causing the motion of the auroras. We suggest a physical explanation for the slow propagation of the disturbance through the magnetosphere and a model for the electric field generation. Predictions of the model are supported by the global convection maps produced by the SuperDARN HF radars. Finally, the interchange instability and the eigenmode toroidal Alfvén oscillations are discussed as possible generation mechanisms for the dayside auroral forms launched by the SI...|$|R

Typical period of low-latitude Pi 2 pulsations, from {{a fraction of a}} minute to few minutes, is believed to be determined either by eigenperiod of the plasmasphere cavity mode (Sutcliffe et al. 2013) or by a forced response to a periodic energy release in the magnetotail (Keiling and Takahashi 2011).

T., on 13 March 1989 when the planetary magnetic Kp-index was 8 + and auroral electrojet index (AE) reached a value of 2000 nT. The global effect of the substorm was particularly evident from large rises of the virtual height of the F-region (h′F) and from large ionization depletions found from the critical frequency (foF 2) decreases of the layer, using data from 46 ionosonde stations. The fluctuations in h′F showed a significant correlation with auroral surges, deduced from the AE index. The evidence of sequential enhancements in h′F and associated ionization depletions, indicated the presence of large-scale travelling disturbances (LSTIDs) launched during the disturbed period and propagating to low latitudes. LSTIDs moved with velocities between 460 and 530 m s- 1, originating equatorwards of the auroral zone at the shell with an L-value = 2. 3. The exceptionally large and rapid enhancements in h′F, with the height increments exceeding 200 km and reaching 400 km, {{as well as the}} shift of the origin of LSTIDs to higher mid-latitudes, are the unusual aspects of the present disturbances, distinguishing them from other cases of LSTIDs studied on the global scale.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{study has been}} undertaken {{on the effect of}} magnetic substorm onsets (as deduced from the auroral hourly electrojet AE-index) on the occurrence of high midlatitude (or sub-auroral latitude) ionospheric range spread-F (Sr). Unlike the previous reports real-time ionograms were used in this analysis thus eliminating ambiguities stemming from the correlating secondary evidence of spread-F with auroral substorms. The Australian southernmost ionosonde station Hobart (51. 6 °S geom.) proved to be uniquely suitable for the task as being sufficiently close to the southern auroral zone. Sr was assigned in km to each hourly nighttime ionogram at two sounding frequencies: Sr 1 (at 2 MHz) and Sr 2 (at 6 MHz) for four months in 2002 : January and June (representing southern summer and winter solstices), and March and September (representing autumn and vernal equinoxes). It is evident that the southern winter solstitial period (June) is associated with high endemic midlatitude spread-F activity. All other seasons are closely linked with temporal sequences of enhanced spread-F activity following substorm onsets. For the first time it was possible not only find a simultaneous occurrence pattern of these diverse phenomena but to deduce numerical characteristics of the response of midlatitude ionosphere to the global auroral stimulus. Excellent case events, hitherto unpublished, are shown illustrating the presence of the AE peaks (in nT) being ahead of Sr peaks (in km) by a time shift Δt (in h). Sr 1 magnitude showed a significant correlation with the magnitudes of the preceding AE with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0. 51 (probability of the occurrence by chance less than 0. 01). Sr 2 peaks were more sensitive to <b>auroral</b> <b>disturbances</b> but were not correlated with the AE magnitude variations. The time shift (Δt) was on average 4 h {{with a standard deviation of}} 3 h. The general pattern in the occurrence of magnetic substorms and spread-F is very similar. A number of corresponding peaks of the AE-index and Sr fluctuations were identified.

The statistical test RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MBE (Mean Bias Error) were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the geomagnetic disturbance. Different variables have been used to develop different types of models. Values of the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination were high, which indicates that the results are good. The equations produced the best correlations at subauroral and low latitudes, and the best correlation was obtained with low values of RMSE and MBE...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now known}} that there are several {{different}} types of <b>auroral</b> zone <b>disturbances,</b> each reflecting fundamentally different processes within the magnetosphere-ionosphere system. Four types known to be dynamically important are described here. Substorms follow a> ~ 0. 5 hr growth period of enhanced convection. Onset occurs within the near-Earth plasma sheet and is often followed by new magnetic X-line in the mid-tail. Evidence now indicates that substorm onset results from a transition from a stable to unstable state of the nightside magnetosphere that initiates a few minutes prior to onset {{as the result of}} a reduction in the strength of convection caused by an appropriate change in the interplanetary magnetic field impacting the magnetosphere. Convection driven auroral enhancements occur at midnight-to-dawn MLTs and result from plasma sheet electrons, which are strongly energized during periods of enhanced convection and magnetic drift around the dawn side. Enhancements in solar wind dynamic pressure cause global disturbances that can be quite dramatic. These disturbances consists of increases in magnetospheric and ionospheric currents and electric fields, enhancements in auroral emissions and broadening of the auroral oval, and significant shrinkage of the polar cap size. Poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs) are auroral enhancements that initiate along the poleward boundary of the auroral oval. They occur during all overall levels of geomagnetic activity and are associated with few minute flow bursts in the tail plasma sheet. They are the most common disturbance. They are often repetitive and may be a manifestation of a large-scale ULF oscillation...|$|R
40|$|Interrelations of the {{phenomena}} of upper atmosphere disturbances in high latitudes, such as magnetic <b>disturbance,</b> <b>auroral</b> displays, anomalous ionization in the ionosphere, X-ray and radio wave emissions, are discussed with special reference 1) to the numerical relations of quantities of the disturbances and 2) to the {{spatial distribution of}} disturbance area. As to the numerical relations, the effects of primary electron beams, for example, ionization, excitation and emission of X-ray and radio waves, were shown {{to be consistent with}} the observational results, though a considerable scattering of numerical values occurs owing to the fluctuation of energy spectrum of primary electrons. The examination of spatial distribution of disturbance area has led to a conclusion that 1) the electron precipitation responsible for various disturbance phenomana can be divided into three groups, i. e. flash precipitation group, quasisteady precipitation group and noon precipitation group, and 2) these groups would correspond respectively to the electron precipitation from the open-close boundary of magnetic lines of force in geomagnetic cavity, to the electron precipitation from the trapping region, and to that from neutral regions of cavity surface in the day side...|$|R
40|$|Offset fields between {{pairs of}} JERS- 1 {{satellite}} SAR data acquired in winter with 44 days time interval were employed for {{the estimation of}} Arctic glacier motion over Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya and Franz-Josef Land. The displacement maps show that the ice caps are divided {{into a number of}} clearly defined fast-flowing units with displacement larger than about 6 in in 44 days (i. e. 50 m/year). The estimated error of the JERS- 1 offset tracking derived displacement is on the order of 20 m/year. Occasionally, azimuth streaks related to <b>auroral</b> zone ionospheric <b>disturbances</b> were detected and dedicated processing steps were applied to minimize their influence on the estimated motion pattern. Our analysis demonstrated that offset tracking of L-band SAR images is a robust and direct estimation technique of glacier motion. The method is particularly useful when differential SAR interferometry is limited by loss of coherence, i. e. for rapid and incoherent flow and large acquisition time intervals between the two SAR images. The JERS- 1 results, obtained using SAR data acquired by a satellite operated until 1998, raise expectations of L-band SAR data from the ALOS satellite launched in early 2006. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|International audienceTo {{learn about}} the {{geometry}} and sources of the ionospheric current systems which generate strong geomagnetically induced currents, we categorize differential equivalent current systems (DEC) for events with strong dB/dt by decomposing them into the contributions of electrojet-type and vortex-type elementary systems. By solving the inverse problem we obtain amplitudes and locations of these elementary current systems. One-minute differences of the geomagnetic field values at the IMAGE magnetometer network in 1996 ? 2000 are analysed to study the spatial distributions of large dB/dt events. The relative contributions of the two components are evaluated. In particular, {{we found that the}} majority of the strongest dB/dt events (100 ? 1000 nT/min) appear to be produced by the vortex-type current structures and most of them occur in the morning LT hours, probably caused by the Ps 6 pulsation events associated with auroral omega structures. For strong dB/dt events the solar wind parameters are shifted toward strong (tens nT) southward IMF, enhanced velocity and dynamic pressure, in order for the main phase of the magnetic storms to occur. Although these events appear mostly during magnetic storms when the auroral oval greatly expands, the area of large dB/dt stays in the middle part of the auroral zone; therefore, it is connected to the processes taking part in the middle of the magnetosphere rather than in its innermost region populated by the ring current.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{feasibility}} of detecting auroral emission from the potentially habitable exoplanet Proxima Centauri b. Detection of aurorae would yield an independent confirmation of the planet's existence, constrain the presence and composition of its atmosphere, and determine the planet's eccentricity and inclination, thereby breaking the mass-inclination degeneracy. If Proxima Centauri b is a terrestrial world with an Earth-like atmosphere and magnetic field, we estimate the power at the 5577 Å OI auroral line is {{on the order of}} 0. 1 TW under steady-state stellar wind, or ∼ 100 × stronger than that on Earth. This corresponds to a planet-star contrast ratio of 10 ^- 6 - 10 ^- 7 in a narrow band about the 5577 Å line, although higher contrast (10 ^- 4 - 10 ^- 5) may be possible during periods of strong magnetospheric <b>disturbance</b> (<b>auroral</b> power 1 - 10 TW). We searched the Proxima Centauri b HARPS data for the 5577 Å line and for other prominent oxygen and nitrogen lines, but find no signal, indicating that the OI auroral line contrast must be lower than 2 × 10 ^- 2 (with power ≲ 3, 000 TW), consistent with our predictions. We find that observations of 0. 1 TW auroral emission lines are likely infeasible with current and planned telescopes. However, future observations with a space-based coronagraphic telescope or a ground-based extremely large telescope (ELT) with a coronagraph could push sensitivity down to terawatt oxygen aurorae (contrast 7 × 10 ^- 6) with exposure times of ∼ 1 day. If a coronagraph design contrast of 10 ^- 7 can be achieved with negligible instrumental noise, a future concept ELT could observe steady-state auroral emission in a few nights.

40|$|This work quantifies {{the extent}} to which {{disturbance}} phenomena contribute to the observed geomagnetic field on the time-scale of months to years. A deterministic approach was adopted in which geomagnetic monthly means were analysed in the time domain. By presupposing the time dependence of the external and induced field variations, which we assume to vary as the aa geomagnetic index, we arrived at an estimate of the relative amplitude of the disturbance to each component of the field at a number of observatories. In all some 58000 geomagnetic monthly means from 59 observatories operating this century were analysed. Special attention was paid to the selection and validation of the data as otherwise the numerical computations would have been unduly compromised. The results consist of 177 estimates of the relative amplitude of disturbance, one for each of three orthogonal components north (X), east (Y) and vertically down (2) at each observatory. The disturbance to the X component was found to be consistently negative over the whole of the Earth’s surface with an intensification in <b>auroral</b> regions. The <b>disturbances</b> to the Z component were found to be smaller than that for X except in high latitudes. Mean disturbances to the Y component were smaller still. Results were in general consistent with the dipole field of the magnetospheric ring current, aligned with, though of opposite polarity to, the Earth’s main field. Typical amplitudes of the mean disturbance field from month to month were of the order 10 nT. The results can be used to estimate the variation of the disturbance field. Subtracting this from both monthly and annual means yields an improved estimate of the field originating in the core and its secular variation. Some examples are presented.

40|$|The first {{extended}} {{series of}} observations of Saturn's auroral emissions, undertaken by the Hubble Space Telescope in January 2004 in conjunction with measurements of the upstream solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) by the Cassini spacecraft, have revealed a strong auroral response to the interplanetary medium. Following {{the arrival of the}} forward shock of a corotating interaction region compression, bright auroras were first observed to expand significantly poleward in the dawn sector such that the area of the polar cap was much reduced, following which the auroral morphology evolved into a spiral structure around the pole. We propose that these auroral effects are produced by compression-induced reconnection of a significant fraction of the open flux present in Saturn's open tail lobes, as has also been observed to occur at Earth, followed by subcorotation of the newly closed flux tubes in the outer magnetosphere region due to the action of the ionospheric torque. We show that the combined action of reconnection and rotation naturally gives rise to spiral structures on newly opened and newly closed field lines, the latter being in the same sense as observed in the auroral images. The magnetospheric corollary of the dynamic scenario outlined here is that corotating interaction region-induced magnetospheric compressions and tail collapses should be accompanied by hot plasma injection into the outer magnetosphere, first in the midnight and dawn sector, and second at increasing local times via noon and dusk. We discuss how this scenario leads to a strong correlation of <b>auroral</b> and related <b>disturbances</b> at Saturn with the dynamic pressure of the solar wind, rather than to a correlation with the north-south component of the IMF as observed at Earth, even though the underlying physics is similar, related to the transport of magnetic flux to and from the tail in the Dungey cycle.

40|$|Ionospheric, auroral and {{geomagnetic}} {{observations were}} made simultaneously at Syowa Station during the fifth wintering of the Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition in 1961 The ionospheric soundings at vertical incidence {{were carried out}} every fifteen minutes. Auroras were measured by photometric technique for the three lines, λ 5577 A (OI (S-D) line), λ 6300 A (OI (D-P) line and λ 4278 A (N G of N_ 2 ^+ (0 - 1) band), and the magnetogram from which the magnetic Qindices were reduced, was obtained by a magnetometer of pen-recording type Based on these data obtained during the winter months, the expressions for the relation between auroral luminosity (J in kR) and electron density (N in electrons/cm^ 3) in the E region were calculated in the following two ways. 1) When the exponent b of maximum electron density in the expression J=aN^b_ is calculated by the method of least squares, it is about 1 6 for λ 5577 A line and about 1 3 for λ 4278 A band for the case of E_n (night E layer) or E_ (retadation type of E_s). 2) In case it is assumed beforehand that the auroral luminosity {{is proportional to the}} square of maximum electron density in the E-region, the expression becomes J (4278) = 1 2 × 10 ^ N^ 2 _ for the case of the correlation of the 4278 band with E_ layers. In general, type of the sporadic E layer seems to change in the order from E_n to E_, E_ (auroral type of E_s) and E_ (flat type of E_s, as the geomagnetic disturbance of negative bay type progresses There is a kind of the sporadic E layer which is not accompanied by <b>auroral</b> and geomagnetic <b>disturbances</b> Such E_s layers are apt to take a shape of flat type, and may be, so to speak, of mid-latitudinal type The relations between auroral intensities of λ 5577 A line and λ 6300 A line and between auroral luminosity and geomagnetic variation of H component are also discusse...|$|R
40|$|On 11 April 2001, a large {{magnetic}} storm occurred with SSC at 13 : 43 &nbsp;UT, and Dst reached below - 200 nT after two southward Bz excursions. The Kp index during this storm reached 8 and remained high (&gt; 4) for about 21 h, and the S&# 227;o Lu&# 237;s magnetometer H component presented simultaneous oscillations and decreased substantially {{relative to the}} previous magnetically quiet days. This storm triggered strong ionospheric irregularities, as observed by a recently installed 30 MHz coherent scatter radar, a digisonde, and a GPS scintillation receiver, all operating at the S&# 227;o Lu&# 237;s equatorial station (2. 33 &deg; S, 44 &deg; W, dip latitude 1. 3 &deg; S). The ionospheric conditions and {{the characteristics of the}} ionospheric irregularities observed by these instruments are presented and discussed. The VHF radar RTI (Range Time Intensity) echoes and their power spectra and spectral width for the storm night 11 - 12 April 2001, were used to analyse the nature and dynamics of the plasma irregularities and revealed the coexistence of many structures in the altitudinal range of 400 - 1200 km, some locally generated and others that drifted from other longitudinal sectors. The radar data also revealed that the plumes had periodic eastward and westward zonal velocities after 22 : 20 &nbsp;UT, when well-developed quiet-time plumes typically drift eastward. Another interesting new observation is that the F-layer remained anomalously high throughout the 11 - 12 April 2001 storm night (21 : 00 &nbsp;UT to 09 : 00 &nbsp;UT next day) (the LT at S&# 227;o Lu&# 237;s is&nbsp;UT - 3 h), as indicated by the digisonde parameters hmF 2 and h'F, which is a condition favourable for spread F generation and maintenance. The AE auroral index showed enhancements (followed by decreases) that are indicative of magnetospheric convection enhancements at about 15 : 00 &nbsp;UT, 20 : 00 &nbsp;UT and 22 : 00 &nbsp;UT on 11 April 2001 and at 00 : 20 &nbsp;UT (small amplitude) on 12 April 2001, associated with many Bz fluctuations, including clear two southward incursions that gave rise to large and long lasting Kp values and large negative Dst values. This intense <b>auroral</b> activity generated <b>disturbance</b> dynamo and prompt penetration electric fields that were responsible for the maintenance of the F-layer at a high altitude along the night of 11 - 12 April 2001. The short-lived F-region height rise seen between 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 &nbsp;UT on 11 &nbsp;April 2001 is probably due to the prompt penetration eastward electric fields of magnetospheric origin during the first IMF Bz turning to south around 15 : 00 &nbsp;UT...|$|R
