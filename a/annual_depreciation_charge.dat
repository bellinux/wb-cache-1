5000|$|Because of {{government}} tax-incentives and valuation issues, <b>depreciation</b> <b>charged</b> by businesses is rarely a true {{reflection of the}} loss in value of their capital stock.

3000|$|In most cantons, the Financial Management Act of Parliament (FMA) {{offers the}} finance {{minister}} a strong conservative bias. The most common solution is the possibility—but not the obligation—to discretionarily inflate operating expenses by managing <b>depreciations</b> with ‘depreciation’ <b>charges</b> (AD). 10 AD {{must not be}} confused with the ‘true’ <b>depreciation</b> <b>charges</b> (D) representing the very actual wear and tear and obsolescence of assets. The true <b>depreciation</b> <b>charges</b> are calculated using either the declining-balance method (constant depreciation rate applied on the residual book value) or the straight-line (constant rate applied to the acquisition cost of the asset). The rate is determined according to the useful working life of the considered asset. For each capital expenditure, the Parliament decides over the amount of the expenditure it authorises, the duration of the working life of the assets, and the <b>depreciation</b> <b>charges</b> that follows. Thus, there is no possibility for the executive branch of the government or for the finance minister to compromise on the amount of D that has to be recognised every year. 11 [...]...|$|R

30|$|Operating {{revenues}} (R) correspond by {{and large}} to inflows of cash resulting from operating activities. In terms of operating expenses (E), the correspondence with outflows of cash is weaker since not all expenses are disbursements. Typically, {{only part of the}} operating expenses (E*)—like wages, purchase of goods and services, and interest payments—drains cash. Other operating expenses such as <b>depreciation</b> <b>charges</b> (D) trigger no payment, meaning that they have no impact on cash. 9 These book entries are purely accounting charges. In a true and fair view, the amount of the <b>depreciation</b> <b>charge</b> must accurately match the wear and tear and obsolescence of assets.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the effect of a {{progressive}} tax system on optimal tax depreciation. By using dynamic optimization we show that an optimal strategy exists, and we provide an analytical expression for the optimal <b>depreciation</b> <b>charges.</b> <b>Depreciation</b> <b>charges</b> initially decrease over time, and after a number of periods the firm enters a steady state where depreciation is constant and equal to replacement investments. This way, the optimal solution trades off the benefits of accelerated depreciation (because of discounting) and of constant depreciation (because of the progressive tax system). We show that the steady state will be reached sooner when the initial tax base is lower or when the discounting effect is stronger. ...|$|R

Over that period, it has recorded additional <b>depreciation</b> <b>charges</b> in 28 of its 34 annual financial reports. The canton of St. Gallen (SG) was a late-adopter. However, it never recorded any AD in the 17 annual reports it has presented under the common chart of account.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{calculations}} of leasing economics, derived from recently valid laws, mainly the income tax law. According to § 19 paragraph 3 letter a) of the income tax law /ZDP/, the tax expenses represent a <b>depreciation</b> <b>charge</b> of tangible and intangible properties. The new law about the income tax allowed in precisely determined cases to claim <b>depreciation</b> <b>charge</b> not only to tax-payer, having the proprietorship or the administration right (if {{it relates to the}} state, village or the higher regional unit), but also to tax-payers who do not have this right if they count this property, incl. they count their property being rented by the form of financial leasing (§ 24 paragraph 1 letter. e).
