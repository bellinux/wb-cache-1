5|$|The {{race between}} Amondson and Dodge {{was viewed as}} a way to {{determine}} which faction would lead the party in the future. Amondson achieved ballot access in Louisiana as the nominee of the Prohibition Party and in Colorado as the nominee of the Concerns of People Party. Dodge achieved ballot access only in Colorado, where he was listed as the nominee of the Prohibition Party. Overall, Amondson won the contest, collecting 1,896 (1,512 of those were from Louisiana) votes compared to Dodge's 140. As expected, Amondson placed well behind both major candidates (George W. Bush received 1.1million votes, <b>and</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> received over 1million votes). He placed eighth in a slate of 12 candidates on Colorado's ballot (Dodge placed last, even though it was his home state). Amondson's third-place finish in four Louisiana parishes was the first time since 1960 that the Prohibition Party nominee for President out polled-all other third party candidates for president in any county.|$|E

25|$|New York is {{the most}} {{important}} source of political fundraising in the United States, as four of the top five ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top ZIP code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of George W. Bush <b>and</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry.</b> The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every $1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends $11.4billion more than it receives back). City residents and businesses also spent an additional $4.1billion in the 2009–2010 fiscal year to the state of New York than the city received in return.|$|E
500|$|Several polls from September to November 2003 showed Clark {{leading the}} Democratic field of {{candidates}} or as {{a close second}} to Howard Dean with the Gallup poll having him in {{first place in the}} presidential race at 20% as late as October 2003. [...] The John Edwards campaign brought on Hugh Shelton—the general who had said Clark was made to leave the SACEUR post early due to [...] "integrity and character issues"—as an advisor, a move that drew criticism from the Clark campaign. Since Dean consistently polled in the lead in the Iowa caucuses, Clark opted out of participating in the caucuses entirely to focus on later primaries instead. The 2004 Iowa caucuses marked {{a turning point in the}} campaign for the Democratic nomination, however, as front-runners Dean and Dick Gephardt garnered results far lower than expected, <b>and</b> <b>John</b> <b>Kerry</b> and John Edwards' campaigns benefited in Clark's absence. Clark performed reasonably well in later primaries, including a tie for third place with Edwards in the New Hampshire primary and a narrow victory in the Oklahoma primary over Edwards. However, he saw his third-place finishes in Tennessee and Virginia as signs that he had lost the South, a focus of his campaign. He withdrew from the race on February 11, 2004, and announced his endorsement of John Kerry at a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, on February 13. Clark believed his opting out of the Iowa caucus was one of his campaign's biggest mistakes, saying to one supporter the day before he withdrew from the race that [...] "everything would have been different if we had [...]" ...|$|E
