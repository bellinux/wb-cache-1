5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, New York state {{planners}} {{envisioned a}} system of arterial roads in Utica that would include connections to Binghamton and Interstate 81. Due to community opposition, only parts of the highway project were completed, including the North–South <b>Arterial</b> <b>Highway</b> running west of the city. Six New York State highways, one three-digit interstate highway, and one two-digit interstate highway pass through Utica. New York State Route 49 and State Route 840 are east–west expressways running along Utica's northern and southern borders, respectively, and the eastern terminus of each is in the city. New York State Route 5 and its alternate routes—State Route 5S and State Route 5A—are east–west roads and expressways that pass through Utica. The western terminus of Route 5S and the eastern terminus of Route 5A are both in the city. With Route 5 and Interstate 790 (an auxiliary highway of Interstate 90), New York State Route 12 and State Route 8 form the North–South <b>Arterial</b> <b>Highway.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} Middlesex County, Route 18 continues {{north as}} a freeway, entering Old Bridge Township. After interchanging with U.S. Route 9 (exit 30), the freeway ends, and the route becomes an <b>arterial</b> <b>highway</b> through a mostly wooded commercial stretch of Old Bridge. The route crosses several roads in this area. It then passes under County Route 516 and County Route 527 (Old Bridge-Matawan Road), {{but has no}} northbound interchange to connect with them; motorists have to travel through a residential area to access these roads. On the southbound side, motorists can use a cloverleaf or Englishtown Road. Route 18 then enters East Brunswick, then interchanging with Middlesex County Route 615, which also connects to County Route 527.|$|E

Route4 passes over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad before entering the business district of Wickford Junction. The freeway interchanges with Routes2 and102 at exit5, a partial cloverleaf interchange. After the interchange, Route4 bends to the northeast, beginning a parallel alignment with Route2 that continues to its northern terminus. Route4 crosses into the town of East Greenwich, passing under South Road before interchanging with Route2 at exit6, a partial cloverleaf interchange.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} {{countered with}} a proposal calling {{for the construction of}} a new highway along the east bank of the Chenango River that bypassed downtown. Since the bypass would not enter the city limits, the proposed road was not eligible for the <b>arterial</b> <b>highway</b> program. By 1953, the city developed a new plan that gave Broad Street to the state while also establishing East Main Street and the section of East River Road between Main Street and NY23 as arterial highways. The latter two routes would comprise an eastern bypass of northern Norwich while falling within the criteria for the <b>arterial</b> <b>highway</b> program. The revised proposal was approved by city voters by a 641–250 vote in 1953, allowing for bills to add the roads as state highways to enter the New York State Legislature in January 1954. Both were approved and signed into law by Governor Thomas E. Dewey within two months.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 and 1957, an <b>arterial</b> <b>highway</b> was {{constructed}} between Johnstown and Mayfield {{by way of}} Gloversville. The new roadway became a realignment of NY148.

The portion of NY43 north of NY30 and all of NY148 was re-designated as NY30A in April 1960 after pressure from local Automobile Club.|$|E

25|$|NY54 {{was broken}} {{up into a}} handful of routes {{as part of the}} 1930 {{renumbering}} of state highways in New York. The portion of the route south of Mayfield became the northern half of NY148, a new north–south highway that continued past Fonda to Central Bridge. Meanwhile, SH248 and SH1935 were designated as NY349 by the following year. In the mid-1950s, NY148 was realigned between Gloversville and Mayfield to follow a new <b>arterial</b> <b>highway</b> located just north of its original alignment. The former routing of NY148 along East State Street became part of an extended NY349.|$|E

The route is a four lane arterial, winding through the Glen Head section of Oyster Bay. A short distance later, NY107 intersects with another portion of Cedar Swamp Road, which forks to the northeast. After this junction, NY107 becomes a four-lane freeway through Glen Head, with the median being replaced by a concrete barrier. Along this stretch, NY107 crosses under the Long Island Rail Road's Oyster Bay Branch, just west of the Glen Street station. Now in the city of Glen Cove, NY107 passes the water tower and bends northwest. At the city line, NY107 becomes known as Pratt Road.|$|E

Passing north of a residential complex, NY107 bends northwestward once again, crossing through several mansions and intersecting with Wheatley Road. At Wheatley Road, NY107 enters the village of Upper Brookville, passing south of Long Island University's CW Post as it becomes four-lanes and enters an at-grade intersection with NY25A (Northern Boulevard). After NY25A, NY107 enters Old Brookville village, remaining a two-lane residential road.

MD 177 serves as an <b>arterial</b> <b>highway</b> through Pasadena, Jacobsville, and the Lake Shore area of northeastern Anne Arundel County. The highway is paralleled by MD 100 through Pasadena and Jacobsville. MD 177 {{originally}} began near what is now its western intersection with MD 648, which was originally part of MD 2. A short section of the highway was built in Pasadena in the early 1910s. MD 177 was extended east through Jacobsville in the early 1920s and to Gibson Island in the late 1920s. The highway was extended west in the late 1930s after MD 2 was relocated to its present four-lane divided highway. A freeway section of MD 177 was constructed between MD 3 in Glen Burnie and MD 2 in the mid-1960s; the freeway was renumbered MD 100 when that highway was completed from Pasadena to Jacobsville in the early 1970s.
