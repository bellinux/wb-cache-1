5|$|Consistent {{accounts}} of Saruman's earlier history appear in <b>Appendix</b> <b>B</b> to The Lord of the Rings, {{first published in}} The Return of the King, and in the posthumously published The Silmarillion (1977) and Unfinished Tales (1980). All were written in the mid-1950s. Saruman, like Gandalf and Radagast the Brown, {{is one of five}} 'wizards', known as the Istari, who begin to arrive in Middle-earth circa two thousand years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings. They are Maiar, envoys of the godlike Valar sent to challenge Sauron by inspiring the people of Middle-earth rather than by direct conflict. Tolkien regarded them as being somewhat like incarnate angels. Saruman initially travels in the east; he is later appointed head of the White Council and eventually settles at Gondor's outpost of Isengard. Fifty years before The Lord of the Rings, after his studies reveal that the One Ring might be found in the river Anduin near Sauron's stronghold at Dol Guldur, he helps the White Council drive out Sauron in order to facilitate his search.|$|E

The arms of the Holy See are blazoned: gules, two keys in saltire or and argent, {{interlacing}} in the rings or, beneath a tiara argent, crowned or. This means: on a red field are placed two keys, crossed as in the letter X, one gold, the other silver, bound by a gold cord placed through the rings, and, above the keys, a silver (white-coloured) tiara with gold (yellow-coloured) crowns. The arms of Vatican City are identical, except that the gold and silver keys are reversed and the cord is red ("gules") and interlaced {{at the intersection of}} the two keys, as illustrated in <b>Appendix</b> <b>B</b> of the Fundamental Law of Vatican City State, 7 June 1929.|$|E

By contrast, Ludkovsky's C^k-maps need not be C^k in the former sense, at least in positive characteristic.
