While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was {{not covered by the}} environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E

It is now the late-night hub of Plymouth's entertainment strip, but has a reputation for trouble at closing hours.|$|E

From that moment, Reddy decided to make a film in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script.|$|E

Here, NY812 joins NY58 northeast along the southern bank of the now-unified Oswegatchie River to the village of Gouverneur, located in the town of the same name, where NY812 leaves NY58 but joins U.S. Route11 (US11) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of the community.|$|E

5|$|In Berlin Busoni was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> of {{the musical}} world of the Weimar Republic. His works, {{including}} his operas, were regularly programmed.

His last appearance as a pianist was in Berlin in May 1922, playing Beethoven's Emperor Concerto. Amongst his composition pupils in Berlin were Kurt Weill, Wladimir Vogel and Robert Blum, and he also during these last years had contact with Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, Hermann Scherchen and others.|$|E
