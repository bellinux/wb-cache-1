40|$|<b>Anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>meningocele</b> is {{characterized}} by herniation of the meningeal sac due to a developmental bone defect {{in the front of}} a sacrum bone. It was first described in 1837. The sacral meningocele may be congenital or acquired. It is usually discovered during a rectal or pelvic examination as a cystic lesion or discovered incidentally. Most of the symptoms are due to compression on the adjacent organs. In this paper, we present a case of an asymptomatic female patient who had a pelvic cyst detected during a routine obstetric ultrasound examination. We show radiological findings of the detailed postpartum evaluation of the cyst, which led to detection of sacral agenesis, huge <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>meningocele,</b> and significant arcuate uterus...|$|E
40|$|<b>Anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>meningocele</b> is a {{very rare}} {{clinical}} entity characterized by herniation of a meningeal sac through a sacrococcygeal defect. We report {{a case of a}} 20 -year old female with Marfan syndrome who presented with abdominal distention that was misdiagnosed as an ovarian cyst on pelvic ultrasound. Pelvic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging showed large, well-defined multiloculated intrasacral and presacral cysts communicating via two separate broad necks and extending through defects in anterior aspect of sacral vertebrae. This case emphasizes that <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>meningocele</b> should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with pelvic cysts particularly in patients with underlying connective tissue disorders. Because severe neurologic complications or even death may occur without proper preoperative planning in such cases, MR imaging should always be performed for evaluation and characterization of pelvis cystic lesions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>meningocele</b> is an {{extremely}} rare condition {{and there has been}} only one previous report of a prenatal diagnosis.

Neither fetal ultrasound nor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 20 + 5 weeks' gestation could detect communication between the cyst and the spinal cord. Because extension of the pear-shaped cyst through the pelvic diaphragm down to the perineum was reminiscent of dilated vagina and uterine cervix, a tentative diagnosis of hydrometrocolpos secondary to imperforate hymen was considered. On follow-up MRI at 33 + 5 weeks' gestation, a narrow stalk connecting the pelvic cyst and the spinal canal through the anterior sacral foramen was clearly delineated, allowing us to reach the prenatal diagnosis of <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>meningocele...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: Lumbo-peritoneal shunt {{was used}} as an {{alternative}} treatment in a large <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>meningocele,</b> a rare congenital malformation, is illustrated. Clinical Presentation: A 48 -year-old female patient presented with a two-month history of progressive paraparesis, leg pain and numbness of both legs. The investigation demonstrated spina bifida with a huge sac of meningocele, protruding anteriorly into the pelvic cavity. On two previous surgical operations for closure, the fistula through the posterior transsacral approach failed 20 years ago at another hospital, but her symptoms had subsided spontaneously without explanation. She came to Thammmasat Hospital with an episode of spinal cord compression for 2 months. Management: Because of the old surgical scar and high pressure of the meningocele, a lumbo-peritoneal shunt was selected to drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the meningocele to the peritoneal cavity.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} {{the results of}} treatment of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in spinal cord injury by sacral posterior root rhizotomy and <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> root stimulation using the Finetech-Brindley stimulator. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 52 patients with spinal cord lesions and urological problems due to hyperreflexia of the bladder complete posterior sacral root rhizotomy was performed and a Finetech-Brindley <b>sacral</b> <b>anterior</b> root stimulator was implanted. All patients were evaluated and followed with a strict protocol. A minimal 6 -month followup is available in 47 cases. RESULTS: Complete continence was achieved in 43 of the 47 patients with 6 months of followup. A significant increase in bladder capacity was attained in all patients. Residual urine significantly decreased, resulting in a decreased incidence of urinary tract infections. In 2 patients upper tract dilatation resolved. In 3 patients rhizotomy was incomplete and higher sectioning of the roots was necessary. One implant {{had to be removed}} because of infection.

40|$|Study Design. The {{insertion}} {{torque and}} pull-out force after cyclic loading of the bicortical sacral pedicle screw through the S 1 endplate were tested using human cadaveric specimens. Objectives. The {{purpose of this}} study was to (1) evaluate the effect of cyclic loading on the pull-out force of two different techniques of bicortical sacral pedicle screw fixation and (2) to correlate the pull-out force after cyclic loading with the screw insertion torque. Summary of Background Data. Biomechanical studies using conventional sacral pedicle screw fixation techniques have demonstrated reduction in stiffness and strength after cyclic loading. Technical difficulties with <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> cortex penetration and frequent screw loosening have been reported in clinical studies. In the authors' center, a new method of sacral pedicle screw fixation bicortically through the S 1 endplate has been used successfully in the clinical setting. However, the mechanical stability of this new technique after undergoing cyclic loading has not been documented in the literature. Methods. Seven-millimeter compact Cotrel-Dubousset sacral screws were randomly assigned by side (left vs. right) and inserted bicortically either anteromedially through the <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> cortex or superiorly through the S 1 endplate of 17 fresh frozen human sacrum. The tk; 4 maximum insertion torque for each screw was measured. Cyclic loading from 40 N to 400 N was applied to each screw at a frequency of 2 Hz for 20, 000 cycles. Pull-out tests were conducted after completion of the cyclic tests. Results. The mean maximum insertion torque and mean pull-out force following cyclic loading were significantly higher for bicortical fixation through the S 1 endplate (mean 3. 17 N·m and 1457 N) than bicortical fixation through the <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> cortex (mean 1. 98 N·m and 1122 N). Both S 1 endplate and anterior cortical fixation techniques demonstrated significant correlations between insertion torque and pull-out force following cyclic loading. Conclusions. In sacral pedicle screw fixation, screw trajectory through the S 1 endplate was significantly stronger than screws penetrating the <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> cortex. Insertion torque was a good intraoperative indicator of screw pull-out force after cyclic loading. © 2005, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Percutaneous sacroplasty has {{recently}} gained attention {{as a potential}} treatment for sacral insufficiency fractures. We describe a readily identifiable fluoroscopic landmark that facilitates needle placement and validate this with virtual needle placement by using CT data and fluoroscopically guided treatment in 13 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From CTs of 100 consecutive patients, the optimal target zone for needle placement in the sacral ala was defined {{at the intersection of}} lines from each of the corners of the first sacral segment, which is readily identifiable on lateral fluoroscopy. We then measured the distance from that virtual target point to the <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> cortex by using the CT data for 3 specific trajectories: 1) parallel to the L 5 -S 1 disk, 2) axial with respect to the patient, and 3) along the long axis of the sacrum. Case records of 13 consecutive patients treated by using this technique were also reviewed. RESULTS: The mean distances for the 3 trajectories were 11. 3 mm, 11. 2 mm, and 12. 8 mm, respectively. Needle placement would have been outside the <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> cortex in 3 patients. Review of preprocedure imaging easily identified this potential breach. During treatment, needle placement by using the landmark was successful in all patients, and there were no complications.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Endoscopy {{is used on}} {{different}} occasions-for instance, to open {{the floor of the}} third ventricule in triventricular hydrocephalus, to open a cyst into the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, for biopsy or for partial resection of some tumors, or to insert a shunt in hydrocephalus or syringohydromyelia. However, the use of endoscopes for evaluating and treating meningoceles remains to be assessed. METHODS: Five different kinds of rare meningoceles are presented. In each, neuroendoscopy was used as the main tool for exploration and treatment. RESULTS: Two sacral meningoceles and one oral cephalocele were cured through a keyhole opening under endoscopic control. One posterior <b>sacral</b> <b>meningocele</b> was explored and no communication with normal subarachnoid spaces was observed, allowing a simple suture of the posterior to the anterior walls. And, last, a complex case with three intrasacral meningoceles was explored and partially treated. CONCLUSIONS: Meningoceles with very small communication within the normal subarachnoid spaces appeared the most suitable to be cured by an endoscopic procedure. In case of a larger communication, the meningocele could be treated, or at least the morphology can be better understood, by using a keyhole procedure under endoscopic control. In all cases the surgery was of short duration (less than 1 hour) and very well tolerated. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{inferior}} hypogastric plexus mediates pain sensation {{through the}} sympathetic chain {{for the lower}} abdominal and pelvic viscera and {{is thought to be}} a major structure involved in numerous pelvic and perineal pain syndromes and conditions. Objectives. The objective {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the structures affected by an inferior hypogastric plexus blockade utilizing the transsacral approach. Study Design. This is an observational study of fresh cadaver subjects. Setting. The cadaver injections and dissections were performed at the Department of Forensic Sciences and Insurance Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary after obtaining institutional review board approval. Methods. 5 fresh cadavers underwent inferior hypogastric plexus blockade with radiographic contrast and methylene blue dye injection by the transsacral fluoroscopic technique described by Schultz followed by dissection of the pelvic and perineal structures to localize distribution of the indicator dye. Radiographs demonstrating correct needle localization by contrast spread in the specific tissue plane and photographs of the dye distribution after cadaver dissection were recorded for each subject. Results. In all cadavers the dye spread to the posterior surface of the rectum and the superior hypogastric plexus. The dye also demonstrated distribution to the <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> nerve roots of S 1, 2, and 3 with bilateral spread in 3 cadavers and ipsilateral spread in 2 of them. Limitations. The small number of cadaver specimens in this study limits the results and generalization of their clinical significance. Conclusions. Inferior hypogastric plexus blockade by a transsacral approach results in distribution of dye to the <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> nerve roots and superior hypogastric plexus as demonstrated by dye spread in freshly dissected cadavers and not by local anesthetic spread to other pelvic and perineal viscera...|$|R

Calcification and apparent intraluminal hematoma (in the abdominal aorta) were also avoided. To evaluate the radiation dose, the estimated CT dose index volume (CTDIvol) and dose–length product (DLP) were recorded for each image data set following completion of the CT examination, according to the dose report.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to access to pelvis {{position}} and morphology in standing posture and to determine the relative locations of their articular surfaces. This is obtained from coupling biplanar radiography and bone modeling. The technique involves different successive steps. Punctual landmarks are first reconstructed, in space, from their projected images, identified on two orthogonal standing X-rays. Geometric models, of global pelvis and articular surfaces, are determined from punctual landmarks. The global pelvis is represented as a triangle of summits: the two femoral head centers and the sacral plateau center. The two acetabular cavities are modeled as hemispheres. The <b>anterior</b> <b>sacral</b> plateau edge is represented by an hemi-ellipsis. The modeled articular surfaces are projected on each X-ray. Their optimal location is obtained when the projected contours of their models best fit real outlines identified from landmark images. Linear and angular parameters characterizing the position of global pelvis and articular surfaces are calculated from the corresponding sets of axis. Relative positions of sacral plateau, and acetabular cavities, are then calculated. Two hundred standing pelvis, of subjects and scoliotic patients, have been studied. Examples are presented. They focus upon pelvis orientations, relative positions of articular surfaces, and pelvis asymmetries...|$|R
