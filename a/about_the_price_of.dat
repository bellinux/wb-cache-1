5|$|During the Great Depression, Arrington {{was curious}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> {{potatoes}} {{and set about}} his first economic experiment. He put slips of paper {{in some of the}} sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the United Kingdom on vinyl in mid-December 1979, and in the United States on vinyl and 8-track tape two weeks later. A gatefold cover design of the LP was only released in Japan. Though London Calling was released as a double album it was only sold for <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> a single album. The Clash's record label, CBS, at first denied the band's request for the album to be released as a double. In return CBS gave permission for the band to include a free 12-inch single that played at 33⅓ rpm. Ultimately, the planned 12-inch record became a second nine-track LP.|$|E

50|$|The firm became {{engaged in}} railway building, {{including}} {{parts of the}} Great Western Railway and the South Eastern Railway. Not liking the risks involved in these massive public works projects, Grissell dissolved the partnership in 1846. Grissell had numerous contracts for work building the Houses of Parliament, again with Charles Barry as architect. But, due to a dispute <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> refined craftwork, Grissell {{was not able to}} fully complete the building.|$|R
25|$|A {{second major}} cost lay in play scripts. In the years around 1600, playwrights could be paid {{as little as}} £6 to £7 per play (or <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> two suits). Yet since the {{companies}} acted a constantly changing repertory, they needed an abundant supply of plays. Philip Henslowe's Diary records dozens of titles for the 15971603 period; when Worcester's Men were setting up for their first London season in 1602, they purchased a dozen new plays from Henslowe's stable of house playwrights, to supplement their existing stock.|$|E
25|$|Coffee, {{regarded}} as a Muslim drink, was prohibited by Ethiopian Orthodox Christians until as late as 1889; it is now considered a national drink of Ethiopia for people of all faiths. Its early association in Europe with rebellious political activities led to Charles II outlawing coffeehouses from January 1676 (although the uproar created forced the monarch to back down {{two days before the}} ban was due to come into force). Frederick the Great banned it in Prussia in 1777 for nationalistic and economic reasons; concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> import, he sought to force the public back to consuming beer. Lacking coffee-producing colonies, Prussia had to import all its coffee at a great cost.|$|E
25|$|The first {{publicly}} transmitted live trans-Atlantic {{program was}} broadcast via the Telstar satellite on July 23, 1962, at 3:00pm EDT, and Cronkite {{was one of}} the main presenters in this multinational broadcast. The broadcast was made possible in Europe by Eurovision and in North America by NBC, CBS, ABC, and the CBC. The first public broadcast featured CBS's Cronkite and NBC's Chet Huntley in New York, and the BBC's Richard Dimbleby in Brussels. Cronkite was in the New York studio at Rockefeller Plaza as the first pictures to be transmitted and received were the Statue of Liberty in New York and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The first segment included a televised major league baseball game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. From there, the video switched first to Washington, D.C.; then to Cape Canaveral, Florida; then to Quebec City, Quebec, and finally to Stratford, Ontario. The Washington segment included a press conference with President Kennedy, talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> the American dollar, which was causing concern in Europe. This broadcast inaugurated live intercontinental news coverage, which was perfected later in the sixties with Early Bird and other Intelsat satellites.|$|E

500|$|In the 1920s, General Billy Mitchell of the United States Army Air Corps, {{believing that}} air forces had {{rendered}} navies {{around the world}} obsolete, testified in front of Congress that [...] "1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> one battleship" [...] and that a squadron of these bombers could sink a battleship, making for more efficient use of government funds. This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a careful series of bombing tests alongside Navy and Marine bombers. In 1921, he bombed and sank numerous ships, including the [...] "unsinkable" [...] German World War I battleship [...] and the American pre-dreadnought [...]|$|E
2500|$|On March 19, 1838, Pratt {{introduced}} a bill to drastically lower postage rates, and argued that high postage costs disproportionately affected the poor, {{and that it was}} effectively a tax on intelligence, as it hindered the free passage of information. The bill was passed. He felt so strongly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> postage that on his grave he had inscribed [...] "WHILE MEMBER OF CONGRESS; MOVED THE REDUCTION OF POSTAGE; A.D. 1838".|$|E

2500|$|The State Bar of Arizona {{appealed to}} {{a desire to}} {{maintain}} a certain air of [...] "professionalism" [...] among lawyers as justifying its ban on lawyer advertising. [...] Advertising, the State Bar asserted, would [...] "undermine the attorney's sense of dignity and self-worth", [...] "erode the client's trust in the attorney" [...] by exposing an economic motive for representation, and [...] "tarnish the dignified public image of the profession". But the public understands that attorneys make their living at the bar, and few attorneys deceive themselves by thinking otherwise. [...] "Bankers and engineers advertise, and yet these professions are not regarded as undignified. [...] In fact, {{it has been suggested}} that the failure of lawyers to advertise creates public disillusionment with the profession." [...] A lack of information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> legal services tends to dissuade people of modest means from seeking legal representation, even when it is in their best interest to engage such representation. [...] Finally, insofar as the [...] "belief that lawyers are somehow 'above' trade has become an anachronism, the historical foundation for the advertising restraint has crumbled." ...|$|E

But Mill might have said the same thing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> a music box, provided it was properly patented, anywhere at all. For the music box and Shakespere's skull and the corner in wheat are all merely different kinds of examples of the things called a monopoly sale.|$|E
