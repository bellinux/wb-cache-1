5|$|A {{development}} {{in recent years}} that seeks to <b>address</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> has been termed evidence-based medicine. As its name suggests, this approach strives to rigorously study the effects of different interventions instead of relying on logic or tradition. Jeffrey Arnold argues that its application worldwide could lead to the boon of sharing best practices between emergency medicine practitioners in various countries, thus advancing the current standard of emergency care.|$|E
5|$|The {{provision}} of {{and access to}} the routes through the countryside used by the Wicklow Way is dependent on agreement with local authorities and landowners.

5|$|Individuals {{or groups}} could {{petition}} at the Castellania through a supplicha; common cases were from practitioners needing {{a license to}} perform their occupation and the poor requesting social benefits. For such purposes and other, the Castellania and related tribunals employed {{the largest number of}} clerks. At one point, the working environment of the clerks had no standard working hours and their outcome received country-wide criticism; this resulted in counter petitions, with the clients requesting efficient service in less waiting time and the clerks requesting increase in wages. By 1780 a bando was introduced to <b>address</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues.</b>|$|E

Other measures to improve safety and increase capacity are under consideration.|$|E
