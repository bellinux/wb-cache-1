5|$|One other point, already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, <b>and</b> <b>therefore,</b> <b>I</b> believe, you were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E

5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>I</b> cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future.

25|$|Demanding concert tour {{schedules}} caused Rachmaninoff's output as {{a composer}} to slow significantly, so that between {{his arrival in}} the US in 1918 and his death in 1943, he completed just six compositions. Clearly his composition time was limited {{because he had to}} keep performing to support his family, but also his nostalgia for Russia seemed to dampen his compositional creativity. So demanding was his schedule that he termed his concert season 'harvest time’, becoming increasingly disillusioned, and entrenched in the idea of his being a failure: ‘I was born a failure <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>I</b> bear all the burdens that are inseparably part of this status,’ he wrote to Yevgeny Somov in 1923. Despite Rachmaninoff’s concerns, he was lauded by the American public, who loved seeing the famous composer of their favourite Prelude in C-sharp minor.|$|E
500|$|In Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte, a {{biography}} by Napoleon's private secretary, Louis de Bourrienne, {{he notes that}} Le souper de Beaucaire was reprinted as a book– the first edition issued {{at the cost of}} the Public Treasury in August 1798, and a second edition in 1821, following Napoleon's death. He also states, [...] "It was during my absence from France that Bonaparte, in the rank of chef de bataillon , performed his first campaign, and contributed so materially to the recapture of Toulon. Of this period of his life I have no personal knowledge, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>I</b> shall not speak of it as an eye-witness. I shall merely relate some facts which fill up the interval between 1793 and 1795, and which I have collected from papers which he himself delivered to me. Among these papers is a little production, entitled Le Souper de Beaucaire, the copies of which he bought up at considerable expense, and destroyed upon his attaining the Consulate." ...|$|E
500|$|That summer, Prokofiev {{completed}} the Divertimento, Op. 43 (which {{he had started}} in 1925) and revised his Sinfonietta, Op. 5/48, a work started in his days at the Conservatory. In October that year, he had a car crash while driving his family back to Paris from their holiday: as the car turned over, Prokofiev pulled some muscles on his left hand. Prokofiev was therefore unable to perform in Moscow during his tour shortly after the accident, but {{he was able to}} enjoy watching performances of his music from the audience. Prokofiev also attended the Bolshoi Theatre's [...] "audition" [...] of his ballet Le pas d'acier, and was interrogated by members of the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM) about the work: he was asked whether the factory portrayed [...] "a capitalist factory, where the worker is a slave, or a Soviet factory, where the worker is the master? If it is a Soviet factory, when and where did Prokofiev examine it, since from 1918 to the present he has been living abroad and came {{here for the first time}} in 1927 for two weeks ?" [...] Prokofiev replied, [...] "That concerns politics, not music, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>I</b> won't answer." [...] The RAPM condemned the ballet as a [...] "flat and vulgar anti-Soviet anecdote, a counter-revolutionary composition bordering on Fascism". The Bolshoi had no option but to reject the ballet.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, the {{relations}} with United States suffered a major set back and resentment when the United States unilaterally conducted a secret offence (see: Neptune Spear) in Abbottabad, {{which resulted in}} successful execution of Usama Bin Laden.

Gillani reportedly announced that: [...] "We will not allow our soil to be used against any other country for terrorism <b>and</b> <b>therefore,</b> <b>I</b> think it's a great victory, it's a success and I congratulate {{the success of this}} operation." [...] Later Gilani blamed the world for their failure to capture bin Laden.

2500|$|German {{veterans}} particularly criticized Schörner for a 1945 {{order that}} all soldiers found {{behind the front}} lines, who did not possess written orders {{to be in that}} particular area, were to be court-martialed on the spot and hanged if found guilty of desertion. This is mentioned in the writings of Siegfried Knappe, Hans von Luck, and Joseph Goebbels. [...] "Deserters get no mercy from him," [...] Goebbels wrote of Schörner on 11 March 1945. [...] "They are hanged from the nearest tree with a placard round their necks saying: 'I am a deserter. I have declined to defend German women and children <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>I</b> have been hanged.'" [...] (Ich bin ein Deserteur. Ich habe mich geweigert, deutsche Frauen und Kinder zu beschützen und bin deshalb aufgehängt worden.) The approving Goebbels continued with, [...] "Naturally such methods are effective. Every man in Schörner's area knows that he may die at the front but will inevitably die in the rear." [...] Gottlob H. Bidermann, a German infantry officer who served in Schörner's command in 1944-45, reported in his memoirs that the General was despised by officers and men alike.|$|E
2500|$|The January term brought miserable {{weather and}} a {{struggle}} {{to keep up with}} his studies. Around this time, he had an earnest conversation with John Herbert about going into Holy Orders, and asked him whether he could answer yes to the question that the Bishop would put in the ordination service, [...] "Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit". When Herbert said that he could not, Darwin replied [...] "Neither can I, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>I</b> cannot take orders" [...] to become an ordained priest. Even his interest in insect collecting waned. He fell out with one of the two locals he employed to catch beetles when he found that the local was giving first choice to a rival collector. In the doldrums, he joined a crowd of drinking pals in a frequent [...] "debauch". He put in some hard riding. On one night he and three friends saw the sky lit up and [...] "rode like incarnate devils" [...] eleven miles to see the blaze. They arrived back {{at two in the morning}} and violated curfew.
