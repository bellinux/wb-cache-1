40|$|We {{introduced}} simple microscopic non-Markovian walk models which describe underlying {{mechanism of}} <b>anomalous</b> <b>diffusions.</b> In the models, we considered the competitions between randomness and memory effects of previous history by introducing the probability parameters. The memory effects were considered in two aspects, {{one is the}} perfect memory of whole history {{and the other is}} the latest memory improved with time. In the perfect memory model superdiffusion was induced with the relation the Hurst exponent H to the controlling parameter p as H=p for p> 1 / 2. While in the latest memory enhancement models, <b>anomalous</b> <b>diffusions</b> involving both superdiffusion and subdiffusion were induced with the relations H=(1 +α) / 2 and H=(1 -α) / 2 for 0 <α< 1 where α is the parameter controlling the degree of the latest memory enhancement.

In this note, we overcome the difficulty by modifying the Davies' perturbation method to obtain sub-Gaussian upper bounds on the heat kernel.

40|$|Biomembranes are {{exceptionally}} {{crowded with}} proteins with typical protein-to-lipid ratios being around 1 : 50 - 1 : 100. Protein crowding has a decisive role in lateral membrane dynamics {{as shown by}} recent experimental and computational studies that have reported <b>anomalous</b> lateral <b>diffusion</b> of phospholipids and membrane proteins in crowded lipid membranes. Based on extensive simulations and stochastic modeling of the simulated trajectories, we here investigate in detail how increasing crowding by membrane proteins reshapes the stochastic characteristics of the <b>anomalous</b> lateral <b>diffusion</b> in lipid membranes. We observe that correlated Gaussian processes of the fractional Langevin equation type, identified as the stochastic mechanism behind lipid motion in noncrowded bilayer, no longer adequately describe the lipid and protein motion in crowded but otherwise identical membranes. It turns out that protein crowding {{gives rise to a}} multifractal, non-Gaussian, and spatiotemporally heterogeneous <b>anomalous</b> lateral <b>diffusion</b> on time scales from nanoseconds to, at least, tens of microseconds. Our investigation strongly suggests that the macromolecular complexity and spatiotemporal membrane heterogeneity in cellular membranes play critical roles in determining the stochastic nature of the lateral diffusion and, consequently, the associated dynamic phenomena within membranes. Clarifying the exact stochastic mechanism for various kinds of biological membranes is an important step towards a quantitative understanding of numerous intramembrane dynamic phenomena...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince {{the seminal}} work of Russell and Weiss in 1994, resolvent {{conditions}} for various notions of admissibility, observability and controllability, and for various notions of linear evolution equations have been investigated intensively, sometimes {{under the name of}} infinite-dimensional Hautus test. This paper sets out resolvent conditions for null-controllability in arbitrary time: necessary for general semigroups, sufficient for analytic normal semigroups. For a positive self-adjoint operator A, it gives a sufficient condition for the null-controllability of the semigroup generated by −A which is only logarithmically stronger than the usual condition for the unitary group generated by iA. This condition is sharp when the observation operator is bounded. The proof combines the so-called “control transmutation method” and {{a new version of the}} “direct Lebeau–Robbiano strategy”.

40|$|Phase diagram {{based on}} the mean square {{displacement}} (MSD) {{and the distribution of}} diffusion coefficients of the time-averaged MSD for the stored-energy-driven Lévy flight (SEDLF) is presented. In the SEDLF, a random walker cannot move while storing energy, and it jumps by the stored energy. The SEDLF shows a whole spectrum of <b>anomalous</b> <b>diffusions</b> including subdiffusion and superdiffusion, depending on the coupling parameter between storing time (trapping time) and stored energy. This stochastic process can be investigated analytically with the aid of renewal theory. Here, we consider two different renewal processes, i. e., ordinary renewal process and equilibrium renewal process, when the mean trapping time does not diverge. We analytically show the phase diagram according to the coupling parameter and the power exponent in the trapping-time distribution. In particular, we find that distributional behavior of time-averaged MSD intrinsically appears in superdiffusive as well as normal diffusive regime even when the mean trapping time does not diverge.
