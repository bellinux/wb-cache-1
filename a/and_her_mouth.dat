500|$|The {{music video}} starts {{off with a}} blue monitor screen with an eye showing the {{inscription}} [...] "Welcome". The video progresses inside a blue space ship-style room with Madonna lying prostrate in {{what seems to be}} a scientific experiment. The imagery cast in this section of the video have drawn comparisons to hermeticism. The video progresses into a sequence of dreams, containing varied surrealistic, mystic, new age, Sufi and Egyptian imagery and symbolism. Such include a scene in which Madonna lies on a rotating sunflower, and images of a woman with long hair, an alchemist-type man holding a cube with Madonna's face on each side as well as rotating Sufi dancers. The dream sequence progresses with unusual clips, including Madonna in a pool with half-visible skulls. A scene in which Madonna, dressed in a light dressing gown, gives birth to doves, can also be seen; the image has been compared to the work of René Magritte and Kahlo's 1932 painting My Birth. Suddenly, she floats down a corridor in a white gown and appears in a black-and-white projection in a cinema-like room. As the music gets more dramatic, the dream grows intense, with images of skulls and scars appearing, and the singer can be seen wading through space. A scene in which Madonna's eyes are replaced with her mouth <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> with an eye precedes the ending, influenced by the work of Kahlo; the final shots show Madonna waking up and looking out.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Garðar won the {{principal}} role of Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny, in The Phantom of the Opera at Her Majesty's Theatre in London's West End. It {{was in this}} role that he discovered his ability to sing high notes. [...] "I'd been having a bad evening and I was miserable, felt I wasn't even {{good enough to be}} in the chorus. Then in my next scene I went up to the C sharp and it just stayed there. Christine, the soprano, was walking towards me <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> fell open and she whispered to me, 'Wow, is that really you?' I've had those notes ever since." ...|$|E
60|$|Festing {{looked up}} sharply {{and saw that}} Helen was puzzled and suspicious. Her eyes were harder <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> was set.|$|E
60|$|HER tawny {{eyes are}} onyx of thoughtlessness, Hardened {{they are like}} gems in ancient modesty; Yea, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth's</b> prudent <b>and</b> crude caress Means even less than her many words to me.|$|R
50|$|Nguyen's film work {{includes}} Going the Distance, The Last New Year <b>and</b> Below <b>Her</b> <b>Mouth.</b>|$|R
30|$|Silvana opens <b>and</b> closes <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> says affirming “mmm” as she closely {{looks at}} her father.|$|R
60|$|My love lies {{underground}} With {{her face}} upturned to mine, <b>And</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> unclosed {{in the last}} long kiss That ended her life and mine.|$|E
60|$|She {{bit her lip}} {{and faced}} me there, a sweet flushed living thing, with a tear {{coursing}} down her cheek, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> now firm and steady.|$|E
60|$|Under this ferocious banter, she sat {{breathing}} harder, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> was disturbed. Her lips quivered and opened, {{in spite}} of her utmost efforts to keep them still.|$|E
60|$|Jane {{drew back}} with a startled air, <b>and</b> opened <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> all agog, to let in a deep breath.|$|R
60|$|Here she ceased; <b>and</b> {{snapping}} <b>her</b> reticule again, <b>and</b> shutting <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{looked as}} if she might be broken, but could never be bent.|$|R
60|$|She started, {{she stared}} at him with {{distended}} eyes, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> small <b>mouth</b> was open like a ring.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{much was}} it, Aunt Matilda?" [...] asked Uncle Braddock, while Aunt Judy {{opened her eyes}} <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> simply because she could not open her ears any wider than they were.|$|E
60|$|Philippa {{turned and}} looked at him. Her eyes were usually very sweet and soft <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> delightful. Just at that moment, however, there were new and very firm lines in her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "They've 'ad {{a bit of}} a tiff," [...] said Gwendolen, {{attending}} to her duties in the kitchen, with her outdoor hat still on <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> full. [...] "They're rummuns--if ever! My eye!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a big price, Ronnie," [...] he said, [...] "but you'll {{have to pay}} it. The {{sooner you}} marry the girl <b>and</b> close <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> the better." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{got up on}} {{his knees}} <b>and</b> faced <b>her.</b> She {{looked into his eyes}} steadily, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> large <b>mouth</b> trembled with a smile.|$|R
60|$|A little frown {{appeared}} on Aline's forehead <b>and</b> she set <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> mutinously.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the Patchwork Girl laughed. It {{was funny}} {{to see her}} laugh, because her cheeks {{wrinkled}} up, her nose tipped, her silver button eyes twinkled <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> curled at the corners in a comical way.|$|E
6000|$|Gavinia {{thought she}} heard the chink of another five shillings, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> opened so wide that a {{chaffinch}} could have built therein. [...] "Is he {{to look for a}} bottle in the pond?" [...] she asked, eagerly.|$|E
60|$|But Leila thought: 'If I {{were that}} meercat he'd have taken more notice of my paw!' Her heart began {{suddenly}} to ache, {{and she walked}} {{on to the next}} cage with head up, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> hard set.|$|E
6000|$|... "You had to fight, I suppose?" [...] {{continued}} Miss Pritty, shutting <b>her</b> eyes <b>and</b> pursing <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> {{with the}} air of one who braces herself to face the inevitable.|$|R
60|$|The frog {{by nature}} is both damp <b>and</b> cold, <b>Her</b> <b>mouth</b> is large, <b>her</b> belly much will hold; She sits {{somewhat}} ascending, loves to be Croaking in gardens, though unpleasantly.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bell {{had seen}} the blush also, <b>and</b> pursed <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> up, <b>and</b> looked grave. Had there been no {{stammering}} and no blush, she might have thought nothing of it.|$|R
60|$|But he was {{watching}} her throat below the ear, where the flush was fusing into the honey-white, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> that pouted disconsolate. She stirred against him as she walked, and his body was like a taut string.|$|E
6000|$|King Grumpy {{went out}} to meet her, but when he saw her, with a skin like a tortoise's, her thick eyebrows meeting above her large nose, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> from ear to ear, {{he could not help}} crying out: ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{threw back}} her kimono for Gyp to inspect her dress--a girdled cream-coloured shift, {{which made her}} ivory arms and neck seem more than ever dazzling; <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> opened, as if for a sugar-plum of praise. Then, {{lowering}} her voice, she murmured: ...|$|E
60|$|I drew <b>her</b> closer <b>and</b> kissed <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{not once}} nor twice, but {{clinging}} {{to it with}} all the ardor of passion, as if my lips had become glued to hers.|$|R
60|$|Scraps tried that. Her pearl {{teeth were}} unable to chew the bread <b>and</b> beyond <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> there was no opening. Being unable to swallow she threw away the bread and laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{prepared}} for anything," [...] said Pauline, <b>her</b> lustrous eyes <b>and</b> <b>her</b> little <b>mouth</b> opening simultaneously, for she also heard the numerous footfalls outside.|$|R
60|$|He {{was in the}} act of {{concluding}} {{his explanation}} when another chuckle burst upon them from the region of the lamp. This time there was no attempt at concealment, for there stood old Kannoa, partly enveloped in savoury steam, her head thrown back, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> wide-open.|$|E
60|$|He was {{a little}} startled by the earnestness of her words. She seemed pale and fragile, her eyes larger and deeper than usual, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> tremulous. She was like a child with the shadow of some fear hanging over her. He laughed and held her tightly to him.|$|E
60|$|Charlotta the Fourth had blossomed {{out into}} young ladyhood. She wore her hair now in an {{enormous}} pompador and had discarded the blue ribbon bows of auld lang syne, but her face was as freckled, her nose as snubbed, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and smiles as wide as ever.|$|E
60|$|Judy, {{with her}} brother's wink, shakes <b>her</b> head <b>and</b> purses up <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> into no without saying it.|$|R
60|$|The old woman, to {{the unspeakable}} dismay of the Grinder, walked her twisted figure round and round, {{in a ring}} of some four feet in diameter, {{constantly}} repeating these words, <b>and</b> shaking <b>her</b> fist above <b>her</b> head, <b>and</b> working <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> about.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] he said, [...] "I {{swear it}} by this holy token and by your lips," [...] and he kissed first the cross <b>and</b> then <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> adding, [...] "Shall I {{ask the same}} oath of you?" ...|$|R
