40|$|The {{most common}} reason why {{clinical}} trials fail {{is that they}} fall well below their goals for patient accrual. Researchers will frequently overpromise and underdeliver {{on the number of}} patients that they can recruit during the proposed time frame. The result is studies that take far longer than planned and/or that end with fewer patients than planned. This raises serious economic and ethical issues. We have developed a Bayesian model for accrual that will encourage careful planning of <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> as well as allow regular monitoring of accrual patterns during the conduct of the clinical trial. We have developed software in R that can show graphically the expected duration of the trial under initial planning estimates of <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> and that can adjust those <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> as the trial progresses by combing the actual accrual data with the prior beliefs of accrual. This software can be used by individual researchers, by Institution Review Boards during their continuing review of approved projects, and by Data Safety and Monitoring Boards during their interim analysis. We are working on extensions of the software to multi-center trials, to assessing the impact of refusal rates and losses due to exclusion criteria, and to non-uniform <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> (e. g., <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> in a trial expected to have a slow startup period). We are looking for support and collaborators to make the software available on a R server computer using a simplified front-end interface, to test the software prospectively in a series of clinical trials, and to support research on the extensions to new and important areas...|$|R

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} for public pension schemes to offer individuals {{the option to}} delay benefit claiming until after the normal retirement age, and increase the annual benefit level as a result. Existing literature shows that for non-liquidity constrained individuals, delaying benefit claiming {{for a number of}} years after retirement is optimal from a utility perspective in a wide variety of cases. In this paper we focus on non-liquidity constrained individuals who wish to defer pension benefits, and investigate the attractiveness of an alternative deferral strategy. The alternative deferral strategy consists of claiming benefits immediately, and using them to buy deferred annuities from an insurance company. We first determine conditions under which the accrual offered by the public pension scheme for delaying benefit claiming is less than actuarially fair from the viewpoint of an insurer who uses the prevailing term structure of interest rates to determine the expected present value of missed and additional benefits. Actuarial unfairness can be generated by, e. g., age-independent <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> or slow adjustments of the <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> to changes in interest rates. We find that, in particular for men, the degree of actuarial unfairness is such that there is ample room for insurers to profitably offer annuity products that make the alternative deferral strategy preferred to deferring benefit claiming. If individuals choose to strategically exploit these alternative deferral strategies, this will affect benefit claiming behavior in public pension schemes, which in turn affects long run program costs...|$|R
40|$|Outcome-adaptive {{randomization}} {{is one of}} {{the possible}} elements of an adaptive trial design in which the ratio of patients randomly assigned to the experimental treatment arm versus the control treatment arm changes from 1 : 1 over time to randomly assigning a higher proportion of patients to the arm that is doing better. Outcome-adaptive randomization has intuitive appeal in that, on average, a higher proportion of patients will be treated on the better treatment arm (if there is one). In both the randomized phase II and phase III settings with a short-term binary outcome, we compare outcome-adaptive randomization with designs that use 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 fixed-ratio randomizations (in the latter, twice as many patients are randomly assigned to the experimental treatment arm). The comparisons are done in terms of required sample sizes, the numbers and proportions of patients having an inferior outcome, and we restrict attention to the situation in which one treatment arm is a control treatment (rather than the less common situation of two experimental treatments without a control treatment). With no differential patient <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> because of the trial design, we find no benefits to outcome-adaptive randomization over 1 : 1 randomization, and we recommend the latter. If it is thought that the patient <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> will be substantially higher because of the possibility of a higher proportion of patients being randomly assigned to the experimental treatment (because the trial will be more attractive to patients and clinicians), we recommend using a fixed 2 : 1 randomization instead of an outcome-adaptive randomization...|$|R

The open-ended nature of these risks to the employer is the reason given by many employers for switching from defined benefit to defined contribution plans over recent years.

40|$|Background: The use of {{telemedicine}} {{for cancer}} patients is limited, particularly in Asia.

We assessed the feasibility and acceptance of a pharmacist-run tele-oncology service to monitor chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in ambulatory cancer patients. Patients and Methods: A single-center, prospective study was conducted at a local cancer center. Patients' CINV symptoms were monitored through short message service (SMS) for 5 days post-chemotherapy. Feasibility was measured by patients' adherence to the service, patient satisfaction, and number of pharmacist interventions. Acceptance {{was measured by the}} <b>accrual</b> <b>rate.</b> Results: The <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> was 37. 6 % (68 / 181 patients). Sixty patients (median age, 49. 5 years) completed the study.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the German public old age social security program (,Gesetzliche Rentenversicherung') and its incentive effects on retirement decisions.

It summarizes labor market behavior of older persons in Germany during the last 35 years and surveys the empirical literature on the effects of the social security system on retirement in Germany. The paper shows that even after the 1992 reform the German system is actuarially unfair. This generates a substantial redistribution from late to early retirees and creates incentives to early retirement. Indeed, average retirement age is very low in West Germany (about age 59) and even lower in East Germany. This tendency towards early retirement is particularly hurting in times of population aging when the German social security contribution rate is expected to increase dramatically and will substantially exceed the rates in other industrialized countries. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Phase II cancer {{studies are}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} activity of a new drug or a new treatment regimen. Activity is sometimes {{defined in terms of}} a survival probability, a binary outcome such as one-year survival that is derived from a time-to-event variable. Phase II studies are usually designed with an interim analysis so they can be stopped if early results are disappointing. Most designs that allow for an interim look are not appropriate for monitoring survival probabilities since many patients will not have enough follow-up {{by the time of the}} interim analysis, thus necessitating an inconvenient suspension of accrual while patients are being followed. Methods Two-stage phase II clinical trial designs are developed for evaluating survival probabilities. These designs are compared to fixed sample designs and to existing designs developed to monitor binomial probabilities to illustrate the expected reduction in sample size or study length possible with the use of the proposed designs. Results Savings can be realized in both the duration of accrual and the total study length, with the expected savings increasing as the <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> decreases. Misspecifying the underlying survival distribution and the <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> during the planning phase can adversely influence the operating characteristics of the designs. Conclusion Two-stage phase II trials for assessing survival probabilities can be designed that do not require prolonged suspension of patient accrual. These designs are more efficient than single stage designs and more practical than existing two-stage designs developed for binomial outcomes, particularly in trials with slow accrual. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Few trials groups report {{analyses}} of accrual. Although Trans- Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) has reported accrual within individual trials, no analysis {{has ever been}} reported. Type A trials are those trials for which TROG is the principal sponsor and are dependent on accrual from TROG centres. The {{aim of this study}} was to review accrual rates to type A trials over the last 3 years. Methods: All type A trials that had presented accrual data during the TROG annual scientific meetings and the trials review meetings between April 2010 and April 2012 were reviewed. Expected <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> (EAR) and actual <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> (AAR) were estimated from accrual curves as well as initial delays in accrual. Ratios of AAR to EAR (RAEAR) were calculated. Results: There were 16 type A trials from which estimates could be made. The median EAR was 40 patients per year and the median AAR was 20 patients per year. Wide variations in each were noted and the median RAEAR was 0. 67. The median initial delay was 7. 5 months. Conclusions: Although TROG is a highly successful trials organisation, the median AAR is only half of the median EAR and in only three trials (19 %) was the AAR the same or more than the EAR. Future reports could address potential factors affecting the AAR but would require prospective data collection. The RAEAR is one of many factors that can be used to help determine which trials should continue. Overall rates of accrual can be used as a record of TROG’s productivity...|$|E
40|$|Parathyroid hormone (PTH) restores {{bone mass}} to the osteopenic skeleton, but {{significant}} questions remain {{as to the}} underlying mechanisms. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multiligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily; however, recent studies indicate a role in bone physiology. We investigated the significance of RAGE to hormone-induced increases in bone by treating 10 -wk-old female Rage-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice with human PTH-(1 – 34) at 30 μg·kg− 1 ·day− 1 or vehicle control, 7 days/wk, for 7 wk. PTH produced equivalent relative gains in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) throughout the skeleton in both genotypes. PTH-mediated relative increases in cortical area of the midshaft femur were not compromised in the null mice. However, the hormone-induced gain in femoral cancellous bone was significantly attenuated in Rage-KO mice. The loss of RAGE impaired PTH-mediated increases in femoral cancellous bone volume, connectivity density, and trabecular number but did not impact increases in trabecular thickness or decreases in trabecular spacing. Disabling RAGE reduced femoral expression of bone formation genes, but their relative PTH-responsiveness was not impaired. Neutralizing RAGE did not attenuate vertebral cancellous bone response to hormone. Rage-null mice exhibited an attenuated <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> of bone mass, {{with the exception of}} the spine, and an enhanced <b>accrual</b> <b>rate</b> of fat mass.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} distortions in labor supply choices that are {{induced by the}} {{recovery}} policies of pension funds. Pension funds recover from funding shortfalls and surpluses by making adjustments in the contribution rate charged to participants and/or adjusting the value of pension accruals received by participants in return. Deviations between contribution and <b>accrual</b> <b>rates</b> imply that the pension fund levies a net tax or provides a net subsidy on the labor supply of its participants. The resulting distortions in labor supply choices cause labor earnings to become more positively correlated to stock returns, thereby reducing the risk-bearing capacity of participants. Recovery policies prevent pension funds from taking optimal advantage of the risk premium in financial markets. Labor supply distortions are eliminated if financial gains and losses are levied upon participants through lump-sum transfers, rather than through transfers that are proportional to labor supply. My analysis suggests that this policy improvement results in an ex ante welfare gain of almost a full percentage point in terms of certainty equivalent consumption...|$|R
