5|$|In August, Khánh {{gave himself}} more powers, {{provoking}} widespread riots and demonstrations across the nation, with Buddhist activists prominent in expressing opposition against Khánh. The anarchy forced Khánh {{to back down}} and make concessions, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> up in a weaker position than before. Among the concessions he made was to remove or demote some Catholic officials who had been close to Diệm's religiously discriminatory rule, angering the minority Catholic community. Among those demoted were Generals Phát and Đức, both Catholic. They launched a coup attempt backed mainly by Catholic elements against Khánh before dawn on 13 September. They took over the city without firing a shot, and used the national radio station to proclaim the deposing of Khánh's junta. There was little initial reaction {{from most of the}} military commanders, including Thi.|$|E
5|$|In the ODI tri-nation tournament against Australia and Zimbabwe that followed, Pathan was {{the leading}} wicket-taker with 16 wickets {{at an average of}} 31 in his maiden ODI series. After ending with 0/61 from ten overs on debut against Australia, he bounced back to take 3/64 and 3/51 in the next two matches against the World Cup holders. He earned his first {{international}} man of the match award in the tournament, after taking 4/24 against Zimbabwe at the WACA Ground in Perth in his eighth ODI. However, his tour ended on a bad note after he was reprimanded by match referees for mocking the Australian batsman Damien Martyn after his dismissal in the second final. In that match, he took 2/75 as Australia amassed 5/359 and crushed India by 208 runs. Pathan made 30 in the match as his team folded for only 151. His batting improved {{towards the end of the}} tour with three scores of at least 19 in his last four innings, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> with 86 runs at 17.20 for the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{started the}} 2011–12 season well scoring against Norwich City and twice against FC Thun in the UEFA Europa League. With Stoke signing Peter Crouch {{at the end}} of August, Jones found himself out of favour and was {{restricted}} to cup and European matches. This has led to speculation that Jones could be leaving the club in the 2012 January transfer window but Pulis insists that he is still in his plans. He scored an historic goal for Stoke against Dynamo Kyiv to earn them a 1–1 draw which secured Stoke's qualification to the knock-out stage of the Europa League. In 2012–13 Jones remained behind Crouch in Pulis' starting line-up restricting him to cameo appearances off the bench. He regained his place in December 2012 after injury to Crouch and scored his first Premier League goal for sixteen months in a 1–1 draw with Everton. Jones continued his revival scoring against Liverpool on boxing day, and against his old club Southampton on 29 December. Jones lost his place once Crouch had returned to the side <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> the season on a sour note as he was involved in a dressing room bust-up with Glenn Whelan. At {{the end of the season}} Tony Pulis was replaced by Mark Hughes and Jones was critical of the style of football played under Pulis.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July 2009, while {{participating}} in a training match during pre-season with Arsenal in Bad Waltersdorf, Nasri suffered a broken leg. The injury required {{two to three months}} of rest and, as a result, Nasri missed the opening of the 2009–10 Premier League season. He made his debut late in the campaign on 25 October 2009 in a League Cup tie against Liverpool. Nasri played the entire match in a 2–1 win. On 4 November, he scored his first goal of the season in the team's 2009–10 UEFA Champions League group stage match against AZ. Three weeks later, Nasri converted another Champions League goal, this time against Standard Liège in a 2–0 win. He featured heavily with the team during the winter months <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> the 2009 calendar year by scoring a goal and providing an assist 4–1 win over Portsmouth away at Fratton Park.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} Test {{debut in the}} first match of the Ashes series at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. He took match figures of 2/65, his first wicket being Jack Hobbs, and in his first Test innings as a batsman, he hit the first ball for a {{boundary}} but was dismissed off the next ball, before scoring 49 in the second innings as Australia chased 428 for victory. McCabe and Don Bradman were scoring quickly and had taken the score to 3/229 when McCabe lofted Maurice Tate towards mid-on. Syd Copley, {{a member of the}} ground staff who was acting as a substitute fielder dived forward and took a difficult catch. McCabe's dismissal sparked a collapse of 7/104 as England took a 93-run win. McCabe scored 44 and an unbeaten 25 as Australia squared the series with a seven-wicket triumph in the Second Test at Lords. McCabe made 30 in a rain-affected draw in the Third Test, before scoring four and taking 4/41 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, removing Ranjitsinhji, Maurice Leyland, Maurice Tate and Ian Peebles to reduce England to 8/251 in another wash out. With the series locked at 11, the Fifth and final Test at The Oval was a timeless Test. McCabe scored his first Test half-century of 54 as Australia piled on 695 to win by an innings and reclaim the Ashes 21. McCabe took one wicket in the deciding match, bowling leading English batsman Wally Hammond for 13. In all, McCabe scored 210 runs at 35.00 and took eight wickets at 27.62 in the Tests, and aggregated 1012 runs at 32.64 and took 26 wickets at 27.80 for the whole tour. This made him the fifth highest run-scorer for the tour. However, he was unable to register a century on tour, his highest score being 96. He continued his habit of failing to convert his starts into centuries in the tour matches after the start of the Tests. In one stretch of eight county innings, he registered scores between 34 and 79 seven times, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> with seven fifties for the tour. Nevertheless, Wisden praised his attacking ability to disrupt the length of opposition bowlers. On two occasions, McCabe took more than two wickets in an innings.|$|E
5|$|After an eight-game goal drought, Giovinco {{scored a}} hat-trick against D.C. United, on 23 July, in a 4–1 home win, also surpassing De Rosario's {{previous}} all-time record as Toronto FC's top scorer by two goals to 35 goals. With two goals from free kicks during the match, including his {{seventh in the}} MLS, he broke David Beckham's record for most goals from set-pieces in the league since 2010. He {{was named to the}} Team of the Week once again for his performances, and was also named MLS Player of the Week {{for the first time that}} season. On 27 August, Giovinco was brought off the field after the later diagnosis of strains in his quadriceps and adductor in the eventual 1–0 loss in the 401 Derby with Montreal at home; although he was initially expected to be sidelined for a month, the injury was more severe than expected, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ended</b> up missing seven weeks of play. He finally returned to action on 16 October, against Montreal once again, helping to set up Toronto's equaliser in a 2–2 away draw. On 26 October, Giovinco scored the opening goal of a 3–1 home win over Philadelphia, both his and Toronto FC's first MLS Playoff goal in the MLS Cup Playoffs, and was later involved in his team's next two goals; this was Toronto's first ever playoff win, which enabled the team to progress to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals for the first time. On 6 November in the second leg of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, Giovinco scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 away win over New York City FC, 7–0 on aggregate, to progress to the Eastern Conference Finals in an all Canadian derby against Montreal Impact. In the first leg of the Eastern Conference Final on 22 November, Giovinco set up Jozy Altidore's goal in a 3–2 away loss to Montreal. Toronto later beat Montreal 5–2 in extra time in the return leg at home on 30 November, as Giovinco once again set up Altidore's goal, winning on an aggregated score of 7–5, making Toronto FC the first Canadian team to compete in an MLS Cup Final; although he was forced off in the 97th minute due to cramp in his calf, he was later declared fit to play against Seattle Sounders in the 2016 MLS Cup Final. On 5 December, he was named to the MLS Best XI for the second season in a row, despite being left off the finalists list for the MLS MVP.|$|E
