5|$|NCMPs {{have raised}} <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> in Parliament {{a wide range}} of issues. What follows are some of the more notable issues mentioned.|$|E
5|$|Following U.S. Democratic {{presumptive}} {{presidential nominee}} Barack Obama's selection of Biden, the Senator's vice-presidential general election campaign began. During the campaign, {{he used his}} political experience to complement Obama, <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> Republican Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Biden was elected Vice President on November 4, 2008, and sworn in on January 20, 2009.|$|E
5|$|During {{his stay}} in South Africa, along with scriptures and {{philosophical}} texts of Hinduism and other Indian religions, Gandhi read translated texts of Christianity {{such as the}} Bible, and Islam such as the Quran. A Quaker mission in South Africa attempted to convert him to Christianity. Gandhi joined them in their prayers <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> Christian theology with them, but refused conversion stating he did not accept the theology therein or that Christ was the only son of God.|$|E
5000|$|In 2014, {{interest}} from multiple students {{led to the}} creation of a Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> Program where students compete in a range of different public speaking <b>and</b> <b>debate</b> events across a statewide and national level. As of 2016, the Bridges team is an active member school of the National Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> Association, <b>and</b> has qualified students to the CHSSA State Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> Championship Tournament <b>and</b> the NSDA's National Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> Tournament Finals in only two years of existence.|$|R
2500|$|Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> is {{one among}} many high caliber extracurricular {{activities}} at Albuquerque Academy. The Albuquerque Academy style of Original Oratory is popular on the National Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> circuit, {{brought about by}} 2001 champion Yasmin Mashhoon and coach Randy McCutcheon. At the 2009 State Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> Tournament, Albuquerque Academy had five state champions, as well as winning Speech Sweepstakes, <b>Debate</b> Sweepstakes, <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> Coach of the Year (Susan Ontiveros). The Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> team had held the state title for 24 straight years by 2010(taking Speech Sweepstakes, <b>Debate</b> Sweepstakes, <b>and</b> having many state champions.) At the 2014 New Mexico State Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> Tournament, the Albuquerque Academy Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> team reclaimed the title by winning the Speech Sweepstakes, <b>Debate</b> Sweepstakes, <b>and</b> having 7 state champions.|$|R
50|$|The National Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> Association, {{formerly}} the National Forensic League, is an interscholastic speech <b>and</b> <b>debate</b> organization serving the middle school, high school, {{and college students}} in the United States. The Association provides competitive speech <b>and</b> <b>debate</b> activities, resources, training, scholarship opportunities, and advanced recognition.|$|R
5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders {{began to}} write about social policy. His major concern was human {{development}} in a technological era. He addressed employing spiritual guidance with a “program of human values” to achieve a good life. Nevertheless, his underlying goal was to achieve “full employment.” So, he kept himself grounded in economic principles, as understood <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> during that era.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, hostility towards Dissenters increased. A Bill against {{occasional}} conformity was {{passed through the}} House of Commons <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> in the Lords. Figures such as Henry Sacheverell, a High church clergyman, warned against Dissenters assuming positions of political power. His lead {{was followed by the}} Tory press, who published a number of sermons and pamphlets making similar arguments. In December, Defoe published his own pamphlet, The Shortest Way, assuming the same stylistic conventions as the Sacheverell and the Tory publications.|$|E
5|$|Lemuriform origins {{are unclear}} <b>and</b> <b>debated.</b> American {{paleontologist}} Philip Gingerich proposed that lemuriform primates evolved {{from one of}} several genera of European adapids based on similarities between the front lower teeth of adapids and the toothcomb of extant lemuriforms; however, this view is not strongly supported {{due to a lack}} of clear transitional fossils. Instead, lemuriforms may be descended from a very early branch of Asian cercamoniines or sivaladapids that migrated to northern Africa.|$|E
50|$|Rio's speech <b>and</b> <b>debate</b> {{class was}} {{canceled}} for the 2010-2011 school year. However, Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> still runs as a club.|$|R

ACJC's traditional Intercollegiate Debating Championships is now recognised by the Ministry of Education as the main debate tournament for pre-tertiary institutions in Singapore.|$|R
5|$|Reactions to the {{disclosure}} were diverse, encompassing commentary and {{articles in the}} electronic, print, and broadcast media; the Wikipedia community researched Essjay's article edits to check for errors <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his editorial activities Jordan spent less time editing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|Breyer {{was born}} in San Francisco, California, the son of Anne A. (née Roberts) and Irving Gerald Breyer, and raised in a middle-class Jewish family. Irving Breyer was legal counsel for the San Francisco Board of Education. Both Breyer and his younger brother, Charles, who is a federal {{district}} judge, are Eagle Scouts of San Francisco's Troop 14. Breyer's paternal great-grandfather emigrated from Romania to the United States, settling in Cleveland, where Breyer's grandfather was born. In 1955, Breyer graduated from Lowell High School. At Lowell, {{he was a member}} of the Lowell Forensic Society <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> regularly in high school tournaments, including against future California governor Jerry Brown and future Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{critics were}} {{pleased with the}} album. Cyrus was praised for being natural and {{reflected}} while performing as herself. They also complimented Swift's performance <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> if she or Cyrus were more dominant. The soundtrack received a nomination for a 2009 American Music Award for Favorite Soundtrack, but lost to the Twilight soundtrack. Hannah Montana: The Movie reached the top ten in many nations, and topped charts {{in countries such as}} Austria, Canada, and New Zealand. In the United States, it peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. By May 2009, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album platinum.|$|E

5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered <b>and</b> <b>debated.</b> He wished Thror's map to be tipped in (that is, glued {{in after the}} book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held up to the light. In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E
5|$|Many doctors {{considered}} {{the case to}} be unusual <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> the cause of death. Some, including family members, accused them of criminal negligence; that Shepard was fed well before the operation, which could have allowed him to choke on vomit. No autopsy was made, but an inquest {{was made by the}} coroner. The two doctors to perform the operation made a statement on March 28, 1893 that after prior examinations no diseases were found and his heart and lungs seemed healthy. A Tribune reporter met doctor William J. Morton, son of possible ether discoverer William T. G. Morton who had first used it in 1846. Morton said it was most improbable Shepard died of ether, ensuring its safety when properly used, and that deaths were one in 25,000. He recommended an autopsy.|$|E
5|$|Already the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland has a {{great impact}} on the king's powers. From 1505 the king could not pass laws himself without the {{approval}} of the sejm, this being forbidden by Polish szlachta privilege laws like nihil novi. According to the nihil novi constitution, a law passed by the sejm had to be agreed by the three estates (stany sejmujące; the king, the senate and deputies from the sejm proper - the lower chamber). There were only few areas in which the king could pass legislation without consulting the sejm: on royal cities, peasants in royal lands, Jews, fiefs and on mining. The three estates of the sejm had the final decision in legislation on taxation, budget and treasury matters (including military funding), foreign policy (including hearing foreign envoys and sending diplomatic missions) and ennoblement. The sejm received fiscal reports from deputy treasurers, <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> on most important court cases (the sejm court), with the right of amnesty. The sejm could also legislate {{in the absence of the}} king, although such legislation would have to be accepted by the king ex post.|$|E
5000|$|At Catholic Memorial, {{nearly every}} student participates in [...] "forensics", or speech <b>and</b> <b>debate,</b> {{at one point}} in his {{academic}} career. CM faculty teach students to public speaking through various classroom activities; in the Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> club students perform and compete interscholastically as they recite speeches, dramatic acts and original oratory. Since 1961 the school's Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> program has produced over twenty-five state and three national champions. The 2010 team won the [...] "Founder's Award" [...] at Nationals. The Forensics Team won the 2017 Massachusetts Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> State Chamionship.|$|R
5000|$|Pi Kappa Delta (ΠΚΔ) is a Forensics (Public Speaking <b>and</b> <b>Debate)</b> Honor Society for {{undergraduate}} {{university students}} and a professional organization for graduates, typically university Speech <b>and</b> <b>Debate</b> Coaches.|$|R

It {{is one of four}} major {{national}} organizations that direct high school competitive speech <b>and</b> <b>debate</b> events in the United States. The others are the National Catholic Forensic League or NCFL, the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association or NCFCA, and Stoa.|$|R

25|$|In U.S. history, the {{relationship}} between Thomas Jefferson and slavery was a complex one in that Jefferson passionately worked to gradually end the practice of slavery while himself owning hundreds of African-American slaves throughout his adult life. Jefferson's position on slavery has been extensively studied <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> by his biographers and by scholars of slavery.|$|E
25|$|The lizard genus Anolis on {{the islands}} in the Caribbean has also {{been the subject of}} {{numerous}} studies investigating the role of competition and character displacement in community structure. Lesser Antilles islands can only support Anolis species of different sizes, and the relative importance of character displacement versus size at colonization in determining invasion success has been explored <b>and</b> <b>debated.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, public {{officials}} and public hygiene experts studied <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> sanitation for several decades. The {{construction of an}} underground network of pipes to carry away solid and liquid waste was only begun in the mid 19th-century, gradually replacing the cesspool system, although cesspools were still in use {{in some parts of}} Paris into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|While the {{validity}} of the existence of paranormal phenomena is controversial <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> passionately by both proponents of the paranormal and by skeptics, surveys are useful in determining the beliefs of people in regards to paranormal phenomena. These opinions, while not constituting scientific evidence for or against, may give an indication of the mindset of a certain portion of the population (at least among those who answered the polls).|$|E
25|$|Dr Bainbridge of St Martin's Lane and Surgeon Lawrence {{attended}} {{him at the}} Angel Tavern <b>and</b> <b>debated</b> {{whether his}} leg should be amputated. When told he would lose his leg at the hip, Mynn, a sincerely religious man, asked {{for a few minutes}} to say his prayers. In those minutes the doctors decided not to operate and instead had him sent to St Bartholomew's Hospital. After two years convalescence, he fully recovered.|$|E
