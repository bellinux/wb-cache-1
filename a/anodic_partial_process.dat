40|$|We {{report on}} the {{electroless}} copper deposition with formaldehyde as the reducing agent. The reaction occurs in high-ly alkaline solutions. Since copper ions are present as EDTA complexes, a catalyst is needed to facilitate copper ion reduc-tion. Methanediolate anions, intermediates of the formaldehyde oxidation, act as such a catalyst. Furthermore, freshly deposited copper exhibits increased catalytic activity toward formaldehyde oxidation. Both effects lead to strong cou-pling between the <b>anodic</b> and cathodic <b>partial</b> <b>processes.</b> Such a feedback can lead to oscillatory behavior of the deposi-tion reaction.

Nevertheless, systematic researches on this problems are scarce. In this paper, {{in order to}} verify if the quoted phenomenon is generalizable, the influence of different organic substances on the corrosion of Armco iron in 1 N H 2 SO 4 solution has been studied. Organic compounds of different molecular structure and stability (nitrile, azole and triazole derivatives) have been considered. To {{determine the influence of}} the concentration of the additives, spectrophotometric and gravimetric measurements of iron corrosion rates {{in a wide range of}} additive concentration have been performed.

40|$|Norwegian {{concrete}} {{structures are}} exposed to salt contamination from both sea water and de-icing salts. Chlorides penetrate the concrete cover and initiate corrosion of the reinforcement. The deterioration process can propagate at high rates and endanger serviceability and structural safety. Concrete resistivity is usually assumed to correlate closely with the corrosion process, and its measurement is in principle simple and costefficient, and widely recommended to support service life assessment. However, {{the extent to which}} concrete resistivity measurements can provide us with detailed information about the corrosion process needs critical examination. The main objective of this PhD project was to study the applicability of concrete resistivity measurement for predicting the rate of reinforcement corrosion induced by chlorides. A review of the literature led to the conclusion that a general correlation could be found between increasing concrete resistivity and decreasing corrosion rate, but a large scatter was observed within and between the studies reviewed. Various possible reasons for the discrepancies were identified: researchers used dissimilar procedures for determining both concrete resistivity and corrosion rate, and concrete composition was recognised as affecting the overall tendency. Interestingly, the literature contained very limited discussion on the mechanisms involved in providing the correlation assumed between concrete resistivity and corrosion rate. On the basis of the literature review, it seemed appropriate to investigate the relationship between concrete resistivity and corrosion rate further using specially designed laboratory experiments. In total, three experimental studies were conducted using mortar to investigate the subject. The first study focused on the limitations of measuring galvanic currents in macro-cells. It was confirmed that galvanic current measurements provide an indication of the actual corrosion current, and thereby rate, only if the actively corroding segment is sufficiently small. The second experimental study investigated the limitations of bulk resistivity measurements for predicting the ohmic resistance in a macro-cell between small anodes and a large cathode network. It was found that for small anodes the ohmic resistance between the anode and the cathode is not directly correlated with the bulk resistivity. Local inhomogeneities strongly influence the measurements. The ratio between bulk resistivity and the resistance between a specific anode and the cathode was not constant over time and varied in particular with changes in the moisture conditions. The third experimental study examined the influence of mortar resistivity on the ratelimiting steps of chloride-induced corrosion. It was shown that for small anodes the local conditions around the anode are more decisive for the <b>anodic</b> and ohmic <b>partial</b> <b>processes</b> than the bulk resistivity. The cathodic <b>partial</b> <b>process</b> was found to be practically independent of the mortar resistivity. For the setup and materials investigated, {{it was not possible to}} identify any one rate-limiting step as dominant. The controlling rate-limiting step varied for the different materials investigated. For mortar prepared with fly ash, and therefore possessing high mortar resistivity, the concept of anodic-resistance control suggested in the literature was found to fit well. Cathodic control was identified for mortars with a comparatively low bulk resistivity (prepared only with Portland cement). Furthermore, it was confirmed that the generally assumed inverse correlation between corrosion rate and concrete resistivity depends very much on the material composition. In conclusion, it was found that there can be no direct relationship between concrete resistivity and the corrosion rate. The dependency on material composition and in particular the fact that concrete resistivity is not directly correlated with the underlying <b>partial</b> <b>processes</b> that determine the corrosion rate must be considered as decisive on this question. It must therefore be assumed that the direct relationships between concrete resistivity and corrosion rate introduced in the literature, and any models and general threshold values based upon them, are not generally applicable...|$|R

In the second stage the stones are under the angle of repose and increase of height of the mound can only be accomplished together with an increase in width of the basis. In the dumping process four sub-processes can be distinguished, i. e. the positioning of the dumping vessel, the start of the falling process, the falling process itself and jumping and rolling of the stones that hit the bottom. Three different <b>partial</b> <b>processes</b> can take place during the falling process. The first one is a (semi-) diffusion process, which results in a swinging motion of a singular stone.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper the author {{proposed}} {{a method of}} determining the respective rate laws for partial proc-esses in mixed potential systems (1). This method has recently been applied to electroless copper plating sys-tems (2). The emphasis in that work (2) and sub-sequent publications (3, 4) was toward a determination of the reaction orders in order to elucidate the r action mechanism. However, the resulting reaction orders made an exact elucidation impossible: it was possible only to make general remarks concerning possible mechanisms (3, 4). One may question the validity of an indirect analysis particularly when nonintegral re-action orders are obtained and an atomistic mecha-nism cannot be proposed (2 - 4). This note will provide a means of testing the analysis further and will indi-cate how additional information associated with the rate law can be obtained. Since only selective pieces of data {{are used in the}} determination of the reaction orders for the <b>partial</b> <b>processes</b> (1, 2), it is possible that an incorrect anal-ysis and/or poor data could lead to incorrect rate laws. A typical test of the validity of a rate law in chemical kinetics is the determination of the specific rate con-stant using all of the rate data.

Therefore, the computation of the rate constants for the <b>partial</b> <b>processes</b> provides a means of testing both the theoretical analysis {{and the quality of the}} data.

40|$|Corrosion in {{geological}} disposal facilities of high level nuclear waste {{is of great}} importance to maintain {{the integrity of the}} waste container and thus ensure the public safety. Specifically, a nuclear waste “Supercontainer” has been designed by Belgium with carbon steel as being the main metallic barrier material. The corrosion environment in the Supercontainer has been determined to be anoxic {{for the vast majority of}} the service period, and the forms of corrosion are expected to be mainly general passive corrosion and pitting corrosion due to passivity breakdown. In order to realize the prediction of accumulated corrosion damage over the exceedingly long service horizon of the Supercontainer (> 100, 000 years), employment of mechanistically based or analytic models are necessary. Accordingly, the passivity and passivity breakdown of carbon steel were investigated in this dissertation work experimentally using electrochemical techniques and analyzed within the framework of the Point Defect Model (PDM), an analytical model describing the mechanism of passivity. A mixed potential model has been developed to deconvolve the negative total current density that is observed at potentials more negative than the open circuit potential, Ecorr, under anoxic conditions into its <b>partial</b> <b>anodic</b> and cathodic components as a function of potential across the passive range. Deconvolution was successfully achieved by optimizing a Mixed Potential Model (MPM) comprising the PDM to describe the <b>partial</b> <b>anodic</b> <b>process</b> and the Butler-Volmer equation to describe the <b>partial</b> cathodic <b>process</b> of hydrogen evolution. In this manner, the corrosion rate can be determined across the entire passive range, including the range of potential (E < Ecorr) within which the net observed current density is negative. The commonly observed irreversibility of the passive state on carbon steel in alkaline solutions was examined in simulated concrete pore solution under anoxic conditions replicated by applying relatively negative film formation potentials, at which the cathodic process dominates the passive system. The fundamental source of this irreversibility was investigated by describing the kinetics of the passive system by the MPM. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Mott-Schottky analysis and model optimization were performed at each potential when the potential was first stepped in the anodic direction and then in the cathodic direction. The experiment and optimization results demonstrate that the irreversibility of the passive state is closely associated with the discrepancy in the defect structure of the passive film upon opposite stepping directions of the film formation potential, and is essentially caused by the slower film formation and slower film dissolution during the cathodic potential stepping than those during the anodic potential stepping. The theory of the kinetics of nucleation of metastable pits in terms of the PDM has been applied the first time to describing the evolution of the nucleation rate of metastable pits on a variety of metallic substrates. The PDM successfully accounts for the experimental data that have been reported in the literature on stainless steel, carbon steel, iron, aluminum, and Alloy- 22, and which are judged to be reliable and reproducible. Important fundamental parameters related to metastable pitting such as total number density of pitting nucleation sites, dissolution time of the cap over the pit, energy related to absorption of the aggressive ions into oxygen vacancies in the surface of the barrier layer, vacancy condensation rate, and the time at which the nucleation rate of metastable pits is maximum were obtained from the optimization of the PDM on the experimental data, as reported in the present paper. The values obtained for those parameters are in good agreement with values and observations reported elsewhere. Finally, passivity breakdown on carbon steel was studied in various solutions with different pH values, chloride concentrations, and temperatures. The data are interpreted in terms of the PDM, too. An increase in temperature from 25 °C to 85 °C results in a decrease in localized corrosion resistance according to a linear relationship between the critical pitting potential and log (chloride activity) for all chloride concentrations. The linear dependence of the critical pitting potential on the square root of potential scan rate, as predicted by the PDM, yields an estimate of the critical areal concentration of condensed cation vacancies at the metal/ﬁlm interface that leads to the passivity breakdown...|$|R
