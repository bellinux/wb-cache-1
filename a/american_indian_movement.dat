The AIM Grand Governing Council is based in Minneapolis and retains {{the name of the}} national group. It says that the schism arose when Means, Churchill, Glenn T. Morris and others openly supported the Miskito Indian group Misurasata, who were allied with the anti-revolutionary, CIA-backed Contras.|$|E

The COINTELPRO Papers (1990; reissued 2002), also co-authored with Jim Vander Wall, examines a series of original FBI memos that detail the Bureau's activities against various leftist groups, from the U.S. Communist Party in the 1950s to activists concerned with Central American issues in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Movement,</b> {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E

40|$|Drawing on methodologies from Performance Studies and Transnational American Studies, this {{dissertation}} is {{an historical}} {{analysis of the}} transatlantic relations of the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> radical sovereignty <b>movement</b> of the late Cold War. First the study recovers the transnational dimension of Native Americans as historical actors, and demonstrates that the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> radical sovereignty <b>movement</b> of the early 1970 s posed a transnational challenge to the U. S. nation state. Next, arguing against the scholarly consensus, it shows that by the mid- 1970 s the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> radical sovereignty <b>movement</b> transformed itself into a transnational struggle with a transatlantic wing. Surveying the older transatlantic cultural representations of <b>American</b> <b>Indians,</b> this study finds that they both enabled and constrained an alliance between Native radical sovereignty activists and European solidarity groups in the 1970 s and 1980 s. This dissertation traces the history of <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> access and participation in the United Nations, documents the transformation of Native concepts of Indian sovereignty, and analyzes the resulting alliances in the UN between <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> organizations, Thir...|$|R
5|$|Although often {{assumed to}} be a debate of recent origins, local Washington, D.C. {{newspapers}} have published news items on the controversy many times since at least 1971, all in response to Native American individuals or organizations asking for the name to be changed. National protests began in 1988, after the team's Super Bowl XXII victory, prompting numerous Native Americans to write letters to Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke; others boycotted Redskins products and protested, but Cooke rejected the possibility of change. There was a protest of about 2,000 people at the 1992 Super Bowl between the Redskins and the Buffalo Bills; the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Movement's</b> (AIM) Vernon Bellecourt {{was one of the main}} organizers of the protest.|$|R

Tommy has encountered intolerance in an assimilationist school system and racist North American society, but his family encourages him to be proud of his Okanagan heritage. He becomes an activist for Aboriginal rights. Armstrong has said that Slash is not a chronicle of AIM (<b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Movement); rather, the text provides a personalized account of the origins and growth of Native activism since the 1960s (Lutz 22 and Jones 51).|$|R

25|$|Approximately 10,000 largely {{peaceful}} protesters marched {{against the}} war in Iraq and 2,000 more to end homelessness and poverty.

About 1,000 people in place for the third major march, and the last to be sanctioned, were stopped on Thursday, September 4, 2008, by police because they attempted to begin their march after the time their march permit expired. The Anti-War Committee, which supports nonviolent action and civil disobedience and had cooperated with anarchist groups, had organized and publicized the march to protest at the time of McCain's acceptance speech, which was in violation of the court-approved protest permit time.|$|E
5000|$|For {{about three}} years in the early 1990's, Risling, Jack D. Forbes, Morrison & Foerster and many others collaborated with fimmaker Jan Crull, Jr. to make a film about the {{controversy}} surrounding D-Q University and its turbulent relationship with the U.S. government. The media had labelled this school as being [...] "controversial" [...] for years and as one of the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Movement's</b> [...] "centers". [...] Crull had been drawn to the D-Q U story from the time that he was a professional Hill staffer responsible for the shaping of a U.S. House hearing on legislation that D-Q U was seeking in 1981. He and the Rislings had developed a rapport over the years since which ultimately led to the A Free People, Free To Choose film project. Well over a hundred hours of footage had been shot when a schism between some of the film's subjects erupted into becoming litigation. Morrison & Foerster was the first sponsor to withdraw from the project and eventually Crull had to scrap it even though distribution for a completed film was already in place.|$|R
40|$|Framed by {{histories}} of Lakotas {{in the twentieth}} century, <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Activism, and the “long civil rights movement,” this dissertation seeks to provide new perspectives on the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> civil rights <b>movement.</b> Although the United States government removed Lakotas from western Nebraska {{in the late nineteenth}} century, some returned to a portion of their homeland, settling and working in the border town of Gordon and the region’s two largest towns, Alliance and Scottsbluff, in the twentieth century. Between 1917 and 2000, Lakotas living in off reservation communities in western Nebraska created a grassroots reform movement, whose goals differed from the national and pan-Indian civil rights movement. Although many were enrolled tribal members of the Oglala or Sičháŋğu Lakota Nations, Lakotas in western Nebraska were more concerned with ending segregation and racism in their communities than explicitly addressing tribal sovereignty. Lakota leaders not only fought to end discrimination, but also {{for the federal government to}} continue providing its trust responsibilities to Lakotas in western Nebraska. This dissertation reveals that <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> civil rights’ origins are more diverse than being rooted in national <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> organizations. The <b>movement</b> that arose in western Nebraska provides an example of <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> activism that developed in a rural off reservation region...|$|R

500|$|Many {{supporters}} of Native American mascots {{feel that the}} financial cost of changing mascots would far outweigh the benefits. Sales of merchandise with team mascots and nicknames ranging from T-shirts to beer cozies generate {{millions of dollars in}} sales each year, and teams contend that a change in team mascots would render this merchandise useless. The cost of removing images from uniforms and all other items, which must be paid out of local school funds, is a greater factor for secondary schools. Opponents feel that despite the cost of a change in team mascots, it should be done to prevent what they believe is racial stereotyping. Clyde Bellecourt, when director of the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Movement</b> stated: [...] "It's the behavior that accompanies all of this that's offensive. The rubber tomahawks, the chicken feather headdresses, people wearing war paint and making these ridiculous war whoops with a tomahawk {{in one hand and a}} beer in the other; all of these have significant meaning for us. And the psychological impact it has, especially on our youth, is devastating." ...|$|E

Herring 2 ̆ 7 s biography of Kenekuk, the Kickapoo prophet, reveals a rare blend of leadership skills that Kenekuk employed to unite the Vermillion band, first in Illinois and then in Kansas. Using a variety of stratagems, Kenekuk, sometimes with reason and other times with bluster, fenced with politicians and government bureaucrats to delay removal from ancestral lands. The band stayed on in Illinois much longer than might otherwise be expected. He understood the white settlers 2 ̆ 7 mentality, and attempted to inculcate attitudes among his followers that might gain at least temporary approval of the whites. When the band did remove, its western settlements quickly became showpieces of hard-work and sobriety...|$|R
