[...] Oyelowo also responded to the controversy, believing that it came from a result of Faulkner's male fans. Comedian Charlie Brooker however, commended the scene, as well as the series in general, stating in his Guardian column: [...] "The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up <b>and</b> <b>blinked</b> in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation." [...] In a January 2010 poll, fans of the show voted Helen's death as the [...] "most shocking death scene" [...] in the series, drawing 49% of the votes.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} {{attracted}} controversy for its second episode, which saw {{the demise of}} a main character after her hand and head were forced into a deep fryer. The scene attracted over 250 complaints, 154 {{of them to the}} television watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. Following the complaints, the BBC admitted that the scene [...] "clearly disturbed" [...] several viewers, but defended it as it was showing the audience [...] "the kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in the fight against terrorism." [...] The Broadcasting Standards Commission stated the scene was shocking, but [...] "in the context was acceptable and important for the later narrative". However the watchdog still criticised the BBC for failing to warn viewers of the violence to come in the scene. The controversy sparked a response from comedian Charlie Brooker in his Guardian column, stating: [...] "The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up <b>and</b> <b>blinked</b> in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between arousal level <b>and</b> <b>blink</b> rate {{has not yet}} been clarified. One of the causes is a difference of the task done by previous study. Visual tasks greatly influence blink rate, therefore, it is necessary to examine the {{relation between}} arousal level <b>and</b> <b>blink</b> rate as it pertains to vision. In this study, the relation between arousal level <b>and</b> <b>blink</b> rate was examined through testing the effects that performing visual task and non-visual task (auditory task) had on 12 university students. The index of arousal level was an electroencephalogram (α-index). As a result of the experiment, we proposed hypothesis relating arousal level <b>and</b> <b>blink</b> rate. In this hypothesis, the blink rate decreases as arousal level decreases when arousal level decreases below a certain level. However, with visual tasks, the blink rate tends to temporarily increase as arousal level decrease. And, we also proposed extended hypothesis. In this hypothesis, when arousal level increases markedly, the blink rate also increases...|$|R

30|$|The Bayesian method {{developed}} by Cox et al. (Cox et al. 2012; Rosten et al. 2013) globally analyzes sequential frames and applies a statistical model to infer {{the best possible}} distribution of molecules using their <b>blinking</b> <b>and</b> bleaching properties across different frames. Spatially overlapping fluorophores are allowed in any particular frames and molecules are resolved by a priori knowledge about the proceeding frames and a posteriori estimates of the bleaching <b>and</b> <b>blinking</b> of the molecules in the subsequent frames.

40|$|The {{importance}} of the interval between con-tractions of heart muscle for the strength of con-traction has been appreciated for almost 100 years (Bowditch, 1871). Today the term “in-terval-strength relationship ” encompasses all direct effects of cardiac rate and rhythm on myocardial contractile performance (Koch-Weser <b>and</b> <b>Blinks,</b> 1963). Of foremost physiologic importance is {{the influence of the}} frequency of activation of the heart on the strength and time course of its contraction (Koch-Weser, 1963; Koch-Weser <b>and</b> <b>Blinks,</b> 1963). Other manifes-tations of the interval-strength relationship include the transient changes in myocardial con-tractility which follow sudden changes in fre-quency and those seen with one or more prema-ture beats or after periods of inactivity. All such interval-dependent changes in contractility arise from changes both in the duration of the active state and in the degree of activation of the contractile element (Koch-Weser <b>and</b> <b>Blinks,</b> 1963). Changes in the latter can be accounted for by the complex interactions of two opposing, interval-dependent factors which modify basal contractility: the positive and the negative inotropic effects of activation (<b>Blinks</b> <b>and</b> Koch-Weser, 1961; Koch-Weser <b>and</b> <b>Blinks,</b> 1963). However, the nature of the changes in the myocardium which are responsible for the in-terval-strength relationship remains to be estab-lishecl. In both atrial and ventricular myocardium of almost all mammalian species contractility is raised by increases in frequency of contraction over a wide range (Koch-Weser, 1963; Koch-Weser <b>and</b> <b>Blinks,</b> 1963). Since this range in-cludes most rates observed in vivo, this aspect of the interval-strength relationship has at-tracted most attention. One popular hypothesi...|$|R
