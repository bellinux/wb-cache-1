40|$|Due to the {{specific}} nature of radio networks, the channel access in radio local area networks (LAN) is different from cabled LAN. The HIPERLAN standard for radio networks will provide a 24 Mbps data rate transmission. It has a special feature, called <b>active</b> <b>signalling,</b> {{which can be used}} to provide an efficient channel access mechanism. 1. <b>Active</b> <b>signalling</b> The channel access in radio LANs has to face special problems. Unlike wired LANs, nodes cannot build a complete history of the network from the fragments of feedback they obtain from the channel. This feature makes the collision detection techniques in radio networks different from cabled networks. The <b>active</b> <b>signalling</b> feature of the radio LAN standard HIPERLAN provides an efficient channel access mechanism. It consists in requiring each node that wants to access the channel to send a certain sequence of on/off's as a preamble to each packet transmission. This sequence is encoded according to a random pattern whose details will be d [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Signalling is the {{critical}} component of telecommunications networks. Thus {{the design of the}} signalling system is a fundamental issue for the creation of the future Broadband ISDN out of ATM switching technology. Today 2 ̆ 7 s telecommunication networks use common channel signalling networks (standardised in SS 7) which are often separate from the bearer or transport network. With an ATM based Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN), it is anticipated that both signalHng and user traffic will share the underlying ATM layer. An SS 7 2 ̆ 2 Message Transfer Part 2 ̆ 2 (MTP) provides reliable connectionless signalling message transport. However due to differences between SS 7 <b>links</b> and ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links</b> (i. e. ATM Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs)), a new MTP will be needed for B-ISDN.

To design such an error monitor, the delay performance of ATM <b>signalling</b> <b>links</b> during errored periods must be determined.

Identifying these can help to design new strategies to utilize known small molecules, e. g. to trigger specific cellular transformations or to reposition known drugs. Results: We developed CellFateScout that uses the method of Latent Variables to turn differential high-throughput expression data and a functional network into a list of <b>active</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways. Applying it to Connectivity Map data, i. e., differential expression data describing small molecule effects, we then generated a Human Small Molecule Mechanisms Database. Finally, using a list of <b>active</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways as query, a similarity search can identify small molecules from the database that may trigger these pathways. We validated our approach systematically, using expression data of small molecule perturbations, yielding better predictions than popular bioinformatics tools.
