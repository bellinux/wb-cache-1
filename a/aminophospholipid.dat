However, not much is known on hemoglobin interactions with the <b>aminophospholipids,</b> predominantly localized in the inner leaflet of erythrocytes, e. g., phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in membranes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC). Effects of cholesterol, largely abundant in erythrocytes, have also not been studied in great details in earlier studies. This work therefore describes {{the study of the}} interactions of different hemoglobin variants HbA, HbE and HbF and the globin subunits of HbA with the two <b>aminophospholipids</b> in the presence and absence of cholesterol.

To explore the origin of the hepatic and extrahepatic symptoms associated with ATP 8 B 1 deficiency, we investigated the impact of ATP 8 B 1 depletion on the domain-specific <b>aminophospholipid</b> translocase activities and polarized organization of polarized epithelial Caco- 2 cells. Caco- 2 cells were stably transfected with short hairpin RNA constructs to block ATP 8 B 1 expression. <b>Aminophospholipid</b> translocase activity was assessed using spin-labeled phospholipids. The polarized organization of these cells was determined by pulse-chase analysis, cellfractionation, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. ATP 8 B 1 was abundantly expressed in the apical membrane of Caco- 2 cells, and its expression was markedly induced during differentiation and polarization. Blocking ATP 8 B 1 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) affected neither <b>aminophospholipid</b> transport nor the asymmetrical distribution of aminophospholipids across the apical bilayer. Nonetheless, ATP 8 B 1 -depleted Caco- 2 cells displayed profound perturbations in apical membrane organization, including a disorganized apical actin cytoskeleton, a loss in microvilli, and a posttranscriptional defect in apical protein expression. Conclusion: Our findings point to a critical role of ATP 8 B 1 in apical membrane organization that is unrelated to its presumed <b>aminophospholipid</b> translocase activity, yet potentially relevant for the development of cholestasis and the manifestation of extrahepatic features associated with ATP 8 B 1 deficienc...|$|E

Magnesium depletion of the erythrocytes considerably decreases the outward rate of both aminophospholipids to values close to that of phosphatidylcholine.

40|$|AbstractRecognition {{signals are}} {{displayed}} on the cell surface during apoptosis that enable macrophages to engulf and dispose of the dying cell. A common signal is the externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS). Studies in erythrocytes and platelets have suggested that PS exposure requires the concomitant activation of a phospholipid scramblase (PLS) and inhibition of an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -dependent <b>aminophospholipid</b> translocase. However, the molecular mechanism underlying PS exposure during apoptosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we provide evidence that expression of PLS is neither necessary nor sufficient for PS exposure during Fas-triggered apoptosis. On the other hand, egress of PS is shown to correlate with a decline in intracellular ATP and inhibition of <b>aminophospholipid</b> translocase activity upon Fas stimulation. Moreover, suppression of intracellular ATP levels by the glucose anti-metabolite, 2 -deoxyglucose, alone or in combination with glucose-free medium, potentiates Fas-induced PS exposure in the PLS-expressing Jurkat cell line and enables PLS-defective Raji cells to externalize PS in response to Fas ligation. These studies suggest that intracellular ATP levels can modulate the externalization of PS during apoptosis, and implicate the ATP-dependent <b>aminophospholipid</b> translocase in this process...|$|E

Reverse transcription-PCR revealed high expression of atp 8 a 2 mRNA in the retina and testis. Within the retina, immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies localized Atp 8 a 2 to outer segment disc membranes of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Atp 8 a 2 purified from photoreceptor outer segments by immunoaffinity chromatography exhibited ATPase activity that was stimulated by phosphatidylserine and to a lesser degree phosphatidylethanolamine but not by phosphatidylcholine or other membrane lipids. Purified Atp 8 a 2 was reconstituted into liposomes containing fluorescent-labeled phosphatidylserine to measure the ability of Atp 8 a 2 to flip phosphatidylserine across the lipid bilayer. Fluorescence measurements showed that Atp 8 a 2 flipped fluorescent-labeled phosphatidylserine from the inner leaflet of liposomes (equivalent to the exocytoplasmic leaflet of cell membranes) to the outer leaflet (equivalent to cytoplasmic leaflet) in an ATP-dependent manner.

40|$|Asymmetric {{distribution}} of phospholipids is ubiquitous in the plasma membranes of many eukaryotic cells. The {{majority of the}} <b>aminophospholipids</b> {{are located in the}} inner leaflet whereas the cholinephospholipids are localized predominantly in the outer leaflet. Several functional roles for asymmetric phospholipid distribution in plasma membranes have been suggested. Disruption of lipid asymmetry creates a procoagulant surface on platelets and serves as a trigger for macrophage recognition of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the dynamic process of phospholipid translocation regulates important cellular events such as membrane budding and endocytosis. In the present study, we used the red cell membrane as the model system to explore the contribution of phospholipid asymmetry to the maintenance of membrane mechanical properties. We prepared two different types of membranes in terms of their phospholipid distribution, one in which phospholipids were scrambled and the other in which the asymmetric {{distribution of}} phospholipids was maintained and quantitated their mechanical properties. We documented that maintenance of asymmetric distribution of phospholipids resulted in improved membrane mechanical stability. The greater difficulty in extracting the spectrin–actin complex at low-ionic strength from the membranes with asymmetric phospholipid distribution further suggested the involvement of interactions between <b>aminophospholipids</b> in the inner leaflet and skeletal proteins in modulating mechanical stability of the red cell membrane.

When reconstitution was conducted at 37 °C, the efficiency of rHDL formation from POPC was decreased as compared with that conducted at 4 °C. Moreover, large rHDLs with a Stokes diameter of 9. 6 nm became dominant over small rHDL with a diameter of 7. 9 nm, which was distinctly observed at 4 °C. The <b>aminophospholipids</b> POPS and POPE promoted the formation of small rHDLs at 37 °C, but fluorescence experiments revealed that they did so in a different fashion: Fluorescence lifetime data suggested that the head group of POPS reduces hydrophobic hydration, especially in small rHDLs, suggesting that this lipid stabilizes the saddle-shaped bilayer structure in small rHDLs. Fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy data showed that incorporation of POPE increases acyl chain order and water penetration into the head group region in large rHDLs, suggesting that POPE destabilizes the planar bilayer structure. These results imply that these <b>aminophospholipids</b> contribute {{to the formation of}} small rHDLs under biological conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractActive {{maintenance}} of membrane phospholipid asymmetry is universal in normal cell membranes and its disruption with subsequent externalization of phosphatidylserine is {{a hallmark of}} apoptosis. Externalized phosphatidylserine appears {{to serve as an}} important signal for targeting recognition and elimination of apoptotic cells by macrophages, however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for phosphatidylserine translocation during apoptosis remain unresolved. Studies have focused on the function of <b>aminophospholipid</b> translocase and phospholipid scramblase as mediators of this process. Here we present evidence that unique oxidative events, represented by selective oxidation of phosphatidylserine, occur during apoptosis that could promote phosphatidylserine externalization. We speculate that selective phosphatidylserine oxidation could affect phosphatidylserine recognition by <b>aminophospholipid</b> translocase and/or directly result in enzyme inhibition. The potential interactions between the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine and the redox-active cationic protein effector of apoptosis, cytochrome c, are presented as a potential mechanism to account for selective oxidation of phosphatidylserine during apoptosis.

The major membrane lipid species identified in S. cremoris were acidic phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin), glycolipids, and glycerophosphoglycolipids. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) was completely absent. Protonmotive force-driven and counterflow transport of leucine was assayed in fused membranes of S. cremoris membrane vesicles and liposomes composed of different lipids obtained by the freeze/thaw-sonication technique. High transport activities were observed with natural S. cremoris and Escherichia coli lipids, {{as well as with}} mixtures of phosphatidylcholine (PC) with PE or phosphatidylserine. High transport activities were also observed with mixtures of PC with monogalactosyl diglyceride, digalactosyl diglyceride, or a neutral glycolipid fraction isolated from S. cremoris. PC or mixtures of PC with phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or cardiolipin showed low activities. In mixtures of PC and methylated derivatives of PE, both counterflow and protonmotive force-driven transport activities decreased with increasing degree of methylation of PE. The decreased transport activity in membranes containing PC could be restored by refusion with PE-containing liposomes. These results demonstrate that both <b>aminophospholipids</b> and glycolipids can be activators of the leucine transport system from S. cremoris.

40|$|A {{fascinating}} {{aspect of}} cellular membranes {{is that the}} different lipid species are often non-randomly distributed across the bilayer. This lipid asymmetry serves a multitude of cellular functions and is maintained by uni-directional flippases. The identity of these activities remains to be established, but promising candidates {{are members of the}} P 4 subfamily of P-type ATPases. Dysfunction of the latter enzymes has been implicated in diabetes, obesity and a life-threatening liver disease. Consequently, much attention is currently focused on the mechanisms underlying lipid asymmetry and their (patho) physiological implications. Mutation of the human P 4 ATPase ATP 8 B 1 causes the life-threatening liver disease familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1 (FIC 1 disease). Here, we explore the origin of the extrahepatic symptoms associated with FIC 1 disease by investigating the impact of blocking ATP 8 B 1 expression on the membrane domain specific flippase activities and functional organization of polarized human intestinal epithelial cells. Although ATP 8 B 1 is abundantly expressed in the apical membrane, we show that blocking its expression by RNAi neither affects the apical flippase activity, nor the steady state distribution of aminophospholipids across the apical bilayer. Nonetheless, ATP 8 B 1 depletion has a profound effect on apical membrane organization, including a dramatic loss in microvilli and down regulation of apical membrane protein expression. Importantly, these results point to a critical role of ATP 8 B 1 in apical membrane organization that is unrelated to its presumed flippase activity, yet potentially relevant for the manifestation of FIC 1 disease. Previous work indicates that <b>aminophospholipid</b> transport and asymmetry critically depend on P 4 ATPases and their CDC 50 binding partners. However, whether P 4 ATPases directly catalyze <b>aminophospholipid</b> transport and whether or not CDC 50 proteins are integral parts of the P 4 ATPase transport machinery is not known. Hence, the molecular composition and working mechanism of <b>aminophospholipid</b> translocases remain to be established. Human P 4 ATPase family members outnumber CDC 50 homologues by 5 to 1. This implies that each human CDC 50 protein interacts with multiple P 4 ATPases or, alternatively, that some human P 4 ATPases function without a CDC 50 binding partner. To gain further insight into the significance of CDC 50 proteins in P 4 ATPase-dependent <b>aminophospholipid</b> transport, we systematically investigated the physical and functional interactions between members of these two protein families. We demonstrate that each human CDC 50 homologue interacts with multiple P 4 ATPases, and that in all cases analyzed these interactions are indispensable for P 4 ATPase export from the ER. In addition, we provide the first evidence to date that CDC 50 proteins serve a critical role in the reaction cycle of P 4 ATPases. As CDC 50 proteins seem to represent indispensable components of the P 4 ATPase transport machinery, we next analyzed the consequences of a combinatorial loss of CDC 50 proteins on the transbilayer organization of aminophospholipids in the plasma membrane of human cervical carcinoma cells. We show that blocking the expression of the two principal endogenous CDC 50 proteins simultaneously did not lead to any measurable perturbation of <b>aminophospholipid</b> asymmetry at the plasma membrane.

When oil samples containing PE/RI mixtures were heated at a temperature higher than 90 °C, the oil rapidly developed browning, fluorescence, and free radical-scavenging activity, which was higher than the developed by the oil in the absence of added compounds or in the presence of only either PE or RI. These changes were a consequence of the formation of Maillard reaction products in the oil by reaction between PE and RI. Among them, the N-alkylpyrrole derivatives produced in this reaction could be determined by GC-MS after transpyrrolisation. Differently to Maillard products formed between carbohydrates and amino acids, the products of the reaction with <b>aminophospholipids</b> are more hydrophobic and, therefore, better candidates to be employed as lipophilic antioxidants in food products.

40|$|Previous {{estimates}} {{have placed}} the energy requirements of total phospholipid metabolism in mammalian brain at 2 % {{or less of}} total ATP consumption. This low estimate {{was consistent with the}} very long half-lives (up to days) reported for fatty acids esterified within phospholipids. However, using an approach featuring analysis of brain acyl-CoA, which takes into account dilution of the precursor acyl-CoA pool by recycling of fatty acids, we reported that half-lives of fatty acids in phospholipids are some 100 times shorter (min-h) than previously thought. Based on these new estimates of short half-lives, palmitic acid and arachidonic acid were used as prototype fatty acids to calculate energy consumption by fatty acid recycling at the sn- 1 and sn- 2 positions of brain phospholipids. We calculated that the energy requirements for reacylation of fatty acids into lysophospholipids are 5 % of net brain ATP consumption. We also calculated ATP requirements for maintaining asymmetry of the <b>aminophospholipids,</b> phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine across brain membrane bilayers. This asymmetry is maintained by a translocase at a stoichiometry of 1 mol of ATP per mol of phospholipid transferred in either direction across the membrane. The energy cost of maintaining membrane bilayer asymmetry of <b>aminophospholipids</b> at steady-state was calculated to be 8 % of total ATP consumed. Taken together, deacylation-reacylation and maintenance of membrane asymmetry of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine require about 13 % of ATP consumed by brain as a whole. This is a lower limit for energy consumption by processes involving phospholipids, as other processes, including phosphorylation of polyphosphoinositides and de novo phospholipid biosynthesis, were not considered...|$|R
