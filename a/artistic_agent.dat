40|$|Connecting Across Boundaries: The Use of Chinese Images in Chos&# 335;n Court Art from Transcultural and Interdisciplinary Perspectives {{examines}} how visual objects derived from China were represented and manipulated for royal court rites and palaces in Chos&# 335;n Korea. This study investigates {{the importance of}} art in understanding cultural transmission and intercultural connections {{as well as the}} manifold relationship among <b>artistic</b> <b>agents</b> and objects in the ritual, political, socio-economical, and intellectual contexts of the Chos&# 335;n dynasty. Focusing on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Chos&# 335;n court screens, which depict themes deriving from Chinese textual and pictorial sources that were widely appreciated in Korea and Japan, this dissertation explores the perception and circulation of images, the dissemination of knowledge and social customs, the ritual use of visual objects, the deployment of art in palatial structures, and the role of <b>artistic</b> <b>agents</b> in the consumption and production of court art. It encompasses examination {{of the ways in which}} meaning is constructed, modified, and reinstated both in textual and visual forms, and what may happen when themes from a literary text are adapted to painting as well as moving across time and cultures. While challenging the idea of a unilateral Chinese `influence' on Korean culture, which neglects the role of Korean artists, patrons, and beholders as active agents, this study aims to unveil the process of appropriation of Chinese themes and the causes that affected this process, whether political, socio-economic, intellectual, or artistic. In order to identify the dynamics between human agents, institutional systems, and objects and to analyze the cultural transmissions from China and the eclecticism reflected in Chos&# 335;n art, I use two important theoretical concepts, "agency" and "cultural translation. " Emphasizing the political functions of court art, I use three case studies of court paintings produced to decorate palace buildings and to commemorate court rituals. First, I examine commemorative court screens in which stories of celebrated figures from Chinese literature and lore are fused with actual Chos&# 335;n court events. These paintings successfully satisfied the demands of agents who wanted to elevate contemporary events by superimposing well-known exemplary ancient images on current secular occasions. Second, I analyze paintings depicting two legendary banquets of Chinese mythical and historical figures, which were produced to celebrate festive court rites in the nineteenth century. By identifying the patrons, their political standing, and the purpose of the paintings, I explore the way these paintings constructed a symbolic space pertaining to state rituals and expressed the agendas of a particular political party. I further explore how these paintings expressed the social values and political agendas of their patrons in a ritualistic way by examining the interplay between visual and non-visual forms of art in court rites. Third, I use screen paintings depicting Chinese sage rulers and idealized images of Chinese antiquity to explore how Chinese rulership and ideal society was represented at the Chos&# 335;n court and how the current material culture and knowledge introduced from outside were integrated in the representation of an imaginary, ancient Chinese empire...|$|R

40|$|Meta-design, {{the act of}} {{designing}} a system or species of design instead of a design instance, is an important concept in modern design practice and in the generative design paradigm. For meta-design to be a useful tool, the designer must have more formal support for both design species definition/expression and the abstract attributes which the designer is attempting to embody within a design. Arties is an exploration of one possible avenue for supporting meta-design.   Arties is an artistic system emphasizing the co-evolution of colonies of Artificial Life design or <b>artistic</b> <b>agents</b> (called arties) and the environment they inhabit. Generative design systems have concentrated on biological genetics metaphors where a population of design instances are evolved directly from a set of “parenti designs in a succession of generations. In Arties, the a-life agent which is evolved, produces the design instance as a by product of interacting with its environment. Arties utilize an attraction potential curve as their primary dynamic. They sense the relative attraction of entities in their environment, using multiple sensory channels. Arties then associate an attractiveness score to each entity. This attractiveness score is combined with a'taste'function built into the artie that is sensitized to that observation channel, entity, and distance by a transfer function. Arties use this attraction to guide decisions and behaviours. A community of arties, with independent evolving attraction criteria can pass collective judgement on each point in an art space. As the Artie moves within this space it modifies the environment in reaction to what it senses. Arties support for Meta-design is in (A) the process of evolving arties, breeding their attraction potential curve parameters using a genetic algorithm and (B) their use of sensory channels to support abstract attributes geometries. Adjustment of these parameters tunes the attraction of the artie along various sensing channels. The multi-agent co-evolution of Arties is one approach to creating a system for supporting meta-design. Arties {{is part of an}} on-going exploration of how to support meta-design in computer augmented design systems. Our future work with Arties-like systems will be concerned with applications in areas such as modelling adaptive directives in Architecture, Object Structure Design, spatio-temporal behaviours design (for games and simulations), virtual ambient spaces, and representation and computation of abstract design attributes. ...|$|R

At that time, {{he wanted to be}} a singer, then an impressionist, but his mother, knowing that show business was a difficult field but also certain of her son's potential, steered him toward acting. Thus at 10 years old he made his début in L'Oiseau bleu, a made-for-TV movie directed by Gabriel Axel. This caught the attention of director Robert Hossein, who cast Curtil as Gavroche in an adaptation of Les Misérables, which aired as a miniseries on French TV in 1982.|$|E

5000|$|The Baroness {{was given}} a {{platform}} for her poetry in The Little Review, where, starting in 1918, her work was featured alongside chapters of James Joyce's Ulysses. Jane Heap considered the Baroness [...] "the first American dada." [...] She was an early female pioneer of sound poetry, but also made creative use of the dash, while many of her portmanteau compositions, such as “Kissambushed” and “Phalluspistol,” present miniature poems. Most of her poems remained unpublished until the publications of Body Sweats. Her personal papers were preserved after her death by her editor, literary <b>agent,</b> <b>artistic</b> collaborator, and lover Djuna Barnes. University of Maryland Libraries acquired a collection of her work with the papers of Barnes in 1973 and subsequently separated von Freytag-Lorninghoven's papers and treated them as an individual collection. The collection contains correspondences, visual poems, and other artistic/literary works by the artist. The University of Maryland's special collections has an extensive digital archive of her manuscripts.|$|R
50|$|Gall’s paintings, {{when seen}} on their own, might {{be read as}} perverse abstractions; when his sculptures, often the basis for many of his paintings, are shown alongside, the interplay between 2 and 3 {{dimensions}} amplifies the oscillation between abstraction and figuration. He explores the interactions between surfaces: foils, plastic wrapping, velvet, tape and other variously textured materials, frequently alluding to an erotic connection. Stunning and unsettling, his paintings come alive with their photographic realism while others break down as collage with their cubist-like geometry. Only when they are encountered closely does the paint itself emerge as its own textural element and <b>artistic</b> <b>agent.</b> Gall confounds the viewer by removing collective reference points. These images are quotations of his own fantastical universes.|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{supervised}} by Professor Geoff Sutcliffe. No. of pages in text. (85) This thesis discusses {{the production of}} visually appealing computer-generated drawings, through the emulation of human drawing techniques and artificial evolution. Employing a population of line drawn objects from user-input, the Darwinian process of evolution produces original drawings with increasing levels of user satisfaction. The production of aesthetic (e. g., [20]) computer-generated drawings by LAS-CAUX, a computer programmed <b>artistic</b> <b>agent,</b> begins with a database populated by genotypes. A genotype contains the information necessary to render a two-dimensional line drawing. Genotypes are initially formed by recording and analyzing user-generated drawings. As soon as one genotype has been stored in the database, LASCAUX may begin to populate the database with genotypes of LASCAUX generated drawings, via artificial evolution. LASCAUX uses artificial evolution to populate a database with fresh offspring genotypes by introducing random variations and recombinations on any number of parent genotypes within the database...|$|E
40|$|While Cardinal Francesco Maria del Monte {{is celebrated}} as Caravaggio's first major patron in Rome, his primary {{activities}} {{at the turn of}} the seventeenth century were, in reality, centered much more around his role as a courtier and an <b>artistic</b> <b>agent</b> working on behalf of Ferdinando I de' Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany. In order to further the grand duke's propagandistic agenda for himself and his state, the cardinal, from his position in Rome, advised Ferdinando on opportunities to buy and commission works of art. He also gave gifts to the sovereign, such as Caravaggio's Medusa, always with the grand duke's artistic aims in mind. Del Monte should indeed be thought of as a patron of the arts; however, his relationship with the Florentine court sheds light on an essential but perhaps understudied position within the mechanism of Italian patronage [...] that of the agent who works on behalf of another...|$|E
40|$|Midpointness’ is {{an ongoing}} and {{generative}} project that is dismantled and reconstructed by the accretion of the surrounding connections, associations, influences and voices of the curators, artists, students and other audiences who contribute to it. These are {{in the form of}} artworks, public events, texts, artefacts, performances or other interventions. It is entirely open to input and impact {{from a wide range of}} agents. Generally speaking, the project seeks to invite a consideration of the ‘work of art’ as art’s labour or task. More specifically, we seek to explore the dynamics of inner/outer dialogues of the process of artistic work, opening up potentials that any <b>artistic</b> <b>agent</b> might hope for, or stumble across, when he/she explores the generative potential of the ‘work’ of art. For “For, About, Nearby” we propose to develop a text work and ‘speak it’ from a standing speaker in a public thoroughfare in the conference venue. The spoken text will be a play on the tradition of the conference ‘abstract’. The abstract is the site of an outline of intention and creatively speaking can often be the antithesis to the generation of creative work. Here we couple it with an ‘obstruction’, as a means of aggravating  and diverting the attempt at a conclusion towards which an abstract, and indeed a formal presentation, might be aimed. ‘Obstract’ is aimed, albeit circuitously, at a process of intervention in which the ‘centre’ (the work and/or the text) and its surrounding universe are completely indivisible. As such the principle of ‘footnotes’ filters through to the whole text; the footnotes being analogous to the surrounding constellations within which the ‘centre’ of the work sits, swapping footnotes for centre and vice versa. The footnotes refer to points both real and imagined in the past, present and future...|$|E
