5|$|Layers {{deposited}} {{during the}} Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, {{and are the}} product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area. The thickness of the glacial till layer ranges between 100 and 900 feet (30 and 270 m). This till is <b>also</b> <b>what</b> makes agriculture more prevalent in eastern South Dakota as it is extremely fertile.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs of Allosaurus {{were short}} in {{comparison}} to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed claws. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2ulna/humerus ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof-like than those of earlier theropods. Each foot had three weight-bearing toes and an inner dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was <b>also</b> <b>what</b> is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Fung sends more killers to Kwai's {{refuge in}} order to {{eliminate}} Kwai's syndicate. A gunfight ensues, with the four men emerging victorious. As they escape, Kwai's syndicate lose track of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid pictures that he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello {{has a problem with}} his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but <b>also</b> <b>what</b> he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet a pregnant woman (Michelle Ye) with a group of children. Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach the landfill where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and the pregnant woman learn of the shootout during a news report.|$|E

Over the next several years, the organization would establish numerous hospitals, orphanages and homes for the aged.|$|E
25|$|There were <b>also</b> <b>what</b> {{were called}} the Comalco and Aurukun matters. Comalco Aluminium Ltd held several bauxite mining leases {{issued by the}} Queensland State Government under the Comalco Act 1957 (Qld). In each of these claims, the Wik peoples alleged that the mining leases were invalid because the Queensland Government owed {{fiduciary}} duties as a trustee to the Wik people, and that those duties had been breached by the granting of the mining leases. The Aurukun claim also included an attack on an agreement called the Aurukun Associates Agreement entered into under the Aurukun Associates Agreement Act 1975 (Qld).|$|E

In 1865 he visited again with an artist friend and a dog to the Ladakh Valley. He visited Kutch in 1871–1872 but noted that his geology work kept him from making many observations. He noted wild cheetahs from the region and <b>also</b> <b>what</b> is now Stoliczka's bushchat. In 1873 he joined an {{expedition}} organized by Hume along with Valentine Ball to the Andaman and Nicobar islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of new worlds and {{contact with other}} civilizations led to a cultural mix, which {{was reflected in the}} arts and literature of the Portuguese Renaissance. The contact with the civilizations of Africa and the East led to the importation of numerous objects of ceramics, textiles and furniture, precious woods, ivory and silk, in turn, led to the emergence of new artistic forms resulting cultural exchanges between Europe, and East Africa, through the Portuguese. The new trade of items with the newly discovered lands is <b>also</b> <b>what</b> allowed the Portuguese Renaissance to be funded, by creating a wealthy Portuguese nobility and merchant class.|$|E
25|$|Most {{societies}} {{consider it}} a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with {{someone who does not}} consent. This is called sexual assault, and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. <b>Also,</b> <b>what</b> constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex (age of consent) are frequently the subject of debate, as is adolescent sexual behavior in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.|$|E

25|$|Zahau was gagged with a blue, long sleeve T-shirt {{wrapped around}} her head with the sleeves double knotted and stuffed into her mouth. There was <b>also</b> <b>what</b> {{appeared}} to be tape residue on her legs. Medics attempted to revive her, but pronounced her dead at the scene. The police initiated forensic and toxicology testing on her body {{as part of an}} autopsy to determine the cause of death. She was buried at St. Joseph's Memorial Park in St. Joseph, Missouri on July 23. Speculations of foul play began early on in the case; however, investigators were unable to find any other DNA at the scene besides Zahau's. On September 2, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department formally announced their finding that Zahau committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, viewing tools potentiates motor {{activity}} {{related to the}} specific tool-use. This phenomenon is different from other classes of objects, and indicates that tools are not viewed just based off what they are, but <b>also</b> <b>what</b> they actually do. In just viewing tools, activation of left lateralized areas {{are very similar to}} the use/pantomiming areas as noted above. These areas include the ventral premotor cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus and some parietal areas. The main difference is that tools being used elicit greater activation in ventral brain regions, and decreased activation in primary motor areas. Additionally, there were very similar areas of activation in naming tools and viewing tools. There were other areas of activation in the left hemisphere, possibly reflecting the lateralization of language.|$|E
25|$|According to the post-slide report {{released}} by Multiconsult and reviewed by NTNU, several potential indirect causes 'should be discussed': First of all, starting {{weeks before the}} slide, Western Norway was subjected to record-breaking precipitation and winds, which increased in strength when the remains of Hurricane Maria reached shore. The rainstorm, named Kristin by meteorologists, caused floods, traffic jams, material damage and power outages. The precipitation gradually increased pore pressure between the mountain and loose masses, adding to the damage of a process of erosion from surface water. This process may have been further hastened by the possible breach of a water pipe, indicated by a housing unit losing its water supply at around 17 o'clock the day previous to the slide. <b>Also,</b> <b>what</b> {{may have contributed to}} the incident was as a garage that was constructed in the neighbourhood on a fill-in site.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{historians have}} stated {{that it is hard}} to {{describe}} the national sense of shock and trauma that set in when the masses of Jews all over the world learned that someone as famous as Sabbatai Zevi had officially abandoned his faith for Islam. However, the fact remains that Zevi is the most famous Jew to have become a Muslim, which is <b>also</b> <b>what</b> the term Sabbatean has come to denote. Many within Zevi's inner circle followed him into Islam, including his wife Sarah and most of his closest relatives and friends. Nathan of Gaza, the scholar closest to Zevi, who had caused Zevi to reveal his Messiahship and in turn became his prophet, never followed his master into Islam but remained a Jew, albeit excommunicated by his Jewish brethren.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} REBT is humans {{do not get}} emotionally disturbed by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others. This concept has been attributed {{as far back as}} the Roman philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity. In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the A-B-C-D-E-F model of psychological disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an A, adversity (or activating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral Cs, consequences, but <b>also</b> <b>what</b> people B, irrationally believe about the A, adversity. A, adversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.|$|E
25|$|Although Chu Ci is an {{anthology}} of poems by many poets, Qu Yuan was its central figure, both as author of the seminally important Li sao section and in the persona of protagonist. There are various other authors which are also thought to have written various sections of the Chu Ci, {{as well as some}} sections which may derive from some traditional source. Various scholarly sources propose solutions for who wrote what, in the Chu Ci, with more doubt or questions about some sections than others. Besides the actual authorship of the diverse material of the Chu Ci, another scholarly concern is in regard to the history of who and when these pieces were collected and anthologized into one work, and <b>also</b> <b>what</b> other editorial work was done. Besides the authorship of the actual content, much commentary has been written in regard to the Chu Ci, some of which is traditionally incorporated into the printed editions.|$|E
