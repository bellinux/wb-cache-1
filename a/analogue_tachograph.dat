25|$|The {{tachograph}} was {{a device}} that monitors speed and driving and rest times. One {{of the way to}} record the information is the old method using a paper chart (<b>analogue</b> <b>tachograph).</b> The chart recorder is an electromechanical device that records an electrical or mechanical input trend onto a piece of paper (the chart). Chart recorders may record several inputs using different color pens and may record onto strip charts or circular charts. The tachograph is a device fitted to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver's activity selected from a choice of modes. The drive mode is activated automatically when the vehicle is in motion.|$|E

Drivers must note all the reasons for doing so on the back of their tachograph record sheets (if using an <b>analogue</b> <b>tachograph)</b> or on a printout or temporary sheet (if using a digital tachograph) at the latest on reaching the suitable stopping place (see relevant sections covering manual entries).

5000|$|Tachographs can be {{tampered}} with in various ways, such as slightly twisting the marker, blocking {{the path of}} the arm with a piece of rubber or foam, short-circuiting the unit for short periods, intentionally preventing the detection of gear movement with a magnet, or interrupting the (older <b>analogue)</b> <b>tachograph's</b> power supply with a blown fuse to stop operation completely thus recording no information whatsoever. There is also [...] "forgetting to insert" [...] the chart when beginning duty. Unauthorized changing of the discs (and then discarding one of the two, so that some activities are [...] "forgotten") is well known throughout Europe. [...] "Ghosting" [...] is another common trick when false driver information is entered onto a second chart to give the appearance that there is a second driver present in the cab for long distance runs that cannot be completed within a single driver's daily driving period.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on circumstances, {{operators}} of preserved buses {{may need to}} fit their vehicle with an <b>analogue</b> or digital <b>tachograph.</b> All commercial operation (not on a scheduled bus route) requires a tachograph.

50|$|The <b>analogue</b> <b>tachograph</b> head uses styli {{to trace}} lines on a wax coated paper disc that rotates {{throughout}} the day, where one rotation encompasses a 24-hour period. If the disc {{is left in}} the head over 24 hours, a second trace will be written onto the first, and so on until the disc is removed. It is an infringement of EU Regulation 561/2006 to use a disc for a period longer than it is designed for. Multiple overlapping traces may still be deciphered in the speed and distance fields, but {{it is far more}} difficult for the activity field where one trace can easily be obliterated by another. <b>Analogue</b> <b>tachograph</b> heads provide no indication to the driver of the need to change the disc.|$|E
50|$|Most tachographs {{produced}} {{prior to}} 1 May 2006 {{were of the}} analogue type. Later <b>analogue</b> <b>tachograph</b> head models are of a modular design, enabling the head {{to fit into a}} standard DIN slot in the vehicle dashboard. This would enable a relatively easy upgrade to the forthcoming digital models, which were manufactured to the same physical dimensions.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, it succeeded the <b>analogue</b> <b>tachograph</b> as {{a result}} of European Union {{regulation}} 1360/2002 that made digital tachographs mandatory for all relevant vehicles manufactured after August 1, 2005. Digital tachographs would be required as of May 1, 2006 for all new vehicles for which EWG regulation VO(EWG)3820/85 applies, as is published in the official newsletter of the European Union L102 from April 11, 2006.|$|E
50|$|Without {{a digital}} card reader, {{computer}} and analysis software, the {{data can be}} more difficult to interpret as it is not visually represented as the analogue chart is, and requires mathematical calculations to decipher the information from its presented format. Some Renault branded tachograph heads can produce printed information in a graphical format, similar in appearance to the activity trace on an <b>analogue</b> <b>tachograph</b> chart.|$|E

The first on board recording devices is <b>analogue</b> <b>tachograph</b> which obligatory to using to introduce in USA in 1939. This paper includes main rules of function of <b>analogue</b> <b>tachograph</b> and digital tachographs system using in road transport in European Union. According to new Commission Regulation (EC) No 1360 / 2002 of 13 June 2002 we present elements of an inspection system for recording data and identification of the system users. The tachograph’s cards, calibration of digital tachograph, running of authorized workshops and the requirements for authorized workshops, had been specified. Article presents also possibility of future requirements of digital tachograph and authorizes workshops in Poland and Union Europe base on Commission Regulation (EC) No 1360 / 2002 of 13 June 2002 replacing the Annex 1 B. Paper shows diagram of caliration of digital tachograph on road base, diagram of calibration of digital tachograph on work station as well as view of certificated vehicles unit – digital tachograph and view of cards in digital tachographs system in Poland. A characteristic feature of the digital tachograph is an integration of all users of the recording equipment in road transport. The users can be classified in four groups having different rights and obligations, which are presented in the article...|$|E

Regrettably, the construction of <b>analogue</b> <b>tachograph,</b> an original type of tachograph used in road transport, encouraged to numerous frauds and counterfeits of social rules for drivers. For this reason the European Union has developed an inspection system, based on digital ta-chograph and chip cards, used for recording the data and identification of the system users. The article is the presentation of the main rules of function of the digital tachograph system, used in road transport in European Union. The document describes main legal rules introducing the digital tachograph sys-tem, foremost requirements which must be fulfilled by the producers of digital tachographs {{in order to get the}} type approval, possibility of future requirements of digital tachograph, main functions, charac-teristics of participant of digital tachograph system and their tools of the identification, acting and set-ting of authorize workshops in Poland and European Union and the accessible methods of check and calibration of digital tachographs and their description, based on Commission Regulation (EC) No 1360 / 2002 of 13 June 2002.

40|$|A {{tachograph}} which {{belongs to}} the group of ORD devices is the oldest recorder (On Board Recording Devices), and the duty of taking it was led into the USA already in 1939. The inventor of the tachograph was Max Maria von Weber, an administrative official, engineer and author. The Hasler Event Recorder was introduced in the 1920 s. Regrettably, the construction of <b>analogue</b> <b>tachograph,</b> an original type of tachograph used in road transport, encouraged to numerous frauds and counterfeits of social rules for drivers In order to solve these all problems, they led with Directive of Advice No. 2135 / 98 from 24 September 1998 of the August of 2004 from the beginning of {{in the area of the}} European Union, new type of registering setting up in the road transport- digital tachograph. In order to make it impossible to abuse, a complex system of keys was applied cryptological and of certificates, saved in grating and devices, letting for explicit determining entitlements of users and authenticities of data, cards and devices. In spite of using, the most modern keys and securing systems, with respect to elements of the system of digital tachographs a lot of modus operandi were observed so that they registered wrong sizes. The European Union took right action in order to before to prevent, nevertheless they must be implemented into the everyday life. Those paper is include information about level of manipulation of digital tachograph and their elements, ways of manipulations of digital tachograph and future ways of counteracting manipulations...|$|E
