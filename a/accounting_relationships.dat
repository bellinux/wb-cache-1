40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the <b>accounting</b> <b>relationships</b> {{between the}} financial and the real economy. It will be shown that accounting can clarify the nature of economic phenomena and be an important building block for economic theory. The paper will {{argue that there is}} much confusion about key macroeconomic concepts like saving, investment and finance. This confusion is best summarised in the statement "saving finances investment". After clearly defining the <b>accounting</b> <b>relationships</b> between lending, financial saving and physical investment it will be shown that this is a nonsense statement. The theory behind it - the loanable funds theory - will be analysed and critiqued. It will be shown that the loanable funds theory confuses the concepts of income and production, lending and saving, and financial saving and non-financial saving. It will further be shown that this has not only theoretical but also important policy implications...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to examine how a dyadic trust {{perspective}} can support effective development of key <b>account</b> <b>relationships.</b> The need for Key Account Management in the UK Mortgage Industry is investigated, factors for effective key <b>account</b> <b>relationship</b> management are identified and a trust/Mortgage Lender and Intermediary perspective of Key <b>Account</b> <b>relationship</b> effectiveness is analysed. The results of this study have been achieved through a mixed methods research strategy and these have been discussed in relation to Key Account Management and Trust theory. This study responds to concerns about the lack of research in this area, challenging and building on existing Key Account Management theory, integrating trust theory and applying this to a new context. A survey instrument to assess the effectiveness of Key <b>Account</b> <b>relationships</b> has been devised and can be applied to different contexts. Results show that demonstrations of trustworthiness leads to better key account performance but there is not a strong association of perceptions of higher trust with performance. Mortgage Lenders and Intermediaries have different perspectives of key account effectiveness and Mortgage Lenders lead the way in Key Account Management initiatives but there is evidence of various degrees of interdependence and willingness to achieve mutual gains. Key <b>account</b> <b>relationships</b> are not locked in to integrated Key Account Management programmes and exit from these relationships is quite easy. An important aspect of this research in the context of the UK Mortgage Industry has been the perceived positive role of the Key Account individual and that of different types of trust throughout relationship development, compensating for the perceived negative role of organisational culture aspects that may influence those involved in key account development within and between organisations. The contribution of this research is to show the relevance of Key Account Management as a business model providing market conditions are appropriate for Key Account Management development and that it is based on mutual learning and a format that suits the orientation of supplier and buyer, their own organisational design and culture and resources available as well as the environment in which they operate. This research suggests that fully integrated Key Account Management is not a realistic expectation and dependence on a few suppliers or customers as Key Account Management theory suggests, is not sensible. This study contributes to KAM practice in that it shows it is the management of trustworthiness rather than trying to manage trust that leads to a satisfactory Key <b>Account</b> <b>relationship</b> format for both supplier and buyer in the UK Mortgage Industry. This does currently rely heavily on the `intrapreneurial' skills of key individuals. In understanding how trustworthiness is demonstrated (through concern and benevolence, expertise, communication, intrapreneurial skills, commitment, organisational culture and KAM organisation) leads to more appropriate actions and behaviours to facilitate a relationship that works best for particular seller and buyer organisations given the particular circumstances. Organisations need to work on improving trust that is placed in the institution by for example developing effective marketing communications effort internally as well as externally and knowledge based trust, relating in particular to the exchange of confidential and strategic information. The identified factors for key account effectiveness presented in the survey can serve as useful guidelines for managing key accounts as they also demonstrate signals of trustworthiness. These factors can be used specifically to add to the limited range of performance criteria of key accounts currently adopted by the industry. Further research is suggested that may consider a key account manager or client's disposition towards trust, an examination of perceptions of supply chain t [...] .

40|$|Growth {{dynamics}} and structural change {{are the two}} central features of variation / selection processes within populations. This paper explores {{them in terms of}} three themes, or sets of accounts, namely Logistic Growth Accounting, Competition Accounting and the Price Theorem. The accounting concepts have in common a concern with 'population thinking' and are essential elements in the study of economic development interpreted as the transformation of initial populations of activities into new kinds of populations. Development can be uncovered at many levels in an economic system, for example in the competitive process at the level of industries, sectors and markets. Business rivalry, underpinned by differential innovative activity, is the basis of the differential survival and growth of competing economic activities and the strategies deployed to create sustainable differences in competitive selection characteristics are {{at the core of the}} capitalist dynamic interpreted as an adaptive, evolutionary process. This kind of evolutionary argument is necessarily concerned with growth rate {{dynamics and}} the explanation of the diversity of growth rates across entities in a population. The <b>accounting</b> <b>relationships</b> presented are a prelude to deeper causal explanations of evolution in institutions, economies and perhaps in knowledge itself. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that SAMs are widely used as the {{databases}} for CGE models there remains some confusion over {{the relationship between the}} two; in particular the implications and meaning of the 'law of one price ’ appear to be poorly understood. This has two clear, and arguably, worrying implications. First, a deficiency in understanding the <b>accounting</b> <b>relationships</b> in a SAM means that when compiling a SAM it is likel that the structural relationships in the economy may be misrepresented. And second, any misunderstanding of the behavioural relationships in a CGE model, which can be defined as theory with numbers, is highly likely to lead to flawed interpretations of the results from such models. The discussion in this paper revisits the issues of the role of a price system in social accounts and then demonstrates how the resultant price definitions require that all whole economy models that satisfy the conditions of being both complete and consistent MUST obey the 'law of one price’. The relevance of the 'law ’ to the characteristics of certain features of CGE models is demonstrated as is its relevance to the compilation of SAMs. ...|$|E

However, contrary to my predictions, auditors who rely on both decision aids do not outperform auditors who rely on only one decision aid. Although I find empirical evidence that cognitive load is negatively related to analytical review effectiveness, I do not find evidence that my decision aids reduce cognitive load...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a critique of}} loanable funds theory by using simple <b>accounting</b> <b>relationships.</b> It is shown that many economists identify saving and the credit supply by interpreting the macroeconomic saving-investment identity as a budget constraint. According to that interpretation, more saving through lower consumption (and government spending) leads to a higher supply of credit and thus more funds to be invested by firms for investment. The paper shows that proponents of this theory commit accounting fallacies or need very strong and somewhat peculiar assumptions for their theory to hold. In the first step, the concepts of " and " will be clearly distinguished using simple accounting. It will be shown that credit is not limited by anybody's saving {{and that no one}} has to abstain from consumption in order for a credit to be provided. Also, it will be shown that financial saving (an increase in net financial assets) through a reduction in expenses reduces other economic units' ability to spend and save. The identification of saving and the provision of credit is likely to stem from the invalid application of neoclassical growth models to a monetary economy. In those models, there are either only tangible assets, so that no coordination failures in financial saving can occur, or in those models real goods are lent and borrowed, not money...|$|E

The literature review builds the theoretical foundation for the research and the empirical research material is derived from eight (8) semi-structured interviews with both the supplier and the customer company’s management and with customer end-users. Findings and Conclusions A theoretical model on managing customer expectations in global <b>account</b> <b>relationship</b> was built and the examination of these factors in the case setting showed that the framework was confirmed and supported.

I argue that the generally rising U.

In a globalized market, the United States has a comparative advantage in producing marketable securities and in exchanging low-risk debt for higher-risk equity. It is not surprising that savers around the world want to put a growing portion of their savings into the U. S. economy. I argue that serious efforts to reduce the U.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to locate the {{specific}} items from the financial statements that are responsible for the dirty surplus accounting flows and how important they are in its explanation. Design/methodology/approach – It is generally accepted that some country accounting rules allow some operations that can generate dirty surplus in the annual statements. Working on this basis, it is necessary to consider information at the same time across firms and across time, using panel data econometric techniques. A static panel data estimated by generalized least squares can be used to correct correlations between firms and account numbers or a dynamic panel data estimated by GMM-SYS with instrumental variables to avoid endogeneity. Findings – Results show that in a static panel data model, the income statement items have a lower explicative power of balance sheet items variations, having higher explicative power a dynamic one (AR(1)). Results show that, specifically, financial assets, debts and book value capture the dirty accounting flows. Research limitations/ implications – Working in differences reduces the explicative power of the income statement and working in levels could be inconsistent if it is impossible to contrast, first, stationary in data due to their shortage. It is suggested that future works increase the frequency of the observed data, and contrast the cointegration as a way to check the <b>accounting</b> <b>relationships.</b> Practical implications – It is important to evaluate whether the income statement can (or cannot) explain the financial position of a firm. Also it is important to know where dirty surplus accounting flows are located can be useful for firms' valuation. Originality/value – The econometric technique proposed in the paper deals with the main limitation in accounting research: information is bigger in cross-section (number of firms) than in time series (economic periods).
