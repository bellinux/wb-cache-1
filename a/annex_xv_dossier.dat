50|$|The low {{molecular}} weight products BBP, DEHP, DIBP, and DBP {{were added to the}} Candidate list of Substances for Authorisation under REACH in 2008-9, and added to the Authorisation list, Annex XIV, in 2012. This means that from February 2015 they are not allowed to be produced in the EU unless authorisation has been granted for a specific use, however they may still be imported in consumer products. The creation of an <b>Annex</b> <b>XV</b> <b>dossier,</b> which could ban the import of products containing these chemicals, is being jointly prepared by the ECHA and Danish authorities and is expected to be submitted by April 2016.|$|E
30|$|The {{intention}} of the SiS concept is to regulate substances of very high concern as constituents or impurities in substances, mixtures, and in articles. In principle this is already realised in certain entries of Annex XVII. As a first case, Germany is preparing an <b>Annex</b> <b>XV</b> <b>dossier</b> for the PAH benzo[a]pyrene as substance in substance. Benzo[a]pyrene is the most prominent PAH known for CMR and vPvB-properties, and already regulated in mixtures for consumer uses (Annex XVIII), as an impurity in toys and as extender oil {{for the production of}} tyres or parts of tyres (Annex XVII, entry 50).|$|E
30|$|An <b>Annex</b> <b>XV</b> {{restriction}} <b>dossier</b> for cadmium in artists’ paints {{was submitted}} by an EU member {{state to the}} European Chemicals Agency ECHA. By cleaning, used brushes under the tap cadmium can enter the food chain via waste water treatment and subsequent agricultural application of the sewage sludge. It was estimated that 110  kg Cd per year is spread on agricultural land via this exposure route. Other sources of Cd amount to almost 120 tons per year.|$|R
30|$|The European Food safety Authority EFSA {{considers}} a {{tolerable weekly intake}} (TWI) for Cd of 2.5  µg/kg body weight as appropriate. This is lower {{by more than a}} factor of two than the value established by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) with 5.8  µg/kg body weight as weekly intake [12, 13]. Regardless which value is considered the margin between weekly intake of Cd from food and the tolerable intake might be small for certain subgroups of the population, e.g., children or vegetarians. This was the reason for the Swedish Chemicals Agency KEMI to submit a proposal for a restriction according <b>Annex</b> <b>XV</b> of the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH) regulation [14] to the European Chemicals Agency ECHA in December 2013. It was proposed to restrict the placing on the market as well as the usage of Cd and its compounds in manufacture of artists’ paints and pigments.|$|R
40|$|The {{results from}} Annex XIII of the Cooperative Agreement between the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the Ministry of Energy and Mines of the Republic of Venezuela (MEMV) have been {{documented}} and published with many researchers involved. Integrate comprehensive research programs {{in the area of}} Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) ranged from feasibility laboratory studies to full-scale multi-well field pilots. The objective, to cooperate in a technical exchange of ideas and information was fully met throughout the life of the Annex. Information has been exchanged between the two countries through published reports and technical meetings between experts in both country's research communities. The meetings occurred every two years in locations coincident with the International MEOR conferences & workshops sponsored by DOE (June 1990, University of Oklahoma, September 1992, Brookhaven, September 1995, National Institute of Petroleum and Energy Research). Reports and publications produced during these years are listed in Appendix B. Several Annex managers have guided the exchange through the years. They included Luis Vierma, Jose Luis Zirritt, representing MEMV and E. B. Nuckols, Edith Allison, and Rhonda Lindsey, representing the U. S. DOE. Funding for this area of research remained steady for a few years but decreased in recent years. Because both countries have reduced research programs in this area, future exchanges on this topic will occur through <b>ANNEX</b> <b>XV.</b> Informal networks established between researchers through the years should continue to function between individuals in the two countries...|$|R
