In 2006, Ruth Marcus, an opinion-writer and columnist for The Washington Post, noted that [...] "he derisive use of 'Democrat' in this way was a Bush staple during the recent campaign", and she chastised Bush, alleging he was being intentionally offensive. Marcus {{went on to say}} the argument about the term was [...] "trivial, sticks-and-stones [...] linguistic bickering". Bush spoke of the [...] "" [...] in his 2007 State of the Union Address, although the advance copy that was given to members of Congress read [...] "Democratic majority".

60|$|Second, As {{it is the}} Father which hath made Christ to us what he is; so it is the Father who hath {{called us}} to partake of Christ and all his benefits. 'Wherefore we must depart from iniquity that profess the name of Christ, that we may glorify him for his call.' (1 Cor. 1:9; Heb. 3:1) He has called us to the {{fellowship}} of his Son Jesus Christ; that is, to partake of <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>good</b> that is in him, as Mediator, and {{to be done by}} him for those that trust in him. Nor had we ever come out of a cursed and condemned condition, to Christ, for life and blessedness, but by the call of the Father; 'For it is not of works, but of him that calleth.' (Rom. 9:11) Now since he has called us to this privilege--even us whom he has called--and left others in their sins to perish by his judgments, it is meet we should depart from iniquity. (Heb. 3:1; 2 Peter 1:2, 3) Especially since the call by which he called us is heavenly, and holy, and because he has not only called us to glory, but to virtue.|$|E

"This 'COMPLETE SETTLEMENT,'--little {{less than}} miraculous to Voltaire and us,--one finds, after sifting, {{to have been}} the fruit of Voltaire's {{exquisite}} skill in treating and tuning his Hirsch (no harshness of rebuke, rather some gleam of hope, of future bargains, help at Court): (Your expenses; compensation for protesting of that Bill on Paris? Tush, cannot we make <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>good!</b> In the first place, I will BUY of you these Jewels [this one discovers {{to have been the}} essence of the operation!], all or the best part of them, which I have here in pawn for Papa's Bill: 650 pounds was it not?

There now, that is settled. Nothing more between us but settles itself, if we continue friends!' Upon which Hirsch walked home, thankful for the good job in Jewels; wondering only what the Allowance for Expenses and Compensation will be. And Voltaire steps out, new-burnished, into the Royal Carnival splendors, with a load rolled from his mind.|$|E

60|$|Ans. Baptism is in {{no sense}} the {{foundation}} of a church. I find no foundation of a church but Jesus Christ himself (Matt 16:18; 1 Cor 3:11). Yea, the foundation mentioned (Heb 6:1,2) is nothing else but this very Christ. For he is the foundation, not only of the church, but of <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>good</b> that at any time is found in her. He is the foundation OF our repentance, and OF our faith towards God (vv 1,2). Further, baptisms are not here mentioned with respect to the act in water, but of the doctrine; that is, the signification thereof. 'The doctrine of baptisms.' And observe, neither faith, nor repentance, nor baptisms, are called here foundations: Another thing, for a foundation, is here by the Holy Ghost intended, even a foundation for them all: a foundation of faith, of repentance, of the doctrine of baptisms, of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. And this foundation is Jesus Christ himself, and these are the first principles, the milk, the A, B, C, and the beginning of Christian religion in the world. I dare not say, No matter whether water baptism be practised or no. But it is not a stone in {{the foundation of a}} church, no not respecting order; it is not, to another, a sign of my sonship with God; it is not the door into fellowship with the saints, it is no church ordinance, as you, yourself, have testified. So then as to church work, it hath no place at all therein.|$|E
60|$|There are islands round us {{of every}} shape and size--all of them {{more or less}} barren, {{the greater part of}} their {{surfaces}} being exposed grey rock. Here and there may be seen, as I have already hinted, small patches of bright green, and, sparsely scattered everywhere, are little red-roofed wooden cottages--poor enough things the most of them; others, gaudy-looking affairs with gable-ends, white faces, and windows bordered with green. All of these are, while I write, reflected in the water as in a mirror, for there is not a breath of wind. Over the islands on my left are seen more islands extending out to sea. On the right tower up the blue hills of the interior of old Norway, and, although the weather is excessively hot, many of these are covered with snow. Everything is light, and transparent, and thin, and blue, and glassy, and fairy-like, and magically beautiful, and altogether delightful! There: have you made much of <b>all</b> <b>that,</b> <b>good</b> reader? If you have, be thankful, for, as I set out by saying, description of scenery, (at least to any good purpose), is impossible. The description of a man, however, is quite another thing. Here is our pilot. He is a rugged man, with fair hair, and a yellow face, and a clay-coloured chin, and a red nose. He is small in stature, and thin, insignificant in appearance, deeply miserable in aspect. His garments are black glazed oiled-cloth from head to foot, and immensely too large for him, especially the waistcoat, which is double-breasted, and seems to feel that his trousers are not a sufficient covering for such a pair of brittle looking legs, for it extends at least half way down to his knees. The flap of his sou'-wester, also, comes half way down his back. He is a wonderful object to look upon; yet he has the audacity, (so it seems to me), to take us in charge, and our captain has the foolhardiness to allow him.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Since the abolishing of the State Lottery <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>good</b> feeling has gone, {{and nothing}} but jealousy exists, through the rivalry of each other. Several {{bill-sticking}} companies have started, but have failed. The first party that started a company was twelve year ago; but {{what was left of}} the old school and their dependants joined together and opposed them. And for some time we were quiet again, till a printer of Hatton Garden formed a company by hiring the sides of houses; but he was not supported by the public, and he left his wooden frames fixed up for rent. The last company that started, took advantage of the New Police Act, and hired of Messrs. Grissell and Peto the hoarding of Trafalgar Square, and established a bill-sticking office in Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane, and engaged some of the new bill-stickers to do their work, and for a time got the half of all our work, and with such spirit did they carry on their opposition towards us, that they used to give us in charge before the magistrate, and get us fined; but they found it so expensive, that they could not keep it up, for they were always employing a lot of ruffians from the Seven Dials to come and fight us; and on one occasion the old bill-stickers went to Trafalgar Square to attempt to post bills, when they were given in custody by the watchman in their employ, and fined at Queen Square five pounds, as they would not allow any of us to speak in the office; but when they were gone, we had an interview with the magistrate, who mitigated the fine to fifteen shillings. During the time the men were waiting for the fine, this company started off to a public-house that we were in the habit of using, and waited for us coming back, where a fighting scene took place that beggars description. Shortly after this, the principal one day came and shook hands with us, and acknowledged that he had broken up the company, and that he himself had lost five hundred pound in trying to overthrow us. We then took possession of the hoarding in Trafalgar Square; but Messrs. Grissell and Peto would not allow us to post our bills on the said hoarding without paying them - and from first to last we paid upwards of two hundred pounds for that hoarding, and likewise the hoarding of the Reform Club-house, Pall Mall."' ...|$|E
