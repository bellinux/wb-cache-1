Far the two most pressure-stable PPOs, we investigated whether pressure stability would be reduced by the simultaneous application of mild heat.

The phenolic extracts of Persea americana fruit and leaves were extracted using methanol and 1 M HCl (1 : 1 v/v). Thereafter, their inhibitory effects on sodium nitroprusside induced lipid peroxidation and key enzymes linked to type 2 diabetes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase) were determined in vitro. The result revealed that the leaves had fruit of <b>avocado</b> <b>pear</b> inhibit both α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities in a dose dependent manner. However, the Peel had the highest α-amylase inhibitory activity while the leaf had the highest α-glucosidase inhibitory activity as revealed by their IC 50 value. Furthermore, incubation of the rat pancreas {{in the presence of}} 5 mM SNP caused an increase in the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the tissue, however, introduction of the phenolic extracts inhibited MDA produced in a dose dependent manner. The additive and/or synergistic action of major phenolic compounds such as syringic acid, eugenol, vnillic acid, isoeugenol, guaiacol, kaemferol, catechin, ρ-hydroxybenzoic acid, ferulic acid, apigenin, naringenin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin, lupeol and epigallocatechin- 3 -O-gallate in <b>avocado</b> <b>pear</b> using gas chromatography (GC) could have contributed to the observed medicinal properties of the plant.
