5|$|Generally, Manasa is worshiped {{without an}} image. A {{branch of a}} tree, an earthen pot or an earthen snake image is worshiped as the goddess, though images of Manasa are worshipped too. She is worshiped for {{protection}} from and cure of snake bites <b>and</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases</b> like smallpox and chicken pox.|$|E
5|$|Immune {{complexes}} (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) {{deposited in}} various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes {{between two and}} three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune <b>and</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases,</b> but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Infection, {{bacterial}} or viral, {{particularly from}} Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus and Pseudomonas spp. Reports at the 16th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology <b>and</b> <b>Infectious</b> <b>Diseases</b> in 2006 indicated that bacterial infections are seldom serious, but that ten to {{twenty percent of}} piercings result in local benign bacterial infection. The Mayo Clinic estimates 30%. Risk of infection is greatest among those with congenital heart disease, who have a much higher chance of developing life-threatening infective endocarditis, hemophiliacs and diabetics, {{as well as those}} taking corticosteroids. In 2006, a diabetic woman in Indiana lost a breast due to an infection from a nipple piercing. Viral infections may include hepatitis B, hepatitis C and, potentially, HIV, although as of 2009 there had been no documented cases of HIV caused by piercing. While rare, infection due to piercing of the tongue can be fatal. Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{predicts that}} {{overweight}} and obesity may soon replace more traditional public health concerns such as undernutrition <b>and</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases</b> {{as the most}} significant cause of poor health. Obesity is a public health and policy problem because of its prevalence, costs, and health effects. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for all adults followed by behavioral interventions in those who are obese. Public health efforts seek to understand and correct the environmental factors responsible for the increasing prevalence of obesity in the population. Solutions look at changing the factors that cause excess food energy consumption and inhibit physical activity. Efforts include federally reimbursed meal programs in schools, limiting direct junk food marketing to children, and decreasing access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools. The World Health Organization recommends the taxing of sugary drinks. When constructing urban environments, efforts {{have been made to}} increase access to parks and to develop pedestrian routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} active epilepsy (as of 2012) {{is in the}} range 3–10 per 1,000, with active epilepsy defined as someone with epilepsy {{who has had a}} least one unprovoked seizure in the last five years. Epilepsy begins each year in 40–70 per 100,000 in developed countries and 80–140 per 100,000 in developing countries. Poverty is a risk and includes both being from a poor country and being poor relative to others within one's country. In the developed world epilepsy most commonly starts either in the young or in the old. In the developing world its onset is more common in older children and young adults due to the higher rates of trauma <b>and</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases.</b> In developed countries the number of cases a year has decreased in children and increased among the elderly between the 1970s and 2003. This has been attributed partly to better survival following strokes in the elderly.|$|E
5|$|Mortality under captivity is {{generally}} high; reasons include stillbirths, birth defects, cannibalism, hypothermia, neglect of cubs by mothers, <b>and</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases.</b> A study comparing {{the health of}} captive and wild cheetahs noted that despite having similar genetic make-up, wild cheetahs are far healthier than their captive counterparts. The study identified possible stress factors such as restricted habitat and interaction with human beings and other carnivores, and recommended private and spacious areas for captive cheetahs. A study of diseases suffered by captive cheetahs in the period 1989–92 in several North American zoos showed that hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a disease of the liver, had affected 82% of the deceased cheetahs, caused nine deaths, and occurred in 51% of living females. Chronic gastritis was detected in 91% of the population. Glomerulosclerosis, a disease of the kidneys, emerged as another significant disease, affecting 84% of the cheetahs; another renal disease, nephrosclerosis, affected 39% of the cheetahs. Feline infectious peritonitis caused two deaths. Pneumonia was a major cause for juvenile deaths. Another study concluded that excess of vitaminA in their diets could result in veno-occlusive disease in their livers.|$|E

25|$|While the United States {{with its}} soil {{untouched}} by the war was enjoying prosperity and living standards of a sort never seen before in history, life in postwar Britain was comparatively grim. Living standards and life expectancy were low, there was little for working-class people to buy, <b>and</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases</b> such as tuberculosis continued to claim many lives. Automobile and home ownership were limited to the upper class of society. Birthrates were low compared to the contemporary baby boom in the US.|$|E

The effect of this drug in emptying psychiatric hospitals has been compared to that of penicillin <b>and</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases.</b> But the popularity of the drug fell from the late 1960s as newer drugs came on the scene. From chlorpromazine a number of other similar antipsychotics were developed. It also led to the discovery of antidepressants.|$|E

In 2004, Congress passed the Project Bioshield Act, which provides $5.6billion over ten years for the purchase of new vaccines and drugs. These vaccines included the monoclonal antibody Raxibacumab, which treats anthrax as well as an Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed, both of which are stockpiled by the US government.|$|E
