In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into Bath to enable the development of further housing, much of it council housing such as the Whiteway estate.|$|E

On 5 January 1919, some of Dmowski's supporters (Marian Januszajtis-Żegota and Eustachy Sapieha) attempted a coup against Piłsudski and Prime Minister Moraczewski, but failed.|$|E

5|$|A postwar {{review of}} {{inadequate}} housing {{led to the}} clearance and redevelopment of {{areas of the city}} in a postwar style, often <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> <b>with</b> the local Georgian style. In the 1950s the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In the 1970s and 1980s it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987 the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.|$|E
5|$|The frontrunner for {{the post}} was the wartime {{commander}} of the Manhattan District, Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols. Indeed, Nichols was the War Department's only nominee. However, the AEC commissioners had different ideas. Nichols was seen as too closely identified with the wartime Manhattan Project; he had opinions <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> <b>with</b> the commissioners on whether the Director of Military Applications was a staff or a line position; {{and he had a}} strong disagreement with the commissioners over the vexing issue of which agency should hold custody of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Accordingly, the AEC commissioners decided to find another candidate.|$|E
5|$|The {{genealogy}} of Ine and of {{the kings}} of Wessex is known from two sources: the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List. The Chronicle {{was created in the}} late 9th century, probably at the court of Alfred the Great, and some of its annals incorporated short genealogies of kings of Wessex. These are often <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> <b>with</b> the more extensive information in the Regnal List. The inconsistencies appear to result from the efforts of later chroniclers to demonstrate that each king on the list was descended from Cerdic, the founder, according to the Chronicle, of the West Saxon line in England.|$|E

5|$|After Áed's death, {{there is}} a two-decade gap until the death of DonaldII (Domnall mac Constantín) in 900 during which nothing is {{reported}} in the Irish annals. The entry for the reign between Áed and DonaldII is corrupt in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, {{and in this case}} the Chronicle is <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> <b>with</b> every other king list. According to the Chronicle, Áed was followed by Eochaid, a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with Giric, but all other lists say that Giric ruled after Áed and make great claims for him. Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth's, although {{it has been suggested that}} he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by Alex Woolf and Archie Duncan with Giric's reign.|$|E
5|$|In 1198, Pope Innocent III {{broached}} {{the subject of}} a new crusade through legates and encyclical letters. The stated intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, now the centre of Muslim power in the Levant. The crusader army that arrived at Venice in the summer of 1202 was somewhat smaller than had been anticipated, and there were not sufficient funds to pay the Venetians, whose fleet was hired by the crusaders to take them to Egypt. Venetian policy under the ageing and blind but still ambitious Doge Enrico Dandolo was potentially <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> <b>with</b> that of the Pope and the crusaders, because Venice was closely related commercially with Egypt. The crusaders accepted the suggestion that in lieu of payment they assist the Venetians in the capture of the (Christian) port of Zara in Dalmatia (vassal city of Venice, which had rebelled and placed itself under Hungary's protection in 1186). The city fell in November 1202 after a brief siege. Innocent tried to forbid this political attack on a Christian city, but was ignored. Reluctant to jeopardise his own agenda for the Crusade, he gave conditional absolution to the crusaders—not, however, to the Venetians.|$|E

25|$|The name Friars' Carse {{derives from}} a monastic {{settlement}} {{which was established}} nearby by the Cistercian monks of Melrose in the 13th century. Carse Loch is located nearby and was once used as the monastic fish pond and its crannog {{was used as a}} hiding place for valuables durings times of war or raids.

25|$|The Orion {{correlation}} theory, as expounded {{by popular}} authors Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval, {{is based on}} the proposed exact correlation of the three pyramids at Giza with the three stars ζOri, εOri and δOri, the stars forming Orion's Belt, in the relative positions occupied by these stars in 10500BC. The authors argue that the geographic relationship of the Sphinx, the Giza pyramids and the Nile directly corresponds with Leo, Orion and the Milky Way respectively. Sometimes cited as an example of pseudoarchaeology, the theory is <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> <b>with</b> mainstream scholarship.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the Standard Model was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike. For theorists, the Standard Model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory, which exhibits {{a wide range of}} physics including spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) in an attempt to explain experimental results <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> <b>with</b> the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.|$|E

25|$|Although often {{striving for}} an exotic appearance, {{the figures in}} many early 19th-century windows are classicising in style. Set against a {{background}} of geometry, quarries or foliage, the small painted incidents within rondels and quatrefoils are nearly always conservatively academic in their appearance, with figures based on those in engravings of works by admired painters, Raphael, Titian, Andrea del Sarto and Perugino. Often in the case of windows with ornate foliage, the archaeologically correct surrounds are <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> <b>with</b> the style of the rondels which make no attempt to reproduce the medieval. William Wailes and Charles Edmund Clutterbuck were among the important firms.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} see a {{divergence between}} {{the language of}} Galicia-Volhynia and the language of Novgorod-Suzdal by the 12th century, assuming that before the 12th century, the two languages were practically indistinguishable. This point of view is, however, <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> <b>with</b> some historical data. In fact, several East Slavic tribes, such as Polans, Drevlyans, Severians, Dulebes (that later likely became Volhynians and Buzhans), White Croats, Tiverians and Ulichs lived on the territory of today's Ukraine long before the 12th century. Notably, some Ukrainian features were recognizable in the southern dialects of Old East Slavic {{as far back as}} the language can be documented.|$|E
25|$|A founder-cult of Protesilaus at Scione, in Pallene, Chalcidice, {{was given}} an {{etiology}} by the Greek grammarian and mythographer of the Augustan era Conon that is <b>at</b> <b>variance</b> <b>with</b> the epic tradition. In this, Conon asserts that Protesilaus survived the Trojan War and was returning with Priam's sister Aethilla as his captive. When the ships put ashore for water {{on the coast of}} Pallene, between Scione and Mende, Aethilla persuaded the other Trojan women to burn the ships, forcing Protesilaus to remain and found the city of Scione.
