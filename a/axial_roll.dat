40|$|In Ring Rolling process, to {{generate}} a seamless and axis symmetrical ring, two independent deformation processes simultaneously occur to reduce the starting ring cross section shape (width and height) {{in order to increase}} the diameter. How this shape changes during the whole deformation process greatly affects the produced ring quality and the loads and energy needed. The main problem is that the shape change is due to two deformation processes that occur in two different ring sections. The ring width reduction is realized in the cross section between the Idle and the Driver roll while the cross section deformed by the Axial rolls movement regulates the ring height. The main problem is that each roll speed law could be set independently from the others. In the industrial environment, a milling curve is introduced to correlate them to the ring section shape. In order to enhance the knowledge on how the Idle and <b>Axial</b> <b>roll</b> speed laws affect the Ring Rolling process, in this work an industrial case study was modeled by a numerical approach. Different Idle and <b>Axial</b> <b>roll</b> speed laws (linearly decreasing, constant, linearly increasing), were designed and simulated.

The influences of rolling process parameters such as the work roll cross angle and work roll shifting on the strip shape and profile of thin strip are recognised throughout this study. The results show that the roll crossing and shifting is efficient way to control the strip shape. The increase of the work roll crossing angle would lead to improve the strip profile significantly by decreasing the exit strip crown and edge drop.

Introduction Radial-axial ring rolling (RARR) {{is widely used}} in the produc- tion of seamless rings for the automotive and aerospace industries, where a ring work-piece is drawn into the mandrel-main roll gap and the <b>axial</b> <b>rolls</b> gap, causing expansion of the diameter as well as reduction in the thickness and height [1, 2]. In the literature, many efforts have been spent in the in- vestigation of the radial-axial ring rolling process considering different points of view, generally aiming to improve the knowl- edge of the interactions among the ring, the tools, the process set up and the production environment. As concerns the process de- sign, Hua et al. [3] defined useful rules for the estimation of the ring stiffness, which {{is an important factor}} to avoid collapses or unexpected deformations during the forming process. Zhou et al. [4], utilizing ABAQUS/Explicit solver, studied the influence of the tools dimensions, providing rules to optimize their choice. Zhou et al.

All rights reserved. abstract The paper focuses on the radial-axial ring rolling process and details a new mathematical approach for the determination of the evolution of the ring geometry during the deformation process, taking into account separately the sequence of incremental deformations occurring when the ring passes through the mandrel-main roll gap and through the <b>axial</b> <b>rolls</b> gap. Based on the determined geometry of the ring, the three strain components of the strain tensor are estimated and the equivalent plastic strain is computed. The proposed approach, taking into account a third strain in each deformation gap, allows an estimation of the equivalent plastic strain, which is a required parameter for the analytical estimation of the flow stress of the material, needed to compute the forming force. Since a direct validation of the strain components is not possible in the industrial RARR process, authors’ models for the determination of geometry and strain, together with preliminary authors’ models for the estimation of strain rate and temperature drop along the process, have been applied to a literature case for the estimation of the radial forming force in order to obtain a validation of the proposed models. Prediction of radial forming force utilizes a literature model based on slip line theory adapted to the ring rolling process. To extend the validation of the approach and to explore the quality of its predictions to other process configurations, different geometry of the ring have been considered and compared with FEM predictions. These com- parisons resulted in good agreement between analytical and FEM results as concerns ring geometry evolution, strain tensor prediction and effective strain estimation...|$|R
40|$|Closed orbit distortions (COD) are {{unavoidable}} in accelerator due to magnet construction {{errors and}} misalignments. With sextupoles or other nonlinear {{elements in the}} accelerator, the COD's in these elements cause additional focusing and tune shift for the small amplitude betatron oscillations At larger amplitudes the COD's in non-linear elements could contribute to resonant terms which will limit the dynamic aperture. The COD's are mainly produced by the following errors: Quadrupole misalignment errors- ~xi'~Yi Dipole field errors- (~Bt/Bt) i Dipole <b>axial</b> <b>roll</b> errors- (~$) i where i stands for anyone element. These errors are modeled by randomly distributed Gaussian errors {{with a mean of}} zero and an rms value given by: ~x, ~y, ~Bt/Bt, and ~~. For the Advanced Photon Source (APS) the tolerances (rms value) on these errors are specified to be ~x, ~y = 10 - 4 meter ~Bt/Bt = 10 - 4 ~ ~ = 10 - 4 radian. For this tolerance level, the average dynamic aperture for the APS lattice decreased from (N x x Ny) = (85 x 85) to = (40 x 40). However, correction magnets can be introduced into the lattice and tuned to reduce the COOlS in the lattice. This will have the effect of increasing the dYnamic aperture and improving other lattice properties (e. g., natural emittance, dispersion, etc.). 2 A.

40|$|Ring Rolling is an {{advanced}} local incremental forming technology to fabricate directly precise seamless ring-shape parts with various dimensions and materials. To produce a high-quality ring different speed laws should be defined: the speed {{laws of the}} Idle and <b>Axial</b> <b>rolls</b> must be set to control the ring cross section and the Driver roll angular velocity must be chosen to avoid too high localized deformation on the ring cross section. Usually, in industrial environment, a constant rotation is set for the Driver roll, but this approach does not guarantee a constant ring angular velocity because of its diameter expansion. In particular, the higher is the ring diameter the lower is its angular velocity. The main risk due to this constrain is the generation of a non-uniform ring geometry. An innovative approach is to design a Driver Roll speed law to obtain a constant ring angular velocity. In this paper a FEM approach was followed to investigate the Driver roll speed influence on the Ring Rolling process. Different Driver roll speed laws were tested starting from a model defined in an industrial plant. Results will be analyzed by a geometrical and physical point of view...|$|R

The advantages of ring rolling process include short production time, uniform quality, closed tolerances, good material quality and considerable saving in material cost.

The accuracy of the FE model was analyzed through a dual comparison: by geometrical and by physical aspects.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringCold ring rolling is {{a complex}} metal forming process and {{generally}} not well understood. In many instances, considerable experience and experimentation is required to develop the process. During the process, plastic deformation behavior namely the plastic deformation state and its development in the deformation zone, has an important effect on {{the stability of the}} process. Hence, investigating the plastic deformation behavior in the deformation zone during the process is very significant for predicting the metal flow, controlling the quality of deformed rings and optimizing the process parameters. In this thesis, a study on plastic deformation behavior in cold ring rolling has been carried out through 2 D numerical simulation using the LS-DYNA numerical finite element analysis code. The type of deformation behavior is compared with three type of plastic deformation behavior, established in previous studies. One type is that the material in the deformation zone entirely comes into the plastic deformation state at the early stage of the process (Type 1). A second type is that the material in the deformation zone gradually comes into the plastic deformation state during the process (Type 2). The last type is {{that at the end of}} process, there is still a rigid zone in elastic deformation or small plastic strain state near the middle radius of the ring blank (Type 3). The theoretical equations for decisive factor for plastic deformation behavior, which is the average amount of feed per revolution and functional relations between the average amount of feed per revolution and various process parameters, are ascertained with the assumption that the change in ring height during the process is negligible. Hence <b>axial</b> <b>rolls</b> are used to restrict the metal flow in axial direction of the ring. The simulation is performed for vi another class of aluminum alloy and the results are explored. The simulation is performed by varying the decisive factors and the results are plotted for the effective plastic strain, vonmises stress and KE/IE ratio v/s time. The distribution of plastic strain through the thickness of the ring is also studied. A study on effect of the plastic deformation behavior on driver roll force was then carried out for both the materials. Through this thesis it was showed that it is required to run the cold ring rolling process at lower driver roll speed and higher feed rate. It is also required to have higher average amount of feed per revolution to achieve homogeneous deformation, uniform strain distribution and higher driver roll force. The results of this thesis in which a 2 D FE analysis with plane strain formulation theory is carried out, can be used as a basis for optimizing the process parameters...|$|R

The extracted angular velocity profiles follow a log-law more closely than the azimuthal velocity profiles due to the strong curvature of this η= 0. 5 setup. The scaling of the wind Reynolds number with the Taylor number agrees with the theoretically predicted 3 / 7 -scaling for the classical turbulent regime, {{which is much more}} pronounced than for the well-explored η= 0. 71 case, for which the ultimate regime sets in at much lower Ta. By measuring at varying <b>axial</b> positions, <b>roll</b> structures are found for counter-rotation while no clear coherent structures are seen for pure inner cylinder rotation. In addition, turbulent plumes coming from the inner and outer cylinder are investigated. For pure inner cylinder rotation, the plumes in the radial velocity move away from the inner cylinder, while the plumes in the azimuthal velocity mainly move away from the outer cylinder. For counter-rotation, the mean radial flow in the roll structures strongly affects the direction and intensity of the turbulent plumes.

It is found that when the applied voltage is static and relatively small, both the axial elongated and bending deformed spring rolls can reach equilibrium after viscoelastic relaxation.

There are various ways of testing the effectiveness of motion correction methods applied in emission tomography, including the use of realistic digital anthropomorphic phantoms. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to create 3 D digital anthropomorphic phantoms based on MRI data of volunteers undergoing a series of clinically relevant motions. These phantoms with combined position tracking were used to investigate both imaging-data-driven and motion tracking strategies to estimate and correct for patient motion. Methods: MRI scans were obtained of volunteers undergoing a series of clinically relevant movements. During the MRI, the motions were recorded by near-infra-red cameras tracking using external markers on the chest and abdomen. Individual-specific extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantoms were created fit to our volunteer MRI imaging data representing pre- and post-motion states. These XCAT phantoms were then used to generate activity and attenuation distributions. Monte Carlo methods will then be performed to simulate SPECT acquisitions, which will be used to evaluate various motion estimation and correction strategies. Results: Three volunteers were scanned in the MRI with concurrent external motion tracking. Each volunteer performed five separate motions including an <b>axial</b> slide, <b>roll,</b> shoulder twist, spine bend, and arm motion. These MRI scans were then manually digitalized into 3 D anthropomorphic XCAT phantoms. Activity and attenuation distributions were created for each XCAT phantom, representing fifteen individual-specific motions. Conclusions: Our results will be combined with the external motion tracking data to determine if external motion tracking accurately reflects heart position in patients undergoing cardiac SPECT imaging.

40|$|In Micro-rolling process, {{metal sheet}} is {{imprinted}} with micron level textures by feeding into {{the gap between}} one smooth roll and one textured roll. To enhance the rollability of thin metal sheet and dimensional accuracy, high density current is sent through workpiece to soften the material by increasing temperature. This manufacturing process is called by Electrically-Assisted Micro-rolling (EAμR). EAμR, as a high efficiency and environment protection manufacturing process, {{can be used for}} production of key components in Micro-electromechanical Systems and bio-engineering. To control the quality of product, it is essential to monitor the pressure distribution in workpiece-roll interface during micro-rolling process. Comparing with process monitoring in conventional rolling process, sensing method in micro-rolling process monitoring not only demands to maintain surface integrity of roll surface, but also is limited by narrow space for sensors installation. Thus, a new sensing method based on embedded capacitance sensor array has been developed and prototyped for real-time monitoring in Electrically-Assisted Micro-rolling process. In the optimal structural design of embedded sensor, Finite element modeling is investigated to study the influence of sensor parameters and electrical current on sensor. To improve the spatial resolution of embedded sensor array mounted in a limited space, a new pressure reconstruction algorithm is presented to retrieve continuous spatial distribution of rolling pressure from a limited number of measured points. In this context, three research tasks has been identified and examined {{during the course of this}} thesis: 1) Design of a new embedded sensing method and its modeling The new sensing method monitors micro-rolling process by an embedded capacitance sensor array integrated into smooth roll of micro-rolling mill. The new embedded sensor using limited sensor installation space provides a new method to measure contact pressure between roller and workpiece without damaging the roller surface. It consists of a cylindrical plastic rod as the physical carrier of sensor array, a group of metal foils attached on cylindrical surface as receiving layer of capacitance array, and a thin plastic film as dielectric material of capacitance. The excitation layer of capacitance sensor is attached on inner surface of mounting hole in smooth roll. When the sensing rod is mounted into mounting hole, a series of capacitance is formed along <b>axial</b> direction of <b>roll.</b> In the design of mechatronics system, multi-physics modeling, based on finite element method, is developed not only to study the relationship between sensor parameters and the sensitivity of sensor, but to understand the thermal and electro-magnetic effect of electrical current passing through workpiece quantitatively as well. 2) Development of prototyping micro-rolling sensing system Micro-rolling sensing system is developed for real-time monitoring of Electrical-Assisted Micro-Rolling process. The whole system consists of one or two embedded capacitance sensor arrays, smooth roll, and capacitance measurement electronic device. Two 1 x 12 pixel capacitance sensor arrays are inserted into sensor mounting holes in smooth roll. Two pieces of printed circuit boards (PCB) are mounted at both ends of smooth roll for capacitance measurement and wireless data transmission. The electronic device measures capacitance in sensing rod using capacitance-to-digital converter chip for stable and precise capacitance measurement. To decrease the noise caused by signal cable, ZigBee communication module is used to transmit the digital signal from circuit to remote PC. In PC receiver, software interface has been developed for real-time monitoring and data analysis. A calibration process on micro-rolling mill has been investigated to calibrate the relationship between capacitance increase of each electrode and rolling pressure. 3) Reconstruction of Spatio-Temporal Distribution of rolling pressure Since roll misalignment and unevenness of workpiece can cause unexpected pressure distribution, monitoring of spatio-temporal distribution of rolling pressure at workpiece-roll interface is critical to control the accuracy of channel dimension. During micro-rolling process, micro-rolling sensing system embedded in rolling mill can transfer a set of capacitance data. To convert capacitance increases of one dimensional sensor array to pressure distribution along <b>axial</b> direction of <b>roll,</b> Back-proejection method is investigated to solve the inverse problem. The pressure-to-capacitance transducer is calculated by numerical method. To increase the spatial resolution of pressure-to-capacitance conversion, interpolation method is investigated to estimate the continuous deformation of dielectric layer under rolling pressure from limited number of sensing points. In this context, three interpolation methods (Kriging, Thin Plated Spline, and Bezier interpolation) and four back-projection methods (Tikhonov regularization, iterative Tikhonov regularization, Landweber iteration, and Offline Iteration Online Reconstruction) are discussed. The best combination of interpolation and back-projection method is determined by numerical experiment. In addition to these focal areas, prototyped micro-rolling sensing system has been equipped to micro-rolling mill for pressure monitoring during EAμR. Pressure reconstruction algorithm has also been tested by outputs of micro-rolling sensing system. The experimental verification was utilized for reliability evaluation of embedded sensing method and pressure reconstruction algorithm...|$|R

Columns are important members and thus many {{scholars in the}} past have been dedicated to the column research. This study presents a direct experimental verification of the AISC Specification for built-up compression members and steel tubs filled with aggregate concrete. To find out the difference of different steels (rolled and cold-formed), we also investigate the AISI Standard of slender C-shaped cold-formed steel members with web openings. The following findings can be drawn from this study and are specified as follows: 1. The AISC Specification for steel columns appears quite conservative, but they are still in the range of reasonable acceptance. 2. The AISI Standard for columns also appears reasonable (Ptest/Pu = 1. 02 ~ 1. 21), for column members with web openings, they are too conservative (Ptest/Pu = 1. 22 ~ 1. 54). 3. The effective sectional area concept was adopted to conduct the analysis of cold-formed steel. When consider the width-to-thickness ratio of members, analysis is long and tedious procedure. The most difficulty job is the calculation of warping constant (Cw) for an open thin-walled open section which is a tedious and difficult task and thus presenting an obstacle to the routine design in practice. This study proposes a step-by-step numerical procedure for evaluating the warping constant of a general open thin-walled section. The proposed procedure is a reliable and useful tool for computing the warping constant for an arbitrary rolled and cold-formed steel open section, which does not need a sophisticated computer software being used. 柱子為壓力構件之通稱，其類型包括純軸壓構件(型鋼斷面、組合斷面) 、同時承受軸壓與彎矩的構件均屬壓力構件。長久以來柱構件的力學行為一直都是熱門研究主題，本研究針對AISC規範中型鋼斷面(rolled section) 、組合斷面(build-up section) ，及鋼管混凝土(CFT) 進行柱構件規範之探討與理論推導，並佐以相關之實驗以茲比較。為了更了解不同鋼材間之差異，亦針對AISI規範中冷軋型鋼構件(Cold-Formed Steel) 進行相關之研究與實驗，以期從理論、規範與實驗比較中更加瞭解受壓鋼構件之力學行為。 本論文主要結論包括 1. 經由理論數值與實驗的比較，AISC規範對於柱構件之承載能力是相當保守，惟尚在合理的範圍之內。 2. AISI規範對於柱構件之承載能力亦是保守(Ptest/Pu = 1. 02 ~ 1. 21) ，在構件腹板開孔部份，經由實驗與理論數值的比較發現規範公式過於保守(Ptest/Pu = 1. 22 ~ 1. 54) 。 3. 分析冷軋型鋼時，必須考慮冷軋鋼板之寬厚比，計算其強度時採有效斷面，造成分析時相當複雜。一般常見之開口斷面(open section) 構件，受力時會受到扭力作用，因此須考慮純扭屈應力(torsional shear stress) 與翹屈應力(warping stress) ，其中翹屈應力之分析常面臨之困難為翹屈常數(warping constant, Cw) 之計算。雖然許多常見開口斷面之翹屈常數已有現成公式可用，但是這些現成公式一般而言仍相當複雜。本研究推導翹屈常數之理論積分式，考慮斷面係由薄壁板元素(thin-walled plate element) 所組成，將理論積分式改成數值公式，由電腦執行開口斷面翹屈常數之運算工作。翹屈數值公式提供規範所列舉斷面與所有非列舉開口斷面之翹屈常數計算流程，處理與解決現今業界之困難。Abstract in Chinese	i Abstract in English	ii Contents	iii List of Tables	v List of Figures	vii Notations	x Chapter 1 - Introduction	 1 1. 1 Background and Previous Studies	 1 1. 2 Objectives of This Research	 3 Chapter 2 - Behavior of Steel Compression Members	 5 2. 1 Governing Equation for Elastic Beam-Column	 5 2. 2 Post-Buckling Behavior	 8 2. 3 Effective Lengths	 8 2. 4 Tangent Modulus	 10 2. 5 Double Modulus and Shanley's Concept	 12 2. 6 Residual Stresses	 15 2. 7 Stub-Column Test	 17 2. 8 Elastic Columns based on Euler Formula	 20 2. 9 Column Strength in terms of Numerical Expressions	 22 Chapter 3 - Review of AISC Column Related Provisions	 25 3. 1 SSRC and ASD Curves / 1989 	 25 3. 2 SSRC and LRFD Curves / 1999 	 26 3. 3 SSRC and LRFD Curves / 2005 	 27 3. 4 AISC Specification / 2005 	 29 3. 5 Pure Steel Sections	 29 3. 6 Composite Sections	 31 Chapter 4 - Review of AISI Column Related Provisions	 33 4. 1 AISI Specification / 2001 	 33 4. 2 Concentrically Loaded Compression Members	 33 4. 3 Sections Not Subject to Torsional or Torsional-Flexural Buckling	 34 4. 4 Doubly- or Singly-Symmetric Sections Subject to Torsional or Torsional-Flexural Buckling	 34 Chapter 5 - Evaluation for Warping Constants Being Used in Column Design Formulas	 35 5. 1 Integration Forms for Open Thin-walled Sections	 35 5. 2 Numerical Forms for Open Thin-walled Sections	 36 5. 3 Numerical Examples	 38 5. 4 Comparison between the Calculated and the Listed Values	 39 5. 5 Summary of Derived and Listed Cw Formulas	 40 Chapter 6 - Experimental Tests Being Conducted	 54 Part one - Built-up Sections (Rolled Steel) 6. 1 Experimental Tests on Built-up Columns	 54 6. 1. 1 Various Built-up Column Slenderness Ratios	 54 6. 1. 2 Axial Compression Strengths	 56 6. 1. 3 Axial Strengths based on Various Slenderness Ratios	 57 6. 1. 4 Experimental Work	 58 6. 1. 5 Discussion of Test Results	 59 Part two - Composite Sections 6. 2 Experimental Tests on Rectangular Steel Tubes filled with Light-Weight Aggregate Concrete	 60 6. 2. 1 Experimental Work	 61 6. 2. 2 Discussion of Test Results	 62 Part three - C-shaped Steel Sections (Cold-formed Steel) 6. 3 Experimental Tests on Compressive Strength of Slender C-shaped Cold-formed Steel Members with Web Openings	 64 6. 3. 1 Experimental Work	 64 6. 3. 2 Test Results	 66 6. 3. 3 Finite Element Analysis	 68 6. 3. 4 Discussion of Test Results	 70 Chapter 7 - Illustrated Examples based on Codes and Tests	 99 Chapter 8 - Conclusions and Suggestions	 107 References	 11...|$|R
