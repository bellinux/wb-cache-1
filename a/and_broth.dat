The first-named organization made the uniforms for the company of her son, Captain L. Cheves McCord, his mother furnishing the material. She resigned her presidency of the Soldiers' Relief Association in order to give her whole time to the military hospital established within the South Carolina College; this was in 1862, and here she gave her greatest service. In her home, at the northwest corner of Pendleton and Bull streets, {{across the street from the}} college property, she received supplies from the women of the city -— supplies available for nourishment for the sick, and hospital comfort. Early every day, there was made in her kitchen a supply of corn bread <b>and</b> <b>broth,</b> heaped into plates and left on a long dresser on her back piazza, served day after day as the nourishment for wounded soldiers who could drag themselves across the street from the convalescent building on the campus.|$|E

[...] Although dreary, the food was generally nutritionally adequate, and according to contemporary records was prepared with great care. [...] Issues such as training staff to serve and weigh portions were well understood. [...] The diets included general guidance, as well as schedules for each class of inmate. [...] They were laid out on a weekly rotation, the various meals selected on a daily basis, from a list of foodstuffs. [...] For instance, a breakfast of bread and gruel was followed by dinner, which might consist of cooked meats, pickled pork or bacon with vegetables, potatoes, yeast dumpling, soup and suet, or rice pudding.
