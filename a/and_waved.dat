40|$|The {{electric}} power generation of co-located offshore wind turbines <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy converters along the California coast is investigated. Meteorological wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> data from the National Buoy Data Center were used to estimate the hourly power output from offshore wind turbines <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy converters at the sites of the buoys. The data set from 12 buoys consists of over 1, 000, 000 h of simultaneous hourly mean wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> measurements. At the buoys, offshore wind farms would have capacity factors ranging from 30 % to 50 %, <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms would have capacity factors ranging from 22 % to 29 %. An analysis of the power output indicates that co-located offshore wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy farms generate less variable power output than a wind or wave farm operating alone. The reduction in variability results from the low temporal correlation of the resources and occurs on all time scales. Aggregate power from a co-located wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farm achieves reductions in variability equivalent to aggregating power from two offshore wind farms approximately 500 km apart or two wave farms approximately 800 km apart. Combined wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms in California would have less than 100 h of no power output per year, compared to over 1000 h for offshore wind or over 200 h for wave farms alone. Ten offshore farms of wind, wave, or both modeled in the California power system would have capacity factors during the summer ranging from 21 % (all wave) to 36 % (all wind) with combined wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms between 21 % and 36 %. The capacity credits for these farms range from 16 % to 24 % with some combined wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> farms achieving capacity credits {{equal to or greater}} than a 100 % wind farm because of their reduction in power output variability...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this CHETN is to examine changes in peak surge {{elevation}} <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> height due {{to changes in the}} frictional resistance of a marsh. Landscape features with vegetation have the potential to reduce storm surge elevations <b>and</b> dissipate <b>wave</b> energy. Land elevations greater than the storm surge elevation act as a physical barrier and create bathymetric resistance for the surge <b>and</b> <b>waves.</b> Landscape features such as marshes also have the potential to create frictional resistance and affect storm surge <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> energy even when below the surge elevation. This is the third in a series of technical notes on the influence of marshes on storm surge <b>and</b> <b>waves.</b> The analysis in this note isolates the sensitivity of the modeled storm surge elevation <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> height to the magnitude of bottom friction change and indicates, in a qualita-tive sense, {{the degree to which a}} marsh density may reduce storm surge elevation <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> height on the coast. The magnitude of bottom friction was systematically increased within a hypothetical marsh area to understand how marsh vegetation type and density may modify storm parameters (surge elevation <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> height) on the coast immediately landward of the marsh. METHODOLOGY: A set of idealized surge simulations using ADCIRC (Westerink et al., 1992) and STWAVE (Smith et al., 2001) were made to examine changes in storm surge elevation an...|$|R

Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct. The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.|$|E
5|$|On a {{surprise}} visit to Damascus {{to celebrate the}} union on 24 February, Nasser was welcomed by crowds {{in the hundreds of}} thousands. Crown Prince Imam Badr of North Yemen was dispatched to Damascus with proposals to include his country in the new republic.

While Nasser was in Syria, King Saud planned to have him assassinated on his return flight to Cairo.

As a consequence of Saud's plot, he was forced by senior members of the Saudi royal family to informally cede most of his powers to his brother, King Faisal, a major Nasser opponent who advocated pan-Islamic unity over pan-Arabism.|$|E
40|$|Ocean wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> {{parameters}} can {{be measured}} by in-situ sensors such as anemometers and buoys. Since the 1980 s, X-band marine radar has evolved {{as one of the}} remote sensing instruments for such purposes since its sea surface images contain considerable wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> information. The maturity and accuracy of X-band marine radar wind <b>and</b> <b>wave</b> measurements have already enabled relevant commercial products to be used in real-world applications.

5|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{refused to}} abandon the area completely {{out of fear that}} such an action would make them appear weak. While they planned a response, Indians raided the San Saba horse herd, stealing all of the horses and pack mules and killing 20soldiers. In October 1759, Spain sent the San Sabá commander, Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla, on an expedition north to the Red River to avenge the attack. The tribes were forewarned and led Parrilla's army to a fortified Wichita village, surrounded by a stockade and a moat, where natives brandished French guns <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> a French flag. After a skirmish in which 52Spaniards were killed, wounded, or deserted, the Spanish retreated. The San Sabá presidio was replaced with a limestone fortress and a moat, but the Comanches and their allies remained close and killed any soldiers who ventured out. By 1769, Spain abandoned the fort.|$|E
5|$|The libertines' {{downfall}} {{began with}} the February 1555 elections.

On 16 May the libertines took to the streets in a drunken protest and attempted to burn down a house that was supposedly full of Frenchmen. The syndic Henri Aulbert tried to intervene, carrying with him the baton of office that symbolised his power. Perrin seized the baton <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> it over the crowd, which gave the appearance that he was taking power and initiating a coup d'état. The insurrection was soon over when another syndic appeared and ordered Perrin to go with him to the town hall. Perrin and other leaders were forced to flee the city. With the approval of Calvin, the other plotters who remained in the city were found and executed. The opposition to Calvin's church polity came to an end.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of props in Peking opera, costumes take on added importance. Costumes function first to distinguish the rank of the character being played. Emperors and their families wear yellow robes, and high-ranking officials wear purple. The robe worn by these two classes is called a mang, or python robe. It is a costume suitable for the high rank of the character, featuring brilliant colors and rich embroidery, often {{in the design of}} a dragon. Persons of high rank or virtue wear red, lower-ranking officials wear blue, young characters wear white, the old wear white, brown, or olive, and all other men wear black. On formal occasions, lower officials may wear the kuan yi, a simple gown with patches of embroidery on both the front and back. All other characters, and officials on informal occasions, wear the chezi, a basic gown with varying levels of embroidery and no jade girdle to denote rank. All three types of gowns have water sleeves, long flowing sleeves that can be flicked <b>and</b> <b>waved</b> like water, attached to facilitate emotive gestures. Tertiary characters of no rank wear simple clothing without embroidery. Hats are intended to blend in {{with the rest of the}} costume and will usually have a matching level of embroidery. Shoes may be high or low soled, the former being worn by characters of high rank, and the latter by characters of low rank or acrobatic characters.|$|E
