5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; its small feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back. It has <b>a</b> <b>quicker,</b> deeper wingbeat than do other loons.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} {{is distinguished}} from other dark-plumaged birds by its yellow tail and ear markings, and its contact call. Parts of its range overlap with the ranges of two cockatoo species that have red tail banding, the red-tailed cockatoo and the glossy black cockatoo. Crow species may appear similar when seen flying at a distance; however, crows have shorter tails, <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> wing beat, and different calls.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E

5|$|Each {{character}} possesses individual {{strengths and}} weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> rate; {{the girl is}} a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves {{in areas such as}} strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Norman broke a hip and {{her health}} began to decline. Although she {{had promised to}} live until 2001, her deteriorating {{condition}} made her followers suspect she would die before then, causing them some distress and denial. In an attempt to help her recover, students used past-life regression to recall interactions with her, and some became very emotional after experiencing memories of events {{in which they had}} rejected and hurt her. Norman returned to leading services in February 1989, making <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> than expected recovery, which was attributed to the past-life rituals. After a period of good health, her condition again deteriorated, prompting students to resume recounting their past crimes. Norman lost most of her hearing and experienced chronic pain; she was admitted to a hospital in December 1989, but by the summer she was well enough to be present at events. She was nearly bedridden in her last years and was attended to by some followers. In 1991, she stated that the Space Brothers had given her permission to die before their expected arrival in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The network {{expanded}} rapidly {{during the}} early decades of the 20th century; by 1944 its main routes were completed, with the addition of its newest line occurring as late as 2007. The pace of expansion fell sharply after the Second World War. In the late 1990s expansion resumed at <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> pace, and four new lines were planned for the network. Despite this, the network's expansion has been largely exceeded by the transportation needs of the city and is said to be overcrowded. As of 2015, two modernisation plans have been presented: City of Buenos Aires law 670, proposing the creation of 3 new lines, F, G and I; and the PETERS plan, wherein 2 lines are created and the I line is postponed for future expansion, plus several other route amendments.|$|E

5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry and hot for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Coulthard set {{the fastest}} {{time of the}} third practice session, a 1:15.965. Häkkinen was second fastest, almost two-tenths of a second off Coulthard's pace. The two Jordan drivers were running quicker; Trulli in third and Frentzen in fourth. Both Jaguars continued to be quick with Irvine fifth and Herbert eighth. The two were separated by Michael Schumacher and Button. Barrichello and de la Rosa rounded out the top ten. In the final practice session, Coulthard was unable to improve his time because of an engine failure though he remained fastest. Häkkinen managed to set <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> time and remained with the second quickest lap. Barrichello ran quicker and was third fastest, in front of Ralf Schumacher. The Jordan drivers remained fastest–Trulli was fifth and Frentzen sixth–their best times two thousands of a second apart. Irvine was seventh quickest, ahead of Michael Schumacher who concentrated on qualifying set-up. Button and Herbert completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the selection of Virginia Tech and Boston College, concerns about potential attendance at the 2008 ACC Championship Game arose. Because the same matchup resulted in such low attendance at the 2007 championship game in Jacksonville, it was doubted that Tampa, which is several hundred miles further south and more distant from the two schools, could attract as many spectators as the previous season's game. Adding {{to the problem of}} selling tickets was the 2008 economic crisis, which many fans cited as a reason for not purchasing tickets. By the Wednesday before the game, Virginia Tech had sold just 3,000 of the 10,000 tickets it was required by contract to sell. There also were questions about how many local fans would attend. To mitigate the problems seen in Jacksonville the year before, ticket prices were lowered from $65 to $25, and it was hoped that the lower capacity of Tampa's Raymond James Stadium compared with Jacksonville Municipal Stadium would allow for <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> sellout. The campaign to attract more fans was moderately successful, as 30,000 of the 43,000 tickets not assigned to either school were sold by December 1, five days before the game. Team ticket sales were abysmal, however, as Virginia Tech and Boston College combined to sell just 5,000 tickets of the 20,000 allotted to the two teams.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather conditions. Barrichello set the fastest time in the first practice session, at 1 minute and 41.953 seconds, which was three-tenths of a second quicker than Pedro de la Rosa of Arrows. Coulthard was third fastest despite going off the circuit at the Clark chicane. Michael Schumacher went off at the Senna chicane en route to recording the fourth quickest lap, ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Häkkinen, Montoya, Irvine, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. In the second practice session, Irvine was running quicker by setting the fastest {{time of the day}} of 1:41.424, ahead of Montoya in second. Häkkinen was third quickest, in front of Barrichello in fourth. Michael Schumacher took fifth place, running wide at the circuit's chicanes which prevented him from setting <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> lap. de la Rosa, Coulthard, Jean Alesi, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher, who collided with the Sudkurve tyre barrier, followed in the top ten.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Second World War, Johnston was a slow-medium and left-arm {{orthodox}} spin bowler, {{but during}} a practice session, he bowled <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> ball to Jack Ryder a former Australian captain and Test batsman, {{who was now}} a Victorian and national selector. This prompted Ryder to wage a personal campaign to induce Johnston to become a pace bowler. At the same time, Richmond captain Jack Ledward wanted him to bowl spin. Upon the resumption of first-class cricket in 1945–46, Johnston made his first-class debut against Queensland and was entrusted with the responsibility of opening the attack. His maiden wicket was that of leading Test batsman Bill Brown. Johnston took a total of 1/84 in a ten-wicket win. He felt that the fast bowling was only for short periods with the new ball, {{and that he would}} be allowed to revert to spin bowling as the ball became older. He played a total of seven matches for the season and took 12 wickets at 35.08, with his best performance being 4/43 against arch-rivals New South Wales. As a result, he missed the national selection for the tour to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Montoya clinched his second consecutive pole position and his third of the season with a time of 1:22.216. Although he was happy with the feel of his car, he did not feel confident that he could take pole position. Montoya was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap 0.312 seconds slower and also went off into a gravel trap during qualifying. Michael Schumacher qualified third and admitted to making a mistake on his third run which prevented him from setting <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> time. Ralf Schumacher had balance issues which meant his car alternated between understeer and oversteer en route to fourth position. He also managed three clear runs before his fourth was disrupted by a yellow flag. Trulli qualified fifth and was delighted with his car and tyres. Coulthard qualified in sixth position and felt his car's balance was good although felt it difficult to push hard and achieve ideal grip. Häkkinen took seventh and ran wide at the exit of Curva di Lesmo on his final timed run and crashed heavily into a barrier which resulted in a large amount of damage to the front and left side of his car. Häkkinen was unhurt but the crash caused qualifying to be suspended for thirteen minutes.|$|E

5|$|Thomas and {{his younger}} brother Henry served in the {{coronation}} of their cousin King Edward II of England on 25 February 1308; Thomas carried Curtana, the Sword of Mercy, and Henry carried the royal sceptre. After initially supporting Edward, Thomas became one of the Lords Ordainers, who demanded the banishment of Piers Gaveston and the governance of the realm by a baronial council. After Gaveston was captured, Thomas took the lead in his trial and execution at Warwick in 1312. Edward's authority was weakened by poor governance and defeat by the Scots at the Battle of Bannockburn. This allowed Thomas to restrain Edward's power by republishing the Ordinances of 1311. Following this achievement Thomas took little part in the governance of the realm and instead retreated to Pontefract Castle. This allowed Edward to regroup and re-arm, leading to a fragile peace in August 1318 with the Treaty of Leake. In 1321 Edward's rule again collapsed into civil war. Thomas raised a northern army but was defeated and captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered but because he was Edward's cousin he was given <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> death by beheading.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Häkkinen clinched his fifth pole position of the season and his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:50.646; although he was optimistic about his race prospects, he was concerned about the start. Häkkinen was joined in the front row of the grid by Trulli, who equalled his best qualifying performance of the season (at the Monaco Grand Prix). Trulli was also optimistic about his chances because of the Jordan team's strong record at the circuit. Button qualified third, and said he was happy with his starting position. Michael Schumacher secured fourth position, nine-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, setting a lap time which pushed Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard into fifth. Coulthard, who had problems with grip, believed that he could have had a faster lap time. Ralf Schumacher secured sixth position after being caught in traffic during his final run, keeping the Williams driver from <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> lap time. Villeneuve, in seventh, reported oversteering. Frentzen qualified eighth; his best lap time was disqualified after Coulthard blocked him at the Bus Stop chicane, which caused Frentzen to run onto the grass. Herbert and Barrichello rounded out the top ten drivers, with Barrichello spinning at the chicane during his third run after locking his brakes. Fisichella, eleventh, missed the top ten by three-tenths of a second on his only quick run of the session. Herbert's teammate, Eddie Irvine, qualified twelfth with tyre-grip problems. He was ahead of Zonta in the slower of the two BARs (which lost a half-second through Eau Rouge), Heidfeld in the faster Prost, Sauber's Pedro Diniz and Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa. Alesi qualified 17th, despite spinning at the chicane and triggering a yellow flag. Salo qualified 18th, ahead of Wurz (who had engine problems and shared the spare Benetton monocoque with Fisichella). Verstappen and the two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the back of the}} grid, in positions 20 to 22.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{car came}} back in on lap 32, with Rosberg leading the field at the flying restart, quickly pulling out a two-second {{advantage}} over Hamilton. Sergio Pérez was {{the winner of the}} restart, moving up three places into 11th and moving up another position several laps later. On lap 39, Button moved ahead of Felipe Nasr into seventh position. After keeping the gap at around two seconds for a number of laps, a mistake by Rosberg saw Hamilton close back up to him, allowing him to use the drag reduction system to attempt an overtake manoeuvre. Several drivers decided to change tyres for a second time around lap 50, including Valtteri Bottas on lap 52, while Nico Hülkenberg took his third stop a lap before, serving a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pitlane in the process. On lap 55, Hamilton {{was the first of the}} leading duo to come in for a pitstop, followed by Rosberg a lap later. <b>A</b> <b>quicker</b> stop for Rosberg and a mistake by Hamilton on his lap after pitting saw Rosberg emerge from his stop ahead. Verstappen was in the lead, soon followed closely by the two Mercedes drivers. On lap 58, Räikkönen overtook Ricciardo for fourth place, while Verstappen was staying in the lead with soft compound tyres he fitted on lap 15. He lost the lead to Rosberg however on lap 61, with Hamilton getting past him as well soon after. As the Mercedes duo battled for the race win, several drivers retired in the closing stages of the race, including Hülkenberg and Massa. Räikkönen was closing in to Verstappen in third, while Pascal Wehrlein edged closer to Bottas in tenth place as well. On the last lap, Hamilton attempted to overtake Rosberg into turn two. Hamilton went to the outside but Rosberg turned into the corner late on the inside and both cars touched, damaging Rosberg's front wing and pushing Hamilton off the track. They almost touched again as Hamilton rejoined the track. Hamilton eventually got ahead into turn three as Rosberg nursed his damaged car to the finish line. He was relegated to fourth position as both Verstappen and Räikkönen moved past him over the course of the lap. Further behind, Pérez retired, elevating Wehrlein into the last point-scoring position in tenth.|$|E
