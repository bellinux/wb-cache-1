5|$|On {{the night}} of Sunday 8 May to Monday 9 May 1977, about 100 people were staying in the Hotel Polen, {{including}} {{a large group of}} Swedish tourists. About 6:20am, the hotel staff were preparing for breakfast service, when one of them noticed smoke that seemed to be coming from the freight elevator (which had not been used since the café-restaurant on the ground floor had closed the previous evening). The night porter was alerted. Contrary to instructions, he did not call the fire department immediately; instead, he poured some buckets of water into the shaft, in an attempt to subdue the fire. By the time he decided to call the fire department, the hotel was filling with smoke. The night porter was unable to reach the phone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> because the fire had already reached it. The porter then ran outside, where he stopped the driver of a laundry truck serving the hotel, and instructed him to drive to the Hotel Krasnapolsky to warn them and to call the fire department.|$|E

500|$|In his written {{confession}} {{released by}} Peruvian police, Van der Sloot recounted that he briefly left {{the hotel to}} get some coffee and bread, and returned to find Flores using his laptop computer without his permission. A police source stated {{that she may have}} found information linking him to the disappearance of Holloway. An altercation allegedly began, and she attempted to escape. According to the aforementioned written confession released by Peruvian authorities, Van der Sloot stated, [...] "I did not want to do it. The girl intruded into my private life [...] [...] [...] she didn't have any right. I went to her and I hit her. She was scared, we argued and she tried to escape. I grabbed her by the neck and hit her." [...] Van der Sloot reportedly stated that he was stoned on marijuana at the time. A detective linked to the case said that Van der Sloot considered getting rid of the body in a suitcase, but decided against it because he would have been stopped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk.</b> He then reportedly drank espresso and took amphetamines to counter fatigue before fleeing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} representation, inference strategies, {{and control}} procedures em-ployed in an automated conversation system named the Bayesian Receptionist. The prototype {{is focused on}} the domain of dialog about goals typically handled by reception-ists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desks</b> of buildings on the Microsoft corporate campus. The system employs a set of Bayesian user models to interpret the goals of speakers given evidence gleaned from a natural language parse of their utterances. Beyond linguistic features, the domain models take into consideration contextual evidence, including visual findings. We discuss key principles of conversational actions under uncertainty and the overall archi-tecture of the system, highlighting the use of a hierarchy of Bayesian models at different levels of detail, the use of value of information to control question asking, and application of expected utility to control progression and backtracking in conversation. ...|$|R

2500|$|However, Skinner {{recognized}} {{that a great}} deal of behavior, especially human behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of response sequences. Complex behavior often appears suddenly in its final form, as when a person first finds his way to the elevator by following instructions given <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk.</b> To account for such behavior, Skinner introduced the concept of rule-governed behavior. First, relatively simple behaviors come under the control of verbal stimuli: the child learns to [...] "jump", [...] "open the book", and so on. [...] After a large number of responses come under such verbal control, a sequence of verbal stimuli can evoke an almost unlimited variety of complex responses.|$|E

Stone then cast Christian Bale, who spent months researching for the role, but dropped out after he was {{not satisfied with the}} prosthetic makeup tests. Stone remarked, [...] "Christian's a very methodical actor and he has to have the makeup thing work for him." [...] Brolin, cast at the [...] "last minute", spent months working on Bush's distinctive vocal style, calling hotels in Texas and talking to the people <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk,</b> listening to their accents. The actor also watched videos of Bush walking. Brolin said, [...] "It changes over the years, how he walks in his 30s, how he walks in foreign lands, before 9/11 and afterward.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between clients and agents <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desks</b> of government agencies, particularly welfare agencies, have received unprecedented attention in France since the 1990 s. A {{number of reasons}} explain this surge of interest in a dimension of public policy hitherto generally neglected both by institutional actors and observers alike. First, so-called public service modernization programs and then State reform programs have included the objective of improving {{relationships between}} the administrations and their usagers [users], now referred to as "clients " (Warin 1997). Welfare agencies were quickly and intensely enlisted in this general reform undertaking. Combining a management-oriented approach and the specialization of services provided to disadvantaged persons(Siblot 2006), these programs {{have contributed to the}} practical and symbolic production of the problem of "handling the excluded", even beyond the level of welfare organizations, especially when public service agents deal with those referred to as des publics difficiles [difficult publics] in the institutional lingo: jeunes des cités[inner-city kids] in public transport, SDF [homeless people] in the hospitals, and les exclus [the excluded]in general. Lastly, these institutional and social preoccupations resonated with researchers, especially as they coincided with a trend towards...|$|R

Crystal Ball {{has been used to}} simulate the framework, based on data collected by several iterations of interviews with CREC employees. It also becomes evident, that using the proposed framework can result in substantial monetary saving for the CREC management in terms of employee wages. Thus optimizing usage of employees leads to savings in wages and better hourly scheduling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> CREC <b>front</b> <b>desk.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> report investigated the possibility of enhancing the service and easing up the load on the main entry desk employees, such that more users are to be served by less number of employees, which can also result in a higher budgetary saving...|$|R

40|$|The {{hospitality}} {{industry is a}} billion dollar industry based upon customer service. Measure of quality service is an intangible concept based upon {{the perception of the}} customer. It is the industry 2 ̆ 7 s front-line employee that has the responsibility of fulfilling the perceived image of service the guest has envisioned. In 1991, industries throughout the U.

The formal training of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> agent bares <b>the</b> same commitment. In this study is was assumed that through formal training <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> agent would gain a better knowledge and confidence in their job performance and overall job satisfaction. As a result the industry would have a knowledgeable, confident and satisfied <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> agent that would provide better customer service. This descriptive study attempted to identify the status of formal training of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> agent, <b>the</b> effect formal training had on job satisfaction and retention and the differences in the perception of formal training between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> agent/trainee and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> manager /trainer in the Rochester/Monroe County, N.
