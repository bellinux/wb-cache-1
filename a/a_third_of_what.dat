5|$|Before {{leaving for}} Italy, Skanderbeg needed to {{accumulate}} the appropriate finances. Pius ordered the Diocese of Dalmatia to give <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it had raised for the forthcoming crusade to Skanderbeg. The pope also ordered 1,000 florins {{to be given}} to Skanderbeg from the Vatican's funds. The Ragusan banks held this amount, but due to the threat of an Ottoman invasion, they refused to continue funding the crusade; Stefan Vukčić of Zeta warned that the Ottomans would soon move into Dalmatia and Albania. They were thus reluctant to fund Skanderbeg's expedition to Italy. Due to issues of finance and the lack of large ships (he had, however, received several smaller ships to transport his troops), Skanderbeg's arrival was delayed while Ferdinand was under siege in Barletta. Before the siege began, however, Ferndinand sent four galleys to the Albanian shores where Skanderbeg and his men were waiting. Skanderbeg had meanwhile sent an unnamed captain to his eastern frontiers to guard against an Ottoman attack and left his wife, Donika, in charge of his affairs.|$|E

25|$|Around 1300–1350 the Medieval Warm Period {{gave way}} to the Little Ice Age. The colder climate {{resulted}} in agricultural crises, the first of which is known as the Great Famine of 1315-1317. The demographic consequences of this famine, however, were not as severe as the plagues that occurred later in the century, particularly the Black Death. Estimates of the death rate caused by this epidemic range from one third to as much as sixty percent.

25|$|Although suicide {{was officially}} {{accepted}} {{as the cause}} of death, some medical experts have raised doubts, suggesting that the evidence does not support this. The most detailed objection was provided in a letter from three medical doctors published in The Guardian, reinforced by support from two other senior doctors in a later letter to the newspaper. These doctors argued that the post-mortem finding of a transected ulnar artery could not have caused a degree of blood loss that would kill someone, particularly when outside in the cold (where vasoconstriction would cause slow blood loss). Further, this conflicted with the minimal amount of blood found at the scene. They also contended that the amount of co-proxamol found was only about <b>a</b> <b>third</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would normally be fatal. Dr Rouse, a British epidemiologist wrote to the British Medical Journal offering his opinion that the act of committing suicide by severing the wrist arteries is an extremely rare occurrence in a 59-year-old man with no previous psychiatric history.

He thus challenges a view of the role of reason in action that {{can be traced back to}} David Hume, and is widely assumed to be correct, not only by philosophers but also by economists. In defending his view, Parfit argues that if there are no objective normative truths, nihilism follows, and nothing matters. He criticizes, often forcefully, many leading contemporary philosophers working on the nature of ethics, including Simon Blackburn, Stephen Darwall, Allen Gibbard, Frank Jackson, Peter Railton, Mark Schroeder, Michael Smith, and Sharon Street. Does Anything Really Matter? gives these philosophers an opportunity to respond to Parfit's criticisms, and includes essays on Parfit's views by Richard Chappell, Andrew Huddleston, Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek and Peter Singer, Bruce Russell, and Larry Temkin. <b>A</b> <b>third</b> volume <b>of</b> On <b>What</b> Matters, in which Parfit engages with his critics and breaks new ground in finding significant agreement between his own views and theirs, is appearing as a separate companion volume...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the article is to examine some of the discussions regarding performative arts (i. e. theatre) in Germany and the Baltic provinces in the 18 th century and to add theological-philosophical marginalia to those discussions. In the light of selected texts answers are sought for two main questions: 1) what place does sanctioned artistic activity have in the theological and intellectual atmosphaere in Germany? Does it largely coincide with social or religious goals like in the Middle Ages, or does it have some different purpose that is not overlapping with those of society or religion? 2) What benefit does society derive from artistic activity? In 18 th-century Germany, such issues were discussed in all the circles of society (ecclesiastic, artistic, educational, economic, etc.) thereby establishing a basis for aesthetics as a discipline related to art theory. If, in the early 18 th century, the German philosophers dealt with art historically or as subjected to other disciplines then {{by the end of}} the century, the arts had become independent. Current article traces through some discussions the arguments which were used in the conflicts regading the place of theatre in the society, and what expectations and assumptionsaccompanied these arguments. The authors have also sought a clearer understanding of the placement of theatre on the scale of beneficial- useless- harmful, based on the aims (related to society or religion) that have been stated by the proponents or assumed by default. The question’s broader background includes an interest in how the reputation of theatre is connected to the goals assigned to it and how the corresponding trends compare with the reputation of religion in society. In the examples included in the article, the assessment of any artisticactivity is closely related to <b>what</b> the goal <b>of</b> art was thought to be and to what extent this goal was thought to conform to religious and/ or social goals. The article notices that those authors who took art most seriously, were the ones who saw it as a part of a whole. It is possible to distinguish between two groups of such authors: one for whom the goal of art was identical or similar with the goals aspired by religion or society and the other who saw theatrical performances as generally harmful or wasteful activity for society and thus dangerous. There emerges also <b>a</b> <b>third</b> group <b>of</b> authors <b>what</b> tends to regard theatre as (relatively) harmless, but at the same time accepts the limited usefulness of theatre for society and religion and accordingly theatre is often perceived as (mere) entertainment...|$|R

'I {{have other}} designs,' replied {{the object of}} all this moral indignation, looking with {{insulting}} indifference on the Cynic's repulsive countenance, 'which, from their immense importance to the world, must meet with universal approval. The labour that I have just achieved forms {{one of a series}} of three projects which I have for some time held in contemplation. The first is an analysis of the new priesthood; the second, a true personification, both by painting and sculpture, <b>of</b> Venus; the <b>third,</b> <b>a</b> discovery <b>of</b> <b>what</b> has been hitherto uninvented--a nightingale sauce. By the inscrutable wisdom of Fate, it has been so willed that the last of the objects I proposed to myself has been the first attained. The sauce is composed, and I have just concluded on this vellum the ode that is to introduce it at my table. The analysation will be my next labour. It will take the form of a treatise, in which, making the experience of past years the groundwork of prophecy for the future, I shall show the precise number of additional dissensions, controversies, and quarrels that will be required to enable the new priesthood to be themselves the destroyers of their own worship. I shall ascertain by an exact computation the year in which this destruction will be consummated; and I have by me as the materials for my work an historical summary of Christian schisms and disputes in Rome for the last hundred years. As for my second design, the personification of Venus, it is of appalling difficulty. It demands an investigation of the women of every nation under the sun; a comparison of the relative excellences and peculiarities of their several charms; and a combination of all that is loveliest in the infinite variety of their most prominent attractions, under one form. To forward the execution of this arduous project, my tenants at home and my slave-merchants abroad have orders to send to my villa in Sicily all women who are born most beautiful in the Empire, or can be brought most beautiful from the nations around. I will have them displayed before me, of every shade in complexion and of every peculiarity in form! At the fitting period I shall commence my investigations, undismayed by difficulty, and determined on success. Never yet has the true Venus been personified! Should I accomplish the task, how exquisite will be my triumph! My work will be the altar at which thousands will offer up the softest emotions of the heart. It will free the prisoned imagination of youth, and freshen the fading recollections on the memory of age!' ...|$|R
