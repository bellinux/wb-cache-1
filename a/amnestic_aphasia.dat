40|$|In {{this study}} {{long-term}} observation of 12 patients with aphasia secondary to severe closed head trauma took place. The most frequent symptoms were <b>amnestic</b> <b>aphasia</b> and verbal paraphasia. Only one {{patient with a}} constant slow wave EEG focus in the dominant hemisphere had severe receptive symptoms. In all other patients the aphasia recovered rather well, though not totally, but the presence and degree of concomitant neuropsychological disorders were most important for the final outcome...|$|E
40|$|A case of {{paroxysmal}} aphasia is reported. Aphasic spells occurred, in this patient, without modification in {{consciousness and}} without involvement of behaviors others than {{those related to}} oral and written speech and language. Longer spells successively recapitulated the clinical pictures of global, Wernicke's. conduction, and <b>amnestic</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Besides aphasiological evaluations, neurological, psychometrical, electroencephalographical, and CT-scan documents were obtained. The discussion bears on four main points : the linguistic characteristics of paroxysmal aphasia as compared to those of aphasias of other etiologies; Pierre Marie's oneness doctrine of aphasia; the mutual relationships of language and thought (in aphasia); the affective experience lived by one with severe aphasia, with special reference {{to the notion of}} anosognosia...|$|E
40|$|Association test (Miura), coin-cup test, hand-eye-ear {{test and}} mental {{calculation}} test {{were performed on}} 50 -year old right-handed male patient who developed the disease with head injury as a turning point and who presented Wernicke's aphasia, <b>amnestic</b> <b>aphasia</b> and Gerstmann's syndrome, and observations were made on {{the course of the}} time required. The time required is prolonged with a fixed cycle to be followed by another normal response; while repeating this, the patient gets tired eventually to give up the test. This may be understood easily if concepts used in physiology such as prolongation of exacitation, refractory period and recovery period are intraduced. Such a change in the mental work ability being ”Gestaltwandel” (Conrad) should be taken note of as a means for elucidation of aphasia...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral {{events are}} recognized, {{although}} infrequent, complications of cardiac catheterization. We report on an exceptional {{case of a}} posterior cerebral circulation syndrome comprising a confusional state, <b>amnestic</b> disturbances, <b>aphasia,</b> and cortical blindness, accompanied by life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia after left and right internal mammary artery graft angiography, with complete recovery over 5 days. The diagnostic potential of computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and SPECT imaging of the brain in diagnosing this rare but important complication is illustrated. The need for early continuous monitoring of patients with clinically important cerebrovascular events postangiography is emphasized. Cathet. Cardiovasc.

40|$|Background: Research {{data on the}} {{compensatory}} {{mechanisms in}} patients with stroke sequelae that have been accumulated within the last years, allows for reconsideration of conventional techniques to restore aphasia. Aim: To increase efficacy of the logopedic rehabilitation of patients with sequelae of the local posterior cortical lesions of the brain. Materials and methods: Two hundred and eighty six patients with aphatic speech disorders during the early and late restorative periods of stroke participated in the study. The presence of aphasia caused by suppressed functioning of the posterior cortical areas was confirmed {{by the results of}} neurologic and logopedic assessments using the method of speech assessment in aphasia (L. S. Tsvetkova et al., 1981). Depending on the type of aphasia, the patients were divided in the groups as follows: 1) those with acoustic + gnostic aphasia (middle temporal gyrus); 2) those with acoustic + <b>amnestic</b> <b>aphasia</b> (upper temporal gyrus); 3) those with semantic aphasia (parietal – temporal – occipital areas). All patients underwent a course of logopedic rehabilitation aimed at restoration of the speech thinking. Results: Until now, there was no technique for restoration of acoustic + amnestic and semantic types of aphasia with severe speech impairment. We have developed and implemented modified restoration methods for patients with posterior types of aphasia that increased the efficacy of rehabilitation. An improvement was seen in 61 % of patients with severe aphasia, in 68 % of those with moderate degree of aphasia and in 90 % of patients with mild aphasia. Conclusion: The clue for achievement of very good results of speech thinking restoration was the consideration of the mechanisms of speech impairment and compensatory processes in patients with the stroke sequela...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{follow up}} of aphasic {{disorders}} {{in patients with}} acute ischemic stroke is of great importance because of its prognostic value for their future recovery. The purpose of that clinical study is to compare the type of aphasia with the CT data about the infarction localization and to evaluate the prospective aphasia recovery. In the clinical study were included 37 patients with ischemic stroke and aphasia, theated in II-nd Neurology Clinic, Medical University Pleven. The diagnosis ischemic stroke was confirmed by clinical and CT investigations. Partial and full recovery of sensory aphasia was registered in all the patients with total aphasia, while motor aphasia showed little tendency of reduction in acute ischemic stroke. Aphasic disorders were more severe in cases with ischemic infarctions localized in the specific anatomical regions responsible for the speech function. The dynamic follow up of aphasic disorders has prognostic value for the speech recovery. Better prognosis show sensory and <b>amnestic</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Lesion localization also influences the prognosis. Key words: ischemic infarction, aphasia, prognosis The dynamic follow up of aphasic disorders in patients with acute ischemic stroke is very important because of its prognostic value for their future recovery. The purpose of that clinical study is to compare the type of aphasia and its severity in the acute stage of ischem-ic stroke with the CT data about the infarction localization and to evaluate the prospective aphasia recovery. MATERIAL AND METHODS 37 patients with ischemic stroke and aphasia were in-cluded in the clinical study (23 males and 14 females) from 52 to 88 years old, treated in II-nd Neurologic Clinic, Uni-versity Hospital Pleven for the period from September 2003 till June 2004. The patients were admitted on the 1 st- 3 rd day of the onset and were treated till the 14 -th- 18 -th day. The diagno-sis ischemic stroke was confirmed by clinical and CT exam-ination...|$|E
40|$|One way to {{investigate}} the neuronal underpinnings of language competence is to correlate patholinguistic profiles of aphasic patients to corresponding lesion sites. Constituting the beginnings of aphasiology and neurolinguistics over a century ago, this approach has been revived and refined {{in the past decade}} by statistical approaches mapping continuous variables (providing metrics that are not simply categorical) on voxel-wise lesion information (voxel-based lesion–symptom mapping). Here we investigate whether and how voxel-based lesion–symptom mapping allows us to delineate specific lesion patterns for differ- entially fine-grained clinical classifications. The latter encompass ‘classical’ syndrome-based approaches (e. g. Broca’s aphasia), more symptom-oriented descriptions (e. g. agrammatism) and further refinement to linguistic sub-functions (e. g. lexico-semantic deficits for inanimate versus animate items). From a large database of patients treated for aphasia of different aetiologies (n= 1167) a carefully selected group of 102 first ever ischaemic stroke patients with chronic aphasia (; 12 months) were included in a VLSM analysis. Specifically, we investigated how performance in the Aachen Aphasia Test—the standard clinical test battery for chronic aphasia in German—relates to distinct brain lesions. The Aachen Aphasia Test evaluates aphasia on different levels: a non-parametric discriminant procedure yields probabilities for the allocation to one of the four ‘standard’ syndromes (Broca, Wernicke, global and <b>amnestic</b> <b>aphasia),</b> whereas standardized subtests target linguistic modalities (e. g. repe- tition), or even more specific symptoms (e. g. phoneme repetition). Because some subtests of the Aachen Aphasia Test (e. g. for the linguistic level of lexico-semantics) rely on rather coarse and heterogeneous test items we complemented the analysis with a number of more detailed clinically used tests in selected mostly mildly affected subgroups of patients. Our results indicate that: (i) Aachen Aphasia Test-based syndrome allocation allows for an unexpectedly concise differentiation between ‘Broca’s’ and ‘Wernicke’s’ aphasia corresponding to non-overlapping anterior and posterior lesion sites; whereas (ii) analyses for modalities and specific symptoms yielded more circumscribed but partially overlapping lesion foci, often cutting across the above syndrome territories; and (iii) especially for lexico-semantic capacities more specialized clinical test-batteries are required to delineate precise lesion patterns at this linguistic level. In sum this is the first report on a successful lesion-delineation of syndrome-based aphasia classification highlighting the relevance of vascular distribution for the syndrome level while confirming and extending a number of more linguistically motivated differentiations, based on clinically used tests. We consider such a comprehensive view reaching from the syndrome to a fine-grained symptom-oriented assessment mandatory to converge neurolinguistic, patholin- guistic and clinical-therapeutic knowledge on language-competence and impairment...|$|E
40|$|The at {{the time}} famous but now {{practically}} for- gotten controversy between the psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger (1881 – 1966) and the neurologist and neuropathologist Fritz Lotmar (1878 – 1964) about the concept of aphasic disorders dragged on – with a few interruptions – {{over a period of}} more than 30 years. This controversial issue was dealt with mainly in the journal Swiss Archives of Neurology and Psychiatry and at meetings of the Swiss Neurological and Psychiatric Society. Furthermore, the dispute triggered off an exchange of letters between Binswanger and Lotmar; this correspondence is evaluated here for the first time. The specific point of dispute was the extent and degree to which <b>amnestic</b> <b>aphasia</b> (aphasic anomia) can lead to a change in the patient’s overall personality and thus, in a broader context, became a controversial question concerning the subject- object split of mind and brain. Binswanger did not consider amnesic-aphasic performance impairments as primarily linguistic anomia but rather as changes in the total per- sonality, in the overall function of the brain. For Lotmar, however, aphasic disorders were purely a matter of brain pathology, strictly localist and primarily explainable as linguistic. Binswanger, approaching the problem {{from the perspective of a}} new “holism”, sought to overcome the subject- object split. Lotmar, however, espousing the view that in aphasias no intelligence disorder is present, attempted to further develop the classical aphasia doctrine; to this end he utilised the dissection of speech into its constituent parts and their localisation in distinct areas of the brain. The controversy between Binswanger and Lotmar concerning the concept of aphasic disorders can be understood within the broader context of the body-mind problem, the question of the relationship between body and soul, and can also be regarded as a continuation of the famous debate between Pierre Marie and Jules Dejerine about the classical doc- trine of aphasia. In the background of this discussion are two processes whose intense interrelationship affects us even today: on the one hand, the establishment of scientific medicine as a primarily body-oriented discipline, the position represented by Lotmar; on the other hand, the opposite process propagated by Binswanger, entailing a rediscovery of the “mental-spiritual” connection that, inter alia, is associated with the development of modern psychotherapeutic and psychosomatic medicine and, above all, with the name Sigmund Freud. Which interpretation of aphasia doctrine might ultimately prevail – according to Minkowski in the discussion following Lotmar’s lecture on “Newer Conflicts Concerning the Concept of Aphasic Disorders” 1935 – will be revealed by the history of science. After the contentual dismantlement of classical doctrine begun by Marie was continued until the Second World War, the work of Norman Geschwind in the sixties resulted in the recurrence of an anatomically based, and also by Lotmar advocated, connectionistic aphasia doctrine, one which was assumed would become the dominant paradigm for the remainder of the century. Despite Binswanger’s improved work environment and the justified criticism of Lotmar’s overly rigorous separation of physis (organism) and psyche, Lotmar’s position on aphasia doctrine, which was primarily body orient- ed, mostly prevailed. However, through the use of new imaging procedures (positron emission tomography) the body-mind problem has attained renewed relevance in that attempts are now being made to locate psychic processes neurologically...|$|E
