5|$|The Mount Washington Observatory {{was built}} on the summit in 1932 through a group {{interested}} in and noting the worth of a research facility at that demanding location. The observatory's weather data have accumulated a climate record since. Temperature and humidity readings have been collected using <b>a</b> <b>sling</b> psychrometer, a simple device containing two mercury thermometers. Where most unstaffed weather stations have undergone technology upgrades, consistent use of the sling psychrometer has helped provide scientific precision to the Mount Washington climate record.|$|E
5|$|The pony is {{typically}} a 2- to 5-litre cylinder. Its capacity determines {{the depth of}} dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection. Ponies may be fixed to the diver's buoyancy compensator (BC) or main cylinder behind the diver's back, or can be clipped to the harness at the diver's side or chest or carried as <b>a</b> <b>sling</b> cylinder. Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but require that the diver is trained to use them.|$|E
5|$|After the meal, Starling {{tries to}} attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She {{handcuffs}} his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, his arm in <b>a</b> <b>sling.</b> As he prepares to eat his meal, including what {{is assumed to be}} part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then assents.|$|E

25|$|Whereas sling-bullets {{are common}} finds in the archaeological record, slings {{themselves}} are rare. This is both because <b>a</b> <b>sling's</b> materials are biodegradable and because slings were lower-status weapons, rarely preserved in a wealthy person’s grave.|$|R
5|$|The P90 can {{be fitted}} with <b>a</b> <b>sling</b> for greater ease of carry, {{and since the}} weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a {{collapsing}} or folding stock), it can be quickly deployed when needed. The weapon's smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter's clothing or equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at {{the front end of}} the weapon's frame to prevent the shooter's hand from accidentally slipping in front of the muzzle while shooting. A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frame—accessed by removing the buttplate—allows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.|$|E
5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as <b>a</b> <b>sling</b> or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{appears in}} the film's DVD version. After Captain Michaels (the Ark 4 captain) announces that they are heading for the Cape of Good Hope, Adrian receives a phone call. He answers the call, and is shocked to recognize the voice as his father's (Harry). Harry tells Adrian that he, his friend Tony (whose left arm is in <b>a</b> <b>sling)</b> and several others survived the megatsunami and are shipwrecked on an island. Adrian informs Captain Michaels of this and the Ark heads for them. Kate thanks Laura {{for taking care of}} Lilly, and Laura tells Jackson that she enjoyed his book. Jackson returns Noah's cell phone, which he recovered during the Ark 4 flood. Lilly says that she sees an island, and the ark finds the shipwrecked cruise ship Genesis and her survivors on a beach.|$|E

40|$|There is {{currently}} little evidence available to guide sur-geons on {{the management of}} a patient with <b>a</b> failed midurethral <b>sling.</b> 1 The reported results by Walsh and colleagues suggest <b>a</b> pubovaginal <b>sling</b> is effective at treat-ing stress incontinence after <b>a</b> failed midurethral <b>sling.</b> 2 In our cohort of patients, 3 16 / 33 had <b>a</b> previous midurethral <b>sling,</b> and half of these had experienced a vaginal or urethral erosion. The subset of patients who had recurrent incon-tinence after <b>a</b> previous midurethral <b>sling</b> showed <b>a</b> trend towards better outcomes compared patients undergoing <b>a</b> pubovaginal <b>sling</b> for other reasons, (median 0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0 - 3) versus median 3 (IQR: 1 - 5) pads per day, p = 0. 12). The management of patients who have failed <b>a</b> midure-thral <b>sling</b> or suffered significant complications from one {{will continue to be}} challenging. The autologous fascia pubo-vaginal sling continues to have a role in the management of patients with complex stress incontinence. References 1. Gormley EA.

5|$|As an {{implement}} {{of war and}} hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as <b>a</b> <b>sling</b> to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his arm in <b>a</b> <b>sling.</b> While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and he made up for his size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of the six}} {{missing women}} and Sparks's brutal beating {{appeared}} prominently in newspapers and on television throughout Washington and Oregon. Fear spread among the population; hitchhiking by young women dropped sharply. While pressure mounted on law enforcement agencies, the paucity of physical evidence severely hampered them. Police could not provide reporters with the little information that was available for fear of compromising the investigation. Further similarities between the victims were noted: The disappearances all took place at night, usually near ongoing construction work, {{within a week of}} midterm or final exams; all of the victims were wearing slacks or blue jeans; and at most crime scenes, there were sightings of a man wearing a cast or <b>a</b> <b>sling,</b> and driving a brown or tan Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E

5|$|The P90 has {{provisions}} for mounting {{a number of}} different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. <b>A</b> <b>sling</b> can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, or it can be fitted with various sound suppressors such as the Gemtech SP90, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with FN Herstal. This stainless steel suppressor with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance. It has a length of 184mm (7.2in), a diameter of 35mm (1.4in) and a weight of 680 g (1.5lb). When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the suppressor, it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33dB. A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which fits over the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; the pouch will collect up to one hundred cases before filling.|$|E
5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, <b>a</b> <b>sling</b> suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E
