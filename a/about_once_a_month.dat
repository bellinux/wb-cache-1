40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{widowhood}} {{have focused on}} reactions {{during the first few}} years postloss. The authors investigated whether widowhood had more enduring effects using a nationally representative U. S. sample. Participants were 768 individuals who had lost their spouse (from <b>a</b> few <b>months</b> to 64 years) prior to data collection. Results indicated that the widowed continued to talk, think, and feel emotions about their lost spouse decades later. Twenty years postloss, the widowed thought <b>about</b> their spouse <b>once</b> every week or 2 and had a conversation <b>about</b> their spouse <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> on average. <b>About</b> 12. 6 years postloss, the widowed reported feeling upset between sometimes and rarely when they thought about their spouse.

He had been pressed to come to the Vicarage, but had come but seldom, waiting patiently till the time should come when he might again ask Mary to be his wife. He was not so gloomy as he had been during the time the engagement had lasted, but still he was a man much altered from his former self. Now he came across the road, and spoke a word or two to his friend. [...] "If I were you, Frank, I should not think so much about it." ...|$|R

As part of his role in coordinating the electromagnetic process, Fidler occasionally visited Chicago, which was more convenient for contractors like Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis Chalmers; Boston, where the offices of Stone & Webster, the main engineering contractor were located; and the production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He attained the rank of major. After World War II ended in August 1945, Fidler was transferred to Tennessee, where he worked on the declassification of Manhattan Project documents.
