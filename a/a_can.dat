5|$|After {{donating}} {{money to}} public television, Marge receives complimentary ballet tickets. She asks Homer to accompany her, {{and much to}} Marge's surprise he agrees, confusing ballet with a circus. On {{the day of the}} ballet, however, he inadvertently gets his arm stuck in a vending machine while trying to steal <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of soda from it and then gets his other arm stuck in a candy machine, and so is unable to attend the ballet. In disbelief about Homer's story, Marge invites her neighbor, Ruth Powers to attend with her. They both enjoy themselves and arrange to go out again the next night. Marge and Ruth's friendship annoys Homer, who feels Marge should be spending time with him instead. However, ignoring Homer's protests, Marge and Ruth visit bars and clubs in Springfield, and Ruth later shows Marge how to use a pistol.|$|E
5|$|An allocator, A, for {{objects of}} type T {{must have a}} member {{function}} with the signature A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n objects of type T; only the memory is allocated, and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional pointer argument (that points to an object already allocated by <b>A)</b> <b>can</b> {{be used as a}} hint to the implementation about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality. However, the implementation is free to ignore the argument.|$|E

After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>canned</b> {{cycle is}} <b>a</b> way of {{conveniently}} performing repetitive CNC machine operations. Canned cycles automate certain machining {{functions such as}} drilling, boring, threading, pocketing, etc... Canned cycles are so called because they allow a concise way to program a machine to produce a feature of <b>a</b> part. <b>A</b> <b>canned</b> cycle {{is also known as}} a fixed cycle. <b>A</b> <b>canned</b> cycle is usually permanently stored as a pre-program in the machine's controller and cannot be altered by the user.|$|R

5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body {{can catch up}} with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event <b>A</b> <b>can</b> reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Guinness {{introduced}} the beer widget, a nitrogen-pressurised ball inside <b>a</b> <b>can</b> which creates a dense, tight head, similar to beer served from a nitrogen system.

Marge decides to purge Springfield of cola trucks, but in spite of her efforts, the drink still maintains its popularity.|$|E

5|$|Pepsiman is {{an action}} game that {{consists}} of four stages, each divided into smaller segments, and each involving the superhero Pepsiman saving {{a person who is}} in need of a drink, such as a military man {{in the middle of a}} desert, by giving them <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of Pepsi. The stages are all based on real locations, such as San Francisco and New York City. The game is played from a third-person perspective, with Pepsiman automatically running forwards through the stage, sometimes running through people's living rooms. The player aims to dodge obstacles, such as cars, construction cranes, and people, as well as Pepsi-branded obstacles, including a Pepsi truck. The player does this by using four different moves: running, dashing, jumping, and super-jumping. The player gains points by collecting Pepsi cans.|$|E

Mulder faces his phobia {{and is able to}} save the Marsden children. Scully holds L'Ively at gunpoint, but is forced to hold her fire when L'Ively informs her of the rocket fuel he has painted on the house. However, Green throws <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of rocket fuel in his face, causing him to lose control and set himself alight outside.|$|E

They also found credit cards belonging to Sheila Damude and Gerard Lowe. In addition, police found Simon Davis' birth certificate, and items that Martin had used to immobilise and kill: a hammer weighing 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb), a battery-operated Z-Force III electroshock weapon, <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of mace, two pairs of handcuffs, a pair of thumbcuffs, two Police brand foldable knives, an oilstone and two Swiss army knives.

5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol <b>A</b> <b>can</b> be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
5|$|Wes grabs <b>a</b> <b>can</b> of {{gasoline}} and pours a trail from the Jeep to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear to it and then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes {{on the ground to}} fool the Bear. While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E
