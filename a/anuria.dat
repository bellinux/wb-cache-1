25|$|<b>Anuria</b> {{refers to}} absent or almost absent urine output.|$|E
25|$|Mannitol is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with <b>anuria,</b> congestive heart failure, and active cerebral haemorrhage (except during craniotomy).|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} is guarded in any dog developing symptoms of toxicosis. A negative prognosis {{has been associated}} with oliguria or <b>anuria,</b> weakness, difficulty walking, and severe hypercalcemia (increased blood calcium levels).|$|E
25|$|The {{consumption}} of grapes and raisins presents a potential health threat to dogs. Their toxicity to dogs {{can cause the}} animal to develop acute renal failure (the sudden development of kidney failure) with <b>anuria</b> (a lack of urine production) and may be fatal.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone may rarely {{cause more}} severe side effects such as anaphylaxis, renal failure, {{hepatitis}} (two reported cases, neither serious), agranulocytosis, DRESS syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Five cases {{of breast cancer}} in patients who took spironolactone for prolonged periods of time have been reported. It should also be used with caution in people with some neurological disorders, <b>anuria,</b> acute kidney injury, or significant impairment of renal excretory function with risk of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Average urine {{production}} in adult humans is around 1.4 L of urine {{per person per}} day with a normal range of 0.6 to 2.6 L {{per person per day}}, produced in around 6 to 8 urinations per day depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing {{too much or too little}} urine needs medical attention. Polyuria is a condition of excessive production of urine (> 2.5 L/day), oliguria when < 400 mL are produced, and <b>anuria</b> one of < 100 mL per day.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} {{dangerous}} systemic symptoms, hemorrhage and coagulation defects {{are the most}} striking. Hematemesis, melena, hemoptysis, hematuria and epistaxis also occur and may lead to hypovolemic shock. Almost all patients develop oliguria or <b>anuria</b> {{within a few hours}} to as late as 6 days post bite. In some cases, kidney dialysis is necessary due to acute renal failure (ARF), but this is not often caused by hypotension. It is more often the result of intravascular hemolysis, which occurs in about half of all cases. In other cases, ARF is often caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation.|$|E
2500|$|Failure: Three-fold {{increase}} in the serum creatinine, or GFR decrease by 75 percent, or urine output of <0.3 mL/kg per hour for 24 hours, or no urine output (<b>anuria)</b> for 12 hours ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{consumption}} of grapes and raisins presents a potential health threat to dogs. [...] Their toxicity to dogs {{can cause the}} animal to develop acute kidney injury (the sudden development of kidney failure) with <b>anuria</b> (a lack of urine production). [...] The phenomenon was first identified by the Animal Poison Control Center (APCC), run by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). [...] Approximately 140 cases were seen by the APCC in the one year from April 2003 to April 2004, with 50 developing symptoms and seven dying.|$|E
2500|$|Emesis (induction of vomiting) is the {{generally}} recommended treatment if a dog has eaten grapes or raisins {{within the past}} two hours. A veterinarian may use an emetic such as [...] apomorphine to cause the dog to vomit. Further treatment may involve the use of activated charcoal to adsorb remaining toxins in the gastrointestinal tract and intravenous fluid therapy in the first 48 hours following ingestion to induce diuresis and help to prevent acute renal failure. Vomiting is treated with antiemetics and the stomach is protected from uremic gastritis (damage to the stomach from increased BUN) with H2 receptor antagonists. BUN, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium levels are closely monitored. Dialysis of the blood (hemodialysis) and peritoneal dialysis {{can be used to}} support the kidneys if <b>anuria</b> develops. Oliguria (decreased urine production) can be treated with dopamine or furosemide to stimulate urine production.|$|E
2500|$|The distal tubules of {{the kidneys}} secrete {{large amounts of}} uromucoid (Tamm–Horsfall protein). This is the {{dominant}} protein in normal urine and {{is thought to be}} important in preventing ascending urinary infections. It is a relatively small glycoprotein (80kDa) that aggregates into polymers of 20–30 molecules. It contains a short amino-acid sequence that can specifically bind to some free light chains. Together they can form an insoluble precipitate which [...] blocks the distal part of the nephrons. This is termed [...] "cast nephropathy" [...] or [...] "myeloma kidney" [...] and is typically found in patients with multiple myeloma. This can block the flow of urine causing the death of the respective nephrons. Rising concentrations of light chains are filtered by the remaining nephrons leading to a cycle of accelerating renal damage with rising concentrations of free light chains in the blood. At the same time, the amount of free light chains entering the urine will be decreased and will be zero if the patient stops producing urine (<b>anuria).</b> Conversely, urine concentrations of free light chains could increase if renal function improved in a multiple myeloma patient receiving treatment. This could account for the poor correlation frequently seen when urine and serum free light-chain concentrations are compared.|$|E
50|$|Amiloride is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with Addison's disease, hyperkalaemia, hyponatremia and <b>anuria.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Anuria</b> is {{clinically}} {{defined as}} less than 50mL urine output per day.|$|E
50|$|Mannitol is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with <b>anuria,</b> congestive heart failure, and active cerebral haemorrhage (except during craniotomy).|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{oliguria}} is <b>anuria,</b> {{which represents}} {{an absence of}} urine, clinically classified as below 80 or 100 ml/day.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms, {{less likely}} in chronic obstruction, are pain {{radiating}} to the T11 to T12 dermatomes, <b>anuria,</b> nocturia, or polyuria.|$|E
50|$|The {{presenting}} {{characteristics of}} DDS include loss of playfulness, decreased appetite, weight loss, growth delay, abnormal skeletal development, insomnia, abdominal pain, constipation, and <b>anuria.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Anuria,</b> {{sometimes}} called anuresis, is nonpassage of urine, in practice {{is defined as}} passage of less than 50 milliliters of urine in a day. <b>Anuria</b> is often caused by failure in the function of kidneys. It may also occur because of some severe obstruction like kidney stones or tumours. It may occur with end stage renal disease. It is a more extreme reduction than oliguria (hypouresis), with 100 mL/day being the conventional (albeit slightly arbitrary) cutoff point between the two.|$|E
50|$|The main {{symptoms}} of a hypercalcaemic crisis are oliguria or <b>anuria,</b> as well as somnolence or coma. After recognition, primary hyperparathyroidism should be proved or excluded.|$|E
50|$|The {{prognosis}} is guarded in any dog developing symptoms of toxicosis. A negative prognosis {{has been associated}} with oliguria or <b>anuria,</b> weakness, difficulty walking, and severe hypercalcemia (increased blood calcium levels).|$|E
5000|$|Failure: Three-fold {{increase}} in the serum creatinine, or GFR decrease by 75 percent, or urine output of <0.3 mL/kg per hour for 24 hours, or no urine output (<b>anuria)</b> for 12 hours ...|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of {{intoxication}} from overdose include drowsiness, insomnia, stupor, agitation, coma, transient confusion, increased anxiety, ataxia, convulsions, oliguria, <b>anuria,</b> tachycardia or bradycardia, arrhythmia, AV block, hypotension, shock, respiratory depression, and, rarely, cardiac arrest.|$|E
50|$|Labial fusion {{can lead}} to urinary tract infection, vulvar vestibulitis and {{inflammation}} caused by chronic urine exposure. In severe cases, labial adhesions can cause complete obstruction of the urethra, leading to <b>anuria</b> and urinary retention.|$|E
50|$|Long-term {{exposure}} to colchicine {{can lead to}} toxicity, particularly of the bone marrow, kidney, and nerves. Effects of long-term colchicine toxicity include agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, low white blood cell counts, aplastic anemia, alopecia, rash, purpura, vesicular dermatitis, kidney damage, <b>anuria,</b> peripheral neuropathy, and myopathy.|$|E
50|$|The {{consumption}} of grapes and raisins presents a potential health threat to dogs. Their toxicity to dogs {{can cause the}} animal to develop acute renal failure (the sudden development of kidney failure) with <b>anuria</b> (a lack of urine production) and may be fatal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anuria</b> {{itself is}} a symptom, not a disease. It is often {{associated}} with other symptoms of kidney failure, such as lack of appetite, weakness, nausea and vomiting. These are mostly the result of buildup of toxins in the blood which would normally be removed by healthy kidneys.|$|E
50|$|Mannitol is a {{medicine}} {{that is used}} {{to increase the amount of}} water removed from the blood and thus improve the blood flow to the kidneys. However, mannitol is contraindicated in <b>anuria</b> secondary to renal disease, severe dehydration, intracranial bleeding (except during craniotomy), severe pulmonary congestion, or pulmonary edema.|$|E
50|$|Second phase: In one {{to three}} days after {{ingestion}} (and dependent on dose ingested), patients develop metabolic acidosis, which causes acute kidney failure, oliguria, increasing serum creatinine concentrations, and later <b>anuria.</b> Other symptoms reported and secondary to acidosis and/or renal failure are: hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac dysrhythmia, pancreatitis, hyperkalemia or mild hyponatremia.|$|E
50|$|These {{patients}} may also demonstrate {{signs and symptoms}} of septic shock, such as tachycardia, hypotension, and <b>anuria.</b> Not surprisingly, these indicators of shock may be absent in elderly or immunocompromised patients or in those with diabetes. Patients should be asked if retching and vomiting occurred before the onset of pain.|$|E
50|$|Acute <b>anuria,</b> {{where the}} decline in urine {{production}} occurs quickly, is usually a sign of obstruction or acute renal failure. Acute renal failure {{can be caused by}} factors not related to the kidney, such as heart failure, mercury poisoning, infection, and other conditions that cause the kidney to be deprived of blood flow.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} {{hemolytic}} crises in this disease is unknown (mainly due to intravascular haemolysis). There is rapid and massive destruction of {{red blood cells}} resulting in hemoglobinemia (hemoglobin in the blood, but outside the red blood cells), hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in urine), intense jaundice, <b>anuria</b> (passing less than 50 milliliters of urine in a day), and finally death {{in the majority of}} cases.|$|E
50|$|Failure {{of kidney}} function, which can have {{multiple}} causes including medications or toxins (e.g., antifreeze, cephalosporins, ACEIs); diabetes; high blood pressure. Stones or tumours in the urinary tract {{can also cause}} it by creating an obstruction to urinary flow. High blood calcium, oxalate, or uric acid, {{can contribute to the}} risk of stone formation. In males, an enlarged prostate gland is a common cause of obstructive <b>anuria.</b>|$|E
50|$|Average urine {{production}} in adult humans is about 12 litres (L) per day, depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing {{too much or}} too little urine requires medical attention. Polyuria is a condition of excessive urine production (> 2.5 L/day). Oliguria when < 400 mL (millilitres) are produced, and <b>anuria</b> one of < 100 mL per day.|$|E
50|$|In Cape Town, South Africa, seven {{children}} developed vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, {{and died of}} renal failure after administration of over-the-counter sedatives. Soon, patients started to present <b>anuria,</b> acidic breathing, hepatomegaly, and unresponsiveness. Patients were treated with fluid hydration and correction of acidosis, but some {{were not able to}} survive. Postmortem examination revealed damage in the kidneys and liver, and laboratory testing found DEG instead of propylene glycol in the sedatives.|$|E
50|$|Most {{types of}} RPGN are {{characterized}} by severe and rapid loss of kidney function featuring severe hematuria (blood in the urine), red blood cell casts in the urine, and proteinuria (protein in the urine), sometimes exceeding 3 g protein/24 h, a range associated with nephrotic syndrome. Some patients also experience hypertension (high blood pressure) and edema. Severe disease is characterized by pronounced oliguria or <b>anuria,</b> which portends a poor prognosis.|$|E
50|$|Spironolactone may rarely {{cause more}} severe side effects such as anaphylaxis, renal failure, {{hepatitis}} (two reported cases, neither serious), agranulocytosis, DRESS syndrome, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Five cases {{of breast cancer}} in patients who took spironolactone for prolonged periods of time have been reported. It should also be used with caution in people with some neurological disorders, <b>anuria,</b> acute kidney injury, or significant impairment of renal excretory function with risk of hyperkalemia.|$|E
