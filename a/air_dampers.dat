Coal-laden air passes through double cone static classifiers, with adjustable classifier vanes, for segregation into pulverized fuel of the desired fineness, and coarse particles. The pulverised fuel continues its journey towards the coal burners for combustion. The coarse particles rejected in the classifier are returned to the mill for another cycle of grinding.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the rate}} of outdoor air (OA) {{ventilation}} has a substantial influence on building energy consumption and occupant health, the available data indicate the outdoor air ventilation rates are poorly controlled in many buildings. Technologies being marketed for real time measurement of the flow rates of outdoor air into HVAC systems should enable better control of OA ventilation. In laboratory research they have studied the performance of these technologies. Sources of measurement errors identified during conduct of this research include: low air speeds; high spatial variability in air speed and direction; large eddies downstream of outdoor air intake louvers; and backwards airflow through a portion of outdoor <b>air</b> <b>dampers.</b> Several suggestions for overcoming these sources of errors were developed including: design {{and control of the}} outdoor air intake system to avoid low, hard-to measure, air speeds; use of highly sensitive pressure and velocity sensors; measuring air speeds between blades of louvers, rather than downstream of louvers; smoothing out the airflow between the outdoor air louver and damper through proper louver selection and insertion of components to straighten air flow; and maintaining a pressure drop across the outdoor air damper that exceeds approximately 0. 04 IWG (10 Pa) ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new {{operating}} {{strategy for the}} outdoor, discharge, and recirculation <b>air</b> <b>dampers</b> of the economizer in VAV system, called split-signal damper control strategy. The strategy controls the outdoor air by only one damper while keeping the remaining dampers full open. The discharge or recirculation air damper is modulated to control the amount of outdoor air introduced into the system while keeping the two remaining dampers full open. Since at least two dampers are always kept fully open during the occupied times, the strategy can provide a minimum static pressure drop in economizer dampers and results in minimum energy use in return and supply fans. An additional advantage is that the proposed strategy prevents reverse airflow through the discharge air damper of a VAV system that uses a volume matching control strategy. The proposed strategy along with the existing strategies such as the three-coupled dampers used in most existing system and the two-coupled dampers are evaluated on an existing system using 1 -year long measured data set, along with an economizer damper model developed and validated in this paper.

40|$|Most air {{handling}} units (AHUs) in commercial buildings have an air economizer cycle for free cooling under certain outside air conditions. During the economizer cycle, the outside air and return <b>air</b> <b>dampers</b> are modulated to seek mixing air temperature at supply air temperature setpoint. Mechanical cooling is always required when outside air temperature {{is higher than the}} supply air temperature setpoint. Generally the supply air temperature setpoint is set at 55 ?F for space humidity control. Actually the dehumidification is not necessary when outside air dew point is less than 55 ?F. Meanwhile the space may have less cooling load due to envelope heat loss and/or occupant schedule. These provide an opportunity to use higher supply air temperature to reduce or eliminate mechanical cooling and terminal box reheat. On the other hand the higher supply air temperature will require higher air flow as well as higher fan power. Therefore the supply air temperature has to be optimized to minimize the combined energy for fan, cooling and heating energy. In this paper a simple energy consumption model is established for AHU systems during the economizer and then a optimal supply air temperature control is developed to minimize the total cost of the mechanical cooling and the fan motor power.

40|$|The Building America {{program has}} been working with home {{builders}} {{for more than a decade}} using a variety of strategies for bringing fresh air into the homes. Many of these strategies utilize the central air handler fan from the HVAC system to ventilate when the system runs.

EnergyGauge USA, a detailed hourly residential simulation program, has been modified to simulate the various runtime strategies, as well as supply- or exhaust-only ventilation strategies and an enthalpy recovery ventilation system.

When forced to turn on for 25 % of an hour, the typical HVAC fan uses significant energy making the overall energy penalty more than that from a continuous supply or exhaust fan supplying the same nominal air flow. Enthalpy recovery ventilation units tend to use more energy overall - despite the heat recovery - than supply or exhaust only ventilation systems, due to using twice as much fan energy.

Furthermore, {{it is well known that}} the physical design and operational quality of the power-take off (PTO) used on the small scale model can have vast effects on the tank testing results. Passive mechanical elements such as friction brakes and <b>air</b> <b>dampers</b> or oil filled dashpots are fraught with nonlinear behaviors such as static friction, temperature dependency, and backlash, the effects of which propagate into the wave energy converter (WEC) power production data, causing very high uncertainty in the extrapolation of the tank test results to the meaningful full ocean scale. The lack of quality in PTO simulators is an identified barrier to the development of WECs worldwide. A solution to this problem is to use actively controlled actuators for PTO simulation on small scale model wave energy converters. This can be done using force (or torque) -controlled feedback systems with suitable instrumentation, enabling the PTO to exert any desired time and/or state dependent reaction force. In this paper, two working experimental PTO simulators on two different wave energy converters are described.

An efficient and accurate steady-state model of extended surface, air cooling and dehumidifying chilled-water coil is used to obtain a new and accurate off-design latent heat transfer performance correlation. Algorithms for efficient calculation of coil latent loads for constant air volume, dual-duct/multi-zone and variable air volume systems are presented.

40|$|The {{naturally}} ventilated, three storey School of Arts Jarman Building provides two dance studios, {{an exhibition}} gallery, teaching rooms, video editing suites and offices. The main dance studio is double-height, has underfloor heating and accommodates sixty people. Fresh air enters from low level perimeter louvres and exits at high level through a stack that rises through the third storey to a stack terminal with motorized louvres. Tracer gas (CO 2) measurements {{were used to}} measure the ventilation rate in conjunction with hot-wire anemometry in the stack tower. The results showed that when all air inlet and exit louvres were set to closed, the residual air flow up the stack was 0. 33 m 3 /s representing a potential heat loss of 9 kW in winter at 0 °C outside. When the louvres were all open, the air flow increased to between 0. 49 and 0. 62 m 3 /s, a level consistent with the studio’s design occupancy. It was found that the studio’s 4 m high perimeter curtains represent a barrier to fresh air entering the main room space and cause the incoming air to migrate upwards towards the stack exit and effectively bypass {{the central part of the}} studio. Tracer gas decay rates showed that the main space experienced an air exchange rate 50 % less than that for the overall studio. An investigation of the controls also revealed that the underfloor heating system operated independently of the control of the stack ventilation system, leading to simultaneous heating and venting. The research shows the vital importance of prescribing contractually that key controls are integrated, that fresh <b>air</b> <b>dampers</b> are well-sealed when closed, and the importance of designing a fresh air supply that matches the way a space is used...|$|E
40|$|Document {{describes}} an onsite workshop and building retuning training conducted in Guam in August 2010. Document reports on issues identified during an audit of several buildings and recommendations {{to save energy}} throughout the site. During the workshop, {{it became apparent that}} as site personnel maintain the facilities at Guam, the following retuning efforts and strategies should be prioritized: (1) Controlling the mechanical systems operational hours and zone temperature set points appeared to present the best opportunities for savings; (2) Zone temperature set points in some buildings are excessively low, especially at night, when the zone temperatures are so cold that they approached the dewpoint; and (3) Manually-set outside <b>air</b> <b>dampers</b> are providing excessive outside air, especially for spaces that are unoccupied. Two of the larger schools, one on the Naval Base and one on Anderson AFB, are in need of a significant recommissioning effort. These facilities are relatively new, with direct digital controls (DDC) but are significantly out of balance. The pressure in one school is extremely negative, which is pulling humid air through the facility each time a door is opened. The draft can be felt several feet down the halls. The pressure in the other school is extremely positive relative to the outside, and you can stand 20 -feet outside and still feel cool drafts of air exiting the building. It is recommended that humidity sensors be installed in all new projects and retrofitted into exist facilities. In this humid climate, control of humidity is very important. There are significant periods of time when the mechanical systems in many buildings can be unloaded and dehumidification is not required. The use of CO{sub 2 } sensors should also be considered in representative areas. CO{sub 2 } sensors determine whether spaces are occupied so that fresh air is only brought into the space when needed. By reducing the amount of outside air brought into the space, the humidity load is also substantially reduced. CO{sub 2 } and humidity sensors, combined with outside air sensors, can be used to predict whether conditions are amenable to mold growth and to automatically adjust systems to help prevent mold without using extra energy. The goal of this training is to give the building operators the knowledge needed to make positive changes in the operation of building systems. As class participants apply this knowledge, building systems will run more efficiently, occupant comfort should improve, while saving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions...|$|E

This research aims to experimentally verify the mathematical model for the damper type with non-cascading blades. Four different types of dampers with non-cascading blades were considered: single blade dampers, dampers with two cross-blades, dampers with two parallel blades and dampers with two blades of which one is a fixed blade in the horizontal position. The case of a damper with a straight pipeline positioned in front of and behind the damper was taken in consideration. Calibration and verification of the mathematical model was conducted experimentally.

40|$|Living in {{a country}} with one of the highest {{population}} densities in Europe (such as Belgium), raises the chance of an individual being confronted with one or more externalities (OECD Environmental Performance Reviews Belgium, 2007). Externalities are by definition experienced by other people than the ones causing them as a side-effect of their production or consumption. Moreover, the cost of these externalities is typically not accounted for in the price of the good nor in the production cost (for a more formal definition see Laffont, 1987). These externalities can be positive or negative. An example of a negative externality is for instance a production plant which might cause odor nuisance to the surrounding neighbors of the plant. When the neighbors are not compensated for this hindrance and the plant owners do not invest in abatement, the odor {{can be seen as a}} negative externality from producing the goods. Governments will try to determine whether mitigation of the negative externality is economically worthwhile. Usually, a policy evaluation based on, for instance, a cost benefit analysis will thus be conducted. However, negative externalities such as noise or odor are not traded on a market, hence there is no market price available. Therefore, monetary estimates of the benefits associated with a reduction in negative externalities are hard to come by. Luckily, the existing non-market valuation methods may offer some relief. Currently, the two most popular valuation methods are the hedonic price (i. e. HP) method and the choice experiments (i. e. CE) (Hanley, Wright, & Adamowicz, 1998; Carson & Louviere, 2011). While the hedonic price technique is a revealed preference method, the choice experiments belong to the stated preference group of methods. The revealed preference methods, and in particular, the HP method (Rosen, 1974), are believed to be more reliable methods because they are based on actual behavior of economic agents (see for instance Theebe, 2004; Nelson, 2008). This technique assumes that a differentiated product such as a house can be described by a vector of characteristics (surface, age, number of bathrooms, etc.). The amount of hindrance is then introduced as one of the characteristics. The hedonic price schedule, that is the equilibrium price of a house, is assumed to be a function of its house characteristics. A utility maximizing consumer will choose a level of a characteristic such that the marginal utility derived from that characteristic equals its marginal price. Thus, observing the price allows us to estimate the marginal willingness to pay for reductions in hindrance. This latter is only true when all assumptions hold. One important assumption for instance is that the housing market should be in a state of equilibrium. More information on these specific assumptions can (for instance) be found in Bateman et al. (2001) and Palmquist (2005). Nevertheless, even if these assumptions hold, this method has its limitations. Estimating a marginal price for a localized good is referred to as the first stage. The second stage is where a demand function is estimated. In that case, this method becomes very tedious. In particular as information to identify how much an individual would be willing to pay for another amount of the characteristic than the one observed, is often not available for the researcher (Hanley et al., 2009). As a consequence, such estimations are scarce in the literature. However, so far most papers using the HP method investigate only one externality at a time. Not including more externalities in the analysis could, in some situations, lead to biased results. More specifically, one or more sources can give rise to one or more externalities. A highway for instance, will probably be causing road noise, visual intrusion as well as air pollution. Unfortunately, most researchers are unable to disentangle these externalities (due to correlation issues) and thus only focus on one of the externalities (Bateman et al., 2001). Quite obviously, this may lead to an overestimation of the effect of that single externality under investigation, on the house price. Moreover, this single externality might then behave as a proxy for other externalities. Other papers investigate the impact of one single externality originating from different sources. For example, Andersson et al. (2010) estimate the willingness to pay (i. e. WTP) of residents to avoid noise pollution originating from highways, railway and an airport. Few papers include different externalities from different sources. For instance, Baranzini and Ramirez (2005) estimate the impact of noise from an airport in Geneva, road noise and the impact of air pollution in general on the house rents. For an overview of hedonic price studies of environmental externalities, see Boyle and Kiel (2001). No research, to the best of our knowledge, has been done on the interaction effects of different externalities from different sources. Nonetheless, it seems rather plausible that multiple externalities have a non-additive impact on the nuisance perceived by individuals: noise pollution might be perceived worse when the individual is also confronted with odor pollution, and vice versa. Therefore, the challenge here lies in valuating the (monetary) benefit from reducing multiple negative externalities while considering their possible additive (a total effect equal to the sum of their separate effects), synergistic (a total effect which is more than the sum of their separate effects) or antagonistic (a total effect which is less than the sum of their separate effects) interaction effects (Kutner et al., 2005). On the other hand, we have the choice experiments which belong to the stated preference methods. A discrete choice experiment is a quantitative technique used for eliciting individual preferences. The choice experiment method was initially developed by Louviere and Hensher (1982) and Louviere and Woodworth (1983). Just like the hedonic price method the choice experiment has its shortcomings too. According to Hanley et al. (1998 p. 426) the “Principle problems in using the CE method are the often complex nature of the statistical/experimental design”. Furthermore, the selection of the appropriate attributes and levels is a challenging task. In addition, respondents are exposed to a certain level of complexity while confronted with the choice cards. Considering the intellectual challenging task, this may cause a self-selection bias and may lead to the use of heuristics by respondents (Hensher et al., 2005). Finally, after answering several choice cards, respondents may reveal some level of learning or fatigue effects (Day et al., 2012). Nevertheless, it is especially suited to deal with multidimensional choices and it allows researchers to uncover how individuals value selected attributes of a product or service by asking them to state their choice over different hypothetical alternatives (Hanley et al., 2001; Amaya-amaya et al. 2008; Mangham et al., 2009). Furthermore, since the focus of this thesis lies in investigating the combined effect of multiple externalities and their interaction effects, a stated choice experiment is a logic additional method. Specifically as a choice experiment also has the benefit of ”providing the opportunity to identify marginal values of attributes that may be difficult to identify using revealed preference data because of co-linearity or lack of variation” (Hanley et al., 1998 page 416). Considering all the above, choice experiments are particularly well-suited for analyzing the WTP for multiple externalities (taking interaction effects into account) originating from one specific source, as these externalities are possibly highly correlated. In the following paragraphs the externalities used in this thesis will be discussed. The discussion will be more elaborate when the externality is used in several papers of this dissertation. Externalities discussed in this dissertation Traffic noise is one of the most frequently recurring externalities in this dissertation. In fact, it will be discussed in each of the papers. In order to show just how important noise nuisance has become, the Final Report on the Review of the Implementation of Directive 2002 / 49 /EC on Environmental Noise[1] (European Commission, 2010 - task 2 page 1), admits that “generally, action to reduce environmental noise has had a lower priority than actions taken to address other environmental problems such as air and water pollution. However, as more information has become available about the health impacts of noise, the need for a higher level of protection for European citizens has come to be recognized”. In particular annoyance, sleep disturbance, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are identified as relevant health indicators (European Commission, 2010; Passchier-Vermeer and Passchier, 2000; Stansfeld and Matheson, 2003). However, noise meters do not account for the perception of noise by humans. Therefore, measurements of noise meters are very often adjusted to the human ear. The A-weighted noise level, denoted by dB(A), is mostly used in environmental noise measurements. Yet, to obtain a representative measure, several averaging schemes exist. Out of these schemes the Lden is the preferred noise indicator in the Environmental Noise Directive i. e. END (European Commission, 2010). This indicator punishes for noise happening in the evening by adding 5 dB to what has been observed (A-weighted) while it adds 10 dB for noise happening at night. As EU membership countries are requested to set up strategic noise maps, these maps will serve as the origin of our data. As a consequence our data on noise is expressed as a yearly average expressed in L-den and has been calculated by using traffic intensity measurements combined with data on the soil composition, <b>air</b> <b>dampers,</b> correction for reflective noise, the geometrics of the surroundings, a meteorological correction and is based on the “Nederlandse berekeningsmethode[2]” also known as the SRMII (Nederlandse Standaard Rekenmethode II) [3]. These L denLden measures are then calculated for the most hindered side of a house by using a 3 D model in which 2006 is used as the reference year and while keeping in mind the characteristics of the terrain such as topography, speed limits, height model, obstructions such as buildings, etc. The accuracy of these calculations has been tested for in certain areas by comparing them with observed measures. Apparently, these calculated measurements are in general accurate[4]. Apart from all the above, it is a well-known fact in the acoustic literature (see, for instance, Miedema and Oudshoorn, 2001) that the same level of noise may cause different annoyance levels depending on the source of noise. For example, in the acoustic literature noise from roads is known to be stated as more annoying than railway noise. We therefore also included railway noise in the third paper of this dissertation. Besides noise, odor will appear in the last two papers. Once as odor from an animal waste treatment facility and once as odor induced by road traffic. In both cases odor was measured in so called sniffing units (Van Langenhove and Van Broeck, 2001). These sniffing units are based on field measurements by sniffing teams. This is a very common way of obtaining odor measures in Flanders and in Europe (Eyckmans et al., 2013). The computation is as follows. Several members of the sniffing team are familiarized with the specific scent of the odor source. Afterwards, they are sent into the area of the source but at a location were the scent cannot be observed. Next, they are crossing the field in a zig-zag matter (on the plume-axis) to make sure there is no adaptation to the scent. Meanwhile, these members take notes on the scent observed and their current position. The point at which odor is just observable is then set as the 1 sniffing unit per m 3 bound (i. e. the maximum odor perception distance). Furthermore, these field measurements happen several times (with a minimum of 8 times) and during different meteorological situations. This maximum odor perception distance, is then implemented in a short-term atmospheric dispersion model in order to back-calculate the odor emission rate (su/s). These emission rates are included in a long term dispersion model to calculate the odor zones and its odor concentrations. Afterwards this information can be visualized by using the ArcGis software. Another important nuisance is air pollution. As Flanders is particularly having trouble with particular matter of 10 micrometers diameter (PM 10), we have focused on this measure in the last paper of this dissertation. Even though the concentration of air pollutants has decreased in the European Union (EU) over the past decades, air pollutant concentrations are still too high (EEA, s. d.). Road transport is one of the larger contributors to particulate matter (PM) concentrations in the EU: for instance, 16 % of PM 2. 5 emissions and 11 % of PM 10 emissions was attributed to road transport in 2013 (EEA, s. d.). The importance of air pollution regulation is highlighted by the following quote: “The human toll for poor air quality is worse than for road traffic accidents, making it the number one environmental cause of premature death in the EU” (European Commission - Environment website[5]). Other externalities that will be discussed are the distance to the nearest high voltage power line, flood hazard areas, accident rates and the lack of green space. The interested reader is referred to the relevant papers for more information on these externalities. Structure of this dissertation In order to understand why these externalities were selected and how they are implemented, the content of each of the papers will now briefly be discussed. First of all, the introductory paper gives a literature review of recent developments regarding road noise valuations. The paper tries to unravel causes of heterogeneity in the results. Choices regarding the functional form, the independent variables that were selected, etc. are believed to cause heterogeneity in the results. If this is true, then eliminating these causes for heterogeneity should lead to similar results while valuating road noise in separate housing markets. Subsequently, the second paper uses the hedonic price technique in order to estimate the impact of road noise in two separate housing markets. While doing so, possible causes of heterogeneity in the results (as discussed in the first paper), were eliminated. As a consequence, the road noise estimates should be similar in both municipalities. The third paper will be the first attempt to investigate the impact of six externalities and their possible interaction effects on the house price using the hedonic price method. The six externalities are odor, noise from railways, noise from a highway, presence of high voltage power lines, flood areas and the absence of green space in the neighborhood of the house. In this paper, the first set of models have identical dependent and independent variables, however each model only includes one externality at a time. As these are the most common estimations in the literature, these results can easily be compared to the results from previous research. Less common are the second set of models, which are similar to the first set however, they will include all externalities at once. As the impact of four out of six externalities remains significantly negative, the third set of models includes two externalities together with their interaction variable. This allows us to examine whether these externalities have an additive, synergistic or antagonistic interaction effect on the house price. The comparison between the first, second and third set of models allows for a quick robustness check of the results. In the final paper, a discrete choice experiment is conducted to estimate the Willingness To Pay (i. e. WTP) / Willingness To Accept (i. e. WTA) for a change is several externalities originating from road traffic. As these externalities all arise from one source, namely road traffic, they will probably be correlated which makes it recommended to use a discrete choice experiment instead of the hedonic price method. The externalities included in this paper are road traffic induced odor, noise, air pollution and accidents. Therefore, the novelty of the valuation papers in this Ph. D. thesis lie in the fact that multiple externalities and their possible interacting effects were investigated. In doing so, we do not only use the hedonic price method but also a choice experiment. Moreover, to compute some of these estimations, the ArcGis software has been used in several of these papers. Finally, these are the very first HP and CE valuations of these multiple externalities in Belgium (Flanders). References Amaya-Amaya, M., Gerard, K. and M. Ryan (2008).

40|$|An air {{conditioning}} system economizer, investigated in this thesis, consisted of three <b>dampers,</b> an outdoor <b>air,</b> a recirculation, and a discharge damper. The purpose of an economizer is to control {{the ratio of the}} outdoor air flow rate to the recirculation air flow rate. The dampers were opposed blade type and had equal sizes. They were coupled through a control system. Two control strategies were investigated. In the first strategy, the three economizer dampers were coupled so that the outdoor air and discharge damper open as the recirculation damper closes. In a second strategy, the discharge damper was always open during operation and the outdoor <b>air</b> and recirculation <b>dampers</b> were coupled so that the outdoor air damper opens as the recirculation damper closes. The two coupled dampers control strategy will require slightly less power than three coupled damper strategy. The study showed that the linearization of throat area versus control signal is the most important factor for reducing power, whether the three coupled it is or two coupled dampers control strategy is used. linearization provides good control of the air flow rates, from 0 % to 95 %.

The model-based control strategy uses {{a model to}} estimate the load on the cooling coil for 100 % outdoor air and minimum outdoor <b>air</b> and transitions <b>dampers</b> between these two positions to minimize the load. The optimization-based control strategy uses a cooling coil model and a one-dimensional optimization routine to determine the fraction of outdoor air that minimizes the coil load. A coil model based on the contact-mixture analogy was adopted for this study and validated with experimental data. Simulations were {{used to compare the}} new economizer control strategies with traditional strategies. Simulations evaluated the sensitivity of the annual and peak cooling loads to outdoor air and return air sensor errors and climatic conditions. Incorrect control decisions stemming from sensor errors reduce the achievable energy savings and lead to higher peak hourly loads. For a scenario representative of poorly maintained sensors, the lowest annual coil loads of the economizer strategies investigated are 3. 0 - 40. 3 % higher than those achieved for the ideal scenario of optimization-based control and ideal sensors (i. e., no sensor errors), and the lowest peak hourly loads for those cases are 6. 8 - 84. 1 % higher than those for the ideal scenario.

40|$|AbstractRooftop Units (RTUs) {{have been}} widely applied in {{providing}} space heating and cooling for commercial buildings. In total, they serve over 60 % of the commercial building floor space in the U. S. Even through the current control approaches of a RTU can maintain the zone temperature corresponding to a set point temperature, it performs inefficiently due to several factors such as limited sensing capability, non-coordinated local control, inherent oversizing effects and so on. In addition to unnecessary power consumptions, the current control and operation technology on RTUs also lead to the space humidity problem, equipment efficiency degradation, and premature failure. To solve aforementioned problems and enhance the overall system performance, this paper presents {{the development of a}} coordination control technique for improving the system operations of multiple RTUs used in light commercial buildings with an open space. In the control algorithm, simplified building models were developed to potentially estimate the instantaneous building load. Utilizing this model-based technique, sequence control strategy is designed to automatically select suitable mode operations of a RTU including economizing, heating, cooling and ventilation mode while synchronizing with the supply fan control and damper operations. Using a developed building simulation platform implemented on Matlab software, the developed coordination control is applied in reducing energy penalty caused by an inherent oversizing problem on multiple RTUs. With the findings, the control algorithm can be further used as a soft-repair for temporally fixing faulty operations and improper commissioning of multiple RTUs such as excessive or insufficient air flow, outdoor <b>air</b> leakage, stuck <b>dampers</b> and simultaneous heating and cooling (RTU fighting) ...|$|R
