5|$|March 6, 2007: Jordan's {{hometown}} newspaper publishes {{an article}} casting {{doubts about his}} January 2007 claims on his Wikia userpage that he {{had worked for the}} United States Trustee Program and had been <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> paralegal.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Kentucky</b> {{governor}} is elected under our constitution {{for four years}} without legal opportunity, regardless of how acceptable his program has been, to put it before the public for approval or rejection. In practical application he must successfully run the legislative gauntlet during the first hurried ninety days he is in office {{if he is to}} adopt a program and have an administration worthy of history's harsh pen. The remaining general assembly two years hence is invariably plagued with vicissitudes common to 'lame duck' tenures.|$|E
5|$|Among Combs' other accomplishments as {{governor}} were requiring voting machines in state elections and {{passage of a}} law making the assessment of state employees for political campaign funds a felony. At {{the end of his}} term, Combs backed Edward T. Breathitt to succeed him {{as governor}}. Breathitt defeated Happy Chandler in the Democratic primary, then went on to defeat Republican Louie B. Nunn in the general election. It was the only time in the 20th century that <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> governor's preferred successor won election.|$|E

5|$|Because Helm died so {{soon after}} taking office, a special {{election}} {{for the remainder of}} his term was set for August 1868. Democrats held a convention in Frankfort on February 22, 1868 and nominated Stevenson to finish out Helm's term. R. Tarvin Baker, formerly Stevenson's opponent in the election for lieutenant governor, was the choice of the Republicans. The Republicans faced many disadvantages, including the national party's persecution of President Johnson and a lack of local organization in many Kentucky counties. Despite Stevenson's shortcomings as a public speaker, he was elected in a landslide—115,560 to 26,605. At the time, it was the largest majority obtained by any candidate in <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> election.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{began dating}} Charlann Harting {{near the end}} of 1950. In mid-1951, they parted ways to attend college – Harting, whose family was better off financially, at the University of Kentucky and Carroll at nearby Paducah Junior College. After their first year, Carroll and Harting decided to get married. The {{ceremony}} took place on July 22, 1951, and the couple eventually had four children – Kenneth, Patrice, Bradley, and Ellyn. Ellyn, born June 27, 1975, was the first child born to <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> First Family while they were residing in the Governor's Mansion.|$|E
5|$|Compromise {{having been}} exhausted, both sides agreed to litigate the matter. The Kentucky Court of Appeals {{found that the}} General Assembly had acted legally in declaring Goebel {{the winner of the}} election. That {{decision}} was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Arguments were presented in the case (Taylor v. Beckham) on April 30, 1900, and on May 21, the justices decided 8–1 not to hear the case, allowing the Court of Appeals' decision to stand. The lone dissension was that of Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan, <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> native. and member of the Republican Party.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{retired from}} the {{practice}} of law in 1989. In June 1990, Cooper was honored with a gala screening of Gentleman From Kentucky, <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Educational Television documentary about his life, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. On February 21, 1991, Cooper died of heart failure in a retirement home in Washington. He had been preceded in death by his second wife, Lorraine, on February 3, 1985. On February 26, 1991, Kentucky's two senators, Wendell H. Ford and Mitch McConnell, gave speeches on the Senate floor praising Cooper, and the Senate adjourned in Cooper's memory. Cooper was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} Keen Johnson, then {{an executive with}} Reynolds Metals, to oppose Cooper's re-election bid. Cooper {{had the support of}} organized labor and benefitted from a large segment of Kentuckians who voted for Republican Richard M. Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy as a reaction against Kennedy's Catholicism in the 1960 presidential election. Cooper ultimately defeated Johnson by 199,257 votes, a record victory margin for <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> senatorial candidate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Jones faced Republican Larry Hopkins, a seven-term congressman {{representing}} Kentucky's 6th congressional district. Hopkins {{was considered the}} Republicans' best hope of capturing the governorship since Louie B. Nunn in 1967. Instead, Hopkins' negative campaign ads, mistakes about his record, and involvement in a House scandal involving bounced checks all hurt his chances. Jones won the election {{by a vote of}} 540,468 to 294,542, the largest margin of victory in <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> gubernatorial race.|$|E

5|$|John Sherman Cooper (August 23, 1901– February 21, 1991) was a politician, jurist, and diplomat {{from the}} U.S. state of Kentucky. He served three non-consecutive, partial {{terms in the}} United States Senate before being elected to two full terms in 1960 and 1966. He also served as U.S. Ambassador to India from 1955 to 1956 and U.S. Ambassador to East Germany from 1974 to 1976. He was the first Republican to be popularly elected {{to more than one}} term as a senator from Kentucky and, in both 1960 and 1966, he set records for the largest victory margin for <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> senatorial {{candidate}} from either party.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2009, Paul {{said that}} if Bunning, whose {{fundraising}} in 2009 matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election, declined to seek a third term, he would almost certainly run in the Republican Party primary to succeed him, and formed an exploratory committee soon after, while still promising {{to stay out of}} the race if Bunning ultimately decided to run for reelection. Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, though <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> news site first broke the news.|$|E
5|$|The Cartman {{drug market}} subplot was heavily {{influenced}} by the 1983 crime film Scarface, with Cartman resembling fictional drug lord Tony Montana and KFC founder Colonel Sanders as antagonist Alejandro Sosa. The episode also included several jokes about Pope Benedict XVI and the child sexual abuse scandals that had been surrounding the Catholic Church at the time. The concept of a former KFC restaurant becoming a marijuana dispensary came from a news story about a real marijuana dispensary in Palms, Los Angeles, built at a site formerly housing <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Fried Chicken franchise.|$|E

Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E
5|$|Although Littleprincessemma, American Pharoah's dam, is the {{half-sister}} to graded stakes winner Storm Wolf, and to Misty Rosette, {{winner of}} the Old Hat Stakes in 2006, her own undistinguished racing career, combined with the modest record of her sire, Yankee Gentleman, dampened initial public expectations for her second-born foal. Yet American Pharoah's maternal bloodline includes Storm Cat, a Grade I winner retired early due to injury, Northern Dancer, <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, and Terlingua, a celebrated broodmare, through whom he is a fifth-generation descendant of Secretariat. He is also descended through his dam from Flying Paster, a Grade I champion who was 1978 California Horse of the Year, and Exclusive Native (sire of Affirmed and Genuine Risk). Through both sire and dam, American Pharoah is a fifth- and sixth-generation descendant of Bold Ruler, {{as well as a}} sixth- and seventh-generation descendant of Tom Fool, one of the top thoroughbreds of the last century. His tail-female line traces back to The Oldfield Mare, foaled circa 1695.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Hardin Helm (June 2, 1831 – September 21, 1863) was <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> politician, attorney, Confederate brigadier general, and a {{brother-in-law}} of Abraham Lincoln. He {{was also}} the son of Kentucky Governor John L. Helm. Helm was born in Bardstown, Kentucky. He attended the Kentucky Military Institute and the West Point Military Academy {{and then went to}} study law at the University of Louisville and Harvard University. He served as a state legislator and the state's attorney in Kentucky. He also served as the assistant inspector-general for the Kentucky state guard. Helm was offered the position of Union Army paymaster by his brother-in-law, President Abraham Lincoln, a position which he declined. Helm felt it was an honor to serve in the Confederate States Army, where he was initially a colonel and later promoted to brigadier general. Helm commanded the 1st Kentucky Brigade more commonly known as The Orphan Brigade. He died on the battlefield during the Battle of Chickamauga. Helm was married to Emilie Todd, the half-sister of Mary Todd Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|Free silver Democrats {{challenged}} Hunter's naturalization. It {{was finally}} concluded that Hunter, an Englishman, was naturalized under provisions {{of a federal}} law {{that allowed him to}} omit the standard preliminaries because of his service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army. Over the course of the contest, Hunter was also indicted for bribery, but was acquitted in short order for lack of evidence. Voting proceeded over several days, and demonstrators in the chamber galleries became disruptive in their support of various candidates. <b>A</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Post account from March 7, 1896, recorded that good-humored legislators began pelting each other with paper wads during the day's deliberations. This attempt at levity escalated until wrapped transcripts of the governor's message to the legislature were flying through the air. By March 11, tensions had reached the point that armed Democratic supporters were standing outside the state house in an attempt to intimidate Republican lawmakers and discourage them from entering. Attempts were made to unseat several legislators in the General Assembly, leading to threats of violence. Observers were banned from the gallery, and everyone entering the state house was searched for weapons.|$|E
5|$|George B. Martin, who {{had served}} six months in the Senate in 1918 after being {{appointed}} to fill a vacancy, opposed Barkley in the 1932 primary, but Barkley defeated him by a two-to-one margin. In the general election, he defeated Republican Congressman Maurice H. Thatcher {{by a vote of}} 575,077 to 393,865, marking {{the first time in the}} 20th century that <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> senator won a second consecutive term. Democrats gained control of the Senate during the 1932 elections; Joseph Robinson was chosen majority leader, and he appointed Barkley as his assistant. Together, they secured passage of New Deal legislation, including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the National Industrial Recovery Act, and the Federal Emergency Relief Act. In July 1934, the Democratic National Committee chose Barkley to respond to Republican National Committee chairman Henry P. Fletcher's radio attacks on the New Deal. Later that year, he embarked on a tour of twenty states, defending the New Deal and stumping for Democratic candidates in the 1934 midterm elections.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Cooper again won {{re-election}} over John Y. Brown, Sr., by 217,000 votes, {{breaking his}} own record of largest victory margin for <b>a</b> <b>Kentucky</b> senatorial candidate, and carrying {{the vote of}} 110 of Kentucky's 120 counties. In the lead-up to the 1968 Republican presidential primary, he endorsed New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, saying that Americans would only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam. Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war, while other Republican candidates tried to remain non-specific about how they would handle it. As Rockefeller's candidacy faded, Cooper encouraged his colleague, Kentucky Senator Thruston B. Morton, to seek the presidency, but Morton declined. The nomination– and eventually, the presidency– went to Republican Richard Nixon.|$|E
