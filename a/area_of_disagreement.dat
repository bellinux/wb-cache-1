5|$|On {{arriving}} in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on 1 Corinthians, denouncing Catholic doctrines of purgatory, clerical celibacy, and lenten fasting. He then spoke against the Catholic {{doctrine of the}} Eucharist, the most sensitive <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> between Protestants and Catholics in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation. Smyth fled to St Andrews and finally to Leuven before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, William Tresham, William Chedsey and Morgan Phillips, stepped forward to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before Richard Cox, the University Chancellor and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation, with Vermigli's opponents arguing for it and him against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli {{at the forefront of}} debates over the nature of the Eucharist.|$|E
25|$|The window {{treatments}} {{were another}} <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> between du Pont and Boudin. Du Pont wanted the window treatments inside the window frame, {{to expose the}} moldings. Boudin felt this made the room appear too tall. After the two discussed the issue in early 1961, du Pont's view won out. But in late 1962, Boudin removed these window treatments and implemented one he had used many times before in many different homes: Straight panels to hide the side moldings, with a Baroque Revival flat panel to cover the top molding and rods. The fabric used was the same Boudin had selected for the wall covering, but trimmed with a French-made decorative silver tape.|$|E
25|$|This {{investigation}} included {{over one}} hundred interviews of former students, family of former students, and former staff members of the school. The interviews confirmed {{that in addition to}} the implementation of the Individual Rating System, school administrators used corporal punishment as a tool to encourage obedience. The interviews revealed little disagreement about the way in which corporal punishment was administered. The former students were consistent in that punishment was administered by school administrators and adult staff witnesses in the building referred to as the White House. The former students were consistent in stating that a wooden paddle or leather strap was the implement used for administering punishment. The <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> amongst former students was the number of spankings administered and their severity. Although some former students stated that they were “beaten” {{to the point that the}} skin of their buttocks blistered and bled profusely, there was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring. A secondary disagreement was the former students’ perceptions of the punishment process. Some former students stated that their spankings caused them no psychological harm and that they learned from their mistakes while others stated that, mentally, they suffered greatly as a result and still do so to this day.|$|E

2500|$|One key <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> {{between the}} factions was over who should control {{payments}} from {{a trust fund}} dedicated to the Prohibition Party by George Pennock in 1930.

2500|$|Leonard notes one <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> amongst applied economists {{which became}} {{famous in the}} US. That was the minimum-wage {{controversy}}. He notes that the fierceness of this controversy was odd because the likely effects were small and that several seemingly more important policy issues such as (entitlement reform, health insurance, CPI calculation) generated nothing like the storm. His explanation is that while this controversy was not especially important to the economy, {{it was very important}} to economics and economics as a policy science. His explanation for this is that minimum wage research came {{to be seen as a}} test of the usefulness of applying neoclassical price theory to the wages and employment. In other words, it was not just a technical quarrel over such things as the sign and size of wage-elasticity but rather an installment in a long running [...] methodological dispute over whether neoclassical price theory is in reality of any use.|$|E
2500|$|Secretary of State Dean Rusk {{commented on}} the most {{significant}} <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> regarding the resolution:There was much bickering over whether that resolution should say from [...] "the" [...] territories or from [...] "all" [...] territories. In the French version, which is equally authentic, it says withdrawal de territory, with de meaning [...] "the." [...] We wanted that to be left a little vague and subject to future negotiation because we thought the Israeli border along the West Bank could be [...] "rationalized"; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties. We also wanted to leave open demilitarization measures in the Sinai and the Golan Heights and take {{a fresh look at}} the old city of Jerusalem. But we never contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel {{as a result of the}} June 1967 war. On that point we and the Israelis to this day remain sharply divided. This situation could lead to real trouble in the future. Although every President since Harry Truman has committed the United States to the security and independence of Israel, I'm not aware of any commitment the United States has made to assist Israel in retaining territories seized in the Six-Day War.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, {{after an}} {{increase}} in both crime and unemployment, the previously unrestricted immigration policy for Turkish migrants was tightened. In the wake of this new policy, a number of Turkish migrants have been deported and immigration procedures have changed to allow Northern Cyprus to better screen migrant applicants. Turkey itself regards policy change as a heavy-handed reaction, thus causing the first major <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> between Northern Cyprus and Turkey.|$|E

50|$|Different anarcho-capitalists propose {{different}} forms of anarcho-capitalism, and one <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> is {{in the area of}} law. Morris and Linda Tannehill, in The Market for Liberty, object to any statutory law whatsoever. They argue that all one has to do is ask if one is aggressing against another (see tort and contract law) in order to decide if an act is right or wrong. However, Rothbard, while also supporting a natural prohibition on force and fraud, supports the establishment of a mutually agreed-upon centralized libertarian legal code which private courts would pledge to follow.|$|E
50|$|Mut'ah, {{literally}} meaning joy, is {{a condition}} where rules of Islam are relaxed. It can apply to marriage (the nikah mut'ah) or to the Hajj (the obligatory pilgrimage) (the Mut'ah of Hajj).

Shias and Sunnis do agree that, initially, or {{near the beginning of}} Islam, nikah mut'ah was a legal contract. Beyond that time, the legality of the practice is debated.|$|E
40|$|The {{handling}} and reporting of testicular tumours is difficult {{due to their}} rarity. METHODS AND RESULTS: A survey developed by the European Network of Uro-Pathology (ENUP) and sent to its members and experts to assess the evaluation of testicular germ cell tumours. Twenty-five experts and 225 ENUP members replied. <b>Areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> included immaturity in teratomas, reported by 32 % of experts but 68 % of ENUP. Although the presence of rete testis invasion was reported widely, the distinction between pagetoid and stromal invasion was made by 96 % of experts but only 63 % of ENUP. Immunohistochemistry was used in more than 50 % of cases by 68 % of ENUP and 12 % of experts. Staging revealed the greatest <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement.</b> Invasion <b>of</b> the tunica vaginalis without vascular invasion was interpreted as T 1 by 52 % of experts and 67 % of ENUP, but T 2 by the remainder. Tumour invading the hilar adipose tissue adjacent to the epididymis without vascular invasion was interpreted as T 1 : 40 % of experts, 43 % of ENUP; T 2 : 36 % of experts, 30 % of ENUP; and T 3 : 24 % of experts, 27 % of ENUP.

50|$|One key <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> in 1983 {{was that}} the {{inhabitants}} of the Falkland Islands were considered by Matgamna {{to have the right to}} autonomy, a position he worked through during the Falklands War. This approach to the national question has since been extended, in large part by Matgamna, to other communities.

5000|$|The {{original}} Ahdut HaAvoda {{party was}} founded in Palestine in March 1919, while under British military administration, after a split in the Poale Zion party, which had established a branch in Ottoman Syria in 1906. Ahdut HaAvoda was led by David Ben-Gurion, {{who had been a}} member of the pre-war group. The root of the division was a conflict between membership of the Communist International and participation in the bourgeois Zionist Organisation (ZO). The membership of the more radical anti-ZO faction tended to come from among the newer Yiddish-speaking immigrants.

5000|$|One <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> between mutualists and anarchist communists {{stems from}} Proudhon's {{advocacy}} {{of money and}} later labour vouchers to compensate individuals for their labor as well as markets or artificial markets for goods and services. Peter Kropotkin, like other anarchist communists, advocated the abolition of labor remuneration and questioned, [...] "how can this new form of wages, the labor note, be sanctioned by those who admit that houses, fields, mills are no longer private property, that they belong to the commune or the nation?"

50|$|An <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>disagreement</b> arises between {{evolutionary}} psychologists, cognitive {{scientists and}} behaviourists {{on where to}} draw the line on what is considered a psychological adaptation, and what is considered a learned behaviour. Where behaviourism explains certain behaviours as conditioned responses, cognitivism may push that these behaviours arise from a psychological adaptation that institutes a preference for that behaviour. Evolutionary psychology proposes that the human psychology consists primarily of psychological adaptations, which is opposed by the tabula rasa or blank slate model of human psychology. Early behaviourists, like B.F. Skinner, tended to the blank slate model and argued that innate behaviors and instincts were few, some behaviourists suggesting that the only innate behavior was the ability to learn. On the other hand, Steven Pinker presents the cognitivist perspective in his book, The Blank Slate, in which he challenges the tabula rasa models and argues that human behaviour is shaped by psychological adaptations.|$|E
