5|$|The Lexus LS (Japanese: レクサス・LS, Rekusasu LS) is a {{full-size}} luxury car (F-segment in Europe) {{serving as the}} flagship model of Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota. For the first four generations, all LS models featured V8 engines and were predominantly rear-wheel-drive, with Lexus also offering <b>all-wheel-drive,</b> hybrid, and long-wheelbase variants. The fifth generation changed to using a V6 engine with no V8 option.|$|E
5|$|The FIA Group B {{regulations}} {{steered the}} concept towards a mid-engine, <b>all-wheel-drive</b> layout, with a Jaguar V12 engine {{as the power}} source. The concept car was designed and built at very little cost to Jaguar, as Randle called in favours from component suppliers and engineering companies he and Jaguar had worked with in the past. In return he offered public recognition for their assistance and dangled the possibility of future contracts from Jaguar.|$|E
25|$|This was {{initially}} available in their quattro <b>all-wheel-drive</b> variants, {{and is very}} similar to the new ZF Friedrichshafen-supplied Porsche Doppel-Kupplung (PDK).|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{previous}} versions, the 997 Targa {{was only}} available as 4 wheel drive. Targa 4 models are slightly {{slower than the}} hard top Carrera models because of the heavier roof and <b>all-wheel-drive</b> transmission.|$|E
25|$|Persistent {{problems}} during the vehicle's development prompted Ford to drop plans for its production and instead begin {{work on an}} <b>all-wheel-drive</b> model to beat the Audi Quattro, designed and built from scratch, resulting in the famous RS200.|$|E
25|$|Jensen {{applied the}} Formula Ferguson (FF) {{full-time}} <b>all-wheel-drive</b> system to 318 units of their Jensen FF built from 1966 to 1971, marking {{the first time}} 4WD was used in a production GT sports car. While most 4WD systems split torque evenly, the Jensen split torque roughly 40% front, 60% rear by gearing {{the front and rear}} at different ratios.|$|E
25|$|As of the 2017 model year, Lamborghini's {{automobile}} {{product range}} {{consists of two}} model lines, {{both of which are}} mid-engine two-seat sports cars. The V12-powered Aventador line consists of the LP 700–4 coupé and roadster. The V10-powered Huracán line currently includes the <b>all-wheel-drive</b> LP 610-4 coupé and roadster, as well as the less powerful rear-wheel-drive LP 580-2 coupé. Lamborghini intends to double its car production by producing as many SUVs by 2018 as sports cars.|$|E
25|$|Similar to the Impreza that Team Cusco ran in {{previous}} years until 2008, a Legacy grand tourer car based on the fifth generation model has been built by R Sport for the Japanese Super GT series (GT300 class). It features a boxer-4 turbo charged engine. The car had also featured <b>all-wheel-drive</b> in the first season but the layout was replaced with an FR layout in 2010, which that season they got their first win in 39th Pokka Summer Special.|$|E
25|$|Some hybrid {{vehicles}} {{such as the}} Lexus RX400h provide {{power to}} an AWD system through a pair of electric motors, one to the front wheels and one to the rear. In {{the case of the}} AWD model version of the Lexus RX400h (and its Toyota-branded counterpart, the Harrier hybrid), the front wheels can also receive drive power directly from the vehicle's gasoline engine as well as via the electric motors, whereas the rear wheels derive power only from the second electric motor. Transfer of power is managed automatically by internal electronics based on traction conditions and need, making this an <b>all-wheel-drive</b> system.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, a {{trademark}} application for the Supra nameplate was {{filed with the}} European Union Intellectual Property Office. According to Autocar, the new Supra is set to debut in 2018. The car will likely feature an <b>all-wheel-drive</b> hybrid system; four-cylinder engines {{are expected to be}} available, with a high-performance version to use a twin-turbo V6 codenamed 943F. Kleine Zeitung reported that the new jointly-developed Supra will be produced at a Magna Steyr facility near Graz, Austria, along with the BMW Z4's successor. Although the sports car's name is yet to be officially confirmed, Toyota global chief engineer Tetsuya Tada said that it will likely carry the nameplate Supra, due to its name recognition and historical significance.|$|E
25|$|The Storm SRTV {{is based}} on an {{original}} design by BC Customs (BCC) of Utah, originally submitted for the Ground Mobility Vehicle System (GMV 1.1) competition hosted by SOCOM. It is in the tactical family of SXOR Mobility Vehicles of SXOR Motorsports. It is a highly mobile 2-door off-roading pickup truck design with <b>all-wheel-drive.</b> The light-weight tactical vehicle has a high performance mid-engine for maximum stability with 430 horsepower and 425lb-ft of torque. The SRTV can exceed double its curb weight in payload while performing missions. The engine will run using standard gasoline, 87 Octane or higher, diesel, or JP-8. The SRTV is constructed of MIL-STD aircraft tubing, minimizing weight, maximizing strength, and providing a skeletal base for multiple types of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) ballistic and blast armoring. The vehicle utilizes identical components with multiple body configurations, hence, it provides multi-role configurations.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{the base}} model was dropped {{in favor of}} a sedan version (replacing the 6000 which ended {{production}} the next year and the Canada-only Tempest), entering production on September 12, 1989. A notable introduction for the Grand Prix in 1990 is the new STE (Special Touring Edition) which replaced the STE model of the Pontiac 6000. In contrast to that model, it trades in <b>all-wheel-drive</b> for the available Turbo 3.1L V6. Standard features include a cassette stereo with equalizer and eight speakers (a compact disc player was optional), remote keyless entry, eight-way power driver's seat with multiple lumbar and sidewing adjustments for both front seat occupants, and a compass/trip computer that was more informative than the units in the SE and turbo coupes. An LE sedan was also available for 1990, standard with a 2.3L Quad 4 engine and a 3-speed automatic, the first use of an inline 4 cylinder engine in a Grand Prix. The 2.8L V6 engine was discontinued, while the 3.1L engine gained widespread availability and a standard five-speed manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|The {{drive train}} {{delivered}} power to all four wheels using an electronically controlled <b>all-wheel-drive</b> system Nissan called the ATTESA E-TS. The ATTESA E-TS system used two accelerometers mounted under the center console, which fed lateral and longitudinal inputs to the ECU. The ECU then controlled power delivery {{to the front}} wheels via an electronic torque split converter. In 1995, the ATTESA E-TS Pro was introduced as an option for R33 GT-R customers, and came as standard equipment in GT-R V.spec models. It was later standard equipment in all GT-R models for the R34 Skyline GT-R. The ATTESA E-TS Pro added an Active Limited Slip Differential, which was controlled by the onboard ATTESA computer. This was only for the rear differential, as the front differential remained as a normal Limited Slip Differential. The ATTESA E-TS Pro was also advertised in brochures as adding an electronically controlled 4-channel ABS brake system. Although it {{is not related to}} the all wheel drive system, it uses much of the same sensors, and the same computer. The R32 could be switched from AWD to RWD by removing the 4WD fuse, but R33 and R34 models had to have the front tailshaft removed, or the centre diff can be depressurised for 'towing mode' as specified in the owners manual.|$|E
500|$|At 24years and 86 days, he {{remained}} the youngest driver {{to win a}} WRC event until his countryman Jari-Matti Latvala won the 2008 Swedish Rally {{at the age of}} 22. Latvala stated that [...] "It's a super feeling, it's almost unbelievable. Henri (Toivonen) was one of my idols and secretly I've always wanted to beat his record as the youngest winner." [...] Over 20 years after the 1980 RAC, Paul White (nicknamed [...] "Chalkie" [...] by Toivonen) commented that he still receives questions about the rally and Henri Toivonen. He noted that the Talbot team, run by Des O'Dell and 15 full-time personnel, was much smaller than other works teams and [...] "had to draft in 'mercenary' mechanics to help." [...] Toivonen's results led to another year in the Talbot squad. In the 1981 season, he was signed up for a larger WRC programme and had a new co-driver, Fred Gallagher, who would later partner Juha Kankkunen and Björn Waldegård in a Toyota Celica Twincam Turbo. Toivonen's rear-wheel drive Group 2 Sunbeam Lotus was now less competitive against the Group 4 cars and the <b>all-wheel-drive</b> Audi Quattro, but despite four retirements, the second places at Rally Portugal and Sanremo, as well as a fifth place at the Monte Carlo Rally, resulted in a seventh place overall in the drivers' world championship. Together with more consistent team mate Guy Fréquelin, he brought Talbot a surprise manufacturers' title. He also competed in the last round of the British Open Rally Championship, the Audi Sport International Rally, and won the event.|$|E
2500|$|Only a four-door sedan was offered. The hardtop and {{the option}} of a 1.6L engine were removed. Engine choices were either the SR18(DE), SR20(DE) and the SR20(VE) with {{available}} <b>all-wheel-drive</b> (ATTESA) versions. The Nissan Hyper CVT automatic transmission was available in this generation along with standard four-speed automatic, five-speed manual, or as an <b>all-wheel-drive</b> with a five-speed manual. Some models had a 1973cc diesel CD20E engine. Models offered include the standard LeGrand, luxury Eprise, sports-oriented SSS, and a limited run SSS-Z model.|$|E
2500|$|The Freemont had its Italian {{launch in}} the end of May 2011. It has two {{front-wheel-drive}} turbodiesel variants the [...] and the [...] version of Fiat's 2.0 L Multijet turbodiesel. Later will be introduced <b>all-wheel-drive</b> version of [...] diesel and the Pentastar V6.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is powered}} with a 2.4-liter i-VTEC {{inline-four}} engine puts out 185hp and 163 pound-feet (220Nm [...] ) of torque at 4,400 rpm {{along with an}} all-new Real-Time <b>all-wheel-drive</b> (AWD) with intelligent control system. All North American Honda CR-Vs come equipped with a 5-speed automatic transmission.|$|E
2500|$|The Countryman has {{a longer}} wheelbase, more {{interior}} room, and higher ground clearance than the Clubman. It {{uses the same}} engines as the Hatch/Clubman range, but with an optional <b>all-wheel-drive</b> powertrain (dubbed [...] "ALL4") to allow minimal off-road and rugged terrain driving. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on all models, with automatic transmission available on all petrol and diesel models except the 90bhp One D.|$|E
2500|$|As with {{previous}} generation models the XC70 features increased ground clearance, optional <b>all-wheel-drive</b> and some cosmetic differences {{from the normal}} V70. On the outside there are XC-only front and rear bumpers, side skirts, wheel arch extensions and additional exterior door trims all in unpainted black plastic. The optional roof rails feature an embossed [...] "XC" [...] and are only available in black. Various unique alloy wheels are offered only for the XC.|$|E
2500|$|... 4×4/4WD/AWD {{systems were}} {{developed}} in many different markets and used in many different vehicle platforms. There is no universally accepted set of terminology to describe the various architectures and functions. The terms used by various manufacturers often reflect marketing rather than engineering considerations or significant technical differences between systems. [...] SAE International's standard J1952 recommends only the term <b>All-Wheel-Drive</b> with additional sub classifications which cover all types of AWD/4WD/4x4 systems found on production vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|After the AMC-based {{4-wheel-drive}} Eagle wagon was dropped, Chrysler and Eagle {{officials were}} busy figuring out {{which type of}} vehicles {{would be best for}} the new division. The four-wheel-drive sporty Eagle concept would continue in spirit by offering <b>all-wheel-drive</b> optionally on the Mitsubishi-based 1990-98 Eagle Talon, the Canadian-market 1989-91 Eagle Vista wagon, and 1992-96 Eagle Summit Wagon. However, the [...] "Eagle car lineup for '90 differed significantly from the one that bowed in 1987, on the heels of Chrysler's buyout of AMC." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Consumer Reports {{predicted}} reliability survey blamed the 2006 first-year GS in the <b>all-wheel-drive</b> form, which had problems in integrity (rattles), body hardware and sound system, {{as the sole}} reason for lowering Lexus' overall score. Despite the reliability issues among 2006 GS models, the vehicle earned a [...] "Recommended" [...] rating from Consumer Reports for vehicle features, overall value and previously automatically assumed reliability for that year. However, the problems have apparently been solved, and the GS AWD was rated [...] "average" [...] in later years.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors {{introduced}} the innovative Eagle for the 1980 model year. These {{were the first}} American mass production cars to use the complete front-engine, four-wheel drive system. The AMC Eagle was offered as a sedan, coupe, and station wagon with permanent automatic <b>all-wheel-drive</b> passenger models. The new Eagles combined Jeep technology with an existing and proven AMC passenger automobile platform. They ushered a whole new product category of [...] "sport-utility" [...] or crossover SUV. AMC's Eagles came with the comfort and high-level appointments expected of regular passenger models and used the off-road technology for an extra margin of safety and traction.|$|E
2500|$|In 1912, Deere & Company {{president}} William Butterworth (Charles' son-in-law), who {{had replaced}} Charles Deere {{after his death}} in 1907, began the company's expansion into the tractor business. Deere & Company briefly experimented with its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain <b>All-Wheel-Drive,</b> but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company in 1918, which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor at its facilities in Waterloo, Iowa. Deere & Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the [...] was introduced. The company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in Waterloo, Iowa, namely the 7R, 8R, and 9R series.|$|E
2500|$|The AMC Eagle was {{the first}} {{production}} car to use the complete [...] "Ferguson Formula" [...] (FF) full-time <b>all-wheel-drive</b> system from Britain's Ferguson Research. Other four-wheel-drive automobile-type vehicles - the Subaru DL/GL (1972 for the Japanese domestic market {{and two years later}} in the U.S.), and much later the Toyota Tercel SR5 Wagon (1983) - only had part-time four-wheel-drive systems that could not be engaged on dry pavement. The Eagle was also years ahead of Subaru's simplistic, part-time front-drive/4WD system, due to Roy Lunn's creativity and Jeep's experience producing 4WD vehicles. Another feature was the Eagle's independent front suspension, accomplished by mounting the front differential to the engine block with universal joints and half shafts to drive the front wheels.|$|E
2500|$|Cadillac {{introduced}} a new design philosophy for the 21st century called [...] "Art and Science" [...] which it claims [...] "incorporates sharp, sheer forms and crisp edges – a form vocabulary that expresses bold, high-technology design and invokes the technology used to design it." [...] This new design language spread from the original CTS and to the Cadillac XLR roadster. Cadillac's model lineup mostly includes rear- and <b>all-wheel-drive</b> sedans, roadsters, crossovers and SUVs. The only exceptions were the front-wheel drive Cadillac BLS (which was not sold in North America) and the Cadillac DTS, neither of which are still in production. The second-generation CTS-V is a direct competitor to the BMW M5. An automatic version of the CTS-V lapped the Nürburgring in 7:59.32, {{at the time a}} record for production sedans.|$|E
2500|$|A high {{center of}} gravity makes a vehicle more prone to {{rollover}} accidents than lower vehicles, especially if the vehicle leaves the road, or if the driver makes a sharp directional adjustment during emergency maneuvers. Figures from the [...] show that most passenger cars have about a 10% chance of rollover if involved in a single-vehicle crash, while SUVs have between 14% and 23% (varying {{from a low of}} 14% for the <b>all-wheel-drive</b> (AWD) Ford Edge to a high of 23% for the front-wheel-drive (FWD) Ford Escape). Many modern SUVs are equipped with electronic stability control (ESC) to prevent rollovers on flat surfaces, but 95% of rollovers are [...] "tripped", meaning that the vehicle strikes something low, such as a curb or shallow ditch, causing it to tip over.|$|E
2500|$|All {{wheel drive}} (AWD) {{historically}} was synonymous with [...] "four-wheel drive" [...] on four-wheeled vehicles, and six-wheel drive on 6×6s, and so on, {{being used in}} that fashion at least {{as early as the}} 1920s., GMC had orders for more than 4,400 <b>all-wheel-drive</b> military trucks." [...] Today in North America the term is applied to both heavy vehicles as well as light passenger vehicles. When referring to heavy vehicles the term is increasingly applied to mean [...] "permanent multiple-wheel drive" [...] on 2×2, 4×4, 6×6 or 8×8 drive train systems that include a differential between the front and rear drive shafts. This is often coupled with some sort of anti-slip technology, increasingly hydraulic-based, that allows differentials to spin at different speeds but still be capable of transferring torque from a wheel with poor traction to one with better. Typical AWD systems work well on all surfaces, but are not intended for more extreme off-road use. When used to describe AWD systems in light passenger vehicles, it refers to a system that applies torque to all four wheels (permanently or on demand) and/or is targeted at improving on-road traction and performance (particularly in inclement conditions), rather than for off-road applications.|$|E
2500|$|Porsche also {{developed}} the car's aerodynamics, which {{were designed to}} increase stability, as was the automatic ride-height adjustment that became available on the road car (961 race cars had fixed suspensions). Its [...] "zero lift" [...] aerodynamics were {{a big part of}} keeping it drivable. The 959 also featured Porsche-Steuer Kupplung (PSK) which was at the time the most advanced <b>all-wheel-drive</b> system in a production car. Capable of dynamically changing the torque distribution between the rear and front wheels in both normal and slip conditions, the PSK system gave the 959 the adaptability it needed both as a race car and as a [...] "super" [...] street car. Under hard acceleration, PSK could send as much as 80% of available power to the rear wheels, helping {{make the most of the}} rear-traction bias that occurs at such times. It could also vary the power bias depending on road surface and grip changes, helping maintain traction at all times. The dashboard featured gauges displaying the amount of rear differential slip as well as transmitted power to the front axle. [...] The magnesium alloy wheels were unique, being hollow inside to form a sealed chamber contiguous with the tire and equipped with a built-in tire pressure monitoring system.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, the Rogue {{comes in}} S and SV trim in front- or <b>all-wheel-drive,</b> {{and in a}} {{top-line}} SL trim in <b>all-wheel-drive.</b>|$|E
