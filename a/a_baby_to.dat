5|$|Norving (previously Varangfly) started {{offering}} {{flights to}} the closed-down military airport in 1970 using their newly delivered Britten-Norman Islander. The background was a landing at the airfield to transport <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> Kirkenes Hospital. The Civil Aviation Administration {{stated that they}} were not opposed to building smaller ambulance airports, but that the state's priority was constructing a network of regional airports. The service started off with a daily round trip ordered by the district physician; patients had priority, but the airline would transport other passengers as well. After a month a second daily round trip was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Premastication, pre-chewing, or kiss feeding is the act {{of chewing}} food {{for the purpose of}} {{physically}} breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the food by themselves. This is often done by the mother or relatives of <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> produce baby food capable of being consumed by the child during the weaning process. The chewed food {{in the form of a}} bolus is transferred from the mouth of one individual to another, either directly mouth-to-mouth, via utensils, hands, or is further cooked or processed prior to feeding.|$|E
5|$|The heart can be {{affected}} by congenital diseases. These include failure of the developmental foramen ovale to close, present in up to 25% of people; ventricular or atrial septal defects, congenital diseases of the heart valves (e.g. congenital aortic stenosis) or disease relating to blood vessels or blood flow from the heart (such as a patent ductus arteriosus or aortic coarctation).; These may cause symptoms {{at a variety of}} ages. If unoxygenated blood travels directly from the right to {{the left side of the}} heart, it may be noticed at birth, as it may cause <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> become blue (cyanotic) such as Tetralogy of Fallot. A heart problem may impact a child's ability to grow. Some causes rectify with time and are regarded as benign. Other causes may be incidentally detected on a cardiac examination. These disorders are often diagnosed on an echocardiogram.|$|E
5000|$|There is <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> boom of {{the post-war}} United States; an overworked stork (a clear Jimmy Durante reference) gets drunk in the Stork Club. There is an {{emergency}} delivery in which inexperienced animals, mostly older animals but including four crows attempting to deliver an elephant, take the <b>babies</b> <b>to</b> their parents. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>babies</b> are getting sent to the wrong parents (such as <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> skunk <b>to</b> <b>a</b> goose, <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> kitten <b>to</b> <b>a</b> duck, <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> gorilla <b>to</b> <b>a</b> kangaroo, <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> hippopotamus <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Scottish Terrier, <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> alligator <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pig and <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> cat <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mouse). To clear up the confusion, Porky Pig is brought in to manage the factory, with Daffy Duck as his assistant. The babies are seen going through a conveyor belt (to the tune of Raymond Scott's famous [...] "Powerhouse") and getting sent by various animals, while Daffy mans the phones, making quick references to Bing Crosby, Eddie Cantor and the Dionne Quintuplets.|$|R

5|$|The {{perspective}} now hovers {{high above}} Tokyo and enters an airplane, where Oscar's mother breast-feeds <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> whom she whispers Oscar's name. The view then drops to Linda and Alex, who take {{a taxi to}} a Tokyo love hotel and have sex. The perspective moves among hotel rooms and observes several other couples having sex in various positions. Each couple emanates a pulsating electric-like pink glow from their genitals. Oscar enters Alex's head and witnesses the sex with Linda from Alex's point of view. He then travels inside Linda's vagina to witness Alex's thrusting, then observes his ejaculation and follows the semen into the fertilization of his sister's ovum. The final scene is shot {{from the perspective of}} a baby being born to Oscar's mother. (According to the director, this is a flashback to Oscar's own birth in the form of a false memory).|$|E
5|$|Libby is {{involved}} in a motorbike accident that leaves her with a small chance of carrying <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> full term. Susan and Karl break the news to her. Libby later falls pregnant and gives birth to Susan and Karl's first grandchild, Ben (Noah Sutherland). Susan almost loses her job as principal when a student reports her for assault; however, the case is later dropped. Susan's nephew Darcy Tyler becomes partner in Karl's surgery and plots to sell the business to a clinic chain. Darcy tells Karl and Susan what he is doing, and Susan is furious with her nephew. Susan's sister, Liz (Christine Keogh), leaves her daughter Elly (Kendell Nunn) with the Kennedys for a brief time; Elly later joins her mother in Sweden. Susan slips on some spilt milk and wakes up with retrograde amnesia. She loses thirty years of her memory and believes she is sixteen and the year is 1972. Susan goes through months of counselling to try and regain her memory. During this time, she tells Karl that she does not like him and she goes missing when she tries to find an old boyfriend. Susan begins having flashbacks and starts to regain her memory. Libby's husband Drew Kirk (Dan Paris) dies and Susan finds it hard to comfort her daughter. Susan grows closer to Karl and he asks her to renew their vows. During the ceremony, Susan's memory returns.|$|E

25|$|Land Rover gave UK pram company Pegasus a licence {{to produce}} a three-wheeler range of Land Rover ATP pushchairs. The design {{reflected}} the heritage of the marque, with a light metal frame with canvas seating, held together with push-studs and tough simple parts like brakes and hinges. They could be collapsed completely flat, with wheels removed in seconds. The basic frame could be adapted with modules to allow <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> lie flat or a bubble windscreen to completely enclose the child. The frame also came in long or short-handled versions, and could be repaired with home tools. The design was simple, light, and rugged and able to travel in all terrains (hence the ATP for all-terrain pushchair.) It came in three military looking colours: a light blue, a sand colour and olive drab. Production was discontinued in 2002.|$|E

25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E
25|$|The company's history also {{includes}} many stories, {{such as one}} about a Good Humor vendor rushing <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> a hospital for treatment and one about the company's helping {{to break up a}} counterfeit money operation on Long Island. During World War II, a Good Humor truck was assigned to follow one of the armies during maneuvers. The commander could not understand how the opposing artillery was quickly locating his position until he realized that the spotters were using the white Good Humor truck as a guide. Rather than deny his troops ice cream, that night he ordered the truck to be painted army green. After the war, a Good Humor vendor took pity on a youngster who was a nickel short and accepted a new magazine in place of the missing five cents. When he returned the next day, the street was lined with stacks of magazines piled by children eager to exchange periodicals for Good Humors.|$|E
25|$|In April 1912, Helene married Felix Deutsch. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Helene experienced {{the first of many}} miscarriages. In The Psychology of Women, Helene discussed the concept of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage as a result of psychological factors, with a critical factor involving the 'pregnant woman's unconscious rejection of an identification with her own mother.' Under the pseudonym of a patient named Mrs. Smith, Helene {{tells the story of a}} woman who has trouble bringing <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> full term. Helene wrote that Mrs. Smith was the youngest child of a large family, where her mother's disappointment that she was not a boy was evident. Mrs. Smith, however, took solace in the deep love of her father and older sister. When she married and wanted to have a child, Mrs. Smith had difficulty reconciling her desire for a child with her mother's rejection of her. When she was about to become a mother herself, Mrs. Smith's fear about identifying with her mother intensified. This fear came to fruition when Mrs. Smith gave birth to a still born child one month before full term.|$|E

According to Grace, her relatives had taken her to the house of Thomas Walshman and his wife, from whom they had stolen <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> <b>to</b> suck its blood. Grace claimed that the child died the following night, and that after its burial at Samlesbury Church Ellen and Jennet dug up the body and took it home, where they cooked and ate some of it and used the rest to make an ointment that enabled them to change themselves into other shapes.|$|E
