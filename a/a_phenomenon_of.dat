25|$|In {{the first}} book of his Meteorology, Aristotle propounded the view of comets that would hold sway in Western thought for nearly two {{thousand}} years. He rejected the ideas of several earlier philosophers that comets were planets, {{or at least a}} phenomenon related to the planets, on the grounds that while the planets confined their motion to the circle of the Zodiac, comets could appear in any part of the sky. Instead, he described comets as <b>a</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> the upper atmosphere, where hot, dry exhalations gathered and occasionally burst into flame. Aristotle held this mechanism responsible for not only comets, but also meteors, the aurora borealis, and even the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|In Etruria, the pseudo-red-figure {{style was}} not just <b>a</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> the {{earliest}} phases, {{as it had been}} in Attica. Especially during the 4th century, some workshops specialised in this technique, although true red-figure painting was widespread among Etrurian workshops at the same time. Notable workshops include the Sokra Group and the Phantom Group. The Sokra Group, somewhat older, preferred bowls with interior decoration of Greek mythical themes, but also some Etruscan motifs. The phantom Group mainly painted cloaked figures combined with vegetal or palmette ornamentation. The workshops of both groups are suspected to have been in Caere, Falerii and Tarquinia. The Phantom Group produced until the early 3rd century BC. Like elsewhere, the changing tastes of the customers eventually led to the end of this style.|$|E
25|$|However, when a {{significant}} {{destruction of the}} vegetation takes place (of natural origin such as an avalanche or human origin), the disturbance undergone by the ecosystem is too important. In this latter case, erosion {{is responsible for the}} destruction of the upper horizons of the ground, and is at the origin of <b>a</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> reversion to pioneer conditions. The phenomenon is called retrogression and can be partial or total (in this case, nothing remains beside bare rock). For example, the clearing of an inclined ground, subjected to violent rains, can lead to the complete destruction of the soil. Man can deeply modify the evolution of the soils by direct and brutal action, such as clearing, abusive cuts, forest pasture, litters raking. The climax vegetation is gradually replaced and the soil modified (example: replacement of leafy tree forests by moors or pines plantations). Retrogression is often related to very old human practices.|$|E

25|$|There {{are plenty}} of causes {{that lead to the}} {{occurrence}} of this yet to be solved this global issue. Among them, globalisation is the main cause undeniably. Globalisation originally symbolises a worldwide trend that helps to balance the economy between developed and developing countries, however the unfair outsourcing attempts of manufacturing labour from rich to the poor countries have led to extreme poverty which is defined as living on less than US$1 a day. (Atal, 2015) Balko (2010) suggests that when the world markets are opened to free trade under globalisation, <b>a</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> “race to the bottom” happens. Sweatshop is an obvious example of such phenomenon. Without transnational guidelines and regulations, large corporations in developed countries are moving their manufacturing plants to the countries that are more vulnerable, such as with less environmental restrictions and lower labour standards. To meet the demands and compete for the patronage, factories in developing countries start to lower their labour regulations by providing minimum wages and ignoring workplace safety requirements. As a result, workers in developing countries face the hardship while the large corporations gain profit.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there were}} a handful of clubs that allowed space for the {{performance}} of traditional folk music by the early 1950s, its major boost came from the short-lived British skiffle craze, from about 1956-8. New clubs included the ‘Ballad and Blues’ club in a pub in Soho, co-founded by Ewan MacColl. As the craze subsided from the mid-1950s many of these clubs began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material. Many became strict ‘policy clubs’, that pursued a pure and traditional form of music. By the mid-1960s there were probably over 300 in Britain. Most clubs were simply a regular gathering, usually in the back or upstairs room of a public house on a weekly basis. They were largely <b>a</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> the urbanised middle classes and known for the amateur nature of many performances. There were also ‘residents’, who performed regular short sets of songs. Many of these later emerged as major performers in their own right, including A. L. Lloyd, Martin Carthy, and Shirley Collins. A later generation of performers used the folk club circuit for highly successful mainstream careers, including Billy Connolly, Jasper Carrott, Ian Dury and Barbara Dickson. The number of clubs began to decline in the 1980s, in the face of changing musical and social trends. But the decline began to stabilize in the mid-1990s with the resurgence of interest in folk music and there are now over 160 folk clubs in the United Kingdom, including many that can trace their origins back to the 1950s.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} very surface layers, the {{atmosphere}} {{is in a state}} of vigorous circulation. The upper layer of troposphere exhibits <b>a</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> super-rotation, in which the atmosphere circles the planet in just four Earth days, much faster than the planet's sidereal day of 243 days. The winds supporting super-rotation blow at a speed of 100m/s (~360km/h or 220mph) or more. [...] Winds move at up to 60 times the speed of the planet's rotation, while Earth's fastest winds are only 10% to 20% rotation speed. On the other hand, the wind speed becomes increasingly slower as the elevation from the surface decreases, with the breeze barely reaching the speed of 10km/h (2.8m/s) on the surface. Near the poles are anticyclonic structures called polar vortices. Each vortex is double-eyed and shows a characteristic S-shaped pattern of clouds. Above there is an intermediate layer of mesosphere which separates the troposphere from the thermosphere. The thermosphere is also characterized by strong circulation, but very different in its nature - the gases heated and partially ionized by sunlight in the sunlit hemisphere migrate to the dark hemisphere where they recombine and downwell.|$|E
