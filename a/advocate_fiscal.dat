40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{resurgence}} of discretionary fiscal policy in the fiscal theory of the price level (FTPL) framework. Despite its reliance on the new consensus macroeconomic (NCM) framework, the FTPL concludes that fiscal policy may lead monetary policy without hampering macroeconomic stability. We show that an empirical model deriving from this theory gives very interesting results: in France and the United Kingdom, fiscal policy has positive long-run effects. This {{is at odds with}} the orthodox nature of FTPL promoters who usually <b>advocate</b> <b>fiscal</b> rules and sanctions. We interpret our results as being consistent with Post Keynesian economic thinking. We conclude that the move of some economists from the NCM school of thought in favor of discretionary fiscal policy has promoted the visibility of Post Keynesian ideas on this topic. fiscal policy, fiscal theory of the price level, French economy, structural VAR, UK economy,...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend Nordhaus’ (1994) results to an {{environment}} which {{is characterized by}} a single monetary authority and several fiscal bodies, as is currently the case in Europe in Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). We show two results. First, cooperation among national fiscal authorities is welfare improving only if they also cooperate with the central bank. If this condition is not satisfied, fiscal rules, such as those of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, may work as coordination devices that improve welfare. Second, the fiscal authorities of the small countries participating in EMU will have no incentives to discipline themselves, since each of them faces a vertical monetary authority reaction function. Though {{it is well known that}} fiscal authorities free-ride (see, e. g. Uhlig 2002), we prove this conventional wisdom in an original way, namely by using a modified version of the Nordhaus model. We also show that such a conclusion emerges precisely when the other well-established result of the Pareto superiority of fiscal leadership with respect to a non-coordinated (Nash) solution no longer applies (since with a vertical monetary authority reaction function the two equilibria coincide). The resulting policy-mix will therefore be inefficient, unless small countries coordinate their fiscal behaviour. Since that is unlikely, as they are expected to free-ride, we <b>advocate</b> <b>fiscal</b> rules to apply to small countries as well...|$|E

50|$|Hansen {{frequently}} {{testified before}} Congress. He advocated against using unemployment to control inflation. He argued that inflation could {{be managed by}} timely changes in tax rates and the money supply, and by effective wage and price controls. He also <b>advocated</b> <b>fiscal</b> and other stimuli {{to ward off the}} stagnation that he thought was endemic to mature, industrialized economies. Hansen was not without his critics, however; journalist John T. Flynn, for example, argued that Hansen's policies were de facto fascism, sharing alarming similarities with the economic policy of Benito Mussolini, the dictator of Italy.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1922, Douglas agreed to run as a {{candidate}} for one of the Jerome area's seats in the Arizona State House of Representatives. Though lacking political experience, his wealth, family name, and record of war service were decisive factors in his favor, as he won both a contested primary and the subsequent general election. Douglas served a single two-year term in the state legislature. A conservative Democrat, Douglas <b>advocated</b> <b>fiscal</b> responsibility and opposed labor legislation. He also objected to the recently signed Colorado River Compact, and proposed an amendment empowering the state to tax electricity produced within its borders.|$|R
50|$|In 1947 Gray {{announced}} he would seek the seat left vacant by Goodwyn's retirement, and Sussex County clerk William B. Cocke Jr. (acclaimed with Gray for helping elect Watkins Abbitt to the U.S. Congress the previous year) decided not to run. Gray promoted pine as a farm product and served as State Ruritan president, as well as national President in 1948-1949. He also worked with fellow lumber industry officials who also served as state officials, including future governor Thomas B. Stanley of Stanley Furniture and Hugh Camp. By 1949, the newly elected Senator Gray was also vehemently <b>advocating</b> <b>fiscal</b> responsibility.|$|R

40|$|Fiscal {{rules were}} {{supposed}} to provide a simple remedy for out-ofcontrol government spending.

Certainly, many advanced democracies have improved their fiscal performance-but fiscal rules have played a small role in this process.

30|$|The {{compensation}} hypothesis {{holds that}} as demand for social protection increases {{in times of}} crisis, more resources will be directed towards adequate protection (Shahidi 2015). Indeed, empirical studies confirm that {{in the wake of}} the crisis, discretionary support was ubiquitous: countries initially turned towards Keynesian measures in the immediate aftermath of the crisis (Marchal et al. 2014 a; Vis et al. 2011; Chung and Thewissen 2011). The European Commission and the IMF <b>advocated</b> <b>fiscal</b> stimuli and explicitly mentioned income support as a valid crisis strategy, as increases in transfers to the poor were deemed more likely to feed through in aggregate demand (European Commission 2008; Spilimbergo et al. 2008). In addition, Dolls et al. (2012) argue that discretionary support was relatively more substantial in countries where social protection was less well developed to start with.|$|R

25|$|Lawton {{most often}} backed the {{policies}} of Truman. He joined with Truman in fighting a fair trade bill in Congress. Lawton supported a requested merger of Pan American World Airways and American Overseas Airlines, a plan that Truman initially opposed, but then passed over {{the recommendation of the}} Civil Aeronautics Board. Lawton vocally opposed plans to decentralize the federal offices in Washington, D.C., spreading them throughout the country so that an enemy attack would not cripple the entire national government. Lawton argued that there was a shortage of office space around the country that made the plans impossible to implement. Lawton often removed himself from debates, treating his job as a technical and administrative one. While he <b>advocated</b> <b>fiscal</b> restraint, he mostly found ways of carrying out Truman's policies, rather than arguing for them. He sought less publicity than his predecessors.|$|R
50|$|Family - The CPS <b>advocates</b> that <b>fiscal</b> {{policy should}} be {{reformed}} to support marriage through the tax system and to remove the welfare penalty on two-parent families.

40|$|The usual {{description}} of Keynes's macroeconomics as {{relying on the}} postulate of money wage stickiness to explain unemployment, and <b>advocating</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy as its cure, is largely mythical. Rather he was concerned with exploring the theoretical idea that an economy co- ordinated by monetary exchange is prone to market failures that create unemployment. The origins of this idea in what Keynes called "classical" economics {{can be traced back}} {{at least as far as}} John Stuart Mill, though he himself preferred to claim the much less orthodox Malthus as his antecedent. Be that as it may, Keynes's own emphasis on income and employment variations as both the result of and the "solution" to specifically inter-temporal failures was highly original. The idea that monetary exchange might involve co-ordinatioin failures of any sort has now largely disappeared from macroeconomics, under the influence of New-classical economics. macroeconomics; Keynesian economics; markets; money; interest rates; unemployment; multiplier...|$|R
