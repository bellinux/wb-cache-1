5|$|It prefers basins <b>and</b> <b>desert</b> areas vegetated with Chinese {{tamarisk}} (Tamarix chinensis), brush, or poplar (Populus), {{along the}} peripheries of rivers {{that surround the}} mountains in the Taklamakan Desert. This distribution of the Yarkand hare is ring shaped. It also uses reed vegetation along rivers for shelter, and tends to avoid agricultural fields. About 200,000 individuals are estimated to inhabit the Tarim Basin.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a common}} plant in many types of habitats, {{including}} chaparral, oak woodland, xeric scrub, temperate valleys, disturbed areas, <b>and</b> <b>deserts</b> including the Mojave <b>Desert</b> <b>and</b> Sonoran <b>Desert.</b>|$|R
50|$|They grow in {{different}} habitats as shores, salt marshes <b>and</b> <b>deserts</b> in mediterranean climate to forests, steppes <b>and</b> <b>deserts</b> in climates with summer rains, from the Sahara to the alpine zone in Central Asia. Very often they grow in dry, saline or disturbed (ruderal) sites.|$|R
5|$|Many Hispanic servicewomen served {{overseas}} during Operations Desert Shield <b>and</b> <b>Desert</b> Storm. Among {{the many}} women who served was Captain Haydee Javier Kimmich from Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. Capt. Kimmich was the highest ranking Hispanic female in the Navy at the time. She was assigned as the Chief of Orthopedics at the Navy Medical Center in Bethesda and she reorganized their Reservist Department during the war.|$|E
5|$|On 24 November Allenby {{ordered the}} relief of the three {{divisions}} of the EEF's XXI Corps <b>and</b> <b>Desert</b> Mounted Corps. In order to move such large formations a pause was unavoidable and so the attack was discontinued, but von Falkenhayn and his Ottoman Army took notice of the temporary cessation of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Soriano {{served with}} {{infantry}} units throughout the United States, Korea, and in Germany. Later Soriano was a liaison officer during operations Desert Shield <b>and</b> <b>Desert</b> Storm, and deployed during Operation Joint Endeavor; {{he retired in}} March 2005. Since retiring from the Army, Soriano {{has worked for the}} aerospace and defense technology company Northrop Grumman and has sat on various boards of directors.|$|E

50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation <b>and</b> <b>deserts.</b>|$|R
5|$|All four {{species have}} {{extensive}} ranges and large populations, {{and the increasing}} use of artificial nest sites has enabled range expansion. The rock martin often breeds in lowland <b>and</b> <b>desert</b> towns, the Eurasian crag martin's range is expanding in Austria, Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and the dusky crag martin is spreading northeastwards into Guangxi, south into lowland Laos, and westwards to the hills and plains of Sindh. There is also a recent unconfirmed report from Cambodia. Their large ranges and presumed high numbers mean that none of the crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Armies facing {{service in}} {{different}} theatres may need several different camouflage uniforms. Separate issues of temperate/jungle <b>and</b> <b>desert</b> camouflage uniforms are common. Patterns can {{to some extent}} be adapted to different terrains by adding means of fastening pieces of vegetation to the uniform. Helmets often have netting covers; some jackets have small loops for the same purpose. Being able to find appropriate camouflage vegetation or in other ways modify the issued battle uniform to suit the local terrain is an important skill for infantry soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage <b>and</b> <b>desert</b> vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, allow it to thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
50|$|They {{are usually}} found in {{subtropical}} areas <b>and</b> <b>deserts.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1945 Rossen {{joined a}} picket line against Warner Bros, making {{an enemy of}} Jack Warner. Rossen signed a {{contract}} with an independent production company formed by Hal Wallis, who had previously been Warner Bros.' head of production. However Rossen wrote only two full scripts for this company, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers in 1946 <b>and</b> <b>Desert</b> Fury in 1947. In The Strange Love of Martha Ivers Rossen used a short story by John Patrick to introduce the main plot, which was set fifteen years later and which Rossen wrote himself. The relationship between Rossen and Wallis broke down when Rossen received offers from other production companies.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, 1,700 Puerto Rican National Guardsmen {{were among}} the 20,000 Hispanics {{deployed}} to the Persian Gulf in Operations Desert Shield <b>and</b> <b>Desert</b> Storm {{as part of the}} Gulf War. Four Puerto Ricans lost their lives, including Captain Manuel Rivera, Jr. of the Marine Corps, a Puerto Rican from the South Bronx, who on January 22, 1991 became the first Marine, and therefore the first Hispanic, to be killed in Operation Desert Shield. Rivera was killed during a support mission over the Persian Gulf. On January 30, 1991, the U.S. House of Representatives paid tribute to Rivera.|$|E
5|$|Native fish in Fossil Creek include {{headwater}} chub, roundtail chub, speckled dace, longfin dace, Sonora sucker, <b>and</b> <b>desert</b> sucker. Between 2007 and 2010, the Arizona Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service added native spikedace, loach minnows, Gila topminnows, and razorback suckers {{as well as}} more longfin dace {{above the}} barrier. All except speckled dace are special-status fish listed as endangered, threatened, or sensitive by federal or state agencies. In addition, more than 100 macroinvertebrate species live in the Fossil Creek watershed. One, the fossil springsnail, is listed sensitive by the U.S. Forest Service.|$|E

5|$|Other {{defensive}} {{strategies are}} {{the use of}} camouflage, fleeing, and aggression. Some species have adopted colourings, shapes, and patterns that {{make it difficult for}} predators that hunt by sight to detect them. They tend to be dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into their background, <b>and</b> <b>desert</b> species tend to be pale. Some species can fly, but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{communities}} {{within the}} park vary with elevation. The TMD has two distinct communities, desert scrub—such as fourwing saltbush and brittlebrush—at the lowest elevations <b>and</b> <b>desert</b> grassland a little higher. The RMD includes these two communities as well as four more at higher elevations, oak woodland, pine–oak woodland, pine forest and, high in the Rincons, mixed conifer forest—Douglas-fir, Ponderosa pine, white fir, Gambel oak, and many other trees, shrubs, and understory plants. During annual inventories in 2011 and 2013, hundreds of scientists and thousands of volunteers identified 389 species of vascular plants, 25 of non-vascular plants, and 197 species of fungi in Saguaro National Park.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Colonel Maritza Sáenz Ryan, who {{had participated}} in both Operations Desert Shield <b>and</b> <b>Desert</b> Storm, became the first woman and first Hispanic West Point {{graduate}} to serve as an academic department head. She also has the distinction of being the most senior ranking Hispanic Judge Advocate and has been instrumental in raising awareness of the inequity and impracticality of the Combat Exclusion Policy, which restricts women's roles and opportunities in the military regardless of talent or ability.|$|E

50|$|The Azores High (also {{known as}} the Bermuda High), is {{associated}} with the Mediterranean climate found in the Mediterranean Basin, the Sahara <b>Desert,</b> <b>and</b> Arabian <b>Desert</b> (as well as that of the Azores, Canary Islands, and other eastern Atlantic islands). The South Atlantic High is similarly associated with the Namib <b>Desert</b> <b>and</b> Kalahari <b>Desert,</b> <b>and</b> the Mediterranean climate of the western part of South Africa. The North Pacific High is related to the North American deserts: the Mojave Desert, Great Basin <b>Desert,</b> Sonoran <b>Desert,</b> <b>and</b> Chihuahuan <b>Desert,</b> <b>and</b> maintains the Mediterranean climate found in the interior of California. The South Pacific High correlates to the Atacama <b>Desert</b> <b>and</b> Central Chile's climate, while the Indian Ocean High controls southwestern Australia's climate.|$|R

5|$|The Köppen {{classification}} {{depends on}} average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The {{most commonly used}} form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, <b>and</b> <b>desert.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} (Tyto alba) {{is the most}} widely {{distributed}} species of owl {{and one of the}} most widespread of all birds. It is also referred to as the common barn owl, to distinguish it from other species in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical owls (Strigidae). The barn owl is found almost everywhere in the world except polar <b>and</b> <b>desert</b> regions, Asia north of the Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and some Pacific islands.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{was called}} to support the {{multinational}} response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. The brigade grew to a 7,700 soldier force composed of three groups, ten battalions, four separate companies, and eight detachments in support of XVIII Airborne Corps during Operations Desert Shield <b>and</b> <b>Desert</b> Storm. The brigade completed 1,500 combat heavy battalions equivalent days of work constructing roads, airfields, heliports, ammunition/fuel/water storage points, life support areas and forward landing strips, distributed over ten million maps, trained over 5,000 coalition engineers, and supported the French attack on Assalman airfield. During follow-on missions the brigade destroyed over 6,000 enemy bunkers and one million tons of munitions.|$|E
