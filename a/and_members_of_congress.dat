5|$|There's no {{question}} in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm's way.|$|E
5|$|The smog catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air pollution as a serious health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air pollution control. Prompted by the smog, President Lyndon B. Johnson <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> worked to pass federal legislation regulating air pollution in the United States, culminating in the 1967 Air Quality Act and the 1970 Clean Air Act. The 1966 smog is a milestone that has been compared with other pollution events, including {{the health effects of}} pollution from the September 11 attacks and pollution in China.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1999, President Bill Clinton offered {{conditional}} clemency to sixteen {{members of}} the FALN convicted for conspiracy to commit robbery, conspiracy to bomb-making, and sedition, {{as well as for}} firearms and explosives violations. None of the sixteen were convicted of bombings or any crime which injured another person, and all of the sixteen had served nineteen years or longer in prison, which was a longer sentence than such crimes typically received, according to the White House. Clinton offered clemency, on condition that the prisoners renounce violence, at the appeal of 10 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, President Jimmy Carter, the Archbishop of New York, and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico. The commutation was opposed by U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and criticised by many including former victims of FALN terrorist activities, the Fraternal Order of Police, <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b> Hillary Clinton in her campaign for Senator also criticised the commutation, although she had earlier been supportive.|$|E

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 18thcentury, many of {{the silver}} dollars {{produced}} by the Mint were shipped to and circulated or melted in China in order to satisfy the great demand for silver bullion in that nation. In 1800, silver deposits once again began to decline, and the total silver dollar output for that year was 220,920. In 1801, following complaints from the public <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> regarding the lack of small change in circulation, Boudinot began requesting that silver depositors receive smaller denominations rather than the routinely requested silver dollars, in an effort to supply the nation with more small change. Production dropped to 54,454 silver dollars in 1801 and 41,650 in 1802, after Boudinot was able to convince many depositors to accept their silver in the form of small denominations. Although silver bullion deposits at the Mint had increased, Boudinot attempted to end silver dollar production in 1803, favoring half dollars instead. Mintage of the 1803 dollar continued until March 1804, when production of silver dollars ceased entirely. In total, 85,634 dollars dated 1803 were struck. Following a formal request from the Bank of the United States, Secretary of State James Madison officially suspended silver dollar and gold eagle production in 1806, although minting of both had ended two years earlier.|$|E

25|$|Baldridge's {{claims of}} {{unlimited}} executive power created {{a firestorm of}} negative opinion on April 26.

25|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} to federal agencies <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> however, {{that the federal}} government had to restore control over architectural design and development in areas adjacent to the sites proposed for parks and buildings in the McMillan plan. Without this regulatory control, unsuitable development would quickly render the National Mall, city parks, and other areas useless for the purposes envisioned by the Senate Park Commission.|$|E
25|$|Congress {{is split}} into two chambers—House and Senate—and manages the task of writing {{national}} legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas. Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary {{organizations such as the}} Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress to help provide it with information, <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.|$|E

Attempts were made to organize in Lowndes County, but fear of the Klan there was so intense from previous violence and murders that blacks would not support a nonviolent campaign in great number, even after Dr. King made a personal appearance on March 1.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} unfolded {{against the}} backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi. Some experts, officials, <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> have contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping. In response, Clinton has said that her use of personal email was in compliance with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts, though not their own private email servers.|$|E

25|$|Critics of Social Security {{have said}} that the {{politicians}} who created Social Security exempted themselves from having to pay the Social Security tax. When the federal government created Social Security, all federal employees, including the president <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress,</b> were exempt from having to pay the Social Security tax, and they received no Social Security benefits. This law was changed by the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which brought within the Social Security system all members of Congress, the president and the vice president, federal judges, and certain executive-level political appointees, as well as all federal employees hired in any capacity on or after January 1, 1984. Many state and local government workers, however, are exempt from Social Security taxes because they contribute instead to alternative retirement systems set up by their employers.|$|E
25|$|Three months later, in April 1957, House and Senate {{subcommittees}} {{overseeing the}} District of Columbia voted {{to approve the}} Foggy Bottom site as well. The Senate followed suit in May, but the House refused to appropriate money to purchase the land. Eight months later, with the Auditorium Commission defunct, a number of civic leaders <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> proposed that the cultural center be built on a site on the National Mall south of the National Gallery of Art (where the National Air and Space Museum is now). This proposal proved so unwelcome that Congress shifted again and chose the Foggy Bottom site for the cultural center. President Eisenhower signed legislation creating the National Cultural Center (later renamed the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts) on September 2, 1958.|$|E
500|$|Following Jackson's {{election}} to the presidency in 1828, Eaton resigned his Senate seat to join Jackson's cabinet as Secretary of War. [...] Eaton and his wife Peggy {{became the focus of}} controversy during Jackson's first term; in the so-called Petticoat affair, Washington's society wives refused to socialize with the Eatons. [...] The wives of the vice president, cabinet members, <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> looked down on Peggy because of the circumstances of her marriage to Eaton; they had wed shortly after the death of her first husband, without waiting for the usual mourning period, giving rise to rumors that she had been unfaithful to her first husband before his death. [...] Eaton resigned as Secretary of War as part of a strategy to resolve the controversy; he later received appointments as Governor of Florida Territory and U.S. Minister to Spain.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of April 14, 1868, the Lincoln statue was moved from Flannery's studio to City Hall. [...] The covered statue was guarded by police so {{no one could see}} it before the {{dedication}} ceremony the following day. [...] On April 15, all of the city's offices were closed at noon and all flags were flown at half-staff. [...] An estimated 20,000 people, around 20% of Washington's population, attended the dedication. [...] Dignitaries at the dedication included President Andrew Johnson, General Ulysses S. Grant, General William Tecumseh Sherman, and General Winfield Scott Hancock. [...] Supreme Court Justices <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> were not in attendance because Johnson's impeachment trial was taking place. [...] A Masonic ceremony, along with music and prayers, took place at the dedication before the main speech by Major General Benjamin Brown French. [...] Following the speech, Washington mayor Richard Wallach introduced Johnson, who uncovered the statue. [...] The crowd cheered, followed by more music and finally a benediction.|$|E
500|$|Of the 100 B-1Bs built, 93 {{remained}} in 2000 after losses in accidents. In June 2001, the Pentagon sought to place {{one-third of its}} then fleet into storage; this proposal resulted in several U.S. Air National Guard officers <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> lobbying against the proposal, including the drafting of an amendment to prevent such cuts. The 2001 proposal was intended to allow money to be diverted to further upgrades to the remaining B-1Bs, such as computer modernization. In 2003, accompanied by the removal of B-1Bs from the two bomb wings in the Air National Guard, the USAF decided to retire 33 aircraft to concentrate its budget on maintaining availability of remaining B-1Bs. [...] In 2004, a new appropriation bill called {{for some of the}} retired aircraft to return to service, and the USAF returned seven mothballed bombers to service to increase the fleet to 67 aircraft. Currently (Sept 2017) the Air Force retains an active inventory of 62 aircraft assigned to squadrons at Dyess AFB, Texas and Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota.|$|E
500|$|The {{rollback}} device gained {{its name}} when President Richard Nixon sought to appoint Senator William Saxbe as Attorney General following the Saturday Night Massacre. Elliot Richardson resigned on October 20, 1973 and Nixon nominated Saxbe on November 1. Saxbe was chosen {{in large part}} because, despite the confrontations of the ongoing Watergate scandal, Nixon felt the Senate would want to confirm one of their own. Saxbe had been a senator in 1969 when the Congress passed a pay increase from $35,000 to $60,000 for Cabinet members. According to , [...] "After considering the report and recommendations of the Commission submitted under section 357 of this title, the President shall transmit to Congress his recommendations {{with respect to the}} exact rates of pay, for offices and positions within the purview of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of section 356 of this title, which the President considers to be fair and reasonable…" [...] The President transmitted [...] "Salary Recommendations For 1969 Increases" [...] to Congress on January 15, 1969 following the first Commission Report submitted to him under [...] in December 1968. (34 F.R. 2241; [...] ). Saxbe had become a Senator on January 3, 1969 and on February 14 the legislation became law when Congress took no action to veto the proposal that raised the salary of top executive branch officials, the judicial branch <b>and</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress.</b>|$|E
