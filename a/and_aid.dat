40|$|The HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> {{pandemic}} <b>and</b> {{its impact}} on socio-economic development in South Africa {{led to the development}} of the broad National Strategic Plan (NSP 2007 - 2011) with the aim to guide the country’s response to the pandemic. This document was the second plan post 1994, to deal with the pandemic, the first one being the NSP 2000 - 2005. However, despite addressing the HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> pandemic since the 1990 s, national statistics indicate that the country still grapples with curbing the spread of new HIV infections. The goal of the study was to investigate the alignment of the FBOs HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> service delivery with the NSP 2007 - 2011 in Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (EMM). To achieve this goal, the study conceptualised and analysed the NSP 2007 - 2011 with regards to its implications for partnerships in addressing the HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> pandemic within the context of the social development approach. The study investigated the Faith-Based Organisations (FBOs) HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> service delivery, the main partners in the field and policy implementation, to establish the extent of their service alignment with the NSP 2007 - 2011 and to identify and describe elements required for service delivery necessary for alignment to the policy. A qualitative research approach, using a collective case study design was utilised for the study. Data was gathered by means of two focus group interviews with the HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> Projects’ managers/coordinators in the employment of the Christian-based FBOs in Ekurhuleni. Findings showed that most FBOs HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> service delivery focus on the management of the disease, and as a result neglect the grassroots and fundamental integrative prevention services. Some difficulties in the partnership between FBOs and government were found by the study, coupled with poor communication between government and FBOs leading to the isolation of FBOs in rendering HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> services. Research findings further revealed poor application of the NSP 2007 - 2011 elements of effective communications, partnerships, service coordination, monitoring and evaluation including provision of support through financial resources by government to enhance FBOs HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> service delivery. The study concluded that the FBOs service delivery in the field of HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> in EMM is not in full alignment with the NSP 2007 - 2011. Furthermore, it was established that without an application of the developmental approach to facilitate the implementation of the NSP elements, FBOs HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> service delivery in alignment with the NSP 2007 - 2011, will be difficult to achieve. The study recommended that the NSP implementation must be based on the social development model to facilitate HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> service delivery linkages amongst government departments on a broad range of the interrelated development issues caused by the pandemic. It was also recommended that future National Strategic Plans should include social developmental themes, to ensure improved alignment of FBOs HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> service delivery, namely, a rights-based approach; partnerships; economic and social development; participation and a macro and micro focus. In particular, it was noted that government needs to strengthen its partnership with the FBOs and to provide intensified funding towards HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> service delivery. Further research should be conducted to establish how the NSP 2012 - 2016 (RSA, 2012) has incorporated these recommendations in order to fill the gaps identified in this study.

5|$|Hydroxyl megamasers {{occur in}} the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and {{appear to be a}} marker in the stage of the {{formation}} of galaxies. As hydroxyl emission is not subject to extinction by interstellar dust in its host LIRG, hydroxyl masers may be useful probes of the conditions where star formation in LIRGs takes place. At redshifts of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed hydroxyl megamasers. Detection of hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift, <b>and</b> <b>aid</b> understanding of star formation in these objects.|$|E

40|$|D. Phil. This enquiry {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} understand {{the ways in which}} the ecology of ideas surrounding HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> in post-apartheid South Africa functions discursively to silence people living with the dis-ease. In this regard, it seeks to understand how the range of subject positions available to people with HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> influences their opportunities for treatment and disclosure. The meanings emerging from this enquiry have implications for interventions aimed at people living with HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids,</b> in that they challenge the liberal humanism underpinning a Western individualist paradigm which constructs people as ‘rational’ and ‘responsible’ on the basis that such constructions tend to attribute guilt or moral culpability to people living with HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids.</b> The conversations <b>and</b> narratives elicited in the process of this enquiry suggest that such discourses constitute a form of disciplinary power in a Foucauldian sense, positioning people living with HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> defensively <b>and</b> limiting their options for ‘positive’ self-definition by foreclosing available subject positions, thereby contributing to the spread of HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids.</b> Hence, this enquiry focuses on social constructions of morality and the impact of these on participants’ attempts to maintain key relationships that afford them a ‘positive’ sense of them-selves. Thus, it looks at experiences of connection and dis-connection and explores the ways in which efforts to retain ‘relatedness’ in order to maximise possibilities for the co-construction of a ‘moral self’ mediate opportunities for disclosure and treatment options. The enquiry aimed to assist participants in deconstructing dominant social constructions of HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> implicit in cultural and political discourse by applying a critical, poststructuralist and discourse-analytic lens in order that they might resist moral attributions based on liberal humanism and access their own voices in narrating the experience of living with HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> in keeping with their lived experience. My aim in this regard was to resurrect alternative or previously silenced accounts and to open up spaces for a multiplicity of meanings associated with HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> to emerge <b>and</b> be heard, toward the end of breaking the silence and creating a conversational space in which people’s meanings could simultaneously be heard and challenged through dialogue. Ultimately, this enquiry highlights the importance of attempting to understand the local and idiosyncratic nature of people’s constructions of HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids,</b> which are often a hybrid mix of ideas and meanings circulating within social, cultural and political discourse. It also underscores the salience of considering people’s lives in context and particularly their need to maintain relationships that afford a positive sense of self. This is reflected in the tendency for participants to construct their identities in relation to significant others and for these relationships to mediate decision making in relation to HIV <b>and</b> <b>Aids</b> by availing or foreclosing certain subject positions, depending on the discourses within which they are situated...|$|R
