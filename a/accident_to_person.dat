40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a nationally}} {{established}} mechanism for surveillance of accidents {{operating in a}} sample of accident and emergency (A&E) departments but no equivalent in primary care. Reduction of <b>accidents</b> presenting <b>to</b> hospitals or family doctors is a target set out in the Department of Health's Our Healthier Nation document. AIMS: To assess the merit and feasibility of collecting information on accidents in primary care, and documentation of the range and severity of accidents presenting. DESIGN OF STUDY: General practitioner (GP) reports following <b>accidents</b> <b>to</b> <b>persons</b> presenting <b>to</b> primary care. SETTING: GPs in six large practices in the Midlands (69, 000 registered patients) completed questionnaires for 1233 persons sustaining accidents at home or during leisure activity during one year from September 1997. RESULTS: Main outcome measures were validation of results and description of the type of <b>accidents</b> presenting <b>to</b> primary care. Recruitment varied considerably between practices, but it was not possible for this to be validated, chiefly because of the limitations of morbidity coding systems. Overall, 18 per 1000 registered persons a year reported an <b>accident</b> initially <b>to</b> the GP, approximately one-sixth of the number presenting to A&E departments. Nine-tenths of the injuries reported were trivial or minor. There were similarities between GP and A&E patients concerning the mechanism or location of injury, but proportionately more elderly and females presented to primary care. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of accidents in primary care is possible, but the discipline required for reliable data capture is considerable and hindered by limitations of morbidity coding systems regarding accidents. However, there are important differences in terms of the types of accidents and injuries seen and the age and sex of persons presenting in primary care and A&E departments...|$|R

We propose to integrate existing technologies and mobile devices into a cooperative system which is able to detect critical situations and execute preventive counteractive measures such as warn traffic participants. The paper starts with an analysis of the different types of accidents in a detailed accident study using the GIDAS database and reports of local accidents with pedestrians. With regard to the different types of accidents {{it is important to consider}} the reasons for each situation.

Almost everyone {{participates in the}} road traffic day by day. Among the participants occur many dangerous and egoistic individuals, who do not observe the road traffic regulations. Theirs irresponsible behaviour often results in car <b>accidents</b> and damage <b>to</b> <b>person</b> and property. One of means to improvement of the road safety is efficient punishment of driving offences. I have divided my thesis into introduction, five chapters and conclusion. The introduction briefly introduces the problematic. In the second chapter I have paid attention to definition of terms "road user", "duties of road users in traffic" and "legal consequence of violation the duty". In the third chapter I have dealed with driving offences. Offence {{is one of the}} administrative torts, which is defined by Offence Act no. 200 / 1990 Coll. It is unlawful action which violates or endangers protected interests of society. Driving offences violate or endanger safety and fluency of the road traffic.

5000|$|In April 1855 a National Association of Factory Occupiers {{was formed}} [...] "to watch over factory {{legislation}} {{with a view}} to prevent any increase of the present unfair and injudicious enactments". The 1844 Act had required that [...] "mill gearing" [...] - which included power shafts - should be securely fenced. Magistrates had taken inconsistent views as to whether this applied where the [...] "mill gearing" [...] was not readily accessible; in particular where power shafting ran horizontally well above head height. In 1856, the Court of Queen's Bench ruled that it did. In April, 1856, the National Association of Factory Occupiers succeeded in obtaining an Act reversing this decision: mill gearing needed secure fencing only of those parts with which women, young persons, and children were liable to come in contact. (The inspectors feared that the potential hazards in areas they did not normally access might be obvious to experienced men, but not be easily appreciated by women and children who were due the legislative protection the 1856 Act had removed, especially given the potential severe consequences of their inexperience. An MP speaking against the Bill was able to give multiple instances of <b>accidents</b> <b>to</b> protected <b>persons</b> resulting in death or loss of limbs - all caused by unguarded shafting with which they were supposedly not liable to come into contact - despite restricting himself <b>to</b> <b>accidents</b> in mills owned by Members of Parliament (so that he could be corrected by them if had misstated any facts). (Dickens thereafter referred to the NAFO as the National Association for the Protection of the Right to Mangle Operatives. Harriet Martineau criticised Dickens for this, arguing that mangling was the result of workers not being careful and: [...] "If men and women are to be absolved from the care of their own lives and limbs, and the responsibility put upon anybody else by {{the law of the land}}, the law of the land is lapsing into barbarism")) For other parts of the mill gearing any dispute between the occupier and the inspector could be resolved by arbitration. The arbitration was to be by a person skilled in making the machinery to be guarded; the inspectors however declined to submit safety concerns to arbitration by those [...] "who look only to the construction and working of the machinery, which is their business,and not to the prevention of accidents, which is not their business" ...|$|R
