40|$|The linearly {{increasing}} {{stress test}} (LIST) {{was used to}} study the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) behavior {{of a range of}} pipeline steels in carbonate-bicarbonate solution under stress rate control at different applied potentials. Stress corrosion cracking, at potentials below - 800 mV(SCE), was attributed to hydrogen embrittlement. Stress corrosion cracking, in the potential range from about - 700 to - 500 mV(SCE), was attributed to an <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>mechanism.</b> In the anodic potential region, the SCC initiation stress was larger than the yield stress and was associated with significant plastic deformation at the cracking site. The relative SCC initiation resistance decreased with increasing yield strength. In the cathodic potential region, the SCC initiation stress was smaller than the yield stress of steel; it was approximately equal to the stress at 0. 1 pct strain (sigma(0. 1 pct) for all the steels. The original surface was more susceptible to SCC initiation than the polished surface...|$|E
40|$|Based on a fractographic {{analysis}} of fatigue crack propagation (FCP) in Al-Li-Cu alloy 2090 stressed {{in a variety}} of inert and embrittling environments, microscopic crack paths are identified and correlated with intrinsic da/dN-delta K kinetics. FCP rates in 2090 are accelerated by hydrogen producing environments (pure water vapor, moist air, and aqueous NaCl), as defined in Part 1. For these cases, subgrain boundary fatigue cracking (SGC) dominates for delta K values where the crack tip process zone, a significant fraction of the cyclic plastic zone, is sufficiently large to envelop 5 micron subgrains in the unrecrystallized microstructure. SGC may be due to strong hydrogen trapping at T 1 precipitates concentrated at sub-boundaries. At low delta K, the plastic zone diameter is smaller than the subgrain size and FCP progresses along (100) planes due to either local lattice decohesion or aluminum-lithium hydride cracking. For inert environments (vacuum, helium, and oxygen), or at high delta K where the hydrogen effect on da/dN is small, FCP is along (111) slip planes; this mode does not transition with increasing delta K and plastic zone size. The SGC and (100) crystallographic cracking modes, and the governing influence of the crack tip process zone volume (delta K), support hydrogen embrittlement rather than a surface film rupture and <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>mechanism</b> for environmental FCP.

An <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proposed which involves a surface film of W 205 that is further oxidized to WO 3 and dissolves by hydrolyzation. Tungsten (1) {{is one of the}} so-called "valve metals" which are distinguished by their abil ity to form highly protective oxide films upon anodic polarization in many aqueous media. Studies of its electrochemical behavior have appeared infrequently in the l iterature for over 100 years. A bibliography and brief review of much of the early work appears in a paper by Koerner (2). Koerner also reported extensive open-circuit potential measurements of the W electrode and observations of its anodic behavior in various acids and bases. The potentials were dependent on the type of W used, the electrolyte pH, and also showed some variation with the nature of the electrolyte. The former dependence was attributed to the presence of appreciable oxides in the metal and the latter to the effect of specific ions on the solubility of the dissolved W species, primari ly W(OH) 6. This compound was believed to break down to tungstic cations in acidic electrolytes and anions in basic.

It was shown that the electrochemical <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> follows a common Tafel line with a slope of ca. 120 mV dec- 1, independent of the solution pH and the hydrodynamics, while the passivation potentials and passivation currents were independent on hydrodynamics but strongly dependent on the pH. In parallel with the electrochemical dissolution, a considerable “anomalous ” or chemical Cr dissolution process occurs, {{as evidenced by the}} spectrophotometric analyses of the electrolytes for Cr ions after prolonged potentiostating of the electrodes at different potentials, as well as by measuring the electrode weight losses.

40|$|Nickel alloys such as Alloy 600 undergo Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) in {{pure water}} at {{temperatures}} between about 260 C {{and the critical}} point. Increasing the level of Cr in Ni-Fe-Cr alloys increases SCC resistance in aerated and deaerated water. The mechanism is not understood. The effect of Cr composition on oxide microstructure and corrosion kinetics of Ni-Fe-Cr alloys was determined experimentally, to evaluate whether the anodic dissolution model for SCC can account for the effect of Cr on SCC. The alloy corrosion rate and corrosion product oxide microstructure is strongly influenced by the Cr composition. Corrosion kinetics are parabolic and influenced by chromium concentration, with the parabolic constant first increasing then decreasing as Cr increases from 5 to 39 %. Surface analyses using Analytical Electron microscopy (AEM) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) show that the corrosion product film that forms initially on all alloys exposed to high purity high temperature water is a nickel rich oxide. With time, the amount of chromium in the oxide film increases and corrosion proceeds toward {{the formation of the}} more thermodynamically stable spinel or hexagonal Cr-rich oxides, similar to high temperature gaseous oxidation. Due to the slower diffusion kinetics at the temperatures of water corrosion compared to those in high temperature gaseous oxidation, however, the films remain as a mixture of NiO, mixed Ni, Fe and Cr spinels, NiCrO{sub 3 } and FeCrO{sub 3 }. As the amount of Cr in the film increases {{and the nature of the}} film changes from NiO to spinel or hexagonal oxides, cation diffusion through the films slows, slowing the corrosion rate. These observations are qualitatively consistent with an anodic dissolution SCC mechanism. However, parametric modeling of the SCC growth process, applying available creep, oxide rupture strain and corrosion kinetics data, indicates that the <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>mechanism</b> accounts for only a fraction of the effect of Cr on SCC resistance...|$|E
40|$|Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) {{can occur}} in {{engineering}} structures where stressed metallic parts are in contact with an aggressive environment, {{and can lead to}} catastrophic failures. High strength steels are particularly susceptible; increasing yield strength significantly decreases the threshold stress intensity factor, KISCC. As a consequence, SCC of high strength steels has been widely studied and is an on-going effort. In this doctoral dissertation, an effort was made to understand the SCC behaviour of two high strength steels, namely 4340 and 3. 5 NiCrMoV steel under the following conditions: (1) SCC behaviour in aerated 90 ºC distilled water. (2) SCC behaviour in aerated 30 ºC distilled water. (3) SCC behaviour under hydrogen charging conditions. Stress corrosion cracking experiments were conducted using the Linearly Increasing Stress Test (LIST), which was developed as part of this dissertation. LIST is an improved form of the Constant Extension Rate Test (CERT) and was used to study both crack initiation and crack propagation under the above experimental conditions. In addition, a potential drop method was developed to determine the threshold stress at which crack initiation occurred. The fracture surface morphologies were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Because the cracking is intergranular in the system of interest, localized electrochemical measurements were performed to determine the grain boundary electrochemical properties using micro-reference electrodes, and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measurements were carried out to determine the grain boundary composition and the presence of grain boundary precipitates that could aid intergranular crack growth. LIST experiments conducted in 90 and 30 ºC distilled water showed that SCC occurred at all the applied stress rates for 4340 steel, while for 3. 5 NiCrMoV steel SCC did not occur at applied stress rates greater than 0. 034 MPa s- 1 in 90 ºC water and 0. 002 MPa s- 1 in 30 ºC water. For the 4340 steel in 90 ºC water, the threshold stress at which cracks initiated was controlled by the development of corrosion pits at lower applied stress rates. At both temperatures, it was shown that the applied stress rate controlled the crack tip strain rate. The crack velocity increased with the increase in the applied stress rate and the crack tip strain rate; the maximum crack velocity at both temperatures corresponded to the plateau crack velocity, vII, determined from fracture mechanics tests at the same temperatures. Moreover, no effect of the steel composition on the crack velocity could be identified for the steels under investigation in the present work, indicating a similar rate limiting step that was independent of steel composition for both steels. Finally the fracture surface morphology was mostly intergranular in both steels, and the applied stress rate did not influence the intergranular fracture surface morphology. Under hydrogen charging conditions, LISTs performed on as-quenched 4340 and 3. 5 NiCrMoV steels indicated that cracking occurred at all applied stress rates for both steels in contrast to the trends for experiments in 90 ºC and 30 ºC distilled water at open circuit potential where cracking did not occur at higher applied stress rates. The dynamic charging decreased the fracture stress and the threshold stress much more dramatically than that in the prior tests, however both stresses were still dependent on the applied stress rate. The measured crack velocity increased with increasing applied stress rate and the crack tip strain rate, and no effect of the steel composition on the crack velocity could be identified for the steels under investigation in the present work, indicating a similar rate limiting step that was independent of steel composition for both steels. Moreover, the exponents of the least square fit data were similar to those from 90 ºC and 30 ºC distilled water experiments, indicating that the same rate limiting step could be operating in all three sets of experiments. Finally, the fracture surface morphology was mostly intergranular fracture, with a significant amount of plasticity at higher applied stress rates. The results from the grain boundary potential measurements using Ag/AgCl micro-reference electrodes, on the as quenched 3. 5 NiCrMoV steel at room temperature indicated that some grain boundary potentials were more negative than their grain interiors, and the potential difference between the filmed and the film free surface was of the order of 1 V. These results suggest that, thermodynamically, the grain boundaries can dissolve preferentially and there was sufficient driving force for this dissolution, thus supporting the possibility of the <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>mechanism</b> in this steel. SIMS imaging of as-quenched 4340 steel specimens before and after cathodic charging indicated the presence of carbides in the steel. Hydrogen appeared to be trapped at the carbide particles. Sulphides were present as discrete particles; however they did not appear to {{play a significant role in}} trapping hydrogen. The presence of carbides at the grain boundaries and the hydrogen trapped by the carbides could contribute to the anodic dissolution and hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms of stress corrosion cracking. In summary the results presented in this dissertation indicate that the applied stress rate controlled the crack-tip strain rate and that the crack velocity was dependent on both the crack tip strain rate and the applied stress rate. The maximum crack velocities increased with the increase in the applied stress rates, to a maximum of vII measured with fracture mechanics tests. Because no effect of the steel composition on the crack velocity could be identified for the steels under investigation in the present work and was dependent only on the crack-tip strain rate, the rate-limiting step for the crack propagation was controlled by the crack-tip strain rate. The grain boundary potential measurements and SIMS analysis of the grain boundaries indicate that the grain boundaries can thermodynamically provide favourable crack propagation path, thus explaining the intergranular nature of the cracking observed in this study...|$|E

To study the <b>dissolution</b> <b>mechanism</b> electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used, in addition, a wide range of spectroscopic, for instance, UV-Visible and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and microscopic techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 3 D Optical microscopy were used. The <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> of copper in Ethaline and C₄mimCl was studied. It is shown that the speciation of dissolved copper at the interface region are [CuCl₃]⁻ and [CuCl₄]²⁻ and the EG controls the structure of interface.

The impact of additives, such as water and CuCl₂. 2 H₂O on the copper dissolution in Ethaline were examined. The former affected the quality of electropolished copper and the latter decreased the dissolution rate. The second stage of the study involved the study of eight metals, Ag, Au, Co, Fe, Ni, Pb, Sn and Zn in Ethaline and C 4 mimCl at 20 °C and 70 °C. Film formation occurred on almost all metals surface.

40|$|Although {{numerous}} {{mechanistic studies}} have been conducted {{over the past three decades}} that have correlated stress corrosion cracking (SCC) susceptibility with various parameters, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the SCC susceptibility of aluminum-magnesium-zinc-copper alloys is still lacking. Most mechanistic theories support either an <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> type of <b>mechanism</b> or a hydrogen embrittlement type of mechanism but within each of these two types of environmentally induced cracking (EIC) mechanisms there is little consensus on the mechanistic details and it seems likely that both <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> and hydrogen embrittlement phenomena play critical roles in the EIC of 7 xxx aluminum alloys. From 1996 to 2000, a multidisciplinary research program was carried out by researchers from University of Virginia, Lehigh University, and Alcoa Technical Center to study the EIC mechanisms in 7 xxx series aluminum alloys. The results of this program provided new evidence to support critical roles of both hydrogen embrittlement and <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution.</b> The role of hydrogen was supported by establishing a correlation between hydrogen uptake and Stage II crack growth rates (CGR), demonstrating Arrhenius dependence of crack growth in humid air, and establishing a correlation between changes in the activation energy for bulk or volume diffusion of hydrogen with temper and corresponding changes in activation energy for crack growth. The primary evidence for an <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> contribution to the SCC process is the observation that development of an aggressive localized environment at the crack tip is a pre-requisite for high crack growth rates. In this study, crack growth rates in humid air (90 %RH) were measured for AA 7050 isothermally aged at 325 ¢ªF for various times. Ln-ln plots of CGR as a function of aging time show linear relationships. However, a distinct change in slope after ~ 10 hours of aging indicates a change in the rate controlling process for environmentally induced cracking (EIC). TEM analyses of AA 7050 under the same aging conditions and mechanically strained 2 % indicate that the change in the slope of the CGR behavior coincides with the transition in the dislocation glide behavior from predominantly particle shearing and planar slip to homogeneous, wavy slip. The correlation between a change in the rate controlling process for EIC and the change in the slip character suggests that crack velocity may be controlled by the rate of dislocation transport of hydrogen. Quantitative evaluation of the results shows the dependence of CGR on the precipitation and growth processes via the Avrami equation.

This behavior can be rationalized by addition of a ferromagnetic energy term to the activation energies. A model is proposed based {{on the existence of}} paramagnetic surface layers below the Curie temperature and the consequent introduction of an energy gradient for the transport of electrons to and from the metal surface. The influence of the metal of an electrode on electro-chemical reaction rates is of interest both to electro...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical Machining (ECM) {{is based}} on the <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> of {{metallic}} work pieces under the influence of an electric current and an electrolyte. To apply the principle of <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> for micro and precision machining a high localization of the electric current density is necessary. In this study two selected strategies are presented to realize these high localised <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> process. The first strategy {{is based on}} a reduction of the gap between electrode and work piece down to approximately 10 ìm. In such small workings gaps an electrolyte flow is nearly not possible. This challenge can be solved by help of a combination of pulsed electric current and a vibrating electrode, which is known as PECM. The second strategy is Electrochemical Machining with closed electrolytic free jet, called Jet-ECM. In Jet-ECM the electric current is directly localized by the position of the electrolyte jet itself. In this paper the limits and possibilities of both strategies from the perspective of tool manufacturing are summarized and compared...|$|R
40|$|A cathode-anode {{arrangement}} {{for use in}} an electrolytic cell is adapted for electrochemically refining spent nuclear fuel from a nuclear reactor and recovering purified uranium and a mixture of uranium and plutonium {{for use as a}} fresh blanket and core fuel in a nuclear reactor. The arrangement includes a plurality of inner <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> baskets that are each attached to a respective support rod, are submerged in a molten lithium halide salt, and are rotationally displaced. An inner hollow cylindrical-shaped cathode is concentrically disposed about the inner <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> baskets. Concentrically disposed about the inner cathode in a spaced manner are a plurality of outer <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> baskets, while an outer hollow cylindrical-shaped cathode is disposed about the outer <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> baskets. Uranium is deposited from the anode baskets in a uniform cylindrical shape on the inner and outer cathode cylinders by rotating the anode baskets within the molten lithium halide salt. Scrapers located on each anode basket abrade and remove the spent fuel deposits on the surfaces of the inner and outer cathode cylinders, with the spent fuel falling {{to the bottom of the}} cell for removal. Cell resistance is reduced and uranium collection efficiency enhanced by increasing the electrode area and reducing the anode-cathode spacing for enhanced trapping and recovery of uranium dendrites scraped off of the cylindrical cathodes which may be greater in number than two...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{measured}} the variations of potentials and current densities for several polymers. The results were carefully examined to identify various {{factors such as}} temperature and pH to influence the poten-tial and rate. The Tafel slope for <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> was determined by the polarization effect under these con-ditions. The optimum conditions were established for each case. The second anodic current density peak and maximum current density were designated as the relative polarization sensitivity (Ir/If). The mass-transfer coef-ficient value (α) was determined by the Tafel slope for <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> {{on the basis of the}} polarization effect under optimum conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} solid-sintered silicon carbide was investigated under high current densities in alkaline solutions. The use of potentiodynamic {{as well as}} chronoamperometric measurements show that the <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> takes place as a transpassive mechanism under formation of a metastable passive layer. At high polarization potentials (≈ 150 [*]V), the dielectric breakdown of the passive layer which was primarily formed on the surface initiates an <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> of sintered silicon carbide at high current densities. Complementary material diagnostics (optical microscopy and SEM/EDX investigation) clearly show significant material removal as well as remaining oxide layer thicker than the native oxide film...|$|R
40|$|When the {{residual}} water content of currently used C 104 - electropolishing solution {{is reduced to}} less than 0. 1 g/l, the <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> of beryl l ium fol-lows Faraday's law with a valence of one over an extended range of anodic po-tentials.

40|$|A {{mechanism}} for the (photo) <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> of silicon in HF containing solutions is proposed, which explains the dependence of both the photocurrent quantum yield and the efficiency for hydrogen evolution on the flux of absorbed photons. The model assumes that the chemical oxidation of an Si(II) intermediate to an Si(IV) product, which is accompanied by {{the formation of a}} hydrogen molecule, is catalyzed by a mobile Si(I) dissolution intermediate. The surface chemistry, corresponding to the proposed <b>mechanism</b> of <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution,</b> is discussed.
