[...] Guitarist Kim Thayil jokingly called it the [...] "Heavy Metal White Album". Cornell said, [...] "I think there's songs on the new record which are almost more commercially viable because they have that memorable feel to them, and I think if anyone expected us {{to come out and}} make something more commercial than Louder Than Love, then I'm glad that they were surprised." [...] Cornell also added that the album was more representative of how the band was live.

A later Guardian critic, Peter Bradshaw, named it the best comedy film of all time, commenting that [...] "this wonderfully funny, unbearably sad film is a miracle of comic writing and inspired film-making". John Marriott of the Radio Times believed that Annie Hall was the film where Allen [...] "found his own singular voice, a voice that echoes across events with a mixture of exuberance and introspection", referring to the [...] "comic delight" [...] derived from the [...] "spirited playing of Diane Keaton as the kooky innocent from the Midwest, and Woody himself as the fumbling New York neurotic".

The band released the resulting album, Badmotorfinger, on October 8, 1991. Steve Huey of Allmusic said that the songwriting on Badmotorfinger [...] "takes <b>a</b> <b>quantum</b> <b>leap</b> in focus and consistency". He added, [...] "It's surprisingly cerebral and arty music for a band courting mainstream metal audiences." [...] Thayil suggested that the album's lyrics are [...] "like reading a novel [...] man's conflict with himself and society, or the government, or his family, or the economy, or anything". The first single from Badmotorfinger, [...] "Jesus Christ Pose," [...] garnered attention when MTV decided to ban its music video in 1991. The song and its video outraged many listeners who perceived it as anti-Christian. The band received death threats while on tour in the United Kingdom {{in support of the}} album. Cornell explained that the lyrics criticize public figures who use religion (particularly the image of Jesus Christ) to portray themselves as being persecuted. Although eclipsed {{at the time of its}} release by the sudden popularity of Nirvana's Nevermind, the focus of attention brought by Nevermind to the Seattle scene helped Soundgarden gain wider attention. The singles [...] "Outshined" [...] and [...] "Rusty Cage" [...] were able to find an audience on alternative rock radio and MTV.
