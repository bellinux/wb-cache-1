5|$|Many {{types of}} tear gas and other riot control agents have been {{produced}} with effects ranging from mild tearing of the eyes to immediate vomiting and prostration. CN and CS are {{the most widely used}} and known, but around 15 different types {{of tear gas}} have been developed worldwide e.g. <b>adamsite</b> or bromoacetone, CNB, and CNC. CS has become the most popular due to its strong effect. The effect of CS on a person will depend on whether it is packaged as a solution or used as an aerosol. The size of solution droplets {{and the size of the}} CS particulates after evaporation are factors determining its effect on the human body.|$|E
25|$|Each of the CAIS held {{between one}} and five {{different}} chemical agents. The agents used in CAIS were phosgene, <b>adamsite,</b> lewisite, cyanogen chloride, chloroacetophenone, sarin, nitrogen mustard, sulfur mustard and chloropicrin. In addition, triphosgene, a phosgene simulant, and ethyl malonate, a tabun simulant were also used. Sarin was the only nerve agent used in CAIS.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, in the {{following}} years, chemical weapons were used in several, mainly colonial, wars where one side had an advantage in equipment over the other. The British used poison gas, possibly <b>adamsite,</b> against Russian revolutionary troops beginning on August 27, 1919 and contemplated using chemical weapons against Iraqi insurgents in the 1920s; Bolshevik troops used poison gas to suppress the Tambov Rebellion in 1920, Spain used chemical weapons in Morocco against Rif tribesmen throughout the 1920s and Italy used mustard gas in Libya in 1930 and again during its invasion of Ethiopia in 1936. In 1925, a Chinese warlord, Zhang Zuolin, contracted a German company to build him a mustard gas plant in Shenyang, which was completed in 1927.|$|E

The main opposition to Jackson, the new president, was the National Republican Party, or Anti-Jacksonians created {{and run by}} Henry Clay. It shared the same nationalistic outlook as the <b>Adamsites,</b> and wanted to use national resources to build a strong economy. Its platform was Clay's American System of nationally financed internal improvements and a protective tariff, which would promote faster economic development. More important, by binding together the diverse interests of the different regions, the party intended to promote national unity and harmony.|$|R
2500|$|A large {{variety of}} organoarsenic {{compounds}} are known. Several were developed as chemical warfare agents during World War I, including vesicants such as lewisite and vomiting agents such as <b>adamsite.</b> Cacodylic acid, {{which is of}} historic and practical interest, arises from the methylation of arsenic trioxide, a reaction that has no analogy in phosphorus chemistry.

5000|$|Diphenylchlorarsine {{was used}} as a {{chemical}} weapon on the Western front during the trench warfare of World War I. It belongs to the class of chemicals classified as vomiting agents. Other such agents are diphenylcyanoarsine (DC) and diphenylaminechlorarsine (DM, <b>adamsite).</b> Diphenylchlorarsine was sometimes believed to penetrate the gas masks of the time and to cause violent sneezing, forcing removal of the protecting device. The Germans called it [...] "Maskenbrecher", [...] "mask breaker", together with other substances with similar effect: <b>Adamsite,</b> diphenylarsincyanide, diphenylaminarsincyanide. Fortunately, this gas did not actually penetrate masks any better than other gases.|$|E

50|$|<b>Adamsite</b> {{is usually}} {{dispersed}} as an aerosol, making the {{upper respiratory tract}} the primary site of action. Although the effects {{are similar to those}} caused by typical riot control agents (e.g. CS), they are slower in onset but longer in duration, often lasting for 12 or more hours. After a latency period of 5-10 minutes irritation of the eyes, lungs and mucous membranes develops followed by headache, nausea and persistent vomiting.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adamsite</b> or DM is {{an organic}} compound; technically, an arsenical diphenylaminechlorarsine, {{that can be}} used as a riot control agent.

50|$|There {{have been}} differing interpretations {{over whether the}} {{protocol}} covers the use of harassing agents, such as <b>adamsite</b> and tear gas, and defoliants and herbicides, such as Agent Orange, in warfare. The 1977 Environmental Modification Convention prohibits the military use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban {{on the use of}} herbicides in warfare, but it does require case-by-case consideration. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention effectively banned riot control agents from being used as a method of warfare, though still permitting it for riot control.|$|E
50|$|Since before WWII AsH3 was {{proposed}} {{as a possible}} chemical warfare weapon. The gas is colorless, almost odorless, and 2.5 times denser than air, as required for a blanketing effect sought in chemical warfare. It is also lethal in concentrations far lower than those required to smell its garlic-like scent. In spite of these characteristics, arsine was never officially used as a weapon, because of its high flammability and its lower efficacy {{when compared to the}} non-flammable alternative phosgene. On the other hand, several organic compounds based on arsine, such as lewisite (β-chlorovinyldichloroarsine), <b>adamsite</b> (diphenylaminechloroarsine), Clark I (diphenylchloroarsine) and Clark II (diphenylcyanoarsine) have been effectively developed for use in chemical warfare.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for chemical weapons {{to be used}} in terrorism is a real possibility. Classes of chemical weapons include nerve agents, vesicants (blister agents), choking agents, incapacitating agents, riot control agents, blood agents, and toxic industrial chemicals. The nerve agents work by blocking the actions of acetylcholinesterase leading to a cholinergic syndrome. Nerve agents include sarin, tabun, VX, cyclosarin, and soman. The vesicants include sulfur mustard and lewisite. The vesicants produce blisters and also damage the upper airways. Choking agents include phosgene and chlorine gas. Choking agents cause pulmonary edema. Incapacitating agents include fentanyl and its derivatives and <b>adamsite.</b> Riot control agents include Mace and pepper spray. Blood agents include cyanide. The mechanism of toxicity for cyanide is blocking oxidative phosphorylation. Toxic industrial chemicals include agents such as formaldehyde, hydrofluoric acid, and ammonia...|$|E
40|$|After the World War II, approx. 40. 000 tonnes of {{chemical}} munitions containing about 13. 000 tonnes {{of chemical}} warfare agents (CWAs) were {{dumped in the}} Baltic Sea [1]. As the artillery shells, aircraft bombs and containers are corroding, the contents are leaking into the environment contaminating the surrounding sediments but also spreading far beyond the dumpsite boundaries [2]. Thus, the necessity of investigations {{on the impact of}} chemical warfare on biota, such as inorganic arsenic and organo-arsenic compounds, is increasing. Among the dumped CWAs are the vesicant mustard gas (Bis(2 -chloroethyl) sulfide), the tear gas chloroacetophenone (2 -Chloro- 1 -phenylethanone) as well as the irritants Clark I (Diphenylarsinechloride) and <b>Adamsite</b> (10 -Chloro- 5 -hydrophenarsazine(10)) [3]. Persistent contaminations at dumping sites are mostly related to arsenic containing compounds [2]. Thus, arsenic containing CWAs have been chosen as model CWAs in the present study. Here, we present the first approach to investigate biological effects of CWA mixtures on the health of blue mussels (M. trossulus) under laboratory conditions. The evaluation of the health status was based on a great array of biomarkers encompassing immunocompetence, oxidative stress defence and pathological alterations in different tissues.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the results of}} geophysical and chemical investigations carried out in a chemical munition dumpsite in the southern Baltic Sea, east of the island of Bornholm. After WW 2 over 32, 000  tons of chemical war material was dumped here including shells and bombs as well as small drums and containers. The geophysical investigations combined very-high-resolution seismics and gradiometric measurements. The results indicate {{the presence of a}} large number of objects buried just below the seafloor. The size of the objects and their distribution, with a marked increase in density towards the center of the dumpsite, suggests that we are dealing with dumped war material. Sediment and near-bottom water samples, taken within the dumpsite and in the surrounding area, were analysed for the presence of various chemical warfare agents (CWA) including <b>Adamsite,</b> Clark, sulphur mustard, tabun, chlorobenzene and arsine oil. The results indicate a widespread contamination that reaches far beyond the dumpsite boundary. CWA degradation products were found in most of the sediment samples. The contamination was mostly related to arsenic containing compounds; only one sample indicated the presence of sulfur mustard. Although the correlation between detected objects and CWA concentrations is not always straightforward, the overall results suggest that a lot of the dumped war material is leaking and that over the years the contamination has reached the seafloor sediments...|$|E
