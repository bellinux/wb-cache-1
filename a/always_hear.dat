500|$|King {{would have}} {{appointed}} [...] "Jihad" [...] as the group's nomination in the [...] "Best Metal Performance" [...] award category at the 49th Grammy Awards, deeming the chosen track [...] "Eyes of the Insane" [...] "the poorest representations" [...] {{of the group}} on ninth studio album Christ Illusion. Despite King's statement, [...] "Eyes of the Insane" [...] won Slayer their first Grammy award. The Slayer guitarist has also stated; [...] "I like playing 'Jihad' because I'm back changing my guitars, and Jeff starts it and he starts it quietly so {{you can hear the}} fans go crazy about it and you can't <b>always</b> <b>hear</b> that {{at the beginning of a}} song." ...|$|E
500|$|He started {{alongside}} Hall of Fame center Dave Cowens, {{who enjoyed}} playing with Washington, remarking, [...] "It's great fun, you can <b>always</b> <b>hear</b> him grunt when he's rebounding." [...] Auerbach said, [...] "Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing {{he could say}} or do {{was going to change}} the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E
500|$|A career-high 23 goals led Suter's 81-point {{campaign}} in 1992–93, but he again struggled {{with a pair}} of knee injuries that caused him to miss three months of the 1993–94 season and limited him to 25 games for the Flames. His tenure with Calgary ended on March 10, 1994, when the team included him in a six-player trade. [...] The Flames sent Suter, along with Paul Ranheim and Ted Drury, to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for James Patrick, Zarley Zalapski and Michael Nylander. The move surprised Suter: [...] "Calgary's meant a great deal to me. You <b>always</b> <b>hear</b> how trades are part of the game and that you don't have any control over them. When it happens, it's a shock. It just blows me away." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1912 Barrett was {{selected}} by Kenney to help run the WPSU national campaign, following the raid by police on Clement's Inn and Christabel Pankhurst's subsequent flight to Paris. Barrett moved back to London {{and within a few}} months she was given the role of assistant editor of the WSPU newspaper, The Suffragette, on its launch in October 1912. Writing in her autobiography Barrett described becoming an editor as [...] "an appalling task as I knew nothing whatever of journalism". By taking on the job she also took on the risks connected with the increasingly militant WSPU. She travelled under cover to Paris to meet with Christabel Pankhurst, and when speaking to her on the phone she recalled how she [...] "could <b>always</b> <b>hear</b> the click of Scotland Yard listening in." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2011 {{documentary}} The Other F Word, Flea {{discussed the}} joys of being a father by saying [...] "It's funny how you <b>always</b> <b>hear</b> people saying that classic parent attitude of, 'I brought you into this world, I gave you life!' You know, it's just, I think, completely the opposite. My kids gave me life. They gave me a reason." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{when he goes}} to {{join the}} queer lady in the window, Joel accepts his destiny, which is to be homosexual, to <b>always</b> <b>hear</b> other voices and live in other rooms. Yet {{acceptance}} is not a surrender; it is a liberation. [...] "I am me", he whoops. [...] "I am Joel, we are the same people." [...] So, in a sense, had Truman rejoiced when he made peace with his own identity.|$|E

"It is the envious {{outsider}} who {{has never}} received an invitation, like myself," [...] some one remarked, [...] "who probably spreads these rumours, for one <b>always</b> <b>hears</b> it hinted that some disgraceful and illegal exhibition is on tap there--a new sort of drugging party, or some novel form of debauchery." ...|$|R
2500|$|Beyoncé penned a {{personal}} note: [...] "Donna Summer made music that moved me both emotionally and physically {{to get up}} and dance. You could <b>always</b> <b>hear</b> the deep passion in her voice. She was so much more than the queen of disco she became known for, she was an honest and gifted singer with flawless vocal talent. I've always been a huge fan and was honored to sample one of her songs. She touched many generations and will be sadly missed. My love goes out to her family during this difficult time. Love, B".|$|E
2500|$|When Kusama was 13 years old, she {{was sent}} {{to work in a}} {{military}} factory where she was tasked with sewing and fabricating parachutes for the Japanese army, then embroiled in World War II. Discussing her time in the factory, Kusama says that she spent her adolescence [...] "in closed darkness" [...] although she could <b>always</b> <b>hear</b> the air-raid alerts going off and see American B-29s flying overhead in broad daylight. Her childhood was greatly influenced by the events of World War II, and she claims that it was during this period that she began to value notions of personal and creative freedom.|$|E
2500|$|After abandoning Wicked Stepmother {{and with}} no further film offers (though she was keen to play the centenarian in Craig Calman's The Turn Of The Century and worked with him on {{adapting}} the stage play to a feature-length screenplay), Davis appeared on several talk shows and was interviewed by Johnny Carson, Joan Rivers, Larry King, and David Letterman, discussing her career, but refusing to discuss her daughter. Her appearances were popular; Lindsay Anderson observed that the public enjoyed seeing her behaving [...] "so bitchy": [...] "I always disliked that because she was encouraged to behave badly. And I'd <b>always</b> <b>hear</b> her described by that awful word, feisty." ...|$|E

2500|$|Humperdinck's {{recording}} {{career has}} {{continued into the}} new century, with new albums {{and a range of}} musical collaborations. In 2000, he hit the top five of the British album charts with Engelbert at His Very Best, and returned to the top five four years later, after he appeared in a John Smith's TV-advertisement. In the spring of 2003, Humperdinck collaborated with Grammy Award-winning artist-producer Art Greenhaw to record the roots gospel album <b>Always</b> <b>Hear</b> the Harmony: The Gospel Sessions; joining Humperdinck on the album were the Light Crust Doughboys, the Jordanaires and the Blackwood Brothers. The critically acclaimed album was nominated for a Grammy for [...] "Best Southern, Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album of the Year", while Humperdinck was photographed with generations of fans at the 2004 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. He was back in the studio soon after, releasing Let There Be Love in 2005. Music critics have remarked on the historical span of material in the album, from songs first made popular in the 1920s to more recent ones from the 1990s, and point especially to Humperdinck's version of Nick Lowe's [...] "You Inspire Me" [...] as a noteworthy cut. In 2007, Humperdinck released The Winding Road. In a conversation with Larry King, Humperdinck discussed the genesis of the album; he pointed out that The Winding Road featured songs exclusively by British composers, as a [...] "tribute to [...] home country", released as it was to mark 40 years since his first international hit recording.|$|E
