We analyzed parent-reported anxiety <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> problems in 6, 783 pairs of twins at 2 -, 3 -, and 4 -years of age.

The aggregate anxiety <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> ratings correlated. 33 for boys and. 30 for girls.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes {{the effectiveness of}} the U. S. Marine Corps' proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks as measures of job performance for promotion decisions. The analysis uses big data techniques (factor analysis) and multivariate regressions on data of 360, 690 active duty Marines who held the paygrade of E 3 or E 4 between 2006 and 2016 to estimate the reliability, validity, accuracy, and practicality of proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks. Overall, results show that proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks are effective indicators of performance, with some room for improvement. Marks are statistically inconsistent between raters, <b>and</b> proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks essentially measure the same type of performance. The factor analysis does show that proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks together are the most important factors in the composite score for E 4 s and the second most important, behind experience, for E 3 s. Lastly, proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks are the most predictive of future performance compared to all other composite score variables. The author recommends that the Marine Corps continue to use proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks as a basis for promotion decisions, but that the Marine Corps should redefine the marks in order to improve interpretability and minimize redundancies.
