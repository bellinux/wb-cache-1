5|$|Buffon captained Juventus in the 2015 Champions League final as the Turin club were {{defeated}} 3–1 by Barcelona at Berlin's Olympiastadion. Buffon {{made the most}} saves throughout the tournament (39), <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> most clean sheets (6), along with Danijel Subašić, Manuel Neuer and Marc-André ter Stegen. He {{was named to the}} 2014–15 UEFA Champions League Team of the Season for his performances throughout the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In 1925 Brundage became {{vice-president}} of the AAU, {{and chairman of}} its Handball Committee. After a year as first vice-president, he became president in 1928 <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> post (except for a one-year break in 1933) through 1935. In that capacity, {{he was able to}} secure peace between the NCAA and AAU, with the former gaining the right to certify college students as amateurs, and greater representation on the AOA's executive board.|$|E
5|$|Simpson had totaled 1025yards in {{the first}} half of the season, which was ahead of the 971 Brown had gained in his first seven games.

5|$|After {{the closing}} in 1991 the {{foundation}} Stiftelsen Rjukanbanen {{was established to}} ensure that the railway remained in an operational condition, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> two railway ferries and some of the rolling stock in operational condition. Norsk Transport retained for a period maintenance of the Rjukan Line, while the Tinnoset Line remained part of the rail network maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The foundation operated ad-hoc charter services on both the Tinnoset Line and the Rjukan Line, as well as with both railway ferries. By 2004 the foundation had run out of money, and closed down.|$|E
5|$|Attacks of the Leningrad Front {{had pushed}} the Army Group North {{to the west}} of Lake Peipus {{resulting}} in a series of operations around Narva. The German Command considered it important to maintain control over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland, which eased the situation in Finland <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Baltic Fleet in its eastern bay. From a military economy viewpoint, the preservation of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida-Viru was also important. In the south, Soviet forces advanced towards the Baltic seacoast {{at the end of their}} Operation Bagration of June–August 1944 against the German Army Group Centre.|$|E
5|$|Clowes {{assigned}} the inexperienced 7th Infantry Brigade a defensive role, guarding key points around Milne Bay from seaborne or airborne attack, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> veteran 18th Infantry Brigade in reserve, ready to counterattack. Lacking accurate maps and finding that their signals equipment was unreliable in the conditions, the Australian {{command and control}} system consisted largely of cable telephones, or where {{there was not enough}} line available, runners. The soft ground made movement by road and even on foot difficult.|$|E

5|$|Coulthard {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher who began from pole position. Barrichello began from {{third on the}} grid and overtook Coulthard going into the first corner. Michael Schumacher maintained his start line advantage <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> lead {{after the first round}} of pit stops. During the course of the second stint of the race, Michael Schumacher began to struggle with tyre wear, allowing Coulthard to close the gap and passed him on lap 40. Coulthard maintained his lead through the second round of pit stops and won the race. Michael Schumacher retired on lap 59 with an engine failure promoting Häkkinen into second position. Barrichello took third, ahead of BAR driver Jacques Villeneuve in fourth.|$|E
5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant {{opened in}} 1964 after Ron Thomas' family {{purchased}} the business from Bill Blake for $600. Blake had named his lounge Country Bill's in 1960 but {{the business was}} unsuccessful. Thomas {{had been in the}} food service industry in Utah previously and ended up living in Portland after a series of relocations with his family. Though he was not fond of the lounge's name, Thomas was unable to afford new signage <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> title. Over time the restaurant grew from a hamburger stand into a family dining restaurant, expanding east from one space to four. In 1978, the family purchased the building and property following the death of their landlord.|$|E
5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant was a family-owned American-style steakhouse {{and seafood}} {{restaurant}} in the Woodstock neighborhood of southeast Portland, Oregon, in the United States. Adjacent to the restaurant was a bar called CB's Lounge. The restaurant opened in 1964 when ownership transferred from Bill Blake to Ron Thomas' family. Though Thomas was not particularly fond {{of the name of}} the business Blake had established in 1960, he was unable to afford new signage <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> lounge's title.

5|$|Financial {{difficulties}} and instability at board level led to six managerial changes in seven years. Saunders resigned after FA Cup defeat to non-league Altrincham, John Bond {{seemed out of}} touch, and in April 1989, once relegation to the Third Division {{for the first time}} in the club's history was confirmed, the club's new owners replaced Garry Pendrey with Dave Mackay. Within 18 months, with relegation to the Fourth Division a possibility, Mackay resigned. Lou Macari came in, revitalised the side, won the Associate Members' Cup at Wembley, and three weeks later walked out to join Stoke City. Terry Cooper won promotion back to the second tier <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> team going during four months of administration before he quit, fearing new owner David Sullivan would want to bring in his own man.|$|E
5|$|Following relegation to the Southern League Second Division in 1903, Watford {{appointed}} {{its first}} manager – former England international and First Division top scorer John Goodall. He led Watford to promotion, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> {{team in the}} division until his departure in 1910. Despite financial constraints, Watford won the Southern League title in the 1914–15 season under his successor, Harry Kent. Watford held the title for five years following the suspension of the Southern League during the First World War – after finishing the 1919–20 season runners-up on goal average, the club resigned from the Southern League to join the new Football League Third Division.|$|E
5|$|Football tournaments {{for senior}} men's {{national}} teams {{took place in}} six Summer Olympics between 1908 and 1936. The Belgian squad participated in all three Olympic football tournaments in the 1920s <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> gold medal at home at the 1920 edition. Apart from the proper national team, two other Belgian delegations appeared at the Olympics. At the 1900 Summer Olympics, a Belgian representation with mainly students won bronze, and at the 2008 edition, Belgium's U-23 selection placed fourth.|$|E

5|$|Michael Schumacher {{maintained}} his start line advantage and withstood Häkkinen's attempts to pass him {{going into the}} first corner. Further around the lap, a collision involving four cars prompted the deployment of the safety car and a fire marshal Paolo Gislimberti {{was struck by a}} flying wheel. When the safety car pulled into the pit lane on lap eleven, Michael Schumacher began to immediately pull clear from Häkkinen <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> lead until his pit stop on the 39th lap. When Häkkinen made his own pit stop three laps later, Michael Schumacher regained the lead which he held to clinch his sixth victory of the 2000 season; Häkkinen finished almost four seconds behind.|$|E
5|$|Rosenqvist won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his start line advantage {{on the first}} lap. He {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> lead until the mandatory round of pit stops when Buemi took over the first position for one lap until he made his stop. Rosenqvist regained the lead but was required to conserve his car's electrical energy usage because of making a pit stop one lap earlier than the rest of the field, allowing Buemi to narrow the time deficit between the two drivers. Buemi passed Rosenqvist for the lead on the 27th lap and held it for the remainder of the race to clinch the win. There were two lead changes among two different drivers during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|The Act of Uniformity 1558, which forced {{people to}} attend Sunday service in an Anglican church {{with a new}} version of the Book of Common Prayer, passed by only three votes. The Bill of Uniformity was more {{cautious}} than the initial Reformation Bill. It revoked the harsh laws proposed against Roman Catholics, it removed the abuse of the pope from the litany <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> wording that allowed for both consubstantial and transubstantial beliefs in the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{received}} {{the second half}} kickoff and mounted a record-setting drive. The opening drive ran for over 9 minutes (a Super Bowl record) and culminated in a 1-yard touchdown run by Ottis Anderson, giving the Giants a 17–12 lead. The signature play of the drive came on a third down play, when Giants receiver Mark Ingram appeared about to be tackled well short of a first down. However, Ingram evaded several tacklers, and dragged one defender just {{enough to get the}} Giants the first down, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> drive alive. By this time, the Giants strategy to handle the Bills offense had become clear: keep them off the field. Indeed, the Giants two touchdown drives consumed over 17 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Law Society of England and Wales persuaded Coopers & Lybrand {{to include}} an {{alternate}} reform proposal in their report, and after pressure from the Law Society, {{and several of the}} larger regional societies, the alternate proposal was used. This was far weaker than the original proposal, <b>and</b> <b>kept</b> <b>the</b> responsibility of regulating the solicitors' profession within the Law Society but increased the separation of functions within the Society and required {{that the majority of the}} people on regulatory committees be lay people (not solicitors). The events surrounding this scandal have been directly linked to the reforms pushed through in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which created an independent disciplinary body for solicitors.|$|E
