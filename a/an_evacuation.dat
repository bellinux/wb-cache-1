5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over New England {{resulted in the}} possibility that Edouard would track {{to the west and}} strike the United States. One computer model predicted the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This caused Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering <b>an</b> <b>evacuation</b> for the busiest tourist weekend of the year, though <b>an</b> <b>evacuation</b> never occurred. Due to the possibility for a landfall on the East Coast of the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center issued Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches and Warnings from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine at various times.

The flooding of the Alaska Railroad track in town forced a halt to all passenger and freight operations between Anchorage and Fairbanks, effectively cutting off Fairbanks from rail traffic.|$|E
5|$|Penfold's next {{overseas}} posting was to Kampala, Uganda, {{as deputy}} high commissioner. There, he persuaded President Milton Obote {{to attend the}} queen's birthday party for the first time. Two months later, Obote was overthrown in a coup, after which Penfold led <b>an</b> <b>evacuation</b> of foreign citizens to Kenya. The high commission remained open, and Penfold was still present six months later when a second coup took place. In 1987, he again returned to the FCO, this time serving in the West Indian and Atlantic Department, and four years later, he was appointed Governor of the British Virgin Islands. The main issues of Penfold's tenure were {{the establishment of the}} territory as an offshore financial centre and the smuggling of drugs through its waters until the sudden death of the chief minister. Penfold resolved the subsequent constitutional crisis by appointing the deputy chief minister as an interim replacement. Penfold's term as governor expired in 1996, after which he spent a year as a drugs adviser to the Caribbean before being appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone in 1997. Six weeks into Penfold's term, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was overthrown in a military coup and Penfold organised <b>an</b> <b>evacuation</b> of foreign citizens.|$|E

France asked Washington for assistance, so the US Department of Defense ordered the US Navy to mobilise <b>an</b> <b>evacuation</b> task force.|$|E
