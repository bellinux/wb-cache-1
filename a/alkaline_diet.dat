25|$|<b>Alkaline</b> <b>diet</b> (also {{known as}} the {{alkaline}} ash diet, alkaline acid diet, acid ash diet, and acid <b>alkaline</b> <b>diet)</b> describes a group of loosely related diets based on the misconception that different types of food can {{have an effect on}} the pH balance of the body. It originated from theories related to osteoporosis research, however, most proponents of the diet maintain the incorrect belief that certain foods can affect the acidity (pH) of the body and can therefore be used to treat or prevent disease. Due to the lack of credible evidence supporting the claimed mechanism of this diet, it is not recommended by dietitians or other health professionals, though some have noted that eating unprocessed foods as this diet recommends may have incidental health benefits unrelated to bodily pH.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{medicine}} {{practitioners who}} have promoted the <b>alkaline</b> <b>diet</b> have advocated {{its use in}} the treatment of various medical conditions including cancer.

While it has been proposed that this diet can help increase energy, lose weight, and treat cancer and heart disease, {{there is no evidence to}} support any of these claims.

50|$|A water ionizer (also {{known as}} an {{alkaline}} ionizer) is a home appliance which claims to raise the pH of drinking water by using electrolysis to separate the incoming water stream into acidic and alkaline components.

25|$|These diets {{have been}} {{promoted}} by alternative medicine practitioners, with the proposal that such diets treat or prevent cancer, heart disease, and low energy levels {{as well as}} other illnesses. Human blood is regulated at pH 7.35 to 7.45. Levels above 7.45 are referred to as alkalosis and levels below 7.35 as acidosis. Both are potentially serious, and the body has acid–base homeostasis mechanisms that generally ensure this does not happen.

40|$|Recently it was {{reported}} from this laboratory that in human smokers urinary nicotine elimination is markedly affected by the pH of the urine (1). In brief, {{it was found that}} when the urine was alkaline only one-fourth as much nicotine was eliminated as when the urine was acid. This difference was explained on the basis of greater nicotine resorption through the urinary mucosa from an alkaline urine, the alkalinity increasing the proportion of alkaloidal base, the form in which, presumably, the alkaloid is most efficiently resorbed. Because the pK value of quinine is so similar to that of nicotine (8. 3 vs. 8. 07, fig. 1), it was thought that the elimination of quinine might behave {{in a manner similar to}} that of nicotine.

40|$|Dietary acid load, {{quantified}} as {{the potential}} renal acid load (PRAL) of the diet, affects systemic pH and acid-base regulation. In a previous cross-sectional study, we reported that a low dietary PRAL (i. e. <b>alkaline</b> promoting <b>diet)</b> is associated with higher respiratory exchange ratio (RER) values during maximal exercise. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to confirm the previous findings with a short-term dietary intervention study. Additionally, we sought to determine if changes in PRAL affects submaximal exercise RER (as a reflection of substrate utilization) and anaerobic exercise performance. Subjects underwent a graded treadmill exercise test (GXT) to exhaustion and an anaerobic exercise performance test on two occasions, once after following a low-PRAL diet and on a separate occasion, after a high-PRAL diet. The diets were continued as long as needed to achieve an alkaline or acid fasted morning urine pH, respectively, with all being 4 - 9 days in duration. RER was measured during the GXT with indirect calorimetry. The anaerobic performance test was a running time-to-exhaustion test lasting 1 - 4 min. Maximal exercise RER was lower in the low-PRAL trial compared to the high-PRAL trial (1. 10 ± 0. 02 vs. 1. 20 ± 0. 05, p = 0. 037). The low-PRAL diet also resulted in a 21 % greater time to exhaustion during anaerobic exercise (2. 56 ± 0. 36 vs. 2. 11 ± 0. 31 sec, p = 0. 044) and a strong tendency for lower RER values during submaximal exercise at 70 % VO 2 max (0. 88 ± 0. 02 vs. 0. 96 ± 0. 04, p = 0. 060). Contrary to our expectations, a short-term low-PRAL (<b>alkaline</b> promoting) <b>diet</b> resulted in lower RER values during maximal-intensity exercise.

40|$|ABSTRACT The vitamin D {{status of}} 181 elderly Irish community-dwelling and {{institutionalized}} subjects was studied during Winter-Spring. The mean serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D level was 10 nmol/L (95 % range < 5. 0 - 59 nmol/L); values were below 25 nmol/L in 79 percent of subjects. A significant seasonal variation of serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels was noted in elderly community-dwelling subjects. The previously documented age-related increase in {{serum alkaline phosphatase}} activity was significantly less in vitamin D replete subjects than in vitamin D deplete {{subjects in this study}} (P < 0. 005).

There were 22, 034 men and women aged 39 - 78 years living in Norfolk (UK) with casual urine samples and dietary intakes from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) -Norfolk FFQ.

The current study investigated the metabolic impact of acid-base disturbances produced by differences in dietary electrolyte balance (DEB) in the meagre (Argyrosomus regius), an euryhaline species. Changes in fish performance, gastric chyme characteristics, pH and ion concentrations in the bloodstream, digestive enzyme activities and metabolic rates were analyzed in meagre fed ad libitum two experimental diets (DEB 200 or DEB 700 mEq/kg) differing in the Na 2 CO 3 content for 69 days. Fish fed the DEB 200 diet had 60 - 66 % better growth performance than the DEB 700 group. Meagre consuming the DEB 200 diet were 90 - 96 % more efficient than fish fed the DEB 700 diet at allocating energy from feed into somatic growth. The pH values in blood were significantly lower in the DEB 700 group 2 h after feeding when compared to DEB 200, indicating that acid-base balance in meagre was affected by electrolyte balance in diet. Osmolality, and Na + and K + concentrations in plasma did not vary with the dietary treatment. Gastric chyme in the DEB 700 group had higher pH values, dry matter, protein and energy contents, but lower lipid content than in the DEB 200 group.

40|$|Abstract Background Modern diets {{have been}} {{suggested}} to increase systemic acid load and net acid excretion. In response, alkaline diets and products are marketed to avoid or counteract this acid, help the body regulate its pH to prevent and cure disease. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate causal relationships between dietary acid load and osteoporosis using Hill's criteria. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis. We systematically searched published literature for randomized intervention trials, prospective cohort studies, and meta-analyses of the acid-ash or acid-base diet hypothesis with bone-related outcomes, in which the diet acid load was altered, or an <b>alkaline</b> <b>diet</b> or alkaline salts were provided, to healthy human adults. Cellular mechanism studies were also systematically examined. Results Fifty-five of 238 studies met the inclusion criteria: 22 randomized interventions, 2 meta-analyses, and 11 prospective observational studies of bone health outcomes including: urine calcium excretion, calcium balance or retention, changes of bone mineral density, or fractures, among healthy adults in which acid and/or alkaline intakes were manipulated or observed through foods or supplements; and 19 in vitro cell studies which examined the hypothesized mechanism. Urine calcium excretion rates were consistent with osteoporosis development; however calcium balance studies did not demonstrate loss of whole body calcium with higher net acid excretion. Several weaknesses regarding the acid-ash hypothesis were uncovered: No intervention studies provided direct evidence of osteoporosis progression (fragility fractures, or bone strength as measured using biopsy). The supporting prospective cohort studies were not controlled regarding important osteoporosis risk factors including: weight loss during follow-up, family history of osteoporosis, baseline bone mineral density, and estrogen status. No study revealed a biologic mechanism functioning at physiological pH. Finally, randomized studies did not provide evidence for an adverse role of phosphate, milk, and grain foods in osteoporosis.
