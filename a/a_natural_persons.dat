40|$|Taxation of Personal Income (a {{comparison}} of the legislation in the Czech republic and selected countries of EU) The topic of taxation of personal income has been chosen {{by the author of}} this diploma thesis. The original purpose was to describe and analyze the legislation in two states, Czech Republic and Slovak Republic, which had existed as a common state more than 70 years in the 20 th century. Therefore it could be interesting to follow up, what had happened during the last 20 years after the disintegration of the common state. This thesis is divided into five parts (including an introduction and a conclusion), which are generally subdivided into the chapters and subchapters. The thesis was written in accordance with the law applicable on the 1 st October 2013. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the author deals with the Czech laws regulating an income tax of individuals. She defines and briefly explains an essential terminology related to that part of legislation including some proposed amendments of the Acts. As a main source the Law on Income Taxes, no. 586 / 1992 was used. It is important to highlight also the chapter number 4 which is focused not only on the Czech territory, but which analyses the problem with an international double taxation of worldwide incomes of <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>persons,</b> including [...] ...|$|E

2500|$|By way of distinction, {{the organs}} {{of the company}} were {{expressed}} to have various corporate powers. [...] If the objects were {{the things that the}} company was able to do, then the powers were the means by which it could do them. [...] Usually expressions of powers were limited to methods of raising capital, although from earlier times distinctions between objects and powers have caused lawyers difficulty. Most jurisdictions have now modified the position by statute, and companies generally have capacity to do all the things that <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person</b> could do, and power to do it in any way that <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person</b> could do it.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{reported}} {{case on the}} capacity of a corporation was the Case of Sutton's Hospital (1612) 77 Eng Rep 960. That case is difficult to follow, but in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC 1992 2 AC 1 Lord Templeman referred to it, and summarised the decision: [...] "That report, although largely incomprehensible in 1990, has been accepted as 'express authority' that at common law it is an incident to a corporation to use its common seal {{for the purpose of}} binding itself to anything which <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person</b> could bind himself and to deal with its property as <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person</b> might deal with his own." ...|$|R

50|$|Alleging {{that the}} {{decisions}} violated the European Convention on Human Rights, Clearstream lodged an appeal with the Court of Cassation, claiming that Clearstream's rights were being abused in being forbidden from taking legal action. The Luxembourg company claimed {{that it was}} impossible for them to be represented by <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person</b> in this legal process in France, as they were bound by Luxembourg law to be chaired by a board of directors of a collegial nature. On 23 May 2006, the advocate-general at the Court of Cassation, Francis Fréchèdehe, requested that both of these actions be dismissed. He assessed that Clearstream could have used the civil procedure, in which it is not mandatory to be represented by <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Clearstream has around 2,500 {{customers}} in 110 countries. Clearstream accepts central banks and AML-regulated credit institutions (such as regulated banks) as customers. Clearstream {{does not accept}} <b>natural</b> <b>persons</b> as customers and no account is opened {{in the name of}} <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person.</b> Clearstream has therefore been described as a [...] "bank for banks" [...] ("Plumbers and Visionaries, a history of settlement and custody in Europe", Peter Norman).|$|R
50|$|Registered Director Part II of the {{legislation}} provides that <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> <b>person</b> appointed as <b>a</b> director of a Covered Entity shall not act in that capacity unless registered under the Law.
