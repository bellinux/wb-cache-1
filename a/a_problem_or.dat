5|$|Since {{silicon nitride}} ball {{bearings}} are harder than metal, this reduces {{contact with the}} bearing track. This results in 80% less friction, 3 to 10 times longer lifetime, 80% higher speed, 60% less weight, the ability to operate with lubrication starvation, higher corrosion resistance and higher operation temperature, as compared to traditional metal bearings. Silicon nitride balls weigh 79% less than tungsten carbide balls. Silicon nitride ball bearings {{can be found in}} high end automotive bearings, industrial bearings, wind turbines, motorsports, bicycles, rollerblades and skateboards. Silicon nitride bearings are especially useful in applications where corrosion, electric or magnetic fields prohibit the use of metals. For example, in tidal flow meters, where seawater attack is <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>or</b> in electric field seekers.|$|E

Different rules are applied depending on the application protocol or software used.|$|E
25|$|Typically English sonnets present <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> {{argument}} in the quatrains, and a resolution in the final couplet. This sonnet suggests this pattern, but its rhetorical structure is more closely modeled upon the older Petrarchan sonnet which arranges the octave (the first eight lines) {{in contrast to the}} sestet (the final six lines).|$|E

25|$|A puzzle is <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> enigma that {{challenges}} ingenuity. Solutions to puzzle may require recognizing patterns {{and creating a}} particular order. People with a high inductive reasoning aptitude may be better at solving these puzzles than others. Puzzles based {{on the process of}} inquiry and discovery to complete may be solved faster by those with good deduction skills. A popular puzzle toy is the Rubik's Cube, invented by Hungarian Ernő Rubik in 1974. Popularized in the 1980s, solving the cube requires planning and problem-solving skills and involves algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Teaching {{engineering}} is teaching {{the application of}} scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to design, build, maintain, and improve structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes. It may encompass using insights to conceive, model and scale an appropriate solution to <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> objective. The discipline of {{engineering is}} extremely broad, and encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of technology and types of application. Engineering disciplines include aerospace, biological, civil, chemical, computer, electrical, industrial, and mechanical.|$|E
25|$|GOES-14 is {{in storage}} at 105°W. The launch of this satellite, which was {{designated}} GOES-O before orbiting, was delayed several times. It was launched successfully on 27 June 2009 from Space Launch Complex 37, piggybacking on a Delta IV rocket. It underwent Post-Launch Testing until December 2009 {{and then was}} placed in on-orbit storage. This satellite {{is a part of}} the GOES-N Series. GOES-14 has been and will be activated should another GOES satellite suffer <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> be decommissioned. It was temporarily designated GOES-East because of technical difficulties with GOES-13 and moved towards the GOES-East location. After resolution of those problems, GOES-14 was returned to storage.|$|E

25|$|Barotrauma {{of descent}} {{is caused by}} {{pressure}} differences between the increasing ambient pressure and the internal pressure of gas filled spaces of the diver's body and equipment. The skills of equalization are simple but essential to avoid injury. More complex, but also more straightforward in practice, is buoyancy control and the associated control of descent rate. The diver {{is expected to be}} competent to control, and particularly, limit, the descent rate by adjustment of buoyancy of the buoyancy compensator, and when applicable, the dry suit. The diver must be able to limit descent rate to match the ability to equalize, particularly the ears, and to stop the descent quickly without going into an uncontrolled ascent if there is <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>or</b> when the desired depth has been reached. In most cases the bottom provides a physical limit to descent, but this is not always the case, and it is generally considered bad form to hit the bottom at speed. A skilled diver will stop at the desired distance above the bottom and stay at that depth, neutrally buoyant, and ready to proceed with the dive. These skills require practice, and are not usually fully developed after typical entry level recreational certification.|$|E

500|$|The {{thoroughness}} of the muster {{was heavily}} dependent on the class of the passengers; the first-class stewards {{were in charge of}} only a few cabins, while those responsible for the second- and third-class passengers had to manage large numbers of people. The first-class stewards provided hands-on assistance, helping their charges to get dressed and bringing them out onto the deck. With far more people to deal with, the second- and third-class stewards mostly confined their efforts to throwing open doors and telling passengers to put on lifebelts and come up top. In third class, passengers were largely {{left to their own devices}} after being informed of the need to come on deck. Many passengers and crew were reluctant to comply, either refusing to believe that there was <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> preferring the warmth of the ship's interior to the bitterly cold night air. The passengers were not told that the ship was sinking, though a few noticed that she was listing.|$|E
500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{believe that in}} 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what {{has been described as}} a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a [...] high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law {{enforcement officers}} visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered the front door to talk to people, but never stated there was <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>or</b> attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.|$|E
