40|$|AbstractAccording to the proton {{buffering}} model, {{introduced by}} Klingenberg, UCP 1 conducts protons through a hydrophilic pathway lined with fatty <b>acid</b> <b>head</b> groups that buffer the protons {{as they move}} across the membrane. According to the fatty acid protonophore model, introduced by Garlid, UCPs do not conduct protons at all. Rather, like all members of this gene family, they are anion carriers. A variety of anions are transported, but the physiological substrates are fatty acid (FA) anions. Because the carboxylate head group is translocated by UCP, and because the protonated FA rapidly diffuses across the membrane, this mechanism permits FA to behave as regulated cycling protonophores. Favoring the latter mechanism {{is the fact that}} the head group of long-chain alkylsulfonates, strong acid analogues of FA, is also translocated by UCP...|$|E

40|$|As {{part of our}} {{long-term}} goal to design a novel type of immunosensor based on IR transduction, we devised two strategies to immobilize derivatives of the herbicide atrazine {{on the surface of}} planar gold substrates. Both strategies take advantage of the well-known formation of self-assembled monolayers of thiolates via spontaneous chemisorption of thiols or disulphides on noble metal surfaces. The first strategy involved the direct chemisorption of a disulphide derivative of atrazine, while the second strategy was based on the covalent attachment of a polymer tethered with atrazine derivatives to a previously adsorbed thiolate carrying a carboxylic <b>acid</b> <b>head</b> group. The resulting organic thin films on gold were characterised by polarization modulation infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) and XPS.

40|$|Ion {{sensitive}} organic {{field-effect transistor}}s (ISOFETs) with a metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) architecture have been fabricated by using poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as the semiconductor and dielectric layers, respectively. To avoid any pin-holes in the dielectric layer, the ISOFET was coated by two separate PMMA layers. An Ag/AgCl double-junction reference electrode {{was used as}} the gate. The results show that the uncoated ISOFET exhibited transistor behaviour in aqueous solutions. However, these devices possessed a small sensitivity of about 0. 5 nA dec- 1 to H+, K+ and Na+ ions. Langmuir-Blodgett membranes were then used to improve the ISOFET response to the target ions in solution. By coating the gate dielectric (PMMA) with an LB membrane of pure arachidic acid (AA), the ISOFETs showed a significantly higher sensitivity to H+ ions of about 3. 5 nA pH- 1, but no improvement in the pK response (< 0. 5 nA dec- 1). The compact ionised layers of carboxylic <b>acid</b> <b>head</b> groups were thought to lead to the improvement in the pH sensitivity; however, the layers of long hydrocarbon chains prevented large monovalent ions, such as K+ and Na+, from interacting with the ionised carboxylic <b>acid</b> <b>head</b> groups. ISOFETs coated with an arachidic acid/valinomycin (AA/val) mixture did not show any selectivity to K+ ions, but exhibited enhanced sensitivities to both K+ and Na+ ions. Instead of trapping K+ ions, the valinomycin molecules in the AA membrane were thought to disrupt the membrane architecture and provide ion-leakage channels. Pure valinomycin-coated ISOFETs also revealed enhancements in both sensitivity and selectivity to K+ ions over Na+. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the cavity in the valinomycin molecules can accommodate a K+ ion but not a Na+ ion. 	To study facilitated K+ transport across the membrane, LB films of AA/val mixture and pure valinomycin were coated on porous supports. The responses of both uncoated and coated membranes were similar. After deposition, collapse of the LB film into the pores may provide leakage channels. This probably led to the observed gradual decrease of the potentials across the membranes...|$|E

For this a new, polydisperse ethylene glycol containing guest molecule is synthesized that is soluble in both chloroform and water. This guest {{is able to}} bind to urea-adamantyl-modified poly(propylene imine) dendrimers in chloroform in a noncovalent manner. When the chloroform is slowly evaporated and D 2 O is added, the hydrophobic dendrimer is solubilized in water. This is not possible when the hydrophobic dendrimer is directly added to the hydrophilic guests in water. When the unmodified poly(ethylene glycol) starting material is used, no solubilization occurs, and this indicates that the urea-acetic <b>acid</b> <b>head</b> group is necessary to solubilize the dendrimer. Approximately 26 guests are required for solubilization of the dendrimer. A lower number of guests results in aggregation and precipitation of the dendrimer.

We report a potent and cell active protein interaction inhibitor, PFI- 3, that selectively binds to essential BAF bromodomains. The high specificity of PFI- 3 was achieved {{on the basis}} of a novel binding mode of a salicylic <b>acid</b> <b>head</b> group that led to the replacement of water molecules typically maintained in other bromodomain inhibitor complexes. We show that exposure of embryonic stem cells to PFI- 3 led to deprivation of stemness and deregulated lineage specification. Furthermore, differentiation of trophoblast stem cells in the presence of PFI- 3 was markedly enhanced. The data present a key function of BAF bromodomains in stem cell maintenance and differentiation, introducing a novel versatile chemical probe for studies on acetylation-dependent cellular processes controlled by BAF remodeling complexes...|$|E

Dilution of these initial micellar aggregates triggers a morphological reorganization resulting in the formation of more stable vesicles. The extent of this morphological transition is related to the solubility of the P 4 VP/fluorinated complexes during the dilution process. This transition is complete for short P 4 VP/FS complexes, incomplete for long P 4 VP/FS complexes, and not observed whenever an alpha,omega-difunctional FS is used in P 4 VP/FS complexes, leading to a cross-linked core.

We developed a synthetic route to the material and studied its behavior in Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett films by means of a variety of characterization techniques, including a new model for the interpretation of UV-Vis reflection spectra of bent-core compounds.

40|$|Caliciviridae are RNA viruses with a single-stranded, {{positively}} oriented polyadenylated genome, {{responsible for}} {{a broad spectrum of}} diseases such as acute gastroenteritis in humans. Recently, analyses on the structures and functionalities of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from several Caliciviruses have been reported. The RdRp is predicted to {{play a key role in}} genome replication, as well as in synthesis and amplification of additional subgenomic RNA. Starting from the crystal structures of human Norovirus (hNV) RdRp, we performed an in silico docking search to identify synthetic compounds with predicted high affinity for the enzyme active site. The best-ranked candidates were tested in vitro on murine Norovirus (MNV) and hNV RdRps to assay their inhibition of RNA polymerization. The results of such combined computational and experimental screening approach led to the identification of two high-potency inhibitors: Suramin and NF 023, both symmetric divalent molecules hosting two naphthalene-trisulfonic <b>acid</b> <b>heads.</b> We report here the crystal structure of MNV RdRp alone and in the presence of the two identified inhibitors. Both inhibitory molecules occupy the same RdRp site, between the fingers and thumb domains, with one inhibitor head close to residue 42 and to the protein active site. To further validate the structural results, we mutated Trp 42 to Ala in MNV RdRp and the corresponding residue (i. e., Tyr 41 to Ala) in hNV RdRp. Both NF 023 and Suramin displayed reduced inhibitory potency versus the mutated hNV RdRp, thus hinting at a conserved inhibitor binding mode in the two polymerases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Surface {{pressure}} measurements and external reflection FTIR spectroscopy {{have been used}} to probe protein-lipid interactions at the air/water interface. Spread monomolecular layers of stearic acid and phosphocholine were prepared and held at different compressed phase states prior to the introduction of protein to the buffered subphase. Contrasting interfacial behaviour of the proteins, albumin and lysozyme, was observed and revealed the role of both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in protein adsorption. The rate of adsorption of lysozyme to the air/water interface increased dramatically in the presence of stearic acid, due to strong electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged stearic <b>acid</b> <b>head</b> group and lysozyme, whose net charge at pH 7 is positive. Introduction of albumin to the subphase resulted in solubilisation of the stearic acid via the formation of an albumin-stearic acid complex and subsequent adsorption of albumin. This observation held for both human and bovine serum albumin. Protein adsorption to a PC layer held at low surface pressure revealed adsorption rates similar to adsorption to the bare air/water interface and suggested very little interaction between the protein and the lipid. For PC layers in their compressed phase state some adsorption of protein occurred after long adsorption times. Structural changes of both lysozyme and albumin were observed during adsorption, but these were dramatically reduced {{in the presence of a}} lipid layer compared to that of adsorption to the pure air/water interface...|$|E

Regardless of perfluo-roalkyl chain length and theoretical method employed, application of a computational thermodynamic cycle indicated no significant change in the estimated aqueous monomeric pKa values between C 1 and C 9, all having a relatively constant pKa of about 0 that is in agreement with earlier predictions and recent experimental evidence. Perfluoroalkyl chain helicity does not appear to result in increased monomeric PFCA pKa values at chain lengths greater than 5. Increasing chain length does not substantially influence the structural or electronic character of the carboxylic <b>acid</b> <b>head</b> group. A MMFF 94 conformational search yielded 2915 separate low- through high-energy conformers of n-PFOA. Ranking of these structures gave the 94 lowest MMFF 94 energy conformations that were subjected to DFT investigations. Application of a thermodynamic cycle approach, coupled with aqueous and gas phase DFT calcula-tions on the molecular and anionic forms for each of the conformers, gave conformationally averaged pKa values for n-PFOA equal to the global minimum helical conformer pKa. The conformational populations under study occupy ∼ 100 percent of the global n-PFOA conformational space, indicating no higher energy/low acidity conformations remain unexamined that could influence the predicted composite aqueous monomeric pKa of zero for this compound...|$|E
40|$|In CaCO 3, biomineralization {{nucleation}} {{and growth}} of the crystals {{are related to the}} presence of carboxylate-rich proteins within a macromolecular matrix, often with organized -sheet domains. To understand the interplay between the organic template and the mineral crystal it is important to explicitly address the issue of structural adaptation of the template during mineralization. To this end we have developed a series of self-organizing surfactants (1 - 4) consisting of a dodecyl chain connected via a bisureido-heptylene unit to an amino <b>acid</b> <b>head</b> group. In Langmuir monolayers the spacing of these molecules in one direction is predetermined by the hydrogen-bonding distances between the bis-urea units. In the other direction, the intermolecular distance is determined by steric interactions introduced by the side groups (-R) of the amino acid moiety. Thus, by the choice of the amino acid we can systematically alter the density of the surfactant molecules in a monolayer and their ability to respond to the presence of calcium ions. The monolayer films are characterized by surface pressure-surface area (-A) isotherms, Brewster angle microscopy, in-situ synchrotron X-ray scattering at fixed surface area, and also infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) of films transferred to solid substrates. The developing crystals are studied with scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), and crystal modeling. The results demonstrate that although all compounds are active in the nucleation of calcium carbonate, habit modification is only observed when the size of the side group allows the molecules to rearrange and adapt their organization in response to the mineral phase...|$|E
