40|$|Surface and near-surface microstructures of {{alkaline}} etched AA 2099 -T 8 {{aluminum alloy}} have been characterized. The effect of <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching</b> on the anodizing {{behavior of the}} alloy in both acidic and neutral electrolytes has been investigated by comparing the electrochemical responses and the resultant anodic films of mechanically polished and alkaline etched alloys. It was revealed that <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching</b> could locally remove intermetallics from the alloy surface, with development of a copper-enriched layer immediately beneath a residual alumina film of about 5 nm thickness. The “footprints ” of <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching,</b> i. e. the removal of intermetallics {{and the formation of}} copper-enriched layer during <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching,</b> could affect subsequent anodizing behavior of the alloy, particularly in the early stages. The removal of intermetallics from the alloy surface could not only improve anodizing efficiency but also contribute to reduced discontinuities in the resultant anodic films, potentially benefiting corrosion and fatigue resistances of the anodized profiles. The difference in anodizing behavior caused by the copper-enriched layer developed during <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching</b> was considered limited to the early stages of anodizing, since a similar copper-enriched layer could be formed quickly during subsequent anodizing process, regardless of the surface pre-treatment...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work studies {{the influence of}} zinc on surface treatments such as mechanical polishing, anodic <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching,</b> <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching</b> and electropolishing. Solid-solution binary alloys containing 0. 6, 1. 0 and 1. 9 at. %Zn were investigated using scanning and transmission electron microscopies and ion beam analysis. Initially, the near-surface composition of the surface pretreated aluminium alloys were determined using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and glow discharge optical spectroscopy (GDOES). Subsequently, the surface morphologies of the pretreated specimens were characterized by secondary electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Further related work was undertaken {{on the effect of}} the employed surface treatments on the anodic behaviour of aluminium-zinc alloys. A final analysis was carried out on the influence of grain orientation on zinc enrichment and surface morphologies of aluminium-zinc alloys developed during <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching.</b> The results reveal that surface pretreatments of aluminium-zinc alloys lead to zinc enrichment at the alloy/film interface. The number of zinc atoms contained in the enriched layer depends upon the employed surface pretreatment and the alloy composition. Surface pretreatments influence the topography of Al-Zn alloys. In particular, for electropolishing, <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching</b> and anodic <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching,</b> the resultant surface morphologies were associated with the oxidation-dissolution-precipitation mechanisms occurring at the alloy/film interface and at the film/solution interface. Anodizing of Al-Zn alloys shows that the anodic films growth on Al-Zn alloys in rolled condition and after surface treatment becomes detached from the substrate independently of the surface treatment employed, although detachment of the anodic film occur earlier on surface pre-treated Al-Zn alloys that developed zinc enrichment. The final studies correlated the mechanisms of oxidation and dissolution with the grain orientation. The result revealed that the (111) grain dissolves faster than other grains, while the higher number of zinc enriched atoms were measured on the (001) grain.

PURPOSE: The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effect of acid or <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching</b> of sandblasted ZrO 2 implants on bone apposition in vivo. METHODS: Cylindrical ZrO 2 implants with two circumferential grooves were placed in the maxilla of 12 miniature pigs. Biopsies were harvested after 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of healing. Undecalcified toluidine blue-stained ground sections were produced. The bone-to-implant contact, the bone area, and the presence of multinucleated giant cells were determined by histomorphometry.

40|$|This paper evaluates wet-chemical pre-{{treatment}}s (<b>alkaline</b> <b>etching,</b> anodising) and a {{plasma treatment}} for structural bonding of titanium (Ti 6 Al 4 V). The main {{objective of this}} study is the comparison of the applicability of the plasma pre-treatment to wet-chemical treatments on titanium for structural bonding. In this context, an atmospheric pressure plasma device was used to deposit thin functional films from hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) precursor on titanium. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to assess the chemical composition of the surface after different pre-treatments on the titanium substrate, while the morphology and the film thickness were investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The adhesion properties on titanium were evaluated by means of a wedge test in hot/wet conditions. After bonding tests the fracture surface and the failure loci were analysed. Using a long arc plasma generator and HMDSO precursor almost stoichiometric SiO 2 coatings were obtained on the titanium substrate.

The optical elements such as a beam splitter, a fixed mirror and a moving mirror are formed and aligned simultaneously with high degree of precision by Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE).

Design/methodology/approach: The topography of laser textured surfaces were investigated using ZEISS SUPRA 25 scanning electron microscope and LSM 5 Pascal ZEISS confocal laser scanning microscope. The reflectance of produced textures was measured by Perkin-Elmer Lambda spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere. Electrical parameters of manufactured solar cells were characterized by measurements of I-V illuminated characteristics under standard AM 1. 5 radiation. Findings: The texturing of multicrystalline silicon surface using Nd:YAG laser {{makes it possible to}} increase absorption of the incident solar radiation. Laser processing is a promising method for texturization of multicrystalline silicon compared to conventional texturing methods applied in used technology of solar cells.

40|$|Preferential grain etching is {{a problem}} {{occurring}} on aluminium products during <b>alkaline</b> <b>etching</b> prior to anodizing, especially if the etching bath contains small amounts of dissolved Zn. The visually uneven, "grainy " surface is caused by different etch rates for different grains, giving a terrace-like surface topography.

40|$|Superhydrophobicity (SH, earlier {{designated}} as ultrahydrophobicity) is a physicochemical phenomenon that {{has attracted a}} vast attention {{for more than one}} decade, with the exciting investigations of Barthlott and Neinhuis as an accelerating point. SH means an extreme waterrepelling property of natural as well as artificial surfaces. It is well substantiated that SH as a macroscopic surface property is based on the interplay of the roughness, mostly having a hierarchical character with micro- and sub-microscalic components, and the chemistry lowering the surface free energy. The way to produce SH depends on the type of the material to be treated. As for aluminum, which has clearly a hydrophilic character, a coating strategy must be necessarily adopted. The roughness may be produced by pure hot water treatment, <b>alkaline</b> or acid <b>etching</b> attack, anodic oxide formation or laser ablation. Other approaches, as straightforward variants of photolithography or micro-embossing at ambient temperature, failed in achieving two-tier roughness characteristics. Therefore, fluoro-organic compounds play an outstanding role for equipping a surface with SH. For Al substrates a great number of approaches were described. Forming very thin films of self-assembling molecules, simple alkanoic acids or even a perfluoroalkane were used. In order to covalently graft coating layers alkyl and fluoroalkyl silanes were applied. Fluorinated surfactants were anchored on aminosilane- pretreated substrates. Phosphonic and phosphoric acids with (fluoro) alkyl tails have a high affinity to be adsorbed onto several metal oxide surfaces. Suitable polymers are poly(dimethyl siloxanes), perfluoropolyether and the soluble fluorine-containing copolymer Teflon AF. It should be noticed that SH can be achieved on smooth substrates using fluoropolyelectrolytes or dispersed PTFE oligomers. In contrast to the 'wet-chemical' modifications mentioned above, 'dry' coating methods may be successfully applied to produce coatings in a very wide thickness range suitable for all substrate materials. PTFE and other fluorocarbon coatings could be generated by Hot Filament Chemical Vapor Deposition (HFCVD) and, derived from it, Initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition (iCVD), with deposition rates of over 1 mm/min.

40|$|Surface {{modifications}} {{are usually}} performed on titanium alloys to improve osteo-integration and surface bioactivity. Modifications such as <b>alkaline</b> and acid <b>etching,</b> or coating with bioactive {{materials such as}} hydroxyapatite, have previously been demonstrated. The aim of this work {{is to develop a}} peptide with combined titanium oxide and hydroxyapatite binders in order to achieve a biomimetic hydroxyapatite coating on titanium surfaces. The technology would also be applicable for the functionalisation of titanium and hydroxyapatite surfaces for selective protein adsorption, conjugation of antimicrobial peptides, and adsorption of specialised drugs for drug delivery. In this work, functionalisation of Ti 6 Al 4 V and hydroxyapatite surfaces was achieved using combined titanium-hydroxyapatite (Ti-Hap) peptides based on titanium binder (RKLPDA) and hydroxyapatite binder (EEEEEEEE) peptides. Homogeneous peptide coatings on Ti 6 Al 4 V surfaces were obtained after surface chemical treatments with a 30 wt % aqueous solution of H 2 O 2 for 24 and 48 hours. The treated titanium surfaces presented an average roughness of S a = 197 nm (24 h) and S a = 128 nm (48 h); an untreated mirror polished sample exhibited an S a of 13 nm. The advancing water contact angle of the titanium oxide layer after 1 hour of exposure to 30 wt % aqueous solution of H 2 O 2 was around 65 °, decreasing gradually with time until it reached 35 ° after a 48 hour exposure, suggesting that the surface hydrophilicity increased over etching time. The presence of a lysine (L) amino acid in the sequence of the titanium binder resulted in fluorescence intensity roughly 16 % higher compared with the arginine (R) amino acid analogue and therefore the lysine containing titanium binder was used in this work. The Ti-Hap peptide KKLPDAEEEEEEEE (Ti-Hap 1) was not adsorbed by the treated Ti 6 Al 4 V surfaces and therefore was modified. The modifications involved the inclusion of a glycine spacer between the binding terminals (Ti-Hap 2) and the addition of a second titanium binder (KKLPDA) (Ti-Hap 3 and Ti-Hap 4). The Ti-Hap peptide aptamer which exhibited the strongest intensity after the titanium dip coating was KKLPDAKKLPDAEEEEEEEE (Ti-Hap 4). On the other hand, hydroxyapatite surfaces, exhibiting an average roughness of S a = 1. 42 µm, showed a higher fluorescence for all peptides compared with titanium surfaces...|$|R

We report here, for the first time, the investigation of ion-track etching of poly(pphenylen...|$|E
