It is the second largest <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>source</b> of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, after fossil fuel combustion. Deforestation and forest degradation contribute to atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions through combustion of forest biomass and decomposition of remaining plant material and soil carbon. It used to account for more than 20% of carbon dioxide emissions, but it’s currently somewhere around the 10% mark. By 2008, deforestation was 12% of total , or 15% if peatlands are included. These proportions are likely to have fallen since given the continued rise of fossil fuel use.|$|E

40|$|Mercury {{emission}} {{into the}} atmosphere is a global concern due to its detrimental effects on human health in general. The two main sources of mercury emission are natural <b>sources</b> and <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>sources.</b> Mercury emission from natural sources include volcanic activity, weathering of rocks, water movement and biological processes which are obviously inevitable. The <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>sources</b> of mercury emission are from coal combustion, cement production and waste incineration. Thus, {{in order to reduce}} mercury emission it is appropriate to investigate how mercury is released from the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>sources</b> and consequently the mercury removal technology that can be implemented in order to reduce mercury emission {{into the atmosphere}}. Many alternatives have been developed to reduce mercury emission and the recent application of activated carbon showed high potential in the adsorption of elemental mercury.
