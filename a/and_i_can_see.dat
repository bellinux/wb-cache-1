Just a direct {{connection}} {{between you and the}} contact patch. The responses to steering, throttle, brake, and gearshift inputs are so nearly instantaneous that they verge on the telepathic. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> exactly what's happening, at least at {{the front end of the}} car, as the wheels turn and judder.|$|E
500|$|Present {{throughout}} the songs background {{is the use}} of violins and a choir, as well as guitar, string instruments, congas and a cajon. [...] However it does make subtle use of synths and electronic sounds. Musically and lyrically, it is influenced by Contemporary Christian music, and has a gospel feel, while including standard pop and R. The song opens with Bieber singing, [...] "And I pray" [...] over a keyboard, while the song's chorus repeats one simple refrain, [...] "I close my eyes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> a better day/ I close my eyes and pray." [...] In the lyrics, Bieber [...] "recognizes the pain and suffering in the world" [...] and then offers [...] "a passive solution" [...] through lines such as [...] "Children are crying / soldiers are dying / Some people don't have a home," [...] before compromising, [...] "I know there's sunshine beyond that rain / good times beyond that pain." [...] Vocally, Bieber's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles.|$|E
500|$|Lexie entertained several {{relationships}} {{throughout her}} time on Grey's Anatomy. In her early appearances, she maintained {{a friendship with}} George O'Malley, until developing romantic feelings towards him. Rhimes offered the insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They’re really good friends <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. She is my kind of girl. The girl who likes the guy {{because he is a}} GOOD guy and that's what George is. He is a good guy and that's something that Lexie could use now. She's going through her own challenges what with Meredith and losing her own mother and trying to keep things afloat. I’m rooting for Lexie. She's my kind of girl and I hope that she gets what she deserves: love. And more kisses. There should always be that." [...] Lexie's most significant relationship was with Mark Sloan. Following her death, Rhimes said: ...|$|E

500|$|Knight felt a {{parallel}} to George in that his [...] "confidence isn't always at its absolute highest", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the friendship evolving into something even greater." [...] When asked what his [...] "favorite George moment" [...] was, Knight said his relationships with Stevens and Bailey.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the [...] "premise {{was a little}} thinly {{stretched}} over the hour" [...] and believed {{it would have been}} overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one, but was glad to have another hour of Fringe regardless. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall disliked that the network failed to issue a [...] "disclaimer" [...] about the episode's production date, stating [...] "...maybe the producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to the franchise. Or perhaps, unhappily, it is a sign that Fox has given up on this show, and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused." [...] She concluded, [...] "As a standalone episode, this one was of middling interest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> why Fox would have dropped it from the Season One lineup. Fans looking eagerly for more 'mythology' episodes, where the links between the Fringe team, Massive Dynamics, Nina Sharpe, William Bell and, for all I know, the Illuminati are explored, may be disappointed." [...] Jane Boursaw of AOL TV was also critical of Fox for giving no warning about the episode and thought it should actually have been titled 'Walter vs. The Priest.'" [...] She continued, [...] "The whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith, not to mention the whole 'being possessed by a dead person because your brain waves crossed during life and death' thing. You can tell it was vintage Fringe -- if indeed it was -- because the storylines are more complex than that these days, what with the alternate universe and Leonard Nimoy and all." [...] Various critics noted guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly when she had to give the impression she was possessed by a male ghost; most reviews were negative, though Boursaw praised it, giving Kremelberg [...] "high fives".|$|E

2500|$|To {{the chagrin}} of long-time fans, the band waited until 2010 to perform live, despite having been {{together}} (as Shadow Gallery) since the early 1990s. When asked the question in one interview, Wehrkamp explained that [...] "We have always been more a studio band than a performing band unfortunately, and while we rehearsed for a tour just before Tyranny was started, a few obstacles blocked our touring options, and we were locked back in the studio to make another record.

2500|$|R. G. Frey, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bowling Green State University, is a preference utilitarian, as is Singer, but reaches a very different conclusion, arguing in Interests and Rights (1980) that animals have no interests for the utilitarian to take into account. Frey argues that interests are dependent on desire, and that no desire can exist without a corresponding belief. Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order belief—a belief about the belief—which he argues requires language: [...] "If someone were to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I see it, that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences." ...|$|E
2500|$|The PlayStation Move {{has been}} {{generally}} well received. Game Informer gave it an 8 out of 10, saying, [...] "The PlayStation Eye and motion controller are a killer combination for accurate and highly responsive motion-based gameplay, and we applaud Sony {{for getting the}} hardware right the first time." [...] Kotaku praised its accuracy, design, use of augmented reality and said that [...] "The Playstation Move is a intuitive, natural feeling way to play games and it brings with it not only a sense of increased immersion to already graphically immersive games, but {{a new way to}} play with your reality and a refreshing form of colorful feedback." [...] IGN gave the Move an 8.5 out of 10, noting that the launch line-up of games for the controller was insufficient though it summarized by saying [...] "At the end of the day, the PlayStation Move {{has the potential to be}} the best motion control system on the current crop of consoles." [...] Joystiq praised the Move, saying [...] "The hardware's great, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it being used in a multitude of really cool ways, but of course it's only as cool as the games that use it" [...] and that the launch line-up was not worth the purchase, though it believed that the Move would be worth the purchase in early 2011 due to a stronger line-up of games such as [...] and Killzone 3. CVG gave the Move an extremely positive review and awarded it 9 out of 10, saying that [...] "Sony's motion control gets beyond being a gimmick. We found ourselves constantly itching for 'one more go'." [...] The Guardian strongly criticized the Move's launch line-up, though it noted that the hardware was strong and that after playing with the Move it was [...] "very hard to go back to the relative inaccuracy of the Wii".|$|E
2500|$|Hatton {{agreed to}} terms on 27 July for an 8 December 2007 welterweight fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. which was {{considered}} to be the biggest welterweight fight since the 1999 clash between Oscar De La Hoya and Puerto Rican legend Tito Trinidad. The MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue on 17 August 2007. The fight was agreed to less than three months after Mayweather had said he planned to retire following a victory over Oscar De La Hoya. Hatton was able to bring the fight to Mayweather in the early rounds. In the 1st round, Hatton caught Mayweather with a left jab which knocked Mayweather off balance. His constant pressure appeared to make Mayweather uncomfortable at first. In the third round, Mayweather landed a right that cut Hatton above the right eye. In round six, referee Joe Cortez took a point away from Hatton after he appeared to hit Mayweather {{on the back of the}} head while Mayweather was rested between the ropes. However, the punch was revealed to have hit the rope rather than Mayweather's head, but Hatton was warned for punching behind the head on numerous occasions before the deduction. Hatton became angry at the referee's decision to deduct a point and turned his back on him. Hatton later claimed he was angered by the referee, which caused him to lose his calm and contributed to his downfall. Hatton was able to hold his own until round eight, when Mayweather began to adapt to Hatton and started counterattacking. Mayweather knocked Hatton down to the mat in round ten. Hatton got up, but Mayweather quickly resumed his attack, resulting in Joe Cortez putting a stop to the fight and Hatton's corner threw in the towel. Mayweather commented post-match that [...] "Ricky Hatton is one tough fighter. He is still a champion in my eyes and I'd love to see him fight again... Ricky Hatton is probably one of toughest competitors I've faced. I hit him with some big ones but he kept coming <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> why they call him the 'Hitman'." [...] The fight received large amounts of publicity, with both fighters promoting the fight heavily.|$|E
