5|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1954, when the Independent Subway System (IND) started operating D trains on the Culver Line. At the time, the tracks had lettered names (i.e. Track A, Track B, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Track H {{from east to}} west). However, the IND also used lettered designations for its routes (i.e. A, B, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to H as well). The BMT had used numbered route designations up to this point, so this {{had not been a}} problem. However, the D route was now using the Culver Line, which departed from tracks E and F. To avoid confusion, the tracks were renamed with numbered designations, which they still carry.|$|E
