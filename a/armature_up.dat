5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic <b>armature</b> vibrated <b>up</b> and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|R

5000|$|The {{telegraph}} sounder {{was used}} at {{the receiving end of}} the line to make the Morse code message audible. Its simple mechanism was similar to a relay. It consisted of an electromagnet attached to the telegraph line, with an iron armature near the magnet's pole balanced on a pivot, held up by a counterweight. When current flowed through the electromagnet's winding, it created a magnetic field which attracted the armature, pulling it down to the electromagnet, resulting in a [...] "click" [...] sound. When the current ended, the counterweight pulled the <b>armature</b> back <b>up</b> to its resting position, resulting in a [...] "clack" [...] sound. Thus, as the telegraph key at the sending end makes and breaks the contact, the sounder echoes the up and down state of the key.|$|R

Two types {{have been developed for}} operation at 150 EC which are able to withstand an acceleration of 2000 g, and a high-temperature (600 EC) transducer is now in the final stage of development. The body of the low-temperature transducer is made of high-temperature epoxy resin, and that of the high-temperature transducer of ceramic material. Iron wire is used as core material to reduce eddy current losses. The dimensions of the transducers are 0. 25 inch diameter and 0. 5 inch long, and 0. 125 inch diameter and 0. 25 inch long, including terminations. A linear displacement of the armature material can be measured at distances up to 0. 01 inch, and because of the high carrier frequency, the vibration of this <b>armature</b> can be <b>up</b> to 30 Kcs.

40|$|As {{electromagnetic}} launcher (EML) is {{an apparatus}} {{that uses the}} electromagnetic (EMAG) force to propel an armature along a rail. An applied electric current, coupled with the resulting magnetic field, creates an EMAG force capable of accelerating an <b>armature</b> to velocities <b>up</b> to several thousand meters per second. The high sliding velocity, coupled with the electric current density, creates extreme thermal conditions at the interface between the rail and the armature that can cause melting at the interface. This project considers a lab-scale EML which is pre-loaded to establish the initial contact between arils and armature. This contact area influences {{the flow of the}} electric current and, therefore, it affects the thermal conditions significantly. This work presents a finite-element analysis (FEA) of the aforementioned physical phenomena of the lab-scale EML. This work is aimed at improving the understanding of the armature-to-rail performance and the useful life of an EML by developing a computer simulation which {{can be used as a}} design tool to acquire conditiodecoup for the best performance. A two-dimensional structural FEA is used to determine the structural deformation, the contact area, the contact pressure, the von Mises stress, and the material properties of the structural compliance. The vibration characteristics of the lab-scale EML armature are studied using Modal analysis. A three-dimensional electromagnetic FEA is performed to determine the EMAG force. Frictional and Joule heating are determined from a two-dimensional thermal FEA. The commercial finite-element package, ANSYS, is used in the simulation. M. S.

40|$|Meiofauna assemblages {{were studied}} along {{putative}} organic enrichment gradients at two marine salmon farms: Loch Ewe, Scotland, U. K. and Nubeena, SE Tasmania, Australia; and a sewage outfall: Sandy Bay, SE Tasmania. The broad {{objective was to}} identify any general meiofauna responses to organic enrichment. 1. No evidence of parallel meiobenthic communities (the same genera occurring at different geographical locations in environments with similar environmental conditions) was found in areas of high organic input. 2. Nubeena was the only site where a "classical" pattern of community response to organic enrichment was found. Severe enrichment (sediments are organically rich and anoxic zones are near the surface; nematodes and annelids can be found; other taxonomic groups, e. g. harpacticoids, are rare) existed under the cage centre. Moderate enrichment (sediments have slightly elevated organic content and anoxic zones may, or may not, {{be close to the}} surface; annelids, nematodes, and harpacticoids are present, though numbers of taxa are reduced and densities may vary from depaup erate to population blooms, i. e. densities one or two orders of magnitude above normal) occurred from under the cage periphery out to 5 m. Slight enrichment (sediment changes are difficult to detect, densities a n d species richness are elevated and there are a b normal species abundance patterns) occurred from 10 to 20 m. 3. At Loch Ewe, severe enrichment occurred under the cage periphery. The region 10 to 25 m from the cage appeared to be moderately enriched, with slight enrichment out to 100 m. This contradicts the results of macrobenthic and physico-chemical surveys that have never indicated effects extending more that 50 m from Scottish s almon cages. 4. The Loch Ewe meiofauna as semblages were markedly different to those from Nubeena because no population blooms were detected and no harpacticoid genera were limited to the area of highest organic enrichment. Population blooms may have been missed because they are a seasonal phenomenon, or because the moderately enriched zone occurred b etween two sampling sites. Differences in harpacticoid distributions at the two locations are probably because of the background organic content which was high at Loch Ewe and low at Nubeena. 5. At Sandy Bay, there was a sharp demarcation in sediment structure and meiofauna a ssemblages 20 m from the sewage outfall. It is reasonable to assume that the sewage effluent was responsible for the sediment modification and therefore the faunal changes. Compared to sites > 20 m from the outfall, sites close to the outfall had a different nematode species composition; fewer nematode taxa; and a depauperate harpacticoid assemblage. Nematode densities were similar at all sites. 6. At a Nubeena cage site, recovery changes in the meiofauna were monitored for six months after the fish had been removed. Neither nematodes nor harpacticoids showed a full recovery over the period. No change in the organic content of the sediment was detected. Benthic oxygen uptake measurements indicated it would take more than 18 months for the physicochemical environment to return to normal. 7. Nematode population changes were gradual and there was a trend for assemblages at different enriched sites to converge. Changes in morphological types were apparent. When the cage was stocked, Type l a nematodes (buccal cavity small, no <b>armature)</b> made <b>up</b> the greatest proportion of the assemblage. After cessation of organic input, these decreased and Type 2 a (buccal cavity medium sized, armature as small teeth) increased; while later in the recovery Type 2 a decreased and Type Ib (buccal cavity medium sized, no armature) increased. This pattern could b e detected along temporal and spatial gradients from the organic input source. 8. Harpacticoids experienced rapid population fluctuations with numerically dominant taxa changing in the space of weeks. When the cage was stocked the harpacticoid assemblages at the enriched sites were similar and consisted mostly of epibenthic taxa. In later samples the interstitial taxa increased and the assemblages tended to diverge. This is probably caused by spatial differences in the rate of recovery of subsurface sediments. 9. Among nematode and harpacticoid a ssemblages, density and number of genera were more sensitive to organic enrichment than Evenness or Shannon-Wiener diversity. Contrary to many other studies described in the literature, Evenness tended to be high at severely enriched sites decreasing to minimum but extremely variable values in the moderately enriched zone. 10. Harpacticoids were not very sensitive when comparing sites in highly enriched zones, due to high b etween-replicate variability. Neither harpacticoids nor nematodes were very sensitive when comparing sites in areas of mild disturbance and thus were not useful for delineating the precise area affected by enrichment. However, by combining data for the two taxocenes with that for other components of the fauna e. g. macrofauna, greater sensitivity could be obtained. 11. If monitoring is restricted to a single taxocene, a multivariate method which determines associations of taxa and their distributions is more sen sitive for detecting changes in environmental conditions than site classification. This method gave similar results to those obtained by combining all data in a site classification...|$|R
