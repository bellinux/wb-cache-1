2500|$|A typical winter, {{with average}} {{temperatures}} around the freezing point during January and February, {{means that a}} period of mild weather (often windy or/and rainy) {{is followed by a}} colder period (when precipitation falls as snow)—and then the mild weather returns etc., rather than a stable temperature close to zero degrees. During the colder periods, the temperature often is below freezing point also during daytime, while as during the milder periods, temperatures below freezing point are unusual even at night. During the mild periods temperatures slightly below freezing point only occur if the night is both calm and free of clouds. If the same circumstances occur during a cold period, the nights can get very cold though.

There's nothing shockingly innovative like his first successes, {{but by now}} he's experienced enough {{to work with a}} limited palette while still giving each track an individual affect ('Prueba De Farmacia', which somehow manages not to be sappy; the salsified 'Aqui La Que Fallo Fue Usted'). Another of Vico C's strengths is his ability to vary vocal tone and timbre to suit a song: playfully prickly on 'Payasito'; tender on 'Moriré'; commanding on the upbraiding 'Polvora'. He still has an unfortunate tendency to moralize ('El Corazón Se Pone Bruto'; 'Angelina'), but his skills are equally undimmed by time, and though no one tune is a socks-rocker, it all <b>adds</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> satisfying whole."
