2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Massimo Pigliucci on the Rationally Thinking podcast, Baggott stated that science is a human endeavor with a [...] "fuzziness around the edges". He {{went on to say}} that there are no rules and, when training to be a scientist, no one gives you an instruction book on how to do science. [...] "We kinda make it up <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along...</b> and it is perfectly reasonable for the scientific community to want to change those rules." [...] Science writer Philip Ball, in a review of Farewell in The Guardian, stated that Baggott was right [...] "although his target is as much the way this science is marketed as what it contains." [...] Ball cautioned Baggott about criticising scientists that speculate because [...] "conjecture injects vitality into science." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't {{you tell}} me now--I see we cannot be overheard--and if {{anything}} strikes you <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along,</b> just run it in. I shall understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} inside, please?" [...] she insisted. [...] "There are {{one or two}} {{questions}} which I might ask you <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b> Please direct the chauffeur." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hooper {{stated that}} [...] "Placing John Williams's themes became obvious <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b> The {{beginning}} of the film has {{to have at least}} a hint of 'Hedwig's Theme'." ...|$|R
60|$|He had {{improved}} his own spirits, {{no less than}} Mrs. Gummidge's, for they were again at their usual flow, and {{he was full of}} vivacious conversation <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b>|$|R
60|$|I turned back, and inquired of my conductor, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> how Mrs. Steerforth was. She {{said her}} lady was but poorly, {{and kept her}} own room a good deal.|$|R
60|$|I {{missed the}} Fair it is true, but I {{picked up some}} {{diplomatic}} tricks which I and the reader may find handy and useful <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b>|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} girl {{spoke in the}} native tongue, which was quite incomprehensible to our travellers, {{but if we are}} to {{enlighten}} our readers we must needs translate <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us be off at once," [...] Dr. Wade {{said to his}} companion; [...] "we {{can talk}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b> I have got two rifles with me; I can lend you one." ...|$|E
60|$|Of course I {{was only}} too glad to follow him. He {{conducted}} {{me to an}} elegant mansion in Bayswater, and chatted pleasantly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> in somewhat nautical tones, for {{he had been a}} man-of-war's man. His name was Flaxmore.|$|R
60|$|What {{his wife}} {{mentioned}} {{of his being}} a tale-teller, {{as well as a}} musician, now occurred to me; and as you know I like tales of superstition, I begged to have a specimen of his talent <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b>|$|R
60|$|We soon {{reached the}} edge of the plain where Jack had been {{separated}} from his companion, and here we proceeded to make a careful search. Being certain that the savages were now out of earshot, we began to halloo occasionally <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b> But monkeys and parrots alone replied to us.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, old fellow. I {{can tell}} you how to find the place <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> in the gig. By-the-by, there's one thing that's rather important. I'd better mention it while I think of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, we {{can take}} it easily, Wilcox, and we will stop at the first cocoa-nut tree we come to. Now, Tom, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> you shall tell us about yesterday, we have not heard a word yet.” ...|$|E
60|$|Isa. You must guide him, by back ways, to my uncle's house, {{and so to}} my cousin's chamber, that he may {{not know}} where he is when he comes there. The rest I'll tell you <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b>|$|E
60|$|The bell of the {{old church}} was ringing <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> and many respectable-looking people and cleanly dressed {{children}} were moving towards the sound. Soon we reached the church, and I have seen nothing yet in England that so completely answered my idea of what such a thing was, as this old village church of Bebbington.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, I did once--but I {{never did}} it again. I caught one, a kitten, {{and set off}} {{with a number of}} boys to kill it; but <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> it began to play with my neck-tie and to purr! Our hearts were softened, so <b>we</b> let it <b>go.</b> Ah! Corrie, my boy, never go hunting cats," [...] said Montague, earnestly.|$|R
5000|$|Parker {{remained}} at WBAL-TV {{until his retirement}} in 1994. [...] Reflecting on his varied roles in the early pioneering years of commercial television, Parker recalled in 2008 that when he started at WAAM in 1951, earning $45 per week, [...] "We just figured things out <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b> In six months, you did everything. I could run a control board, or put on a cooking show".|$|R
6000|$|... "Through here," [...] said Mr. Pogram, {{coming to}} a side door in the garden wall, [...] "we can make a short cut to the police station. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> I shall ask you one or two blunt questions." [...] And he thrust out his under lip: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on. I'll {{tell you}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b> We haven't {{a minute to}} lose." [...] And as we hurried up town, Joe Goose explained: [...] "It's the Hancock Fire Brigade. All {{you have to do}} is wear a red shirt and a helmet, and carry a torch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{it not be}} well, general, if I were to {{tell off}} a dozen parties of twenty men, each {{under the command of}} a steady non-commissioned officer, to enter the houses {{on each side of the}} road <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along,</b> and to clear out any {{soldiers}} they may find there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had been}} led to believe that No Man's Land was {{littered}} with the unburied dead, but I saw nothing of the sort at this place. There had been no German counter attack since our men came up here. But at one point <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> the trench there was a dull stench. [...] "Germans, I think," [...] said my guide, though I did not see how he could tell.|$|R
60|$|I {{know not}} whether {{the day was}} fair or foul; in {{descending}} the drive, I gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame. I {{wanted to see the}} invisible thing on which, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> he appeared to fasten a glance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he seemed breasting and resisting.|$|R
60|$|At the {{appointed}} {{time in the}} evening, Mr. Micawber reappeared. I washed my hands and face, to do the greater honour to his gentility, and we walked to our house, as I suppose I must now call it, together; Mr. Micawber impressing the name of streets, and the shapes of corner houses upon me, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> that I might find my way back, easily, in the morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{anyone should}} come along," [...] Jim said, [...] "it is too dark {{for them to}} see those fellows lying in the boat. Now, we must take our {{bearings}} accurately <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along,</b> so as {{to be able to find}} the boat again if things go wrong with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand, sir. I {{will take}} Pat Hogan with me; he {{has plenty of}} the brogue, and can talk the {{language}} too. So if any one should speak to us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along</b> he can do the talking, {{and no one will}} suspect that we are not a couple of countrymen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{when we go}} down {{country roads}} we'll sing <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along,</b> and we'll sing by the campfires, too. We're going camping, that's all. Taking a {{vacation}} and seeing the country. So why shouldn't {{we have a good}} time? Why, we don't even know where we're going to sleep to-night, or any night. Think of the fun!" ...|$|E
60|$|The tone {{in which}} this was uttered settled the point, and turned the {{wavering}} balance of the creature's affections in my favour. With all the indicators extremely pendulous, and its hairy coat hanging in a species of limp humility, my doggie followed me home; but I observed that, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> he ever and anon turned a wistful glance in {{the direction in which}} the ragged waif had disappeared.|$|R
40|$|Extract:It was the mid- 80 s and I {{remember}} an eminent academic {{telling me}} that I should read a book by some authors called Fisher and Ury. She said it would help me understand something about interest based negotiating and could be useful in training courses for mediators. Positions … interests … transitions … reframes [...] . etc, etc. It was a steep learning curve and <b>we</b> were experimenting <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along...</b>|$|R
60|$|Shouldering our trusty rifles, and {{buckling}} tight {{the belts}} of our heavy hunting-knives, we sallied forth after {{the manner of}} American Indians, in single file, keeping, as may well be supposed, a sharp lookout <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b> The fact was that long delay, frequent disappointment, and now the near prospect of success, conspired together to fill us with a species of nervous excitement that caused us to start at every sound.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Gordon. [...] "It's {{quite what}} one would expect. We do things differently. We heave our rails down and fill up the country with miners and farmers while you'd be {{worrying}} over your parliamentary bills. We strengthen our track <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along,</b> and we'll have iron bridges over every river {{just as soon as}} they're wanted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fortunately we all speak French without accent, {{and there}} is nothing about us to give rise to {{suspicion}} that we belong to La Vendee. If we can think of a more likely story, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along,</b> all the better. When we get as far as Macon, if we ever get there, we can decide whether to endeavour to cross the frontier into Switzerland, or to go down to Toulon.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have found}} me sitting here sure enough," [...] said Phoebe; [...] "but {{if you wish}} to keep me company, you must walk to the Lodge with me; and you shall carry my pitcher for me, if you will be so kind. I will hear all the good things you have to say to me <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>along.</b> But Sir Henry calls for his glass of water {{regularly}} before prayers." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{that the}} {{strength}} in me had quieted her and given her confidence, {{filled me with}} an exultant joy. The youth of the race seemed burgeoning in me, over-civilized man that I was, and I lived for myself the old hunting days and forest nights of my remote and forgotten ancestry. I had much for which to thank Wolf Larsen, was my thought <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along</b> the path between the jostling harems.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall address him, {{first of}} all," [...] the Professor {{explained}} <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along,</b> [...] "with a few playful {{remarks on the}} weather. I shall then question him about the Other Professor. This will have a double advantage. First, it will open the conversation (you can't even drink {{a bottle of wine}} without opening it first): and secondly, if he's seen the Other Professor, we shall find him that way: and, if he hasn't, we sha'n't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the day is}} {{beginning}} to break. In half an hour's time the sun will be up, and the wild beasts will have all retired to their lairs. I hope we shall see no more of them. It is all very well to fight under such advantages; but on foot, were a tiger hiding near a path, he would {{be sure to have}} one of us <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>along.</b> Our knives would not do more than tickle him." ...|$|R
