5|$|Congress sanctioned the {{economic}} emergency {{law and the}} state reform law. The first allowed the president to reduce or remove subsidies, and the latter to privatize state enterprises – the first being telephones and airlines. These privatizations were beneficial to foreign creditors, who replaced their bonds with company shares. Despite increased tax revenue, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from privatizations, the economy was still unstable. The Bunge and Born businessmen left the government in late 1989, amid {{a second round of}} hyperinflation. The first measure of the new minister of economy, Érman González, was a mandatory conversion of time deposits into government bonds: the Bonex plan. It generated more recession, but hyperinflation was reduced. He also reduces social spending, including those for people with disabilities.|$|E

The deal for the briefcase fell through, but {{the man who had}} promised Dworkin the money gave her the airline ticket anyway, and she returned to the United States in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Fares {{were stored}} in a money room at 370 Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn {{starting}} in 1951, when the building opened as a headquarters for the New York City Board of Transportation. The building {{is close to the}} lines of all three subway divisions (the IRT, BMT, and IND) and thus was a convenient location to collect fares, including tokens and cash, via money train. Passageways from the subway stations, including a visible door in the Jay Street IND station, lead to a money sorting room {{in the basement of the}} building. Fare collection and transport was originally performed using armored trucks, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> trains were replaced by armored trucks in 2006.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the papal}} plans were not {{supported}} by the other European monarchs, who had lost enthusiasm for the Crusades. Only one western monarch attended the Council, the elderly James I of Aragon, who could only offer a small force. There was fundraising for a new crusade, and plans were made, but never followed through. The projects essentially came to a halt with the death of Pope Gregory on , <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> which had been raised to finance the expedition was instead distributed in Italy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the search for}} the remains of the ship herself, there was considerable Australian interest in locating relics of the ship's south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the sixcannons thrown overboard when Endeavour grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> went unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an Endeavour cannon from shallow water near the Reef.|$|E

The family moved to Nablus in the West Bank, then under Jordanian control. Abu Nidal graduated from high school there in 1955, and joined the Arab nationalist Ba'ath party.

5|$|To {{meet the}} free market situation, the company's {{management}} introduced measures to keep costs low. On 19 August 1993, ten of eleven trade unions agreed to a three-year wage contract, which contained bonuses for all employees based on the company's profit. The cabin crew's union had a two-day strike, before reaching an agreement. At the same time, the company needed NOK400 million in share capital. Braathens Rederi sold the sister company Braathens Helikopter to Helkopter Service for NOK225 million on 30 September 1993, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was used to buy Braathens SAFE stock. The company raised further capital in an initial public offering, and the company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 10 January 1994. After the listing, Braathens Rederi retained 69% of the company.|$|E

Cecil manages to throw Bart off the cliff, declaring he will kill Bart as Bob never could; ironically, Bob grabs the cord of the dynamite and dives down {{in an effort to}} save him.

5|$|Due to the war, the SAFA {{suspended}} its {{competition from}} 1916 through to 1918. Despite this official suspension, {{a group of}} South Australian clubs decided to form their own league in 1916 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> generated would be put toward the war effort. The Railways Football Club {{was one of the}} clubs that participated in this competition and managed to attract Harold Oliver to be the clubs captain. Unfortunately for the Railways, Oliver would only play one game for the Railways, and would instead return to Berri to focus on his farm. Later in the season, Oliver returned to Port Adelaide to play a few games for the club who was also partaking in the Patriotic League. Port Adelaide would end up winning the 1916 South Australian Patriotic League Grand Final defeating West Torrens 7.11 (53) to 1.13 (19). Harold Oliver played for Port Adelaide during the game and kicked a goal.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{accumulated}} debts (including {{payments for}} her property in Auburn), Tubman fell prey in 1873 to a swindle involving gold transfer. Two men, one named Stevenson {{and the other}} John Thomas, claimed to have in their possession a cache of gold smuggled out of South Carolina. They offered this treasure – worth about US$5,000, they claimed – for US$2,000 in cash. They insisted that they knew a relative of Tubman's, and she took them into her home, where they stayed for several days. She knew that white people in the South had buried valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and also that black men were frequently assigned to digging duties. Thus the situation seemed plausible, and a combination of her financial woes and her good nature led her {{to go along with}} the plan. She borrowed the money from a wealthy friend named Anthony Shimer, and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, however, they attacked her and knocked her out with chloroform, then stole her purse and bound and gagged her. When she was found by her family, she was dazed and injured, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was gone.|$|E

5|$|In November 1995 the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust {{purchased}} the locomotive for £200,000 (through a third party) {{and the following}} February it {{was transferred to the}} Trust's premises at the Midland Railway in Butterley,Derbyshire. In 1998, funded by public donation and the Heritage Lottery Fund, the third party purchaser was paid off <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was now available to restore the locomotive. The work was carried out at the railway workshops at Swanwick Junction and in July 2001 the restored locomotive was allowed a trial run on the national rail network, where it promptly broke down and had to be towed home. With the fault fixed, No. 46233 now started to generate income by hauling enthusiasts' trains, as well as the Royal Train on two occasions. Following another overhaul commencing in 2010, the locomotive resumed its steaming duties in 2012. As at October 2016, it is still owned by the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust and still pulling enthusiasts' specials.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his {{relationship}} with Katz <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including the CWA), Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for a renewal of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E

He eventually rose to be three times mayor of Hulster Ambacht and twice mayor of Hulst. Thanks to powerful allies in the Middelburg chamber of the VOC he was able to successfully appeal for the cancellation of the fines placed on him, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> was returned. In 1640 he married Anna van Driel, who died that same year while giving birth to Nuyts' third son, also called Pieter. In 1649 he married his third (or perhaps fourth) and final wife, Agnes Granier, who was to outlive him.|$|E

5|$|Show {{producers}} {{removed a}} sketch {{which would include}} a rape joke upon Carter's discovery of his daughter, Lois, with her secret family on the southern plantation. Unlike past requests to cut and/or alter jokes, this was not one imposed by the broadcast standards and practices; this was done on the writers' own accord. The sequence showing Peter's silent film star ancestor being stabbed in a card fight was omitted from television broadcasting to save time. Near {{the end of the}} episode, the Griffins are shown arguing over the quality of The Godfather; this scene is drawn from an actual argument that has taken place in the Family Guy writing room over its quality. MacFarlane prefers The 'Burbs <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Money</b> Pit, both of which were received very poorly. Adolf Hitler talking to his wife about his annoyance at Peter Hitler was also removed from television broadcasting for timing purposes.|$|E
5|$|When U.S. President Andrew Jackson {{allowed the}} charter of the Second Bank of the United States to expire in 1836, the U.S. was without any sort of central bank, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> supply in New York City fluctuated with the country's annual {{agricultural}} cycle. Each autumn money flowed out of the city as harvests were purchased and—in an effort to attract money back—interest rates were raised. Foreign investors then sent their money to New York {{to take advantage of the}} higher rates. From the January 1906 Dow Jones Industrial Average high of 103, the market began a modest correction that would continue throughout the year. The April 1906 earthquake that devastated San Francisco contributed to the market instability, prompting an even greater flood of money from New York to San Francisco to aid reconstruction. A further stress on the money supply occurred in late 1906, when the Bank of England raised its interest rates, partly in response to UK insurance companies paying out so much to US policyholders, and more funds remained in London than expected. From their peak in January, stock prices declined 18% by July 1906. By late September, stocks had recovered about half of their losses.|$|E
