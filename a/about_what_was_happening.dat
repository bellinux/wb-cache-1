5|$|In 1943, the Kampfgruppe Auschwitz (Combat Group Auschwitz) was {{organized}} {{with the aim}} of sending out information <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> Sonderkommandos buried notes in the ground, hoping they would be found by the camp's liberators. The group also smuggled out photographs of corpses and preparations for mass killings in mid-1944.|$|E
5|$|German {{citizens}} (despite much of {{the later}} denial) had access to information <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening,</b> as soldiers returning from the occupied territories would report on what they had seen and done. Evans states that most German citizens disapproved of the genocide. Some Polish citizens tried to rescue or hide the remaining Jews {{and members of the}} Polish underground got word to their government in exile in London as to what was happening.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} to pin point any one reason as being the main cause or catalyst of the mutiny. However, a recent perspective has emerged {{of the role of}} global connections. The mutiny has revealed the permeable nature of colonial boundaries and the way that external influences were able to reach the colonies in Southeast Asia. The sepoys of the 5th Light Infantry were constantly being bombarded with information <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> outside of Singapore. As news of the fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan spread, an anti-British movement spearheaded by the Ghadar Party was also disseminating special pamphlets in a variety of languages which were reaching through secret channels {{into the hands of the}} sepoys. Acrimonious slogans against the British only fuelled the anti-colonial sentiment among the sepoys. Some of the slogans were “the wicked English and their allies are now attacking Islam, but the German Emperor and the Sultan of Turkey have sworn to liberate Asia from the tyranny. Now is the time to rise.... Only your strength and religious zeal are required”. The sepoys were clearly being bombarded with a lot of anti-British sentiments while being stationed on the small island of Singapore.|$|E

25|$|The Empire of Aksum {{was one of}} {{the first}} African polities {{economically}} and politically ambitious enough to issue its own coins, which bore legends in Ge'ez and Greek. From the reign of Endubis up to Armah (approximately 270 to 610), gold, silver and bronze coins were minted. Issuing coinage in ancient times was an act of great importance in itself, for it proclaimed that the Aksumite Empire considered itself equal to its neighbors. Many of the coins are used as signposts <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> when they were minted. An example being the addition of the cross to the coin after the conversion of the empire to Christianity. The presence of coins also simplified trade, and was at once a useful instrument of propaganda and a source of profit to the empire.|$|E
25|$|In February–March 1994, {{detailed}} {{reports from}} the Canadian embassy in Kigali meant that the Canadian government {{was one of the}} best informed nations in the world about the coming Rwandan genocide. The foreign minister André Ouellet claimed that he nor anyone else in the Cabinet ever saw the reports from Rwanda. On April 6, 1994, the Rwandan genocide began. The government in Ottawa was apparently kept well-informed <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> by diplomats and Canadian Forces serving as UN peacekeepers, but the genocide was not considered to be a major problem for Canada, with the Chrétien government taking the view that other powers would stop the genocide. The government first insisted in April 1994 that there was only a civil war in Rwanda, and once it become clear that genocide had begun, on May 2, 1994, Ouellet, speaking for the government in the House of Commons promised humanitarian aid and expressed the hope that the Organization for African Unity would do something to stop the genocide. In 2010, the Canadian government apologized to the people of Rwanda for indifference to the genocide of 1994.|$|E
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in Europe. You will {{remember}} {{at that time the}} Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing a thing that no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

500|$|Still {{dissatisfied}} with Spector's [...] "Cinemascope"-like production on [...] "Wah-Wah", when All Things Must Pass was reissued in January 2001, Harrison {{admitted that he}} had been tempted to remix many of the tracks rather than simply remaster the album's original mixes. In an interview with Guitar World magazine to promote the reissue, he also revealed that McCartney had [...] "long since" [...] apologised for his behaviour towards him during the Beatles years. In the 2000 book The Beatles Anthology, Harrison comments: [...] "It's important to state that a lot of water has gone under the bridge...

500|$|When {{he began}} work on the score for A New Beginning, Manfredini created a theme just for the {{character}} of Tommy Jarvis. The idea was {{to suggest that there}} was [...] "madness afoot", which he believed helped to [...] "'point the finger' at various characters [...] to suggest that things were not as you might expect". For Jason Lives, Tom McLoughlin instructed Manfredini to create a score that would not alert the audience <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> or about to happen, [...] "but instead allow the audience to do it to themselves". McLoughlin took this idea from John Carpenter's 1978 film Halloween, which would always follow any shock in the film with Carpenter's [...] "Eeeeeeee!" [...] sound. McLoughlin wanted something more subtle, with a [...] "Gothic" [...] resonance.|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of the [...] University of Melbourne, where she studied medicine and excelled at sports, Mary qualified as a general practitioner in 1921 and became a resident surgeon at Royal Melbourne Hospital. Her work was mainly with poor women, many of whom lived in unsanitary conditions and had inadequate diets. The social mores of the time often kept young women ignorant of matters dealing with sex and pregnancy. She recognised that pregnant women in particular needed more information <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> to them, and provided information on birth control {{at a time when}} many doctors and a large segment of the community were opposed to it. [...] "She broke taboos", Della Hilton later wrote, and [...] "made forbidden subjects not only matters for discussion, but for action".|$|E

This clinic functioned for one day a week until 1945 when it was discontinued, as the advice it offered could by then be obtained elsewhere. The social mores of the time often kept young women ignorant of matters dealing with sex and pregnancy, but she recognised that pregnant women in particular needed more information <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> to them.

2500|$|By {{the time}} of his death, Romero had built up an {{enormous}} following among Salvadorans. He did this largely through broadcasting his weekly sermons across El Salvador on the Church's station, YSAX, [...] "except when it was bombed off the air."
