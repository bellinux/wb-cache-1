5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulations.</b> There is about 125mL of CSF at any one time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulations.</b> These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the CSF is formed in the choroid plexus and flows through the brain along a distinct pathway: moving through the cerebral ventricular system, into the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain, then draining into the systemic blood column via <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulations</b> of the dural sinuses or to peripheral lymphatics along cranial nerve sheathes. Many researchers {{have suggested that the}} CSF compartment constitutes a sink for interstitial solute and fluid clearance from the brain parenchyma. However, the distances between the interstitial fluid and the CSF in the ventricles and subarachnoid space are too great for the efficient removal of interstitial macromolecules and wastes by simple diffusion alone. Helen Cserr at Brown University calculated that mean diffusion times for large molecules such as albumin would exceed 100hrs to traverse 1cm of brain tissue, a rate that is not compatible with the intense metabolic demands of brain tissue. A clearance system based on simple diffusion would additionally lack the sensitivity to respond rapidly to deviations from homeostatic conditions.|$|E

5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It {{is not clear whether}} this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous narrowing in the transverse sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF resorption via <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulation</b> and further rise in ICP.|$|R

40|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) is a blinding condition amongst the young obese female population characterised by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). The aetiology of IIH {{is not known}} and, as highlighted in the 2005 Cochrane review, an evidence base for treatment has not been established, although weight loss is frequently advocated. Obesity is associated with dysregulation of cortisol metabolism by 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 β-HSD 1). Additionally, 11 β-HSD 1 has {{a role in the}} regulation of intraocular pressure. This thesis hypothesised that 11 β-HSD 1 is involved in the aetiology of IIH and examined the roles of obesity, 11 β-HSD 1 and metabolic changes in the pathogenesis and treatment of IIH. We demonstrated that ICP regulating structures (choroid plexus and <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulation</b> tissue), are potential glucocorticoid target tissues expressing 11 β-HSD 1. Metabolomic analysis identified a unique biofluid metabolite biomarker profile, with potential implications for IIH pathogenesis. We established the therapeutic efficacy of weight loss in IIH (improving headaches, papilloedema and ICP) and provided evidence that the beneficial effects may relate to alterations in the glucocorticoid profile driving 11 β-HSD 1 and potentially, 5 α reductase. These studies have started to address the important issues of causation and treatment in IIH and provide avenues for future research into this complex condition.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The lateral tentorial sinus (LTS) has {{not been}} well de-scribed in the imaging literature. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{investigate}} the value of MR imaging in assessing the LTS, which may provide guidance for preoperative planning. METHODS: Fifty-five adult patients underwent MR imaging of the brain. Four neuroradi-ologists evaluated the studies for delineation of the LTS and its branches. Presence of arach-noid granulation and dominance of the venous drainage also were reported. RESULTS: An LTS was detected in 104 of 110 lobes. The LTS in each lobe was classified as type I (candelabra) in 30 (28. 8 %), type II (independent veins) in 22 (21. 1 %), and type III (venous lakes) in 37 (35. 5 %); in 15 (14. 4 %) of the lobes, the LTS was indeterminate. LTS branches were inconsistently detected, with the exception of the vein of Labbe ́ (VL). Five of eight branches were seen in approximately half of the cases. The VL was identified in 94 (85. 4 %) lobes. Among these, 53 (56. 4 %) were draining into the LTS and 22 (23. 4 %) into the transverse sinus; in 19 (20. 2 %) cases, the terminal portion was not visualized.

40|$|Transient {{receptor}} potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV 4) is a non-selective cation channel {{known to}} be a sensorfor hypo-osmolality, cell swelling, warm temperatures and some chemical compounds. Furthermore,the physiological significance of TRPV 4 has attracted a great deal of attention, particularly itsheat-sensitive properties. Previous reports showed the physiological functions of TRPV 4 in severalcell types, including skin, esophageal keratinocytes and hippocampal neurons. For instance, TRPV 4 expressed in skin keratinocytes contributes to the enhancement of the skin barrier function at bodytemperature. Moreover, the release of ATP from esophageal keratinocytes or bladder epithelium isenhanced by extension-mediated TRPV 4 activation. Additionally, neural activity increases with a risein temperature in hippocampal neurons. However, the precise function of TRPV 4 in the brain is stillunknown except for regulation of neural activity in the hippocampus. In this study, the highestexpression of TRPV 4 in choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs) was found using in situ hybridization,immunohistochemistry and EGFP expression in transgenic mice in which EGFP was expressed inTRPV 4 -positive cells. In addition, calcium-activated chloride currents were observed for the first timein CPECs. Moreover, expression of anoctamin 1 (Ano 1), Ano 4, Ano 6 and Ano 10 genes in the choroidplexus was found by RT-PCR. These data suggest that upon TRPV 4 activation, calcium enteringCPECs enhances production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a process dependent upon ion transports. To investigate this hypothesis, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in HEK 293 T cells were performed. ANO 1 -mediated chloride currents were dramatically increased in HEK 293 T cells expressing mouseTRPV 4 and mouse ANO 1 when TRPV 4 was activated by a low concentration of GSK 1016790 A(GSK). In contrast, the GSK-induced chloride currents were not significantly affected in the cellsexpressing ANO 4, ANO 6 or ANO 10 with TRPV 4. Additionally, the GSK-induced chloride currentsin the cells expressing ANO 1 and TRPV 4 were not observed in the absence of extracellular calcium. These results indicated that chloride efflux through ANO 1 depended on TRPV 4 activity. SimilarGSK-induced chloride currents were observed in CPECs isolated from the lateral and the fourthventricle choroid plexus. Interestingly, the GSK-induced chloride currents were strongly inhibited byan ANO 1 /ANO 2 blocker, T 16 Ainh-A 01 (A 01), and ANO 2 expression was not suggested in choroidplexus. These results indicated a functional linkage between TRPV 4 and ANO 1 in CPECs. This isthe first reported case of the linkage of these two proteins in native cells. It was recently reported thatANO 1 is activated by noxious heat. In the author’s study, ANO 1 was activated by heat in the range ofbody temperature. Heat-evoked chloride currents were also observed in CPECs isolated fromwild-type (WT) and TRPV 4 -deficient (TRPV 4 KO) mice. Furthermore, heat-evoked currents weredrastically enhanced after GSK application in WT, but not in TRPV 4 KO CPECs. These resultsindicated the possibility that heat-sensitivity of ANO 1 is enhanced by TRPV 4 activation in CPECs. However, the enhanced currents were not completely blocked by A 01. Thus, the possibility of anotherheat-activated chloride channels also was suggested in CPECs. Accordingly, the author proposes a concept that functional linkage between TRPV 4 and ANO 1 enhances CSF production. First, the apical membrane of CPECs is extended by water influx from thebasolateral side. Second, phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) activity is increased by the extension of the plasmamembrane and arachidonic acid is produced from phospholipids by the activated PLA 2. Then,arachidonic acid is metabolized to epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) by cytochrome P 450 epoxygenaseactivity, and TRPV 4 is activated by EET at body temperature. The TRPV 4 activation leads to calciuminflux, which in turn leads to ANO 1 activation at body temperature. Finally, water efflux from CPECsis driven by efflux of chloride and some cations through a Donnan equilibrium. Production, transportand reabsorption of CSF are important for the maintenance of the brain environment in fetuses andadults. Among the three CSF-related events, the principle role of CPECs is CSF production. CSFtransport is controlled by ependymal cells and the reabsorption is done by <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulation</b> to thedural venous sinuses. Dysfunction of ciliary motility and the failure of cilia development ofependymal cells induce severe hydrocephalus. This indicates that CSF is continuously secreted fromCPECs and the production is independent of the changes in brain pressure. There are currently onlypalliative therapies for hydrocephalus including external ventricular drainage or placement of a surgicalshunt. Control of CSF production through regulation of TRPV 4 activity could allow a safer way totreat those diseases. Thus, these studies suggest a fundamental new therapy for hydrocephalus causedby choroid plexus cysts and choroid plexus papillomas...|$|R
50|$|The {{superior}} sagittal sinus (also {{known as}} the superior longitudinal sinus), within the human head, is an unpaired area along the attached margin of the falx cerebri.

50|$|The {{importance}} of <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulations</b> for the drainage of CSF is controversial.

50|$|The <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulations</b> act as one-way valves.

50|$|For years, it {{was thought}} that the {{mammalian}} CNS did not contain a lymphatic system and thus relied upon alternative routes such as the glymphatic system, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage pathway under the cribriform plate and into the lymphatics of the nasal mucosa, and <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulations</b> to clear itself of excess protein, fluid, and metabolic waste products.

50|$|Communicating hydrocephalus, {{also known}} as non-obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by {{impaired}} cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption {{in the absence of}} any CSF-flow obstruction between the ventricles and subarachnoid space. It has been theorized that this is due to functional impairment of the arachnoidal granulations (also called <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulations</b> or Pacchioni's granulations), which are located along the superior sagittal sinus and is the site of cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption back into the venous system. Various neurologic conditions may result in communicating hydrocephalus, including subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage, meningitis and congenital absence of arachnoid villi. Scarring and fibrosis of the subarachnoid space following infectious, inflammatory, or hemorrhagic events can also prevent resorption of CSF, causing diffuse ventricular dilatation.|$|E
5000|$|Prognosis is {{also very}} poor when IVH results from {{intracerebral}} hemorrhage related to {{high blood pressure and}} is even worse when hydrocephalus follows. [...] It can result in dangerous increases in ICP and can cause potentially fatal brain herniation. Even independently, IVH can cause morbidity and mortality. First, intraventricular blood can lead to a clot in the CSF conduits blocking its flow and leading to obstructive hydrocephalus which may quickly result in increased intracranial pressure and death. Second, the breakdown products from the blood clot may generate an inflammatory response that damages the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulations,</b> inhibiting the regular reabsorption of CSF and resulting in permanent communicating hydrocephalus.|$|E

50|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{circulated}} {{through the}} ventricles, cisterns, and subarachnoid space within the brain and spinal cord. About 150 mL of CSF is always in circulation, constantly being recycled through the daily production of nearly 500 mL of fluid. The CSF is primarily secreted by the choroid plexus; however, {{about one-third of the}} CSF is secreted by pia mater and the other ventricular ependymal surfaces (the thin epithelial membrane lining the brain and central canal) and arachnoidal membranes. The CSF travels from the ventricles and cerebellum through three foramina in the brain, emptying into the cerebrum, and ending its cycle in the venous blood via structures like the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulations.</b> The pia spans every surface crevice of the brain other than the foramina to allow the circulation of CSF to continue.|$|E
50|$|Cerebrospinal {{fluid flow}} is {{important}} in diagnosing bobble-head doll syndrome because disturbances in CSF dynamics can be contributed to blockages in the connections between ventricles such as foramen and aqueducts. Such blockages are tell-tale signs that a cyst is present. Also, if CSF cannot flow freely, it will begin to accumulate leading to hydrocephalus. CSF is secreted by choroid plexuses located on the roofs of the ventricles. After travelling through each ventricle, the CSF leaves the fourth ventricle and flows around the brain stem, cerebellum, hemispheres, and finally, down into the subarachnoid space. To complete the cycle, the CSF then moves {{back up to the}} basal cisternae to start over. In patients with bobble-head doll syndrome, an impairment exists in the ability to reabsorb CSF by the <b>arachnoid</b> <b>granulations</b> leading to an accumulation. Presently, doctors will utilize magnetic resonance imaging to get an image of the afflicted area. If swelling exists in the third ventricle along with cystic lesions, both of which are accompanied by the characteristic head bobbing, a diagnosis of bobble-head doll syndrome is likely. From here, the doctor will propose the available treatment options listed below.|$|E
