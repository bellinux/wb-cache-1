40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we aim at}} better {{understanding}} how human mental representations are structured in the specific case of the perception of urban soundscapes. This task is traditionally studied using questionnaires, surveys or categorization tasks followed by a lexical analysis. In contrast, we propose a new experimental approach to tackle this aim. In this approach, the subject is asked to manipulate sound events and textures within a dedicated computer environment in order to recreate two complex urban soundscapes, one ideal and the other not ideal. Subjects {{have access to a}} sound data set which has been designed and structured based upon perceptual considerations, and may alter the physical parameters of the selected sound samples. In order to achieve this, we use an <b>audio-digital</b> environment and a web audio interface for sound mining developed {{for the purpose of this}} study. The latter allows subjects to explore a sound database without resorting to text. By focusing on the auditory modality during the experimental process, this new paradigm potentially allows the subject to be better put in context and provides a more detailed description of the actual mental representations. In the light of the results presented in this paper, it seems that it also reduces the potential bias of only using verbalization during the experiment...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSignal {{detection}} requires ratings reliability {{throughout a}} clinical trial. The confirmation of site-based rater scores by a second, independent and blinded rater {{is a reasonable}} metric of ratings reliability. We used <b>audio-digital</b> pens to record site-based interviews of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of a novel antidepressant in treatment resistant depressed patients. Blinded, site-independent raters generated “dual” scores that revealed high correlations between site-based and site-independent raters (r= 0. 940 for all ratings) and high sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and kappa coefficients for treatment response and non-response outcomes using the site-based rater scores as the standard. The blinded raters achieved an 89. 4 % overall accuracy and 0. 786 kappa for matching the treatment response or non-response outcomes of the site-based raters. A limitation of this method is that independent ratings depend {{on the quality of}} site-based interviews and patient responses to the site-based interviewers. Nonetheless, this quality assurance strategy may have broad applicability for studies that use subjective measures and wherever ratings reliability is a concern. “Dual” scoring of recorded site-based ratings can be a relatively unobtrusive surveillance strategy to confirm scores and to identify and remediate rater “outliers” during a study...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSignal {{detection}} {{in clinical}} trials relies on ratings reliability. We conducted a reliability analysis of site-independent rater scores derived from <b>audio-digital</b> recordings of site-based rater interviews of the structured Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) in a schizophrenia study. “Dual” ratings assessments were conducted {{as part of a}} quality assurance program in a 12 -week, double-blind, parallel-group study of PF- 02545920 compared to placebo in patients with sub-optimally controlled symptoms of schizophrenia (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier NCT 01939548). Blinded, site-independent raters scored the recorded site-based BPRS interviews that were administered in relatively stable patients during two visits prior to the randomization visit. We analyzed the impact of BPRS interview length on “dual” scoring variance and discordance between trained and certified site-based raters and the paired scores of the independent raters. Mean total BPRS scores for 392 interviews conducted at the screen and stabilization visits were 50. 4 ± 7. 2 (SD) for site-based raters and 49. 2 ± 7. 2 for site-independent raters (t= 2. 34; p= 0. 025). “Dual” rated total BPRS scores were highly correlated (r= 0. 812). Mean BPRS interview length was 21 : 05 ± 7 : 47 min ranging from 7 to 59 min. 89 interviews (23 %) were conducted in less than 15 min. These shorter interviews had significantly greater “dual” scoring variability (p= 0. 0016) and absolute discordance (p= 0. 0037) between site-based and site-independent raters than longer interviews. In-study ratings reliability cannot be guaranteed by pre-study rater certification. Our findings reveal marked variability of BPRS interview length and that shorter interviews are often incomplete yielding greater “dual” scoring discordance that may affect ratings precision...|$|E
