25|$|Upon introduction, the two steeple-cab {{locomotives}} {{proved the}} superiority of electric traction. They were able to operate together with multiple-unit train control, allowing a single crew to control both as an articulated locomotive with greater tractive effort than the Victorian Railways C class heavy goods locomotive, the most powerful locomotive on the VR at the time. Based on their success, suburban goods sidings were rapidly electrified and most suburban goods traffic utilised electric traction. With the electrification of the Gippsland line as far as Traralgon in the 1950s, {{the range of the}} E class locomotives was similarly extended <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> found shunting or hauling services along the line.|$|E
25|$|Homeless shelters, which {{generally}} are night shelters, make people {{leave in the}} morning to whatever they could manage and return in the evening when the beds in the shelters opened up again for sleeping. There are some daytime shelters where people could go, instead of being stranded on the streets, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> helped, get counseling, avail themselves of resources, meals, and otherwise spend their day until returning to their overnight sleeping arrangements. An example of such a day center shelter model is Saint Francis House in Boston, Massachusetts, founded in the early 1980s, which opens for homeless people all year long during the daytime hours and was originally based on the settlement house model.|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{was very}} much limited by the geography of the Mississippi Delta, the flood plain of the river occupying most of northwestern Mississippi. The land is quite low and is in fact lower in many places than the river. The region is characterized by numerous marshes, brakes, sloughs, bayous, lakes, creeks, and rivers that in the geologic past were parts of the river bed. Until {{the middle of the}} nineteenth century, overflow from the Mississippi continued to pass into these waters, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used as alternatives to the main river for water transportation. When railroads provided more convenient commerce, however, levees to contain the flow had been built, and the land was partially drained. Then, when the war came, the levee was breached for the Yazoo Pass expedition, and the land was again flooded. Minor waterways swelled to the size of small rivers, raising the possibility that Union gunboats could travel on them. Porter believed that he could send his gunboats and army transports up Steele's Bayou (present-day Steele Bayou) to Black Bayou, into Deer Creek, then Rolling Fork, and finally into the (Big) Sunflower River. The last met the Yazoo River a short distance upstream from the bluffs where a major Union attack had been repulsed in late 1862.|$|E

500|$|Myrmecia ants {{are easily}} noticeable, {{due to their}} large mandibles, and large {{compound}} eyes that provide excellent vision, and a powerful sting that they use to kill prey. Each of their eyes contains 3,000 facets, making them the second largest in the ant world. Size varies widely, ranging from [...] in length. The largest Myrmecia species is M. brevinoda, with workers measuring M. brevinoda workers are also {{the largest in the}} world. Almost all species are monomorphic, but M. brevinoda is the only known species where polymorphism exists. It is well known that two worker subcastes exist, but this does not distinguish them as two different polymorphic forms. This {{may be due to the}} lack of food during winter <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> incipient colonies. The division of labour is based on the size of ant, rather than its age, with the larger workers foraging for food or keeping guard outside the nest, while the smaller workers tend to the brood.|$|E
500|$|At the start, the Confederate Navy faced {{one of the}} {{problems}} that Mallory had encountered when he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Naval Affairs: an overabundance of high-ranking officers who were too old to go to sea. This came about because the Confederacy had created its navy by promising that men resigning from the U.S. Navy would enter the CS Navy at their old rank. Hoping to avoid the stagnation that was the result of the former promotion process, Mallory proposed that promotion should depend solely on [...] "gallant or meritorious conduct during the war." [...] His proposal was quickly made into law by the Confederate Congress. Still not completely satisfied, in 1863 Mallory initiated the creation of a Provisional Navy, which in effect established two officer corps. The officers whom Mallory or his advisers deemed incapable of combat were retained in the Regular Navy, while young and presumably more aggressive officers would transfer to the Provisional Navy. Officers for fighting ships would be drawn from the Provisional Navy, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> promoted without regard for seniority if they served with distinction.|$|E

500|$|Joy Division {{made their}} {{recorded}} debut in June 1978 when the band self-released An Ideal for Living, {{and two weeks}} later a track of theirs, [...] "At a Later Date", was featured on the compilation album [...] (which had been recorded live in October 1977). In the Melody Maker review of the EP, Chris Brazier said that it [...] "has the familiar rough-hewn nature of home-produced records, but they're no mere drone-vendors—there {{are a lot of}} good ideas here, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a very interesting band by now, seven months on". The packaging of An Ideal for Living—which featured a drawing of a Hitler Youth member on the cover—coupled with the nature of the band's name, fuelled speculation about their political affiliations. While Hook and Sumner later admitted to being intrigued by fascism at the time, Morris insisted that the group's obsession with Nazi imagery came from a desire to keep memories of the sacrifices of their parents and grandparents during World War II alive. He argued that accusations of neo-Nazi sympathies merely provoked the band [...] "to keep on doing it, because that's the kind of people we are".|$|E

Bennett kept his anti-tank and assault pioneer platoons inside the FSB to protect the battalion command post, while the mortar platoon would be particularly exposed, being located adjacent to the 102nd Field Battery gun position in an open area on {{the outer edge of the}} base facing to the north and east. The rifle companies to the north-east provided the only protection, yet there were large gaps between these positions <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> easily bypassed.

2500|$|The Reformation {{messages}} were very controversial and were frequently banned {{in a number}} of Catholic cities.

Pamphlets took little time to produce <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> printed and sold quickly making them harder to track down by the authorities and thus making them a very effective method of propaganda.
