As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E

25|$|I'm just shocked. It's unbelievable. I {{feel like}} my dream has come true, the dream I've been dreaming since a little girl has come true. There were points I thought, 'You know what, I don't {{know if this is}} going to happen'. But with the help from my friends and my family, they all kept telling me to believe in myself and keep on doing it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> and now I'm here and thank you so much to them.|$|E

25|$|It {{became a}} burden. Some {{people say it}} helped me invent {{the kind of music}} I play, but I don’t know whether it did. It’s just {{something}} I’ve had to learn to live with. It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I could do it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang did not, however, restart {{her film}} career or launch a career {{for her in}} episodic {{television}} despite several guest-starring roles in , Marcus Welby, M.D., Branigan and The Men From Shiloh. Even the pilot Prudence and the Chief, which was a spoof on The King <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>did</b> not get picked up as a TV series. In addition, musicals were now failing {{at the box office}} and that avenue was closed to her. As a result, she returned almost exclusively to the musical stage, appearing in only a few more films and TV productions.|$|E
500|$|A {{powerful}} ballad; [...] Stephen Schwartz is a genius. You {{have to be}} a {{child of}} God to understand the depth of this song. Mariah <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it as we felt it. We both felt very connected to the song because of our background. What can I say? (It is) Just a beautiful song. What a lyric! I can't talk about it—just listen to it.|$|E

500|$|... "That record {{saved my}} life. I {{was in such}} a dark space in New York. I was so depressed, always in a bar. I got on a plane to LA to do my music and was given one shot to write the song that would change my life <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I never went back. I left behind my boyfriend, my apartment. I still haven't been back. My mother went in and cleared it for me." ...|$|E
500|$|I love New York. But if I'm there, I {{want to go}} out, friends come to the studio, {{the phone}} rings constantly. But in Capri, I am in a remote place, {{and there is no}} one I can run into. I felt that in Capri I would be able to {{effectively}} finish the album on a shorter schedule. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I made it in three months, I was like 'Get me off this label!' I couldn't take it. The situation there [...] was becoming increasingly difficult.|$|E
500|$|Also in 1908, Jack London {{broke his}} silence on his {{condemnation}} during the controversy by publishing {{an essay in}} Collier's Weekly entitled [...] "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President [...] "homocentric" [...] and [...] "amateur". He further wrote: [...] "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which {{it seemed to me}} several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the snake}} {{handling}} {{scene at the}} Church of God with Signs and Wonders, the song being sung by the congregation is called [...] "May Glory Protect Us". The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin, who was heavily involved in the episode's music production. Rabwin later noted, [...] "I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [...] I told him I could write one that was better {{and he told me}} to go for it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> [...] Kim loved it. [...] It was a great tribute {{that he was able to}} ask me and accept my opinion on it." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1971 {{letter to}} Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, [...] "When {{people ask me}} {{questions}} about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I have only one answer, 'What does he do now?' I noticed you had no answer for that! It's not a putdown, it's the truth." [...] Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music. Commenting specifically on [...] "Revolution 9", Lennon said with ironic authority, [...] "For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask {{any of the other}} people involved. The final editing Yoko <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> alone." ...|$|E
500|$|The arrest {{occurred}} {{about two}} weeks before the release of Grant's first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week. In the much-watched interview, Grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, [...] "What the hell were you thinking?" [...] Grant answered, [...] "I think you know in life what's {{a good thing to do}} and what's a bad thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a bad thing. And there you have it." ...|$|E

500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E
500|$|In October 2008, Horsfield was {{diagnosed}} with testicular cancer, and advised that his playing career was over. As the disease was discovered in its early stages, no chemotherapy or radiotherapy was needed, surgery proved successful and {{less than two months}} later he was given the all-clear. Horsfield decided to make his illness public to help spread awareness of the disease, and lent his support to a Premier League-backed project launched in 2009 to promote men's health issues. He said: [...] "Getting cancer was something I had to get over. I got it, wanted to beat it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Now I am just glad that I've got another chance in football." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} published in December 2003, Kevin Moore {{revealed that he}} had started work on a third Chroma Key album, but had put it aside {{to work on the}} first OSI album, Office of Strategic Influence. When Moore stopped working on Chroma Key material, he had already recorded two songs. [...] "The big difference with the new [...] is that there are more real instruments," [...] Moore said. [...] "I've hooked up with a bunch of friends that made hand drums and didgeridoos. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a lot of recording with that. This new Chroma Key {{is going to be more}} organic, and less digital." ...|$|E

500|$|Of course, I haven't any {{voice to}} speak of, but I {{have a great}} register, and Sullivan used to amuse himself by making me sing bass in one number of an opera and tenor in another. [...] In 'Ruddygore', Sir Arthur had engaged a man to play the servant, my menial, so to speak, who had an {{enormous}} bass voice, and who had {{to go down to}} the lower E flat. [...] Singularly enough, he could go down to G, and then he dropped out entirely, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the [...] below. [...] Generally the audience roared with laughter, and it absolutely brought down the house.|$|E
500|$|..... Like with 'Everytime' I {{wrote the}} whole thing from scratch on the piano. Musically there was no track or anything. I was just at my house <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{the whole thing}} by myself. And then I went and I played it for [...] and I just {{basically}} told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing. And so that song specifically, you know, I did everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Perry's {{decision}} to write [...] "E.T." [...] came after its beat was accidentally played during a recording session {{she had with}} Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Ammo. It was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. However, after hearing it, Perry chose {{to work with the}} track. She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it and I always knew I wanted to write this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it up and I was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this. I know this seems like a long shot, but I think I have the perfect material to put on top of this sound.' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and it really worked out perfectly." ...|$|E
