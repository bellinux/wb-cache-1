5|$|Many traditions have {{stressed}} the grief of mothers over deprivation {{of their children}} but little has been said historically <b>about</b> <b>young</b> children's loss of their mothers; {{this may have been}} because loss of the mother in infancy frequently meant death for a breast-fed infant. In the 19th century, French society bureaucratised a system in which infants were breast-fed at the homes of foster mothers, returning to the biological family after weaning, and no concern was evinced at the possible effect of this double separation on the child.|$|E

40|$|Discourse on 'problematic behavior' of {{the young}} in {{adolescence}} period is often present in lay, media, professional and scientific public. In this research, we performed empirical testing of the psychological concept of 'storm and stress', which is manifested by stereotypes about adolescents as rebels. The goal was to establish whether teachers hold stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>younger</b> adolescents as a social group and what {{the content of the}} stereotype is. Research participants were 193 teachers teaching the seventh grade in ten Belgrade primary schools. Factor analysis method established the presence of several factors, which reflect the psychological content and meaning of teachers' stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>younger</b> adolescents. The results of our research point out: (a) that stereotypes of teachers <b>about</b> <b>younger</b> adolescents stand in partial correspondence with the content of a widely distributed concept of 'storm and stress'; (b) that this concept is mostly loaded with a negative perception of pupils on the part of teachers and (c) that teachers less often perceive pupils through the prism of some positive qualities. That is, teachers think that these positive qualities are not 'typical' qualities of adolescents if they are observed as a group. Interviewed teachers hold stereotypes <b>about</b> <b>younger</b> adolescents, but intensity and valence of stereotypes vary depending on the nature of obtained factors...|$|R

25|$|Besides {{the nine}} or ten volumes of lyrical verse {{mentioned}} above, Winther published Hjortens Flugt ("The Stag's Flight"), an epical romance in verse (1855). Taking place in 15th Century South Zealand, written in Nibelungenlied stanzas and probably inspired by Byron’s Mazeppa it tells <b>about</b> <b>young</b> love, demonic forces and witchcraft with a running stag as the reappearing motive of the untamed forces of Nature. However, in the lyric intervals it is also praising the idylls and freedom of Nature. In generations it became a traditional confirmation present for Danish youths in that respect competing with Paludan-Müller’s Adam Homo.|$|E

Although Hogfields is only 4-year school, the series is divided into 7 parts according to original HP series.

25|$|Over {{the course}} of World War II, {{especially}} during the full-fledged war between Japan and the US that began after in 1941, Edogawa was active in his local patriotic, neighborhood organization, and he wrote a number of stories <b>about</b> <b>young</b> detectives and sleuths that {{might be seen as}} in line with the war effort, but he wrote most of these under different pseudonyms as if to disassociate them with his legacy. In February 1945, his family was evacuated from their home in Ikebukuro, Tokyo to Fukushima in northern Japan. Edogawa remained until June, when he was suffering from malnutrition. Much of Ikebukuro was destroyed in Allied air raids and the subsequent fires that broke out in the city, but miraculously, the thick, earthen-walled warehouse which he used as his studio was spared, and still stands to this day beside the campus of Rikkyo University.|$|E

The lyrics, [...] "I've {{been in love with}} you baby / Ever since you were in Sunday school" [...] lead Clinton Heylin to believe it was written about memories from Morrison's childhood when he attended Sunday school in Belfast; Planet is a California-raised Texan.|$|E
