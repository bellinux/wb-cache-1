5000|$|Chabons first novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, {{was written}} as his UC Irvine masters thesis. Without telling Chabon, his professor, Donald Heiney (better known by his pen name, MacDonald Harris), {{sent it to}} a {{literary}} agent, who got the author an impressive $155,000 advance on the novel (most first-time novelists receive advances ranging from $5,000 to $7,500.) The Mysteries of Pittsburgh appeared in 1988 and became a bestseller, instantly catapulting Chabon {{to the status of}} literary celebrity. Among Chabons major literary influences in this period were Donald Barthelme, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel García Márquez, Raymond Chandler, John Updike, Philip Roth and F. Scott Fitzgerald. As Chabon remarked in 2010, [...] "I just copied the writers whose voices I was responding to, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> probably the best way to learn." ...|$|E

5000|$|Blasted is {{the first}} play by the British author Sarah Kane. It was first {{performed}} in 1995 at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs in London. This performance was highly controversial and the play was fiercely attacked by most newspaper critics, many of whom regarded it as a rather immature attempt to shock the audience. However, critics have subsequently reassessed it; for example The Guardians Michael Billington, who savaged the play in his first review, later recanted {{in the wake of}} Kanes suicide: [...] "I got it wrong, as I keep saying. She was a major talent. Apparently, Harold Pinter said at her memorial service that she was a poet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> dead right." [...] After seeing a revival of the play, an Evening Standard reviewer Annie Ferguson wrote [...] "How shrill and silly the 1995 hullabaloo and hysteria seemed last night when Blasted returned to the Royal Court. It is, and always was, a play with a fine, moral purpose." ...|$|E
5000|$|Asked {{how does}} he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think its timely and {{timeless}} at the same time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> {{one of the most}} difficult things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically its heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the albums 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the bands thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E
5000|$|When {{he creates}} new scripts, Davies {{considers}} the dénouement {{of a story}} to {{be representative of the}} work. He often formulates both the scene and its emotional impact early in the process, but writes the scenes last due to his belief that [...] "scenes cant exist if they arent informed by where theyve come from". Davies is a strong advocate for the continued use of the cliffhanger ending and opposes advertising that sacrifices the impact of storytelling. In pursuit of his quest, he instructs editors to remove scenes from press copies of episodes he writes; cliffhangers were removed from the review copies of the Doctor Who episodes [...] "Army of Ghosts", [...] "The Stolen Earth", and the first part of The End of Time, and Rose Tylers unadvertised appearance in [...] "Partners in Crime" [...] was excised. His most noted cliffhanger was in the script of [...] "The Stolen Earth", which created a public sense of [...] "Doctor Who fever" [...] in the week preceding its conclusion. In an interview with BBC News shortly after the episodes transmission, he argued that the success of a popular television series is linked to how well producers can keep secrets and create a [...] "live experience": Its exciting when you get kids in playground talking about your story, about whos going to live or die, then I consider that a job well done, because thats interactive television, thats what its all about: its debate and fun and chat. Its playing a game with the country <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> wonderful. Russell T Davies, [...] "Struggle to keep Who secret", BBC News Online ...|$|E
5000|$|Farrell, {{who is a}} Christian, {{believes}} that marriage is {{between a man and}} a woman but has said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have the right or anybody has a right to tell somebody who they can or can't love. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this is a civil rights issue. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the right thing to do is let the voters decide." ...|$|R
2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's <b>I</b> <b>think</b> being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham.

5000|$|In July 1981, {{the band}} {{began work on}} the album at EMI Pathé-Marconi Studios in Paris with {{producer}} Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange but were unsatisfied with the sound, eventually opting to record the basic tracks in an old warehouse {{on the outskirts of}} Paris with the Mobile One studio, with vocals later recorded at Family Sound Studio and overdubs done at HIS Studios. In September the album was finished. In November 1992, guitarist Malcolm Young recalled to Mark Blake of Metal CD, [...] "I dont think anyone, neither the band or the producer, could tell whether it sounded right or wrong. Everyone was fed up with the whole album." [...] In 2006, engineer Tony Platt stated in AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, [...] "I think there was a general feeling that Back in Black was the pinnacle of how produced AC/DC should ever be. For Those About to Rock was a bit overproduced {{in terms of what the}} band were about." [...] The LP offers up the groups usual litany of sexually-infused metaphors on songs like [...] "Lets Get It Up," [...] and [...] "Inject the Venom," [...] but the LP is perhaps best remembered for its title track, which has gone on to become the bands perennial show closer accompanied by the firing of stage prop cannons. The song and the name of the album were inspired by a book Angus Young read, entitled For Those About to Die, We Salute You, about Roman gladiators. The gladiators final words to the emperor were [...] "Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant" [...] - or, [...] "Hail Emperor, those who are about to die salute you". Angus Young explained to Kerrang magazine (reprinted in Mark Putterfords AC/DC bio Shock to the System), [...] "We had this chorus riff, and we thought, Well, this sounds rather deadly. We were trying to find a good title...and theres this book from years ago about Roman gladiators called For Those About to Die We Salute You. So we thought, for those about to rock. Its a very inspiring song. It makes you feel a bit powerful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> what rock n roll is all about." ...|$|E
