5|$|Early {{encryption}} {{techniques such}} as the Hill cipher also used matrices. However, due to the linear nature of matrices, these codes are comparatively easy to break. Computer graphics uses matrices both to represent objects and to calculate transformations of objects using affine rotation matrices to accomplish tasks such as projecting <b>a</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> object onto a two-dimensional screen, corresponding to a theoretical camera observation. Matrices over a polynomial ring are important {{in the study of}} control theory.|$|E

5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) game {{in which}} the player guides a civilization through five historical periods, from the Middle Ages to World War II. As in many RTS titles, the player collects natural resources, erects buildings, and trains and maintains a military. Players use a mouse cursor interface (or hotkeys) to direct their units, which range from crossbowmen to King Tiger tanks. <b>A</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> (3D) camera system allows the player to view the action from any perspective, including isometric and first-person angles. A mini-map is included as well.|$|E
5|$|Fez (stylized as FEZ) is an indie puzzle-platform {{video game}} {{developed}} by Polytron Corporation {{and published by}} Trapdoor. The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world {{to be one of}} four sides of <b>a</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments to restore order to the universe.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited is <b>a</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> (3D) flight {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world airplanes. Players may control the Bellanca Decathlon, Extra 300S, Pitts Special S-2B, Sukhoi Su-31 and Grob G103a Twin II sailplane. The game {{begins at the}} fixed-base operator (FBO) interface—a traversable 3D room whose contents represent menu options. For example, the player interacts with a row of scale airplane models to select an aircraft, and with a world globe to change airfield locations. Six settings are available, including Sedona, Arizona and Springfield, Vermont.|$|E

The player competes against the computer's team in turn-based play, although unlike Final Fantasy Tactics characters execute their actions instantly.|$|E
5|$|Major League Baseball was {{developed}} by Atlus and published by LJN. It featured many facets of realistic gameplay and a focus on managerial details, which {{stressed the importance of}} choosing a well-balanced team.

5|$|Many {{bacteria}} (such as E. coli) {{have two}} distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling {{allows them to}} reorient and makes their movement <b>a</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> random walk. (See external links below for link to videos.) The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as it moves.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd used {{innovative}} {{sound effects}} and {{state of the}} art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut. Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate <b>a</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> effect. The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.|$|E
5|$|Sonic and the Secret Rings is <b>a</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> {{platform}} and action game featuring an on-rails style of movement. Sonic the Hedgehog, the series' main character, is the game's only player character. He is controlled exclusively with the Wii Remote, which is held horizontally like a traditional gamepad. Players adjust his forward movement by tilting the controller. He runs along a predesignated path; players jump and brake using corresponding face buttons. Thrusting the Wii Remote forwards allows Sonic {{to perform a}} homing attack, a mid-air move that targets and damages enemies in his path.|$|E

To create <b>a</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> representation of such observations, Astronomer Geng Shouchang (耿壽昌) provided his armillary sphere with an equatorial ring in 52 BCE.

5|$|The Pythagorean tiling may be {{generalized}} to <b>a</b> <b>three-dimensional</b> tiling of Euclidean space by cubes of two different sizes, which also is unilateral and equitransitive.
