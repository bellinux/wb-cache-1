500|$|Addressing his approach, Weisman {{said that}} {{eliminating}} {{the human element}} eliminated the [...] "fear factor" [...] that people <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> wrong or that they will die; {{it is meant to}} be read as a fantasy, according to the author. Josie Appleton of Spiked related the book to [...] "today's romanticisation of nature" [...] in that it linked [...] "the decadence and detachment of a modern consumerist society" [...] with an ignorance of the efforts required to produce products so easily disposed. Appleton also felt the book countered the [...] "Nature knows best" [...] notion by highlighting the randomness of natural forces.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Pride and Prejudice was overwhelmingly positive. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent recommended the opening {{episode of the}} serial one day before the British premiere, saying the television adaptation is [...] "probably {{as good as it}} [...] The casting in particular deserves a tilt at a BAFTA, Firth not being in the slightest bit soft and fluffy [...] and Jennifer Ehle showing the right brand of spirited intelligence as Elizabeth." [...] He considered Benjamin Whitrow a [...] "real scene-stealer with his Mr. Bennet", but was undecided about Alison Steadman's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet. Reviewing the first episode for the same newspaper on the day after transmission, Jim White praised Andrew Davies for [...] "injecting into the proceedings a pace and energy which at last provides a visual setting to do justice to the wit of the book. With everyone slinging themselves about at high speed (the dances, in a first for the genre, actually involve a bit of sweat), it looks like people <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> you would never have suspected they did in Austen's time: having fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Japan, the Mayor of Nagano Shoichi Washizawa {{said that}} it has become a [...] "great nuisance" [...] for the city to host the torch relay prior to the Nagano leg. Washizawa's aides said the mayor's remark was not {{criticism}} about the relay itself but about the potential disruptions and confusion surrounding it.　A city employee of the Nagano City Office ridiculed the protests in Europe, saying [...] "they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> foolish" [...] in a televised interview. The City Office officially apologized later and explained what he had wanted to say was [...] "such violent protests were not easy to accept". Also citing concerns about protests as well as the recent violence in Tibet, a major Buddhist temple in Nagano cancelled its plans to host the opening stage of the Olympic torch relay. This temple was vandalised by an unidentified person the day after in apparent revenge.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Lamm {{told his}} {{listeners}} {{that they should}} value and encourage the efforts of non-Orthodox leaders to more seriously integrate traditional Jewish practices {{into the lives of}} their followers. They should welcome the creation of Reform and Conservative day schools and not see them as a threat to their own. In many communities, Orthodox day schools, or Orthodox-oriented community day schools, have large numbers of students from non-Orthodox families. The liberal movements should be appreciated and encouraged because they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> Jewish, even if it is not the way that Orthodox Jews would like them to, he said. [...] "What they are doing is something, and something is better than nothing," [...] he said in his speech. [...] "I'm very openly attacking the notion that we sometimes find in the Orthodox community that 'being a goy is better'" [...] than being a non-Orthodox Jew, he said in an interview.|$|E
2500|$|Yuan Shao died in 202, {{after which}} his sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang started {{fighting}} over their father's territories. During the Battle of Liyang of 202–203 against the Yuan brothers, Cao Cao put Li Dian and Cheng Yu {{in charge of}} escorting food supplies to the frontline by crossing the Yellow River. Yuan Shang sent his subordinate Gao Fan (高蕃) to station near the river bank to block Cao Cao's supply route. Cao Cao had instructed Li Dian and Cheng Yu to send the supplies by land if they could not cross the river. However, Li Dian gathered his men and told them, [...] "Gao Fan's troops are lightly armoured and they block the water route. This shows that they are lax, {{so they can be}} overcome easily. The military does not act against orders, but they can make their own decisions if they feel they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> beneficial to the country. Let's take them out quickly." [...] Cheng Yu agreed with Li Dian, so they led their forces across the river to attack Gao Fan and defeated the enemy, thus securing the supply route across the river.|$|E

How do you put that together in your head? I mean, you are in a very elite group." [...] Rhyner simply replied with [...] "Any other combat controller put in the same situation would have performed in the same, exact way ... Credit that to the training we receive and the process that we go through to become a combat controller." [...] Future Air Force Cross recipient, and fellow Combat Controller, Robert Gutierrez was also present at the Battle of Shok Valley with Rhyner, albeit with a different Special Forces team, and regarding Rhyner's actions he said reportedly, [...] "If it wasn't for Zach, I wouldn't be here." ...|$|E
