Learned opinions deem the formulations variously competitive (Fisher vs Neyman), incompatible or complementary.

25|$|Icelanders <b>are</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> their Viking {{heritage}} and Icelandic language and take great care {{to preserve their}} traditions. Modern Icelandic remains close to the Old Norse spoken in the Viking Age. For example, the word for computer (an introduced object) is tölva which combines the ancient terms for number and seer. Until the Christianisation of Iceland, many traditional Viking beliefs were strongly held, remnants of which remain today. According to a 2005 New York Times article, the majority of Icelanders either believe in elves or are unwilling to rule out their existence. There {{are a number of}} accounts of roads that have been re-routed and building plans redesigned or abandoned to avoid disturbing rocks where elves are said to live.|$|E
25|$|Distanced from Portugal {{after the}} seventeenth century Goans, like the people of Macão and Timor, Goans had been left much to their own affairs with {{a higher degree of}} independence, {{although}} still a part of Portugal. Goans moved considerably {{to other parts of the}} Portuguese Empire, and metropolitan Portugal and it is possible to find Goans with roots in America, Africa, Europe as well as Asia. After 450 years of being a part of Portugal, during the first post-Liberation years, Goans found it difficult to embrace their new status as part of India and many emigrated to other nations (predominately western), a trend that often continues to date. However, Goan-Catholics in India today <b>are</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> their Portuguese-Indian Catholic culture, their Konkani language and their role in modern multi-religious India. However many aspects of their social and religious life are deeply enshrined in their exquisite western heritage. For instance they celebrate Carnival (western practice) before lent and their religious scripture (Catholic church) is only written and conducted in the Latin script. Even their language takes a lot from Portuguese in terms of syntax or loan words.|$|E
