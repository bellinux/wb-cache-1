5|$|Giant otter muzzles <b>are</b> <b>short</b> and sloping {{and give}} the head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to track changes in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs <b>are</b> <b>short</b> and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaur arms <b>are</b> <b>short</b> when {{compared}} to other known predators. Horner argues that the arms were too short to make the necessary gripping force to hold on to prey.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{navigate}} using a time-compensated sun compass. They can see {{polarized light}} and therefore orient even in cloudy conditions. The polarized light near the ultraviolet spectrum {{appears to be}} particularly important. Many migratory butterflies live in semi-arid areas where breeding seasons <b>are</b> <b>short.</b> The life histories of their host plants also influence butterfly behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Leaf {{morphology}} is {{also very}} diverse in this large genus. Some leaves are very thin, almost needle-like (S. affine), while others <b>are</b> <b>short,</b> stubby, and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme). Another group of species, such as S. scandens (climbing triggerplant) form scrambling, tangled mats typically propped up on aerial roots.|$|E

5|$|The Independent newspaper's {{review of}} the audio books stated that the {{chapters}} <b>are</b> <b>short</b> enough to keep children of seven-plus interested but, as there are ghosts, rats, soldiers and dragon boats to help Septimus and the young Princess fight the evil necromancer DomDaniel, there is {{enough to keep the}} whole family amused.|$|E
5|$|The {{river otter}} is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears <b>are</b> <b>short,</b> the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs <b>are</b> <b>short</b> and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined profile in water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E
50|$|When a form {{stands alone}} as a present-day word, {{it is usually}} a {{telescopic}} abbreviation: bio biography, chemo chemotherapy, hydro hydroelectricity, metro metropolitan. Some telescoped forms can <b>be</b> <b>shorter</b> than the original classical compounds: gynie <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than gyneco- and stands for both gynecology and gynecologist; anthro <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than anthropo- and stands for anthropology.|$|R
5000|$|The {{anterior}} {{sections of}} the radular tooth <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than the posterior section, and the blade <b>is</b> <b>short.</b> The waist and corresponding waist fold are obvious. A basal spur is present, and the barb <b>is</b> <b>short.</b> A shaft fold is present. (Similar to Dalliconus, however the species of Fusiconus {{do not have a}} posterior blade.) ...|$|R

5|$|With a {{head and}} body length of , Eliurus petteri is a {{moderately}} large species of Eliurus. Its upperparts are gray-brown to gray and contrast {{sharply with the}} white underparts. The tail tuft, a characteristic feature of Eliurus, is weakly developed. The skull is delicate and the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) <b>are</b> <b>short</b> and narrow. The incisors are weak.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} they <b>are</b> <b>short</b> of money, a {{group of}} four robbers decide to execute a bank heist. The four create a plan and hire an unwitting chauffeur to drive them to their location. As soon as they reach an isolated road, the robbers force the chauffeur out of the car, gag him, and throw him into a ditch. The robbers then drive {{the car to the}} bank. After entering, they kill a security guard and use explosives to force the bank vault open. The thieves steal as much money as possible and make a quick retreat to their car. Back in the park, a young couple on a walk discover the unconscious body of the chauffeur, and the man calls the police.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale used Mitică as a stock {{character}} to feature in satirical contexts; the biographical insights he provided <b>are</b> <b>short</b> and often contradict each other. Among Mitică's traits are his tendency to generate sarcastic comebacks and sententious catchphrases, a Francized speech, {{as well as}} inclinations to waste time and easily find {{his way out of}} problematic situations. His existence is connected to events in the history of Bucharest which he occasionally references in his jokes. Like Lache and Mache, who are present in Caragiale's fiction, the character is usually portrayed as a civil servant who has a hard time making ends meet, but who is well liked by his peers.|$|E
30|$|The {{amplitude}} of the PI is larger when the rise time <b>is</b> <b>shorter.</b> This <b>is</b> {{consistent with the}} relationship between the rise time and {{amplitude of}} the DL, and the rise time of the PI <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than that of the DL because the effective length of the PI, i.e., the dynamo region, <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than that of the DL. Also, the rise time of the PI <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> at an enhanced speed than at an enhanced density. It is therefore suggested that a high-speed solar wind is needed to create a rapid magnetic variation.|$|R
50|$|The Tweeling Sisters (11) - Zeni and Nadi Tweeling are {{a pair of}} {{conjoined}} twin sisters with opposing personalities. Zeni <b>is</b> <b>short</b> for Zenith and Nadi <b>is</b> <b>short</b> for Nadir.|$|R

5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns <b>are</b> <b>short,</b> fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E
5|$|Hassium is {{not known}} to occur {{naturally}} on Earth; the half-lives of all its known isotopes <b>are</b> <b>short</b> enough that no primordial hassium would have survived to the present day. This does {{not rule out the}} possibility of unknown longer-lived isotopes or nuclear isomers existing, some of which could still exist in trace quantities today if they are long-lived enough. In the early 1960s, it was predicted that long-lived deformed isomers of hassium might occur naturally on Earth in trace quantities. This was theorized in order to explain the extreme radiation damage in some minerals that could not have been caused by any known natural radioisotopes, but could have been caused by superheavy elements.|$|E
5|$|In Hungary, mating {{takes place}} in the last week of April, while in the north it happens later in the second week of May. Matings have also been {{observed}} in June and even early October, but it is not known if the autumn matings result in any young. Females often breed once every two years, or even once every three years if the seasons <b>are</b> <b>short</b> and the climate is severe.|$|E
50|$|The {{anterior}} {{section of}} the radula is much longer than the posterior section. The blade <b>is</b> <b>short,</b> a basal spur is absent, and the barb <b>is</b> <b>short.</b> The radular tooth has no serrations. An accessory process is present and <b>is</b> a <b>short,</b> simple triangular terminating cusp.|$|R

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) {{is large}} and robust. The nasal bones <b>are</b> <b>short,</b> not {{extending}} further back than the lacrimals, and the premaxillaries extend about {{as far back as}} the nasals. The zygomatic plate is narrow and lacks a zygomatic notch, an extension of the plate at the front. The plate's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The narrowest part of the interorbital region, located between the eyes, is to the front and its margins exhibit strong beading. Various crests develop on the long braincase, especially in old animals. The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and, unlike in some other rice rats, also extend to the sides of the braincase.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal bones <b>are</b> <b>short,</b> {{with their}} back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between the frontal and the squamosal is continuous with that between the frontal and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E
5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins <b>are</b> <b>short,</b> broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip, and is positioned just behind the pectoral fin bases. The second dorsal fin is large and tall without a notably elongated free rear tip, and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E

50|$|The humerus and ulna <b>are</b> <b>shorter</b> {{than those}} of L. dubius and L. crumeniferus. The tibiotarsus <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than that of L. falconeri, but slighter longer than those usually found in L. dubius and L. crumeniferus.|$|R
25|$|Equity in a {{portfolio}} can be hedged by taking an opposite position in futures. To protect your stock picking against systematic market risk, futures <b>are</b> <b>shorted</b> when equity <b>is</b> purchased, or long futures when stock <b>is</b> <b>shorted.</b>|$|R
