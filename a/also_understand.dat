25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{addition}} of new vocabulary, written Icelandic has not changed substantially since the 11th century, when the first texts were written on vellum. Modern speakers can understand the original sagas and Eddas which were written about eight hundred years ago.

With some effort, many Icelanders can <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> the original manuscripts.|$|E

25|$|By 3–5 years, {{children}} {{usually have}} difficulty using words correctly. Children experience many {{problems such as}} underextensions, taking a general word and applying it specifically (for example, 'cartoons' specifically for 'Mickey Mouse') and overextensions, taking a specific word and applying it too generally (example, 'ant' for any insect). However, children coin words to fill in for words not yet learned (for example, someone is a cooker rather than a chef because a child may not know what a chef is). Children can <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> metaphors.|$|E

25|$|Here, {{one should}} <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> that an evil {{suggestion}} {{is the starting}} point of evil act. When it affects a careless or heedless person, it creates in him a desire for evil. Then, further whisperings change the evil desire into an evil intention and evil purpose. When the evil suggestion grows in intensity, the intention becomes a resolution, which then culminates in the evil act. Therefore, the meaning of seeking God's refuge from the evil of the whisperer is that God should nip the evil in the bud.|$|E

25|$|According to , {{the member}} {{of the royal family}} with the most {{responsibility}} in this affair is Henry, Duke of Anjou, the king's ambitious younger brother. Following the failed assassination attack against the Admiral de Coligny (which Wanegffelen attributes to the Guise family and Spain), the Italian advisers of Catherine de Medici undoubtedly recommended in the royal Council the execution of about fifty Protestant leaders. These Italians stood to benefit from the occasion by eliminating the Huguenot danger. Despite the firm opposition of the Queen Mother and the King, Anjou, Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, present at this meeting of the Council, could see a good occasion {{to make a name for}} himself with the government. He contacted the Parisian authorities and another ambitious young man, running out of authority and power, Duke Henri de Guise (whose uncle, the clear-sighted Charles, cardinal of Lorraine, was then detained in Rome). The Parisian St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre resulted from this conjunction of interests, and this offers a much better explanation as to why the men of the Duke of Anjou acted in the name of the Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, consistent with the thinking of the time, rather than in the name of the King. One can <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> why, the day after the start of the massacre, Catherine de Medici, through royal declaration of Charles IX, condemned the crimes, and threatened the Guise family with royal justice. But when Charles IX and his mother learned of the involvement of the duke of Anjou, and being so dependent on his support, they issued a second royal declaration, which while asking for an end to the massacres, credited the initiative with the desire of Charles IX to prevent a Protestant plot. Initially the coup d'état of the duke of Anjou was a success, but Catherine de Medici went out of her way to deprive him from any power in France: she sent him with the royal army to remain in front of La Rochelle and then had him elected King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E

500|$|Churches of Christ have {{historically}} {{had the most}} conservative position on baptism among the various branches of the Restoration Movement, understanding baptism by immersion to be {{a necessary part of}} conversion. [...] The most significant disagreements concerned {{the extent to which a}} correct understanding of the role of baptism is necessary for its validity. [...] David Lipscomb consistently argued that if a believer was baptized out of a desire to obey God, the baptism was valid, even if the individual did not fully understand the role baptism plays in salvation. [...] Austin McGary argued strongly that to be valid, the convert must <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> that baptism is for the forgiveness of sins. [...] McGary's view became the prevailing one in the early 20th century, but the approach advocated by Lipscomb never totally disappeared. [...] More recently, the rise of the International Churches of Christ, who [...] "reimmersed some who came into their fellowship, even those previously immersed 'for remission of sins' in a Church of Christ," [...] has caused some to reexamine the question of rebaptism.|$|E
500|$|PedroII was {{hard-working}} and {{his routine}} was demanding. He usually {{woke up at}} 07:00 and did not sleep before 02:00 in the morning. His entire day was devoted to the affairs of state and the meager free time available was spent reading and studying. The Emperor went about his daily routine dressed in a simple black tail coat, trousers, and cravat. For special occasions he would wear court dress, and he only appeared in full regalia with crown, mantle and scepter twice each year at the opening and closing of the General Assembly. PedroII held politicians and government officials to the strict standards which he exemplified. The Emperor adopted a strict policy for the selection of civil servants based on morality and merit. To set the standard, he lived simply, once having said: [...] "I <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> that useless expenditure {{is the same as}} stealing from the Nation." [...] Balls and assemblies of the Court ceased after 1852. He also refused to request or allow the amount of his civil list of Rs 800:000$000 per year (U.S. $405,000 or £90,000 in 1840) to be raised from the declaration of his majority until his dethronement almost fifty years later.|$|E
500|$|Use of the Saltire at sea as a Jack or {{courtesy}} flag has been observed, including as a Jack on the Scottish Government's Marine Partrol Vessel (MPV) Jura. [...] The ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne routinely flies the Saltire as a Jack on vessels {{which have a}} bow staff, including when such vessels are underway. This practice has also been observed on the Paddle Steamer Waverley when operating {{in and around the}} Firth of Clyde. The practice of maritime vessels adopting the Saltire, for use as a jack or {{courtesy flag}}, may lead to possible confusion in that the Saltire closely resembles the maritime signal flag M, [...] "MIKE", which is used to indicate [...] "My vessel is stopped; making no way." [...] Obviously mariners who understand this signal code <b>also</b> <b>understand</b> that the saltire is displayed on the jackstaff and not as a signal. For the benefit of Scottish seafarers wishing to display a Scottish flag other than the Saltire, thereby avoiding confusion and a possible fine, a campaign was launched in November 2007 seeking official recognition for the historic Scottish Red Ensign. Despite having last been used officially by the pre-Union Royal Scots Navy and merchant marine fleets in the 18th century, the flag continues to be produced by flag manufacturers and its unofficial use by private citizens on water has been observed.|$|E
