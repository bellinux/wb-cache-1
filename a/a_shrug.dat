25|$|Huck, whom you'll see on Times Square, somnolent and alert, sad, sweet, dark, holy. Just out of jail. Martyred. Tortured by sidewalks, {{starved for}} sex and companionship, open to anything, ready to {{introduce}} a new world with <b>a</b> <b>shrug.</b>|$|E
25|$|The costumes {{demonstrate}} {{a blend of}} period and contemporary fashion, often disregarding historical accuracy altogether, with one character wearing cargo trousers and wielding Japanese swords. Marion sometimes wears <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> (a clothing item from the mid-2000s), and modern berets are also anachronistically used by soldiers in the series' last episode. In the Series 1, Episode 10, Harold wears Desert Battle Dress Uniform camouflage pants which were not introduced until 1962.|$|E
25|$|Esch ran up an {{impressive}} string of wins, mostly by knockout, before being stopped in two rounds by Mitchell Rose on December 15, 1995. Butterbean took the loss with <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> {{of his shoulders}} and went on the road, barnstorming around the United States and winning fifty-one consecutive matches, with his best win coming against Peter McNeeley. While {{the majority of his}} opponents were technically limited club-level fighters early in his career, he did move up the ranks to win the IBA Super Heavyweight Championship on April 12, 1997 with a second round technical knockout of Ed White at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. He made five successful title defences before relinquishing his championship in 2000.|$|E

5000|$|The episode closes with Marge imagining {{what she}} could have done with her life...she is in front an ice rink, {{reporting}} that [...] "the Miracle on Ice" [...] never happened. [...] "Nooo!" [...] she screams in real life, to <b>a</b> <b>shrugging</b> family.|$|R
25|$|Unlike {{for example}} the English Premier League, the top three teams of the Norwegian Premier League are awarded medals. Silver and bronze medals are {{sometimes}} received with <b>a</b> <b>shrug,</b> but Brann's dismal league history made them top priority for the club in the 1990s. In 1990, Brann {{were involved in a}} decisive last match where they had the chance of clinching the league title, but lost and ended fourth. They lost out on their first medals since 1976 as local rivals Fyllingen IL conceded two vital goals against Molde FK in stoppage time. Only weeks prior to this, Fyllingen IL had beaten Brann in the Cup semi-finals, and their outspoken ambitions to take over the football hegemony in Bergen by now had become a major annoyance for Brann.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a design}} the Shin Kong Life Tower drew <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> from architects in and beyond Taiwan. It was {{generally}} regarded as a rather plain and old-fashioned design with only height to offer as a distinguishing characteristic. Some saw a design flaw in the placement of retail and office entrances {{on the same side}} of the building. Architect Kaku Morin conceded that his design made no novel architectural statement but expressed satisfaction in producing a [...] "healthy" [...] structure. [...] "Construction is as important as design," [...] he told the Taiwan Review in 1995. [...] "A building is like a human body--if it is not healthy, it is nothing no matter how beautiful it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Earth, Wind & Fire was {{approached}} by Sig Shore, producer {{of the motion picture}} Super Fly, to record the soundtrack to a new film about {{the dark side of the}} recording industry, which he called That's The Way Of The World. The film also starred EWF as a new recording act known as [...] "The Group"; they performed songs in the film and Maurice had a small speaking part, as leader of [...] "The Group". In the film Harvey Keitel's character hears [...] "The Group" [...] performing and produces their first album. The film's title is repeated throughout the film as <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of the shoulders to the music world.|$|E

2500|$|Mann {{remained}} with the Packers through the 1954 NFL season. [...] Lee Remmel, {{who worked for}} the Packers in public relations and served as a team historian, described Mann as [...] "on the small side" [...] (5 feet 11inches, 175 pounds), but a [...] "nifty and productive wide receiver." [...] Green Bay Gazette sports writer Art Daley recalled a story involving Mann and teammate Dick Afflis, who later became known in professional wrestling as [...] "Dick the Bruiser." [...] The Packers stayed at a Baltimore hotel that would not allow Mann to stay with the team on account of a policy against allowing African-American guests. [...] When Mann left to go to another hotel, the 252-pound Afflis left with him. [...] When a cab driver told Afflis that he would not drive Mann because of his race, Afflis grabbed the driver by the shirt and said, [...] "You will take him wherever he wants to go." [...] Daley also recalled how he had protested the hotel not accepting Mann and Mann calmed him down by saying with <b>a</b> <b>shrug,</b> [...] "That's just politics." ...|$|E
2500|$|A 1987 essay titled [...] "The Overhauling of Straight America", by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen (writing as Erastes Pill), {{lays out}} a six-point {{plan for a}} campaign, which was first {{published}} in Guide magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans [...] "to think that it is just another thing, with <b>a</b> <b>shrug</b> of their shoulders". Then [...] "your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book [...] "After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the â€™90s." [...] The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. It argues that after the gay liberation phase of the 1970s and 1980s, gay rights groups should adopt more professional public relations techniques to convey their message. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of Newsweek, Time and The Washington Post. The book is often critically described by social conservatives such as Focus on the Family as important {{to the success of the}} LGBT Movement in the 90's and as part of an alleged [...] "homosexual agenda".|$|E
