25|$|Martínez {{was named}} the AL Pitcher of the Month in April, May, June and September 1999 – 4 times in a single season. Martínez punctuated his {{dominance}} in the 1999 All-Star Game start at Fenway Park, when he struck out Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and Jeff Bagwell in two innings. It {{was the first time}} any pitcher struck out the side to start an All-Star Game, and the performance earned Martínez the All-Star Game MVP award. Martínez later said that the 1999 All-Star break was especially memorable for him because he was able to meet the members of the MLB All-Century Team <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> autograph from Ted Williams.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his success}} and popularity, Guerrero {{had been one}} of many wrestlers who were {{frustrated}} at never being given a chance to be main event stars in WCW. These frustrations came to a head when Guerrero requested that WCW President Eric Bischoff either push his character or give him a raise for family reasons. Bischoff responded by allegedly throwing coffee at Guerrero (however, in his autobiography, Guerrero states that Bischoff accidentally knocked his coffee off the table and that it was a complete accident that he was hit). Furious, Guerrero demanded Bischoff release him from his contract on a live episode of Nitro. Guerrero then left the company for a period of months, angry at Bischoff for what he had done. Guerrero later returned to WCW, leading to the belief that maybe Guerrero's angry speeches against Bischoff were actually a work (Guerrero later confirmed it to be a worked shoot). Guerrero would later contradict himself on WWE's DVD Monday Night War claiming that he tried to put personal differences aside {{for the good of the}} company, yet found himself angry and outraged once more because of Bischoff's supposed continued refusal to elevate Guerrero and other similar wrestlers. He let Brian Adams pin him <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> upset victory in a match.|$|E

500|$|Moreover, {{symmetrical}} positions may be disadvantageous to White {{in that he}} has {{to commit}} himself first. Watson notes that it is even difficult for White to play noncommittally in a symmetrical position, since almost every move has certain drawbacks. Fischer once {{went so far as to}} claim that after 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.0-0 0-0 5.d3 d6 (Reinhard–Fischer, Western Open 1963), Believe it or not,' Black stands better! Now, whatever White does, Black will vary it <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> asymmetrical position and have the superior position due to his better pawn structure!" [...] However, GM Paul Keres responded in CHESS magazine, [...] "We just don't believe it!" [...] In symmetrical positions, as the Hodgson–Arkell and Portisch–Tal games discussed below illustrate, Black can continue to imitate White as long as he finds it feasible and desirable to do so, and deviate when that ceases to be the case.|$|E

Berkowitz, a law student at Duke University, was certified with the National Basketball Players Association but was only {{two years older than}} his client. The agent said, [...] "What he has to overcome is his size and range and I have to overcome my age. We are going to market ourselves to NBA teams". Garland's connections with Berkowitz helped him get to know trainer Kendrick Williams <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> endorsement deal with Under Armour. He had hopes of playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA), regardless of whether he had to compete in Europe before reaching that level. In mid-October 2014, Garland planned on entering the 2014 NBA Development League Draft.

[...] Black's father has accompanied her in public to guard against potential accosters. In response to criticism over the song's significant use of Auto-Tune, Black performed an acoustic version during an interview with ABC News, which earned over 180,000 dislikes on YouTube (84% of total ratings) by November 2011.

[...] Black said, however, that soon she was able to ignore such comments, and asked Justin Bieber, her idol, to perform a duet with her. Although Bieber has not released an official announcement regarding the offer, he posted on Twitter [...] "sunday comes after saturday? weird." [...] Bieber later sang part of the chorus at one of his concerts. Rolling Stone's Perpetua again praised Black after the interview and said, [...] "She is actually a pretty decent singer. [...] She is a total sweetheart. [...] Black comes off as a well-adjusted, happy and grateful kid." [...] He also pointed out Black's intention to donate part of the profits from the song to school arts programs and relief efforts in Japan following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

They came across fortifications from the MB, and this survey led to salvage excavations in the following two years of what would later become Area A. In 1961, public works by the national water company revealed Bronze Age architectural remains {{in the form of a}} palace floor. In 1969, another rescue excavation was launched to investigate MB IIA tombs revealed as a result of agricultural activity by the kibbutz.

During her teenage years, she was employed at an Amish Market supermarket in Lower Manhattan, which was the last job that she held before turning to stripping at the age of 19. Upon being fired from Amish Market, she was recommended by her former manager to work at a strip club. She has said she became a stripper to escape poverty and domestic violence, having been in an abusive relationship at the time. Cardi B has also said becoming a stripper was positive for her life in many ways: [...] "It really saved me from a lot of things. When I started stripping I went back to school." [...] Due to her new sudden career path and the expectations it held, Cardi B turned to cosmetic surgery, getting breast implants and buttock augmentation.
