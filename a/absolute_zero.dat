40|$|An {{information}} theory {{approach to the}} thermochapters in introductory physics is outlined. By starting with number of accessible states, one finds natural physical units for entropy (nats or bits) and temperature (energy per unit information), along with separate positive/negative <b>absolute</b> <b>zeros</b> (or infinities in reciprocal temperature). A general and quantitative version of the Zeroeth Law allows one to derive equipartition, the ideal gas law, and the law of mass action where they apply, and show that specific heats and degrees freedom measure bits of uncertainty increase per two-fold increase in thermal energy per particle. The role of heat engines (esp. autotrophs) in biological energy flow {{as well as in}} motors and heat pumps is discussed. Entropy loses its extensive character with consideration of correlation information, allowing one to define information engines that extend the role of heat engines in biology. Lastly, the complementary role of codes and excitations is discussed...|$|R

Script editor Dicks rejected the storyline, but the inclusion of the Ice Warriors inspired the development of The Curse of Peladon.|$|E
5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} {{index of}} refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to <b>absolute</b> <b>zero,</b> preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E

5|$|Liquid helium {{is used in}} {{cryogenics}} (its {{largest single}} use, absorbing {{about a quarter of}} production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (heliumI and heliumII) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near <b>absolute</b> <b>zero.</b>|$|E
5|$|Low {{atomic number}} also makes {{beryllium}} relatively transparent to energetic particles. Therefore, {{it is used}} to build the beam pipe around the collision region in particle physics setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb), the Tevatron and the SLAC. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above <b>absolute</b> <b>zero,</b> and its diamagnetic nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and focus the particle beams.|$|E
5|$|Helium was {{discovered}} in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of helium {{were found in the}} natural gas fields of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, helium I and helium II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of superfluidity in particular, and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near <b>absolute</b> <b>zero</b> have on matter, such as with superconductivity.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we derive {{a formula for}} the number of N-free {{elements}} over a finite field F_q with prescribed trace, in particular trace zero, in terms of Gaussian periods. As a consequence, we derive a simple explicit formula {{for the number of}} primitive elements, in quartic extensions of Mersenne prime fields, having <b>absolute</b> trace <b>zero.</b> We also give a simple formula in the case when Q = (q^m- 1) /(q- 1) is prime. More generally, for a positive integer N whose prime factors divide Q and satisfy the so called semi-primitive condition, we give an explicit formula for the number of N-free elements with arbitrary trace. In addition we show that if all the prime factors of q- 1 divide m, then the number of primitive elements in F_q^m, with prescribed non-zero trace, is uniformly distributed. Finally we explore the related number, P_q, m, N(c), of elements in F_q^m with multiplicative order N and having trace c ∈F_q. Let N | q^m- 1 such that L_Q | N, where L_Q is the largest factor of q^m- 1 with the same radical as that of Q. We show there exists an element in F_q^m^* of (large) order N with trace 0 if and only if m ≠ 2 and (q,m) ≠ (4, 3). Moreover we derive an explicit formula for the number of elements in F_p^ 4 with the corresponding large order L_Q = 2 (p+ 1) (p^ 2 + 1) and having <b>absolute</b> trace <b>zero,</b> where p is a Mersenne prime...|$|R

5|$|Unlike {{any other}} element, helium will remain liquid down to <b>absolute</b> <b>zero</b> at normal pressures. This {{is a direct}} effect of quantum mechanics: specifically, the zero point energy {{of the system is}} too high to allow freezing. Solid helium {{requires}} a temperature of 1–1.5K (about −272°C or −457°F) at about 25 bar (2.5MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214±0.006g/cm3 at 1.15K and 66atm; the projected density at 0K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187±0.009g/cm3. At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} cooling {{involves}} removing internal energy from a system. When no more energy can be removed, the system is at <b>absolute</b> <b>zero,</b> though this cannot be achieved experimentally. <b>Absolute</b> <b>zero</b> is the null point of the thermodynamic temperature scale, also called absolute temperature. If it were possible to cool a system to <b>absolute</b> <b>zero,</b> all classical motion of its particles would cease {{and they would be}} at complete rest in this classical sense.

40|$|Abstract. For {{a complex}} {{polynomial}} with a disconnected Julia set and exactly one critical point with bounded orbit, {{we show that}} certain closest return times of the critical point with bounded orbit are meta-Fibonacci numbers. We give a condition on these meta-Fibonacci numbers that implies that the Julia set of such a polynomial is a Cantor set with (<b>absolute)</b> area <b>zero.</b> We give another condition that implies the Julia set has a connected component contained in a nested sequence of annuli with finite total modulus. We give a sufficient condition for a sequence of meta-Fibonacci numbers to be realizable as return times of a complex polynomial. This condition shows that the combinatorics of complex polynomials are strictly more general than the combinatorics of unimodal polynomials. 1...|$|R
25|$|One {{model that}} {{estimates}} {{the properties of}} an electron gas at <b>absolute</b> <b>zero</b> in metals is the Fermi gas. The electrons, being Fermions, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical velocities, even at <b>absolute</b> <b>zero.</b> The maximum energy that electrons can have at <b>absolute</b> <b>zero</b> is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is {{of the order of}} 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals.
