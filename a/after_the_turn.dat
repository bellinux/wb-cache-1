5|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> of the 19th century, {{architecture}} {{developed into}} the late Baroque style. Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst who built the Chancery Building or Kancellibygningen (1721) on Slotsholmen and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the Eremitage Palace (1734) in Dyrehaven, just north of Copenhagen. Even more ambitious was de Thurah's work at Ledreborg near Roskilde, where he succeeded in working the components into a well-balanced and cohesive Baroque palace.|$|E

Soon afterwards, NY321 turns to the northeast, heading towards NY5. The highway intersects Forward Road (unsigned NY931F) just inside the Camillus town line soon <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn.</b> Forward Road, a local road that passes through a mixture of open fields and forests, serves as a connector between NY321 and NY174.|$|E

Vainio's family on his father's side boasted many athletes whilst Kaarina Vainio had some {{athletic}} background. After becoming engaged to Kaarina in 1937, Tauno Vainio worked in Vuoksenniska as a regional head of the White Guard, and was known as a man of principle. Kaarina Vainio had a middle school education, and Tauno Vainio had graduated as a trade technician.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of Colin Walker's {{first start}} to a season as manager, York signed nine players before the summer {{transfer}} window closed. The season started with an eight-match unbeaten run, but Walker was dismissed in November 2008 after three successive defeats. Martin Foyle was appointed as his successor, and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> {{of the year}} York won only five league matches. Survival in the Conference Premier was achieved with a 17th-place finish. York reached the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium, being beaten 2–0 by Stevenage Borough. They were eliminated from the 2008–09 FA Cup in the fourth qualifying round, and from the 2008–09 Conference League Cup in the Northern section fourth round.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} years of the ninth century, three sub-ealdormen ruled Mercia under Æthelred. Æthelflæd's uncle, Æthelwulf, {{controlled}} western and possibly central Mercia, while the south and east were ruled by Æthelfrith, the father of Æthelstan Half-King. Alhhelm was responsible for the lands bordering the northern Danelaw. Æthelwulf and Alhhelm are not recorded <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> of the century, and Æthelfrith may have been Æthelflæd's chief lieutenant when Æthelred's health collapsed soon afterwards. Keynes sees Æthelfrith as an ealdorman of West Saxon origin, probably appointed by Alfred to look after his interests in south-east Mercia.|$|E

5|$|Tegetthoff {{was laid}} down in 1876 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. The ship was launched in 1878, and completed in 1881. She conducted her sea trials in October of that year, and was finally ready for commissioning in September 1882; Kaiser Franz Joseph attended the commissioning of the ship in Pola. Financial difficulties had again delayed the ship's completion; the parliament finally voted to allocate funds to finish the ship in November 1881. At the time, she was {{the largest and most}} powerful ship in the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and she would keep that distinction until <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> of the century. She was, nevertheless, a political compromise, and was much smaller than foreign casemate ships, particularly British and French vessels.|$|E
5|$|With the {{takeover}} of two French name brands, HOM and Valisère, Triumph International ventured into the men's underwear and high-quality lingerie market. At the same time, the company announced in 1995 {{that in the future}} it would focus more on its Triumph umbrella brand, under which a number of brands would be classified. To that end, an advertising campaign was launched featuring Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen. In the 1990s, Triumph International launched another phase of international expansion, and since 1998 it has been present on the subcontinent of India. In 2001, its newest production facility opened in Dunaújváros (Hungary). <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> of the millennium, Triumph {{was one of the biggest}} textile manufacturers in terms of sales in the domestic market.|$|E

5|$|On 7 September La Fleche {{ran in the}} St Leger on a wet day at Doncaster. Orme, who had {{returned}} from his problems to win the Eclipse Stakes started favourite, with La Fleche, ridden on this occasion by John Watts, strongly supported at 7/2. Watts settled the filly {{in the early stages}} as Orme set off in front. Just <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> into the straight, La Fleche, travelling strongly, moved alongside her stable companion and then pulled clear. She won easily by two lengths from the fast-finishing Sir Hugo, with Orme fading into fifth. On 24 September, La Fleche ran against older and younger horses in the £10,000 Lancashire Plate over one mile at Manchester Racecourse. Ridden by Barrett, she tracked the leaders until the straight, where she accelerated impressively to win by three lengths from Orvieto, with Sir Hugo unplaced.|$|E
5|$|Since the university's {{establishment}} {{in the city}} in 1837, the histories of the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor have been closely linked. The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 {{with the arrival of}} the Michigan Central Railroad, and a north—south railway connecting Ann Arbor to Toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878. Throughout the 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish, and African-Americans. In 1851, Ann Arbor was chartered as a city, though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann Arbor again saw robust growth, with new immigrants coming from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland. Ann Arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in milling. Ann Arbor's Jewish community also grew <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> of the 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, Beth Israel Congregation, was established in 1916.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the Representatives' Centralization of Germany were {{dominated}} by a discussion on how to finance strikes by individual local trade unions. The issue was how local unions could retain their autonomy when receiving financial assistance. Originally, all support between local organizations had been voluntary. But this system became more and more impractical, especially <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> of the 20th century saw numerous large strikes in which employers reacted more aggressively— often by locking out workers. In 1899, the Business Committee felt it had to support a strike in Braunschweig. It took out a loan, which was paid off with dues income and from donations by Berlin unions. The following year, the Business Committee incurred 8,000 Marks in debt by supporting strikes. Part of the debt was paid off by the SPD, while the rest was apportioned among the local unions.|$|E

Kaiser Max and Don Juan d'Austria were deleted from the list in December and June 1904, respectively, though Prinz Eugen lingered on until December 1912. The first two ships became floating barracks and Prinz Eugen was converted into a repair ship and renamed Vulkan. All {{three members of the}} class remained in the navy's inventory through World War I; Italy seized Kaiser Max and Vulkan, though both were awarded to the Royal Yugoslav Navy in the postwar peace negotiations. Italy refused to relinquish Vulkan, the fate of which is unknown, but Kaiser Max was transferred to Yugoslavia and renamed Tivat. The ship was either scrapped in 1924, or kept in the Yugoslav inventory until the country was overrun in the Axis invasion during World War II, her fate after falling back into Italian hands unknown. Don Juan d'Austria, meanwhile, sank under uncertain circumstances in 1919 before she could be seized by the victorious Allied powers.|$|E
