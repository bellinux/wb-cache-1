2500|$|Sapphires can {{be treated}} by several methods to enhance and improve their clarity and color. It is common {{practice}} to heat natural sapphires to improve or enhance color. This is done by heating the sapphires in furnaces to temperatures between [...] for several hours, or by heating in a nitrogen-deficient atmosphere oven for seven days or more. Upon heating, the stone becomes more blue in color, but loses some of the rutile inclusions (silk). When high temperatures are used, the stone loses <b>all</b> <b>silk</b> (inclusions) and it becomes clear under magnification. The inclusions in natural stones are easily seen with a jeweler's loupe. Evidence of sapphire and other gemstones being subjected to heating goes {{back at least to}} Roman times. Un-heated natural stones are somewhat rare and will often be sold accompanied by a certificate from an independent gemological laboratory attesting to [...] "no evidence of heat treatment".|$|E

40|$|Silk from 3 -molted, 4 -molted and {{sex-limited}} Bombyx mori, Antheraea pernyi and Antheraea yamamai {{have been}} investigated using Atomic Force Microscopy and Low Voltage High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy. Nanofibrils, bundles of nanofibrils, helical features and a layered structure with a cross angle between nanofibrils in different layers were observed for <b>all</b> <b>silks.</b> Similar log-normal distributions of fibril widths were obtained from <b>all</b> <b>silks</b> with the geometric mean fibril widths covering the range of 90 – 170 nm. There is no correlation of the fibril width with the fiber size from different types of silkworm. Similar normal distributions of cross angles were observed in 30 % of the images with the arithmetic means covering the range of 30 – 508. There is an apparent correlation of cross angle with fiber size. The larger fibers for which the crystals are primarily alanine exhibit a greater average cross angle, 468, than do those of the smaller fibers for which the crystals are primarily alanine and glycine, 368. Initial wide angle X-ray diffraction measurements on a single fiber of A. pernyi {{are consistent with the}} fraction of fibrils at different cross angles being 28 %.

2500|$|What are the {{characteristics}} of the fibres? [...] For instance, cotton and linen, being plant fibers, are both stronger wet than dry, and so may be able to withstand a more mechanical stress than something like silk. [...] Wool can absorb large amounts of water, but mats if washed in high temperatures.

60|$|The fact is, {{that the}} {{principles}} and economy of the Company's trade have been so completely corrupted by {{turning it into a}} vehicle for tribute, that, whenever circumstances require it to be replaced again upon a bottom truly commercial, hardly anything but confusion and disasters can be expected as the first results. Even before the acquisition of the territorial revenues, the system of the Company's commerce was not formed upon principles the most favorable to its prosperity; for, whilst, on the one hand, that body received encouragement by royal and Parliamentary charters, was invested with several ample privileges, and even with a delegation of the most essential prerogatives of the crown,--on the other, its commerce was watched with an insidious jealousy, as a species of dealing dangerous to the national interests. In that light, with regard to the Company's imports, there was a total prohibition from domestic use of the most considerable articles of their trade,--that is, of <b>all</b> <b>silk</b> stuffs, and stained and painted cottons. The British market was in a great measure interdicted to the British trader. Whatever advantages might arise to the general trading interests of the kingdom by this restraint, its East India interest was undoubtedly injured by it. The Company is also, and has been from a very early period, obliged to furnish the Ordnance with a quantity of saltpetre at a certain price, without any reference to the standard of the markets either of purchase or of sale. With regard to their export, they were put also under difficulties upon very mistaken notions; for they were obliged to export annually a certain proportion of British manufactures, even though they should find for them in India none or but an unprofitable want. This compulsory export might operate, and in some instances has operated, in a manner more grievous than a tax to the amount of the loss in trade: for the payment of a tax is in general divided in unequal portions between the vender and consumer, the largest part falling upon the latter; in the case before us the tax may be as a dead charge on the trading capital of the Company.|$|E
