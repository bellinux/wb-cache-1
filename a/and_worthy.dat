5|$|Formby's ENSA {{commitments}} were heavy, touring factories, theatres {{and concert}} halls around Britain. He also gave free concerts for charities <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> causes, and raised £10,000 for the Fleetwood Fund {{on behalf of}} the families of missing trawlermen. He and Beryl also set up their own charities, such as the OK Club for Kids, whose aim was to provide cigarettes for Yorkshire soldiers, and the Jump Fund, to provide home-knitted balaclavas, scarves and socks to servicemen. Formby also joined the Home Guard as a dispatch rider, where he took his duties seriously, and fitted them around his other work whenever he could.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{quickly became}} deeply {{involved}} in the community. Among the roles he acquired during his first three years in the District of Alberta were President of the newly formed South Edmonton Football Club, secretary-treasurer of the South Edmonton School Board, president of the South Edmonton Athletic Association, vice president of the South Edmonton Literary Institute, auditor of the South Edmonton Agricultural Society, <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> master of the Acacia Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons. He later added to this the title of secretary of the Edmonton District Butter and Cheese Manufacturing Association. He was an early advocate for the incorporation of South Edmonton, hitherto an unincorporated community. When incorporation came in 1899—as the Town of Strathcona—Rutherford became the new town's secretary-treasurer (after acting as returning officer in its first election).|$|E
5|$|The RGA reorganised {{itself to}} become the {{governing}} Rhodesia Party, with Coghlan as Southern Rhodesia's first Premier. The title was changed to Prime Minister in 1933 by George Mitchell, the third man to hold the office. In 1932, the Southern Rhodesian leader was first invited to an Imperial Conference. Although Southern Rhodesia was not a dominion, it was seen elsewhere in the Empire as a sui generis case among Britain's colonies, <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> of inclusion, particularly {{as it was the}} only one which governed itself. Southern Rhodesian Prime Ministers thereafter became a regular fixture at such meetings and, from 1944, at Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences.|$|E

50|$|In 1830 a Leeds publisher, F. E. Bingley, made a {{contract}} with him to write biographies of Yorkshire <b>and</b> Lancashire <b>worthies.</b> These were afterwards republished under the title of Biographia Borealis (1833) <b>and</b> <b>Worthies</b> of Yorkshire <b>and</b> Lancashire (1836). Bingley also printed a volume of his poems in 1833, and Coleridge lived in his house until the contract {{came to an end}} through the bankruptcy of the publisher.|$|R
5|$|The {{official}} go-ahead {{was given}} at 14:00. At 15:30, some 58–80 Ju 88s from I., II., and III./LG 1, escorted by 30 Bf 110s of V./LG 1, took off to bomb Boscombe Down <b>and</b> <b>Worthy</b> Down. RAF Andover {{was to be}} bombed as well, {{with the support of}} 52 Ju 87s from StG 1 and StG 2 who were to strike at RAF Warmwell and Yeovil. I./JG 53 flew a fighter sweep ahead of the bombers from Poole to Lyme Regis in order to tempt the RAF into battle. I./JG 53 made landfall at 16:00. The sweep failed to attract and divert RAF squadrons. Instead, all it succeeded in doing was to alert the RAF defences a critical five minutes earlier. When the main wave of LG 1 and StG 2 arrived over the coast, they were greeted by 77 RAF fighters.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{remains the}} only {{national}} championship game to have featured three of the NBA 50 Greatest Players – Jordan, Ewing <b>and</b> <b>Worthy</b> – chosen in 1996 to mark the NBA's 50th anniversary. In addition to Jordan's, Ewing's and Worthy's Hall of Fame NBA careers with the Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers respectively (including a combined 9 NBA championships), Floyd was named an NBA All-Star and still holds playoff records for most points in a quarter and half, while Perkins played in the league for 17 seasons. For Jordan's part, his game-winner is often seen as the launching point of his career - the moment that gave him the confidence to become what many {{believe to be the}} greatest basketball player of all time, in no small part due to his clutch performance. Jordan has said multiple times that before he would take game-winning shots with the Bulls, he would sometimes think back to his shot in the 1982 game that propelled North Carolina past Georgetown.|$|E

25|$|Hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the folklore and mythology of human cultures {{with which they are}} sympatric. Hyenas are commonly viewed as frightening <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> of contempt. In some cultures, hyenas are thought to influence people’s spirits, rob graves, and steal livestock and children. Other cultures associate them with witchcraft, using their body parts in traditional African medicine.|$|E
25|$|But Richardson {{still felt}} the need to respond by writing a {{pamphlet}} called Answer to the Letter of a Very Reverend <b>and</b> <b>Worthy</b> Gentleman. In the pamphlet, he defends his characterizations and explains that he took great pains to avoid any glorification of scandalous behaviour, unlike the authors of many other novels that rely on characters of such low quality.|$|E
25|$|When we {{arranged}} all {{the chapters}} and {{read through the}} remarkable outline, we found that Spice Planet was a unique <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> story in its own right, not just a precursor to Dune. Although the harsh desert {{is very similar to}} the one familiar to millions of fans, the tale itself is thematically different, focusing on decadence and drug addiction instead of ecology, finite resources, freedom, and religious fanaticism.|$|E
60|$|Such was {{the fate}} of Major Henry Vanderburgh, {{one of the best}} <b>and</b> <b>worthiest</b> leaders of the American Fur Company, who by his manly bearing and dauntless courage is said to have made himself universally popular among the bold-hearted rovers of the wilderness.|$|R

25|$|The former Greyfriars {{bus station}} served the town from 1976 until 2014.

Demolition work began in March 2014, following the move of bus services to North Gate bus station. The Greyfriars was completely destroyed on 15 March 2015 {{by way of a}} controlled explosion.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays {{it appears}} that the almshouses rival the inmates in their decayed circumstances, for, while the black and white paint-work is tidy, the facade shows an {{alarming}} inclination to land at the feet of those who stand in front to admire it. This is a good little build¬ing, adding much to the town's seafront, <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> of careful renovation. Happily the James Butcher Housing Association is now undertaking this work.|$|E
25|$|Another biblical hero, Noah, {{best known}} for his {{building}} an ark to save animals <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> people from a divinely caused flood, later became a wine-maker. One day he drinks too much wine, and fell asleep naked in his tent. When his son Ham enters the tent, he sees his father naked, and Canaan, One of Ham's sons is cursed with banishment. In Jewish tradition, it is also suggested that Ham had anal sex with Noah or castrated him.|$|E

25|$|Currently, the LDS Church {{does not}} {{sanction}} polygamy and considers practitioners to be apostate <b>and</b> <b>worthy</b> of excommunication. The church still confirms that polygamy may {{be approved by}} God, but that observation of the practice is currently prohibited by him. The Community of Christ does not, nor has ever adhered {{to the practice of}} polygamy. The FLDS Church and other Mormon fundamentalists still adhere to the commandment as practiced {{in the early days of}} the movement. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) does not practice polygamy, but recognizes it as a legitimate historical doctrine.|$|E
