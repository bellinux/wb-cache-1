5|$|After <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> Marines {{reached and}} climbed Hill 148. Working from the top, the Marines began {{clearing}} the Japanese fighting {{positions on the}} hill, most of which still remained, with explosive charges, grenades, and hand-to-hand combat. From {{the top of the}} hill, the Marines were also able to put increased suppressive fire on Tanambogo. The Marine battalion commander on Gavutu radioed General Rupertus with a request for reinforcements before attempting to assault Tanambogo.|$|E
5|$|Squab pie is a mutton {{pie with}} a shortcrust pastry lid. It {{should be made}} {{with at least one}} layer of onions, {{followed}} by alternating layers of sliced apples and mutton chops.

The path from the col leads to the fort. There are two gates in good condition. There is no good water on the fort, so it is {{advisable}} to carry enough water. It takes about one hour to climb and see the fort.|$|R
5|$|The Denver protest, {{which was}} {{organized}} by Hanna Khavafipour, included several hundred demonstrators and {{took place in the}} evening at the Colorado State Capitol. The 16th Street Mall and nearby streets were shut down for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> but no arrests were made and businesses experienced few disturbances. A small group of protesters in Pueblo were organized by the Pueblo Congressional Accountability Committee (PCAC).|$|E
5|$|The battle lasted <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> and {{involved}} innovative tactics and technology. By {{the end of}} the day, the IAF had destroyed 29 of 30 SAM batteries deployed in the Beqaa Valley and shot down between 82–86 enemy aircraft with minimal losses. The battle led the United States to impose a ceasefire on Israel and Syria.|$|E
5|$|<b>About</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> later, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the badly coordinated uprising had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers refused to participate in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for their role in the suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} that Whetstone had reached Hispaniola, Du Casse had already departed. Benbow's force {{subsequently}} sighted the French on 19 August, sailing off Cape Santa Marta. The French had three transports and four warships carrying between 68 and 70 guns, while Benbow commanded seven ships carrying between 50 and 70 guns. The English forces were heavily scattered, and the light winds meant that they were slow to regroup. They did not achieve a form of collective order until four in the afternoon, after which a partial engagement was fought, lasting <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> until nightfall caused the fleets to temporarily break off.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2003, Thomas was apprehended by Pakistani {{immigration}} officials {{at an airport}} {{in the city of}} Karachi, and taken into custody. Thomas had with him items including an Australian-issue passport, an airline ticket for travel to Indonesia, and about $ 3,800 in cash. The passport, issued on 19 May 1993, had been tampered with, for the intention of concealing the details of Thomas' movements after his departure from Australia in 2001. He was blindfolded, and driven to an unknown location, where he was questioned for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> by two Pakistani men and two Americans.|$|E
5|$|Only July1, the system's {{circulation}} became broad, {{with most}} of the convection located west of the center. The next day, Chataan briefly weakened to an intensity of 85km/h (50mph), although it began strengthening steadily on July3, when its center passed very near Weno in Chuck State in the FSM. At 1800UTC that night, the JTWC upgraded Chataan to a typhoon, and about 24hours later the JMA followed suit while the storm was approaching Guam from the southeast. At about 2130UTC on July4, the eye of Chataan moved across northern Guam in <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> although the center of the eye passed north of the island.|$|E

5|$|The battle lasted <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> and Harrison lost 62 men (37 {{killed in}} action and 25 mortally wounded); about 126 were less seriously hurt. The Yellow Jackets {{suffered}} the highest casualties of the battle, with 30% of their numbers killed or wounded. The number of Native American casualties is still the subject of debate, but it was certainly {{lower than that of}} the United States forces. Historians estimate that as many as 50 were killed and about 70–80 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|They {{started the}} ascent at 19:00 {{and reached the}} first shelf <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> later. Here, a field radio was stationed. Later the same evening, they reached the main shelf where the {{aircraft}} body lay. Although finding the remaining bodies, the team only salvaged some post, concluding {{that it would be}} too difficult for them to take down the bodies. They were down again at 01:30. At 10:00 on 20 June, the team again ascended the mountain. Bernt Porten climbed halfway up at least a dozen times, taking water up and bringing down bodies wrapped in tarpaulin. All three bodies and the climbers were down again at 21:00.|$|E
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E

5|$|Amidst {{the flames}} and rubble, Arenberg's and Ferdinand's troops tried to storm the castle, but {{found their way}} blocked by masses of debris created by their own explosives. Furthermore, {{although}} close to half of the garrison had perished in the explosion and subsequent collapse of the fortifications, those who remained offered staunch resistance by throwing rocks on the approaching attackers, causing {{a large number of}} casualties. In frustration, 40 or 50 of the attackers tied together two ladders and crawled through the sluice-ways of the garderobe (latrines) that emptied on the hillside, thus gaining access to the interior of the castle. There they killed around 20 of the defenders in fierce fighting; the remaining defenders, approximately 70 men, among them Buchner and Sudermann, the garrison commander and his lieutenant, sought refuge in the castle's keep. In this way, Ferdinand's infantry at last gained unopposed access to the fortress. Storming the castle had taken <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, , a Royal Line ship under {{charter to}} the Uranium Line, caught {{fire in a}} gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the fire for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> but, realizing the {{severity}} of the fire and the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of Volturno had his wireless operator send out SOS signals. The westbound Kroonland, already beyond Volturnos location, turned east to aid the burning liner. In the meantime, several of Volturnos lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched with tragic results: all those aboard the lifeboats were killed as the boats capsized or were smashed by the hull of the heaving ship.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{had been}} {{competing}} with the US in landing {{a man on the}} Moon but had been hampered by repeated failures in development of a launcher comparable to the Saturn V. Meanwhile, they tried to beat the US to return lunar material to the Earth by means of unmanned probes. On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, they launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Jodrell Bank Observatory radio telescope in England was later discovered to have recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and this was published in July 2009 on the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} force left Bremerhaven {{early on}} 8 April 1940, bound for Kristiansand. When they arrived, a heavy fog obscured the city, making {{the passage of}} the fjord outside the harbor very dangerous. As a result, they had to wait until the following morning to begin the attack. As Karlsruhe entered the fjord, she came under heavy fire from the Norwegian coastal guns at Odderøya Fortress. The cruiser turned in the fjord to bring her full broadside into action; the artillery duel lasted for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> before heavy fog again covered the port, forcing both sides to cease fire. The Norwegians surrendered an hour later, and the German ships landed their soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{stock is}} {{typically}} made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork {{or a combination}} of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours,</b> whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom broth for the stock.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was forecast to strengthen slowly to reach peak winds of 45mph (75km/h). Within {{three hours of}} forming, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto. A small cyclone, the storm continued to organize quickly as it turned north-northeastward, while radar imagery suggested {{the formation of an}} eye by early on September 13. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, Humberto was upgraded to a hurricane at 0515UTC on September 13, while located about 15miles (20km) off the coast of Texas. The hurricane made landfall a few miles to the east of High Island at around 0700UTC. A well-defined eye was maintained with strong convection around it, and Hurricane Hunters reported sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>hours</b> after landfall. However, post-storm analysis later determined that the winds were a bit stronger—about 90mph (150km/h).|$|E
