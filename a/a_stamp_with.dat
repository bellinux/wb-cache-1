Tessin was replaced as governor of the crown prince with Carl Fredrik Scheffer, a candidate selected by the Riksdag, an appointment which was enforced even after the candidate had been refused by the queen. In 1755, the Riksdag presented their decision to rectify the loop holes in the constitution which Louisa Ulrika had used to claim that the King had greater constitutional power than the Riksdag had allowed him to practice. They stated that the loop holes in the constitution allowing for royal power would be removed, and that the monarch would no longer be allowed to refuse his signature: if he did so, <b>a</b> <b>stamp</b> <b>with</b> his name would be used.

Reportedly, this provocations triggered the queens plan of a coup d'état, known in history as Coup of 1756.|$|E
