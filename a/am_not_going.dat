5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be a coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and {{people have the right to}} defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
25|$|When I had {{a meeting}} with the Council a day before the concert, they were {{absolutely}} petrified of me. I wanted to play the records and say 'I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E
500|$|As {{the wounded}} lawmen were carried to their homes, they passed {{in front of}} the Sheriff's Office, and Johnny Behan told Wyatt Earp he was under arrest. Wyatt paused two or three seconds and replied very forcibly: [...] "I won't be arrested today. I am right here and <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> away." [...] Dr. George Goodfellow treated the Earps' wounds.|$|E

500|$|On November 21, the {{prosecution}} introduced the letters, telegrams, and checks into evidence. On November 22, Harland testified that Burton had stated: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{to do anything}} inconsistent with my duty as a Senator." [...] Mahaney testified to the in-person payment {{and the destruction of}} the letters at Burton's request on March 22, 1902. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton represented Rialto before him.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, he also feuded with {{democracy}} activist Martha Beatriz Roque, accusing her of collaborating with security forces to provide justification {{for a further}} crackdown. Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions {{he was allowed to}} travel abroad, Payá reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: [...] "I have been told that I am going to be killed before the regime is over but I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to run away." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{more recent}} years, frontwoman Love {{stated that the}} album {{contains}} [...] "nothing melodic". In a 2011 interview for Hit So Hard (2011), a documentary on later Hole drummer Patty Schemel, Love referred to Pretty on the Inside as [...] "unlistenable", going on to say: [...] "That record was a calling card for rock critics and hardcorers, [...] 'This is what I do, and I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to back down from it. I am announcing my persona as a cunt. Thank you very much.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Why {{should she}} give her {{allegiance}} to this world, {{and let it}} so dominate her, that her own world of warm sun and growing, sap-filled life was turned into nothing?

500|$|Shahira Amin {{resigned}} from her position as deputy head of Nile TV, citing {{its coverage of}} the protests, saying, [...] "I walked out yesterday. I can't {{be part of the}} propaganda machine; I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to feed the public lies." [...] Many international journalists in Egypt covering the protests were detained, beaten, shouted at or threatened by pro-Mubarak protesters, as were numerous Egyptian bloggers and activists including Wael Abbas. Two Al Jazeera reporters were attacked as they arrived from the airport while three others were arrested and later released.|$|E
500|$|In May 2008, the Wynn Las Vegas casino filed a civil {{complaint}} against Barkley, alleging {{that he had}} failed to pay a $400,000 debt stemming from October 2007. Barkley responded by taking blame for letting time lapse on the repayment of the debt and promptly paid the casino. After repaying his debt, Barkley stated during a pregame show on TNT, [...] "I've got to stop gambling...I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to gamble anymore. For right now, the next year or two, I'm not going to gamble... Just because I can afford to lose money doesn't mean I should do it." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 24, 1863, at the Court's suggestion, the {{government}} filed a nolle prosequi motion and Jackalow was discharged. Jackalow was admonished {{to leave the}} country and never return, and he complied. Three years after Jackalow's first trial, {{the government}} was unable to locate witnesses for a retrial and persisted in [...] Justice Grier, again riding circuit, reportedly stated: [...] "If the Supreme Court of the United States can't make up its mind whether the place where the murder was committed was within the jurisdiction of the states or on the high seas, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to come so near committing judicial murder as to set twelve men guessing at it." ...|$|E

500|$|Reagan's {{opponent}} in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President Walter Mondale. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability {{to perform the duties}} of president for another term was questioned. His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters; they had previously known him clever and witty. Rumors began to circulate that he had Alzheimer's disease. Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, [...] "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience," [...] which generated applause and laughter, even from Mondale himself.|$|E
500|$|As it {{continued}} eastward, Epsilon developed characteristics of an annular hurricane; such cyclones, more {{often found in}} the deep tropics with greater intensity, have circular eyes, surrounded by a nearly uniform ring of convection and {{a general lack of}} thunderstorms outside the ring. For several days, the intensity fluctuated in a narrow range, and although Epsilon was briefly downgraded to tropical storm status on December4, the NHC assessed it as remaining a hurricane. After it was thought to have weakened, the eye became more symmetric as the ring of convection became stronger. The hurricane remained difficult to forecast, as NHC forecaster Lixion Avila remarked, [...] "There are no clear reasons... and I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to make one up... to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning in August, several {{professional}} athletes {{have participated in}} the 2016 U.S. national anthem protests. The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. During a post-game interview he explained his position stating, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder," [...] a protest widely interpreted as in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests have generated mixed reactions, and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.|$|E

500|$|Given the UFA's formal {{adoption}} of the goal of replacing Stewart's Liberal government with a Farmer government, it remained surprisingly friendly towards the Premier. While campaigning for Moore during the Cochrane by-election, Wood called Stewart [...] "an honourable, upright citizen, doing {{the best he could}} under difficult circumstances" [...] and boasted that [...] "if I have got to tear down the character of an honourable man to build up something that I want, I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to build it up." [...] When at last the general election came, in 1921, the UFA declined to run a candidate in Stewart's Sedgewick riding as a sign of respect to the Premier. After the UFA swept to victory, there was even speculation that Stewart, still a UFA member, would stay on as Premier of a new Farmer's government (as part of its opposition to [...] "old style politics," [...] the UFA had contested the election without designating a leader), but he announced otherwise.|$|E
500|$|At {{the next}} court session on July 15, {{prosecutors}} submitted evidence that V. N. had received 13,500US$ from an unknown source {{just before she}} recanted the charges during the May court session. The prosecution submitted the evidence {{in an attempt to}} show that V. N.'s original statements and desire to press the charges were valid, and later attempts to recant were in bad faith. Brown then took the stand but refused to answer questions as to why his initial statements to Japanese police were different from what Takaesu later stated in court had actually happened on the night in question. The prosecutor asked Brown, [...] "Your original statement that she made sexual advances was false?" [...] Brown replied, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to answer that." [...] When asked why he would not answer, Brown replied, [...] "Because I want the opportunity for this court to see publicly the type of corruption and distortion of evidence by the police and the prosecutor." [...] Takaesu later said that another reason for Brown's refusal to answer most of the questions was because his answers could be used by the USMC in separate military justice actions against Brown.|$|E
500|$|On October 26, 2010, Levy's then-64-year-old father, Robert, {{took the}} stand and refuted {{statements}} about his past suspicions of Condit. Robert Levy testified that he told authorities {{during the early years}} of the investigation that his daughter Chandra would have been too cautious to jog in the woods alone, but said that he no longer believed this to be true. He said that he also told police that his daughter and Condit had a five-year plan between them to get married. In retrospect, Robert Levy admitted: [...] "I just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as the villain." [...] Levy added that he had been convinced that Condit was [...] "guilty until we learned about this character here," [...] referring to Guandique. On November 1, Condit testified at the trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and Chandra Levy had been involved in a sexual relationship. He replied, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to respond to that question out of privacy for myself and Chandra." [...] FBI biologist Alan Giusti testified that semen found on underwear from Levy's apartment contained sperm matching Condit's DNA profile.|$|E

2500|$|Other parties vehemently {{opposed the}} course of action, {{proposed}} by Dewinter. For instance, Ludwig Caluwé (CD) said that the Flemish Interest did not vote for the resolutions in 1999. He added that more power to the regions does not imply the end of inter-regional solidarity. Patrcia Ceysens (Open VLD) said that [...] "the country <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to split, the parliament <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to declare independence." ...|$|R

500|$|In January 2009, The Register {{reported}} {{on an ongoing}} case involving Scientology before Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee, [...] "According to site administrators, several pro-Scientology accounts have been editing the site using Scientology-owned computers." [...] The Arbitration Committee on Wikipedia is composed {{of a group of}} volunteers elected by the editing community to resolve especially difficult conflicts. During the Arbitration case, the page about Scientology was modified by members of the organization. Scientology members had doctored entries in order to advertise for their cause. The Register noted that one of the Wikipedia users admitted he had edited from computers operated by the Scientology organization, [...] "One of these pro-Scientology editors [...] who once used the handle 'COFS' [...] has admitted as much. And he vows to continue editing Scientology articles from Scientology computers." [...] The Register quoted the [...] "COFS" [...] user as saying, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to leave voluntarily and I will continue to use a) my own computer, b) public computers, c) my wireless laptop, d) computers in the Church of Scientology and any station I please". The Guardian cited The Register, and noted, [...] "The technology news website The Register alleges the church has an organised operation to challenge internet criticism." ...|$|E
500|$|In Harpole's third term, councilmembers {{expressed}} {{the need to}} improve relationships between each other. On June 6, 2016, Harpole expressed concern about controversial Facebook posts, which contained ethnic and sexual slurs, by Sandra McCartt. She was a candidate to fill Harpole's former seat on the city council after his successor, Brian Eades, announced his resignation. The next day, Harpole walked out of a City Council executive session, accusing a councilmember of leaking the rankings of candidates to fill the position. He also alleged that councilmembers chastised him for changing the process for selecting Eades' replacement when he suggested bypassing the scheduled questioning of McCartt by the council, and ending her candidacy. Councilman Randy Burkett then admonished Harpole for publicly criticizing McCartt. Councilman Elisha Demerson said Harpole [...] "owes it to the citizens of this community to be present", while Councilman Mark Nair criticized the mayor for not letting the selection process play out. Harpole defended himself, saying, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be ruled by the process. I am ruled by my constituents". In November 2016, Interim City Manager Terry Childers called the city's politics [...] "toxic" [...] and [...] "frustrating". These remarks followed his resignation after being caught denigrating a citizen speaker on a hot mic that month, and berating 911 dispatchers in February.|$|E
500|$|Supporters of Rangel {{argued that}} by {{comparison}} with previous cases, a reprimand {{would be a more}} fitting punishment for Rangel's trangressions than censure. [...] Rangel repeatedly insisted, as he had all along, that nothing he had done was with the aim of enriching himself. [...] It was to no avail. [...] On December 2, 2010, a motion was made in the full House to censure Rangel. [...] Ethics committee chair Zoe Lofgren emphasized that it was Rangel's [...] "accumulation of actions" [...] that warranted the stiffer penalty, and said that the treatment of Rangel should set a new precedent, not follow old ones. [...] A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267–146; most of Speaker Pelosi's allies rejected it and over 105 Democrats voted the resolution down. [...] The House of Representatives then voted 333–79 to censure Rangel. Per custom, Rangel went to the well of the House to hear Speaker Pelosi solemnly read the formal measure of censure. It had been 27 years since the last such measure and Rangel was only the 23rd House member to be censured. Rangel asked to speak and said, [...] "I know in my heart I <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be judged by this Congress. I’ll be judged by my life in its entirety." ...|$|E
