25|$|Credit card {{security}} {{relies on}} the physical security of the plastic card {{as well as the}} privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card owner has access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without <b>additional</b> <b>verification</b> for mail order purchases. It's now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature. A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.|$|E

60|$|But {{although}} {{the experience in}} question is common, it is not wholly easy to give a theoretical account of it. How {{do we know that}} the sensation resembles the previous image? Does the image persist in presence of the sensation, so that we can compare the two? And even if SOME image does persist, {{how do we know that}} it is the previous image unchanged? It does not seem as if this line of inquiry offered much hope of a successful issue. It is better, I think, to take a more external and causal view of the relation of expectation to expected occurrence. If the occurrence, when it comes, gives us the feeling of expectedness, and if the expectation, beforehand, enabled us to act in a way which proves appropriate to the occurrence, that must be held to constitute the maximum of verification. We have first an expectation, then a sensation with the feeling of expectedness related to memory of the expectation. This whole experience, when it occurs, may be defined as verification, and as constituting the truth of the expectation. Appropriate action, during the period of expectation, may be regarded as <b>additional</b> <b>verification,</b> but is not essential. The whole process may be illustrated by looking up a familiar quotation, finding it in the expected words, and in the expected part of the book. In this case we can strengthen the verification by writing down beforehand the words which we expect to find.|$|E

40|$|A {{discontinuous}} Galerkin ﬁnite element method (DGFEM) {{has been}} developed and tested for linear, three-dimensional, rotating incompressible Euler equations. These equations admit complicated wave solutions. The numerical challenges concern: (i) discretisation of a divergence-free velocity ﬁeld; (ii) discretisation of geostrophic boundary conditions combined with no-normal ﬂow at solid walls; (iii) discretisation of the conserved, Hamiltonian dynamics of the inertial-waves; and, (iv) large-scale computational demands owing to the three-dimensional nature of inertial-wave dynamics and possibly its narrow zones of chaotic attraction. These issues have been resolved: (i) by employing Dirac’s method of constrained Hamiltonian dynamics to our DGFEM for linear, compressible ﬂows, thus enforcing the incompressibility constraints; (ii) by enforcing no-normal ﬂow at solid walls in a weak form and geostrophic tangential ﬂow —along the wall; (iii) by applying a symplectic time discretisation; and, (iv) by combining PETSc’s linear algebra routines with our high-level software. We compared our simulations with exact solutions of three-dimensional compressible and incompressible ﬂows, in (non) rotating periodic and partly periodic cuboids (Poincar´e waves). <b>Additional</b> <b>veriﬁcations</b> concerned semi-analytical eigenmode solutions in rotating cuboids with solid walls...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFail-stop {{and silent}} errors are omnipresent on {{large-scale}} platforms. Efficient resilience techniques must accommodate both error sources. To {{cope with the}} double challenge, a two-level checkpointing and rollback recovery approach can be used, with <b>additional</b> <b>verifications</b> for silent error detection. A fail-stop error leads {{to the loss of}} the whole memory content, hence the obligation to checkpoint on a stable storage (e. g., an external disk). On the contrary, it is possible to use in-memory checkpoints for silent errors, which provide a much smaller checkpointing and recovery overhead. Furthermore, recent detectors offer partial verification mechanisms that are less costly than the guaranteed ones but do not detect all silent errors. In this paper, we show how to combine all of these techniques for HPC applications whose dependency graph forms a linear chain. We present a sophisticated dynamic programming algorithm that returns the optimal solution in polynomial time. Simulation results demonstrate that the combined use of multi-level checkpointing and verifications leads to improved performance compared to the standard single-level checkpointing algorithm...|$|R
