5|$|Anne {{was born}} on 12 December 1574 at the castle of Skanderborg on the Jutland Peninsula in the Kingdom of Denmark. Her birth came as <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> her father, King Frederick II of Denmark, who was desperately hoping for a son. But her mother, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, was only 17; three years later she did bear Frederick a son, the future Christian IV of Denmark.|$|E

5|$|Australia reached 3/135 when Miller and Arthur Morris {{departed}} {{in quick}} succession. With Sid Barnes retiring hurt because of <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the ribs, Tallon {{came in at}} 5/139, effectively six wickets down and made 18 {{in half an hour}} before falling at 6/172. Australia managed to reach 221 and avoid the follow on.|$|E
5|$|Destroying this {{symbol of}} British naval power {{by means of}} a {{submarine}} would at least be <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> British morale and, perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor. The plan was to have Lee surface just behind Eagles rudder and use a screw to attach an explosive to the ship’s hull. Once attached, Lee would re-enter the water and make his getaway.|$|E
5|$|In a {{political}} and economic referendum held in November 1987, 67% of the eligible voters participated {{and most of them}} approved the government-proposed reforms, but a popular mandate was formally missed because of the unrealistically stringent passage requirements self-imposed by the regime. The referendum debacle dealt <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the process of market-oriented economic reforms, which had been pursued by Polish governments since the early 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} {{of the campaign}} in Bulgaria in 986 was <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the consolidation of the monocracy of Basil II. Soon after the Battle of the Gates of Trajan, the nobility in Asia Minor, led by the general Bardas Phokas, rebelled against Basil II for three years.|$|E
5|$|Anger at Turnbull's {{response}} to the 23 November 2009 meeting triggered a spill motion against his leadership three days later. The motion was moved by Kevin Andrews, a former Minister in the Howard government, but was defeated {{by a vote of}} 48 to 35. Andrews was not seen as a genuine prospect for the leadership, so the close vote on the spill motion was considered <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> Turnbull. While Abbott supported Turnbull at the time of Andrews' spill, he subsequently resigned from the frontbench. Several others joined Abbott in resigning, including Nick Minchin, Eric Abetz, Sophie Mirabella and Tony Smith.|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E

5|$|Everyone is {{in disbelief}} that Stewie {{would try to}} murder Lois, but she insists that he is evil, and {{explains}} what happened. After falling overboard, she was rescued by a merman. Having developed retrograde amnesia, she starts working at a fat camp in North Carolina. While in a diner, she meets a new boyfriend, who {{turns out to be}} a white supremacist. While at a white supremacist rally, she takes <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the head and regains her memory, at which point she returns to Quahog.|$|E
5|$|In Pittsburgh, two FBI agents, Angus Stedman (Lawrence LeJohn) and James Leeds (Kevin McClatchy), are {{observing a}} house when Leeds falls asleep. When he awakes, he discovers that {{the front door}} of the house is open. The two agents {{investigate}} and stumble upon a room filled with dead bodies. Suddenly, a man wielding an axe and possessing a third eye murders both agents with <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the head.|$|E
5|$|In early August Sudirman {{approached}} Sukarno {{and asked}} him to continue the guerrilla war; Sudirman did not expect the Dutch to abide by the Roem-Royen Agreement, based on the failings of the previous agreements. Sukarno disagreed, which was <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> Sudirman. When Sudirman threatened to resign his post, blaming the government's inconsistency for his tuberculosis and Oerip's death in November 1948, Sukarno threatened to do so as well. As he thought that such a resignation would have a destabilising effect, Sudirman stayed his hand, and a Java-wide cease fire came into effect on 11August 1949.|$|E

5|$|Jairo Mora Sandoval (March 22, 1987 – May 31, 2013) was a Costa Rican {{environmentalist}} who {{was murdered}} {{while attempting to}} protect leatherback turtle nests. Just before midnight on May 30, 2013, Mora and four female volunteers were abducted {{by a group of}} masked men. The women eventually escaped and informed the police. Mora's bound and beaten body was found on the beach the next morning. An autopsy determined he died by asphyxiation after suffering <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the head.|$|E
5|$|The first {{legislative}} session of Breathitt's administration {{was a disappointment}} to his faction. His youth and narrow margin of victory in the election undermined his authority. Further, the unexpected death of Richard P. Moloney, a key legislative leader, was <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> Breathitt's ability to push his agenda through the General Assembly. The major accomplishment of the 1964 session was the approval of a $176million bond issue to increased funding for roads, public education, the state park system, and social services. Other minor accomplishments included passing a purchasing law, strengthening strip mining regulations, and improving benefits for teachers.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} cause of {{collapse}} at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure. The fall of Tikal was <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> {{the heart of}} Classic Maya civilization, the city having {{been at the forefront}} of courtly life, art and architecture for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty. However, new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of Tikal.|$|E

5|$|The twenty {{health workers}} facing felony charges {{were found guilty}} and sentenced on 29 September 2011 by the {{military}} National Safety Court of First Instance. According to the International Federation for Human Rights, the trial lasted only a few minutes. Thirteen of the twenty received sentences of fifteen years' imprisonment, while five were sentenced to five years and two were sentenced to ten years. The sentences were <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the hopes of human rights groups lobbying on the health workers' behalf, which had predicted authorities would ease their stance after releasing some defendants on bail.|$|E
5|$|This was <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the {{short-range}} committee, who {{had made}} good progress on the specification. Despite being technically superior, FACT had not been created with portability in mind or through manufacturer and user consensus. It also lacked a demonstrable implementation, allowing supporters of a FLOW-MATIC-based COBOL to overturn the resolution. RCA representative Howard Bromberg also blocked FACT, so that RCA's work on a COBOL implementation would not go to waste.|$|E
5|$|As the Arabs customarily did not {{campaign}} during winter, Asad demobilized his men. On Harith's urging, on {{the other}} hand, the Turgesh khagan decided to launch a winter attack south of the Oxus, hoping to raise the local population in revolt against the Arabs. In this he was joined not only by Harith and his followers, but by {{the great majority of}} the native princes of Sogdiana and Tokharistan. Asad quickly mobilized his forces and managed to catch the khagan himself with a small part of his army and defeat them at Kharistan. Although both the khagan and Harith escaped capture, the Battle of Kharistan struck <b>a</b> <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> the khagans prestige, and Suluk's murder by his rivals a short while afterwards saved the Muslims from worse.|$|E
