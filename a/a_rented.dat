From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts.

Many of the songs were written in <b>a</b> <b>rented</b> house in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, where bassist Tony Kanal was living. During early production in mid-1998 the band worked on seven tracks in Los Angeles with Matthew Wilder, who had produced Tragic Kingdom, but had creative differences with him. They planned on going to New York City to work with producer Michael Beinhorn, who had produced for alternative rock acts such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Hole, and Soundgarden.|$|E
50|$|Bracton gives several {{examples}} of escheat occurring by a mesne lord (middle lord in the feudal structure): A enfeoffs B at <b>a</b> <b>rent</b> of 10 shillings. B enfeoffs C at <b>a</b> <b>rent</b> of 5 shillings. B dies without an heir. Is A entitled to 5, 10 or 15 shillings a year? While {{it can be}} argued that A is entitled to 15 shillings, it was Bracton's opinion that A should only be awarded 10 shillings. A enfeoffs B at <b>a</b> <b>rent</b> of 5 shillings. B enfoeffs C at <b>a</b> <b>rent</b> of 10 shillings. B dies without an heir. Bracton thinks A is entitled to 10 shillings. Bracton held this problem to be without solution: Is A entitled to the wardship of C's heir, if C held of B in socage, and B, whose rights have escheated to A, and held of A by knight's service.|$|R

The family {{remained}} in Finland, a former Grand Duchy under Russian rule, which had declared its independence in December 1917. They hoped that the White Russians would prevail. They gradually ran out of supplies and had to beg for help from family. In July 1918, Victoria wrote to her first cousin, Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden, begging her to send baby food so she could feed Vladimir. She was alienated from England because she felt her English relatives had not done enough to help the Romanovs.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} two seasons of the 1970s, Nea Salamina {{finished}} {{in the middle of}} the table; the next two seasons threatened relegation, which was avoided. The club's low point was 14 August 1974, when the occupation of Famagusta by Turkish troops led to Nea Salamina becoming a refugee club. Fans and players scattered to unoccupied areas of Cyprus and abroad. In October, board members met at the offices of Aris Limassol, deciding to revive the club. Since most players were in Larnaca, it was decided to make Larnaca the club's temporary home. Its offices were housed temporarily at the offices of Alki Larnaca F.C. and in January 1975 acquired <b>a</b> <b>rented</b> building. Expenses were paid with contributions from members and friends of the club. Two youth academies were founded, in Larnaca and Limassol.|$|E
