25|$|High-risk melanomas {{may require}} <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment,</b> {{although}} attitudes to this vary in different countries. In the United States, most patients in otherwise good health will begin up {{to a year}} of high-dose interferon treatment, which has severe side effects, but may improve the patient's prognosis slightly. However, the British Association of Dermatologists guidelines on melanoma state that interferon is not recommended as a standard <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment</b> for melanoma. A 2011 meta-analysis showed that interferon could lengthen the time before a melanoma comes back but increased survival by only 3% at 5 years. The unpleasant side effects also greatly decrease quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Since {{testicular}} cancers can spread, {{patients are}} usually offered <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment</b> - {{in the form}} of chemotherapy or radiotherapy - to kill any cancerous cells that may exist outside of the affected testicle. The type of adjuvant therapy depends largely on the histology of the tumor (i.e. {{the size and shape of}} its cells under the microscope) and the stage of progression at the time of surgery (i.e. how far cells have 'escaped' from the testicle, invaded the surrounding tissue, or spread to the rest of the body). If the cancer is not particularly advanced, patients may be offered careful surveillance by periodic CT scans and blood tests, in place of <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment.</b>|$|E

Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment</b> if the necrosis rate is low.|$|E

25|$|Premedication with {{corticosteroids}} {{is recommended}} before each administration of docetaxel to reduce fluid retention and hypersensitive reactions. Other medications will often {{be given to}} aid pain management and other symptoms. The treatment of breast cancer with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide is enhanced by <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment</b> with docetaxel. Docetaxel is also used in combination with capecitabine, a DNA synthesis inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} an <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment</b> {{for most women}} who have {{undergone}} lumpectomy and for some women who have mastectomy surgery. In these cases the purpose of radiation {{is to reduce the}} chance that the cancer will recur locally (within the breast or axilla). Radiation therapy involves using high-energy X-rays or gamma rays that target a tumor or post surgery tumor site. This radiation is very effective in killing cancer cells that may remain after surgery or recur where the tumor was removed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{recommended}} in NICE guidance of June 2001 {{that it should}} be used for nonsmall cell lung cancer in patients unsuitable for curative treatment, and in first-line and second-line treatment of ovarian cancer. In September 2001, NICE recommended paclitaxel should be available for the treatment of advanced breast cancer after the failure of anthracyclic chemotherapy, but that its first-line use should be limited to clinical trials. In September 2006, NICE recommended paclitaxel should not be used in the <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment</b> of early node-positive breast cancer. In 2005, its use in the United States for the treatment of breast, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancers was approved by the FDA.|$|E

2500|$|As an <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment,</b> use of {{chemotherapy}} {{as an alternative}} to radiation therapy in the treatment of seminoma is increasing, because radiation therapy appears to have more significant long-term side effects (for example, internal scarring, increased risks of secondary malignancies, etc.). [...] Two doses, or occasionally a single dose of carboplatin, typically delivered three weeks apart, is proving to be a successful <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment,</b> with recurrence rates in the same ranges as those of radiotherapy. The concept of carboplatin as a single-dose therapy was developed by Tim Oliver, Professor of Medical Oncology at Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. However, very long-term data on the efficacy of adjuvant carboplatin in this setting do not exist.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{surgery is}} not {{commonly}} performed, the polycystic ovaries {{can be treated}} with a laparoscopic procedure called [...] "ovarian drilling" [...] (puncture of 4–10 small follicles with electrocautery, laser, or biopsy needles), which often results in either resumption of spontaneous ovulations or ovulations after <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment</b> with clomiphene or FSH. (Ovarian wedge resection is no longer used as much due to complications such as adhesions {{and the presence of}} frequently effective medications.) There are, however, concerns about the long-term effects of ovarian drilling on ovarian function.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of high quality {{evidence}} comparing a primary surgical approach to other modalities, decisions are based on consideration of factors such as adequate surgical exposure and anatomically favourable features for adequate resection, [...] post treatment function and quality of life. Such patient selection may enable them to avoid the morbidity of additional <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment.</b> In {{the absence of}} favourable surgical features the primary treatment of choice remains radiation with or without chemotherapy. Tumor characteristics which favour a non-surgical approach include invasion of {{the base of the}} tongue to the extent of requiring resection of 50% or more of the tongue, pterygoid muscle involvement, extension into the parapharyngeal fat abutting the carotid, involvement of the mandible or maxilla or invasion of the prevertebral space.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{clinical}} study {{took place at}} the Christie Hospital in 1971, and showed a convincing effect in advanced breast cancer, but nevertheless ICI's development programme came close to termination when it was reviewed in 1972. Tamoxifen's further development may have been bolstered by a second {{clinical study}} by Harold W.C. Ward [...] at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Ward's study showed a more definitive response to the drug at a higher dosage. Walpole also may have helped to convince the company to market tamoxifen for late stage breast cancer in 1973. He was also instrumental in funding V. Craig Jordan to work on tamoxifen. In 1972, ICI Pharmaceuticals Division abandoned development of tamoxifen for financial reasons. The drug was subsequently reinvented from a failed contraceptive, to become tamoxifen, the gold standard for the <b>adjuvant</b> <b>treatment</b> of breast cancer and the pioneering medicine for chemprevention for high risk women.
