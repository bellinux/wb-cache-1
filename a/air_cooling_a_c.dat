50|$|A misting fan {{is similar}} to a humidifier. A fan blows a fine mist of water into the air. If the air is not too humid, the water evaporates, {{absorbing}} heat from the air, allowing the misting fan to also work as <b>an</b> <b>air</b> <b>cooler.</b> <b>A</b> misting fan may be used outdoors, especially in a dry climate.

40|$|The {{evaporative}} cooling principle {{applies to all}} equipment that exchanges sensible heat for latent heat. Equipment of this type falls into two general categories: (1) equipment for heat rejection, such as cooling towers and (2) equipment for <b>air</b> <b>cooling.</b> <b>A</b> recent application of evaporative <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> equipment in <b>a</b> heat treat area at the John Deere Component Works in Waterloo, Iowa provided the required <b>cooling</b> at <b>an</b> operating cost of 30 % of a city water coil and 10 % of a chilled water system. At the same time, the evaporative cooing system had the lowest first cost. Evaporative cooling equipment {{can be used for}} such things as reducing the maximum ambient temperatures of large electrical motors, increasing the output of gas turbine engines and lowering the operating cost of air-cooled refrigeration equipment. In addition, direct/indirect {{evaporative cooling}} systems can be used for indoor comfort cooling with substantial reduction in operating cost...|$|R

40|$|Simulation {{work on an}} intermittent-duty, heat pipe-assisted, solar-operated aqua-ammonia {{absorption}} refrigerator is reported. The low-thermal mass collector is the integral evaporator of an acetone-copper heat pipe which delivers the collected energy isothermally to a distant generator. The shell-and-tube type generator receives the energy by vapour condensation. The condenser is <b>air</b> <b>cooled.</b> <b>A</b> separate R- 22 /steel heat-pipe system serves to cool the absorber tanks via a radiation/convection panel. Heat and mass balances are outlined on several units. The resulting equations are solved for day and night operation. It is concluded that both the initial solution (absorbent) concentration and the absorber temperature must be kept low for adequate ice production. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{very large}} number of {{industrial}} processes use <b>air</b> as <b>a</b> <b>cooling</b> medium, either directly or indirectly. Air conditioning is a very common process in which the air in a room, or a whole building, is cooled in order to maintain a comfortable environment for its occupants. Often the <b>air</b> has been <b>cooled</b> by chilled water or brine and the heat transferred to that medium is transported outside the building where, often, fan-driven water-to-air heat exchanging is again effected to reject the heat into the atmosphere. A common sight around, for example, power stations are the large waisted concrete towers that emit steam more or less constantly. These are, in part, using <b>air</b> <b>cooling</b> on <b>a</b> grand scale.|$|R

5000|$|When air rises, moist <b>air</b> <b>cools</b> at <b>a</b> {{lower rate}} than dry air. That is, {{for the same}} {{vertical}} movement, a parcel of moist air will be warmer than a parcel of dry air. This {{is because of the}} condensation of water vapor in the air parcel due to expansion <b>cooling.</b> <b>As</b> water vapor condenses, latent heat is released into the air parcel. Moist air has more water vapor than dry air, so more latent heat is released into the parcel of moist air as it rises. Dry air does not have as much water vapor, therefore dry <b>air</b> <b>cools</b> at <b>a</b> higher rate with vertical movement than moist air. As a result of the latent heat that is released during water vapor condensation, moist air has a relatively lower adiabatic lapse rate than dry air. This makes moist air generally less stable than dry air (see convective available potential energy CAPE). The dry adiabatic lapse rate (for unsaturated air) is [...] per 1,000 vertical feet (300 m). The moist adiabatic lapse rate varies from [...] per 1,000 vertical feet (300 m).|$|R
30|$|Various {{types of}} BTMS have been {{proposed}} by researchers in the past.

Under active <b>air</b> <b>cooling,</b> for <b>a</b> lower temperature rise, either a higher rate of air flow and a high frequent reversal of air flow are essential or the cooling has to be switched to liquid cooling [12, 13].|$|R
