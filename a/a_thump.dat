500|$|Belt {{returns home}} and has another flashback, as he lies {{in bed in}} some agony an astral {{presence}} leaves his body and flies out the window, heading into the sky.

500|$|Betty and Rita go to Diane Selwyn's {{apartment}} and break in {{when no one}} answers the door. In the bedroom, they find {{the body of a}} woman who has been dead for several days. Terrified, they return to their apartment, where Rita disguises herself with a blonde wig. She and Betty have sex that night. At 2 a.m., Rita insists they go to a theater called Club Silencio. The emcee explains in different languages that everything is an illusion; Rebekah Del Rio comes on stage and begins singing the Roy Orbison song [...] "Crying" [...] in Spanish, then collapses while her vocals continue - her performance was a recording. Betty finds a blue box in her purse that matches Rita's key. Upon returning to the apartment, Rita retrieves the key and finds that Betty has disappeared. Rita unlocks the box, and it falls to the floor with <b>a</b> <b>thump.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "committed an unforgivable foul in {{the penalty}} box; the harsh blast of the referee's whistle, his finger {{pointing}} {{to one of}} the most calamitous places in the purgatory of this life; the penalty spot. The heavy odour of death hung over the fateful spot: did you not hear a crowd of thousands suddenly become dumb mutes, did you not see the players standing in a half circle as if they were at a graveside... Everyone holding his breath. I have always believed that Roose grew to his full height as a man in the purgatorial crisis of a penalty, drying off the clay around his feet, washing away the dross which entered his character with the gold... Arthur's sword against the bare fist. Then came the signal; the ball travelled like a bolt from the foot of the penalty taking forward, and in the blink of an eyelid, revolution, <b>a</b> <b>thump,</b> and the ball landed in the heather and gorse of the Buarth." ...|$|E

2500|$|... {{a routine}} dive in the Baltic {{turned into an}} {{emergency}} when the boat sank out of control. She hit the bottom stern-first with <b>a</b> <b>thump.</b> The depth gauge read the submarine was in severe difficulty, having taken on tons of water, poisonous chlorine gas was leaking from the batteries {{and there was the}} danger of an explosion. U-557 had also suffered her first death; a mechanic sustained fatal head injuries in the after torpedo room. A human chain of sailors was formed, passing buckets of sea water to each other, in an attempt to shift some of the weight from the stern to the bow. After many hour's toil, the boat pivoted so that the bow hit the bottom. But the sheer weight of water (about 40 tons) prevented U-557 from reaching the surface. The boat, having exhausted its supply of compressed air, stayed on the sea bed. The crew, {{under the direction of the}} Chief Engineer, rocked the boat by moving rapidly from stern to bow and back again. The submarine eventually worked herself free. After 20 hours, U-557 surfaced and sailed on to Kiel.|$|E
