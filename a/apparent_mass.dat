Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed the usual subunit pattern of a bacterial F 1 Fo ATPase. The polypeptides with <b>apparent</b> molecular <b>masses</b> of 56, 52, 35, 16. 5, and 6. 5 kDa {{were identified as}} the α, β, γ, ɛ, and c subunits, respectively, by N-terminal protein sequencing and comparison with the sequences of the corresponding subunits from the Na+-translocating ATPase of Propionigenium modestum. Two overlapping sequences were obtained for the polypeptides moving with an <b>apparent</b> molecular <b>mass</b> of 22 kDa (tentatively assigned as b and δ subunits). No sequence could be determined for the putative a subunit (<b>apparent</b> molecular <b>mass,</b> 25 kDa).

The ATPase was inhibited by dicyclohexyl carbodiimide, and Na+ ions protected the enzyme from this inhibition. The ATPase was specifically activated by Na+ or Li+ ions, markedly at high pH. After reconstitution into proteoliposomes, the enzyme catalyzed the ATP-dependent transport of Na+, Li+, or H+. Proton transport was specifically inhibited by Na+ or Li+ ions, indicating a competition between these alkali ions and protons for binding and translocation across the membrane.

40|$|The {{propagation}} {{speeds of}} linear waves in gas-solid suspensions depend strongly on the solids volume fraction and the wave frequency. The latter {{is due to}} gas-solid momentum transfer and allows a simple test on filtered gas-solid momentum transfer models. Such models may predict linear wave propagation speeds different from those obtained with the nonfiltered model at wave frequencies higher than the filter frequency, but not at wave frequencies lower than the filter frequency. For the filtered drag, an effective drag coefficient approach is shown to alter the linear wave propagation speeds in the entire wave frequency range, independent of the applied effective drag coefficient. Furthermore, as the effective drag coefficient decreases, the high frequency linear wave propagation speeds are gradually introduced at lower wave frequencies. For the filtered momentum transfer due to {{the correlation between the}} solids volume fraction and the gas phase pressure gradient, the behavior of an <b>apparent</b> added <b>mass</b> closure model and an apparent history force closure model are investigated. An <b>apparent</b> added <b>mass</b> introduces the filter frequency linear wave propagation speeds to frequencies higher than the filter frequency. The linear wave propagation speeds for wave frequencies lower than the filter frequency are, however, not altered. Furthermore, an <b>apparent</b> added <b>mass</b> introduces no intrinsic wave frequency dependence in the linear wave propagation speeds, in agreement with its source term in the non-filtered model. Hence, the frequency dependence of the linear wave propagation speeds at frequencies lower than the filter frequency is still to be provided by a drag type term. As such, the behavior introduced by an <b>apparent</b> added <b>mass</b> is acceptable for filtered models. Also, to a certain extent, an <b>apparent</b> added <b>mass</b> can restore the linear wave propagation speed behavior at wave frequencies lower than the filter frequency altered by an effective drag coefficient approach. The reformulation of the <b>apparent</b> added <b>mass</b> in terms of an apparent distribution of the filtered gas phase pressure gradient over the phases and an apparent (effective) drag force is investigated. An apparent history force introduces intrinsic wave frequency dependence in the linear wave propagation speeds and alters the latter from the low wave frequencies on. As such, the behavior introduced by an apparent history force is unacceptable for filtered models, (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The 600 kDa {{neutrophil}} membrane neutral protease, {{which had}} been shown to generate bioactive peptides from the acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein, has now {{been shown to have}} fibrinogenolytic activity that is distinct from fibrinogenolysis by plasmin and neutrophil lysosomal enzymes. This protease gradually reduces the <b>apparent</b> molecular <b>mass</b> of fibrinogen (340 kDa) to non-clottable products and generates terminal products with <b>apparent</b> molecular <b>mass</b> values of 270 kDa, 200 kDa, 100 kDa and less than 40 kDa through cleavage of all three of the constituent chains. Characteristics of fibrinogenolysis by this neutrophil protease are cleavage of the bond between amino acids valine and glutamic acid at positions 21 and 22 respectively from the N-terminus of the A alpha chain to release an A alpha 1 - 21 peptide, digestion of the B beta chain at positions within the C-terminus, and proteolysis of the bond between amino acids isoleucine and glycine at positions 394 and 395 respectively from the N-terminus of the gamma chain. This generates products that lack anticoagulant activity. The thrombin clotting time of the product with an <b>apparent</b> molecular <b>mass</b> of 330 kDa was prolonged, although clot formation was still observed. Loss of coagulability and inability to clot was found with further degradation of fibrinogen to an <b>apparent</b> molecular <b>mass</b> of 290 kDa.
