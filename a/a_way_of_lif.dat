40|$|Esta dissertaÃÃo Ã um estudo sociolÃgico realizado com jovens acometidas por {{anorexia}} nervosa, pacientes de um serviÃo mÃdico especializado no tratamento de transtornos alimentares. Com base no depoimento de trÃs jovens, pretende-se apresentar as contradiÃÃes vivenciadas por elas no curso do tratamento mÃdico. Neste estudo investigo como as anorÃxicas produzem um corpo considerado saudÃvel pela ciÃncia mÃdica. Para tanto, conto como principal interlocutor Michel Foucault. A partir de seu conceito de resistÃncia pretendo perceber como as pacientes anorÃxicas produzem suas subjetividades ao negociarem com os saberes mÃdicos e midiÃticos de saÃde, bem-estar e beleza. Ã ainda interesse deste trabalho compreender como produÃÃo da identidade de gÃnero aparece no processo de renÃncia a um corpo prÃ-pÃbere para assumir um corpo sexualmente maduro. Baseada numa abordagem qualitativa e, especificamente, na prÃtica de pesquisa de campo foi possÃvel observar que a experiÃncia anorÃxica Ã essencialmente paradoxal. A produÃÃo do corpo anorÃxico em corpo saudÃvel exige recomposiÃÃes entre o desejo de permanecer excessivamente magra e o desejo de ficar boa. A partir dos depoimentos das anorÃxicas Ã possÃvel afirmar que o transtorno Ã uma manifestaÃÃo do desacordo entre a tentativa dessas garotas em construir um sentimento de autonomia ao controlar os impulsos alimentares e a impossibilidade de mediar a multiplicidade de discursos sobre saÃde, beleza e dietas ou de eleger apenas um desses discursos como modo de vidaThis dissertation is a sociological study {{about young}} girls stricken with nervous anorexia attending a medical service {{that specializes in}} the treatment of alimentary disorders. Based on cases related by three youths, this work aims at presenting conflicting aspects that those patients had to go through during their medical treatment. It is investigated how anorexic subjects display a body that is considered healthy by medical science. To this end it was engaged as main support the work of Michel Foucault. Based on his concept of resistance, it is sought to unveil how anorexic patients produce their subjectivities in dealing with medical knowledge and information obtained from the media about health, well being and beauty. In the same fashion, this works is interested in discovering how production of genre identity appears in the process of renouncing a prepubescent body in order to adopt a sexually mature body. Based on a qualitative approach, especially from data obtained from field research, it was possible to observe that the anorexic experience is essentially a paradoxical feature. The production of an anorexic body into a healthy body requires rearrangements going from the will of keeping an excessively slender figure and the desire of obtaining cure. Based on statements from anorexic subjects it is possible to assert that the disorder is both a manisfestation of disagreement presented by these girls in their attempt at building a feeling of autonomy by reining their feeding drives and the plentiful offer of discourses about health, beauty and diets in order to elect just one of these discourses as their guidance to <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>lif...</b>|$|E

40|$|Sulphate-reducing {{bacteria}} (SRB) are anaerobic microorganisms {{that use}} sulphate as a terminal electron acceptor in, for example, {{the degradation of}} organic compounds. They are ubiquitous in anoxic habitats, where they {{have an important role}} in both the sulphur and carbon cycles. SRB can cause a serious problem for industries, such as the offshore oil industry, because of the production of sulphide, which is highly reactive, corrosive and toxic. However, these organisms can also be beneficial by removing sulphate and heavy metals from waste streams. Although SRB have been studied for more than a century, it is only with the recent emergence of new molecular biological and genomic techniques that we have begun to obtain detailed information on their <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>lif...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{heritage}} of industrialized social housing built in Italy between {{the sixties and}} the eighties {{of the twentieth century}} is a very significant episode in the construction history. It {{is one of the most}} complete expression of the Italian version of the building industrialization process. The social housing built in Turin between 1963 and 1980, the first to be affected by the use of construction systems for heavy prefabrication, is particularly interesting. The experimentalism without experimentation, which characterizes the initial phase of the application and adaptation of patents of importation, sometimes already technologically obsolete, gradually gives way to more mature technical experiences, related to processes of industrialization of the whole yard, to which correspond residential solutions of higher quality. The paper aims to highlight the mutual influence between industrialized construction systems, organization of the yard, architectural and typological solutions and evolution <b>of</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>lif...</b>|$|R
40|$|Against {{the common}} view that a European {{identity}} is a functional precondition for legitimate EU governance, this article argues that conceptual {{weaknesses of the}} term ‘collective identity’ {{have led to a}} confusion of several analytic dimensions of ‘identity’ and to an overestimation of strong forms of collective identity. Insights provided by analytic philosophy will be introduced in order to redefine and differentiate ‘collective identity’. The ways in which people refer to themselves as members of we-groups will be outlined and illustrated in order to contribute to an innovative model of the problem and therefore the policy-related formation of collective identities. The article concludes that a strong European identity is not a functional precondition for legitimate everyday democratic governance in the EU. Only in extraordinary situations and in order to institutionalize integration in ethically sensitive policy fields is it necessary that EU citizens discursively agree on an ethical self-understanding <b>of</b> their <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>lif...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this Master Thesis in {{combined}} Philosophy and Psychology is “The Phenomenology of Meditation – a philosophical and psychological perspective on meditation”. As the title says the most important theoretical frame is the Phenomenology, but it also contains an important existentialistic approach to the topic. The phenomenological and existential traditions of western philosophy and psychology are however – which is a key effort of this work - integrated with Buddhist psychology and Philosophy. This integration {{is seen in the}} theoretical approach {{as well as in the}} qualitative empirical data which is delivered by four qualitative research interviews with experienced meditators. The theory as well as the empirical data is used to describe “the way to the beneficial meditational practice”: 1) Guidance from an experiences teacher, 2) An analytical understanding of the what happens in the mind during the practice as well as an understanding of the goal of the practice and what is required to achieve it, 3) A regular practice and a healthy and balanced daily life according to sleep, food, intoxication and domestic and social circumstances, 4) An ethical <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>lif...</b>|$|R
