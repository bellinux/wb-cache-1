5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length of the choir, past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle of the choir contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an <b>access</b> <b>door</b> for the laity.|$|E
5|$|The {{freighter}} {{features a}} large, upward-opening main deck cargo door on its forward port-side fuselage. Adjacent to this large cargo door is an exit door {{used by the}} pilots. All other emergency exits are omitted, and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available. The main deck cargo hold has a smooth fiberglass lining, and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding <b>access</b> <b>door</b> serves as a restraint wall next to the flight deck. Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom-fitted cargo modules. When equipped for extended-range transatlantic operations, UPS's 757-200PFs feature an upgraded auxiliary power unit, additional cargo bay fire suppression equipment, enhanced avionics, and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold. Total production for the 757-200PF totaled 80 aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Check-in {{counters}} {{are divided}} into 8 rows located in 4 islands, each row identified by the letters S – Z. Boarding gates are located in 5 piers, indicated by the letters J and K for domestic flights, and L, P and Q for international flights. Piers J, K and L are connected directly to the main terminal building, while Piers P and Q are accessible via the skybridge. Piers K and L are physically the same pier and share the same gates, but with waiting lounges on different levels (Level 1A for K and Level 2 for L). For international flights, the <b>access</b> <b>door</b> from Pier K is sealed off, while for domestic flights, the <b>access</b> <b>door</b> from Pier L is sealed off instead.|$|E

25|$|The M3 was {{the larger}} and longer {{counterpart}} to the M2 Half Track Car. The M2 was {{originally intended to}} function as an artillery tractor. The M3 had a single <b>access</b> <b>door</b> in the rear and seating for a 12-man rifle squad. Five seats were arranged on each side {{in the rear of}} the vehicle and three seats inside the cab.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the state}} of the timbers, {{especially}} the keel, and the fact that a hole had been cut through the hull in the 1950s for an <b>access</b> <b>door,</b> made this difficult. The Cutty Sark Trust said that less than five percent of the original fabric was lost in the fire, as the decks which were destroyed were additions not present at the original building.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{powered by a}} version of the de Havilland Gipsy Major 4-cylinder inverted inline engine, licence built by Alfa Romeo, which produced 90kW (120hp) and drove a two blade propeller. Aft of the pilot's side windows, two further rectangular windows on each side lit the passenger cabin, the forward one on the port side incorporated into a cabin <b>access</b> <b>door.</b> The Z.1010 had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with enclosed, faired mainwheels on faired half axles mounted on the lower fuselage. Tall, faired shock absorbing legs ran from wheels to wing roots.|$|E

25|$|Constructed on a hillside, the Sky House is a {{platform}} supported on four concrete panels with a hyperbolic paraboloid shell roof. It {{is a single}} space divided by storage units with the kitchen and bathroom on the outer edge. These latter two were designed {{so that they could}} be moved to suit the use of the house - and indeed they have been moved and/or adjusted about seven times over the course of fifty years. At one point a small children's room was attached to the bottom of main floor with a small child-sized <b>access</b> <b>door</b> between the two rooms.|$|E
25|$|The pilot's {{compartment}} had two side-by-side {{seats and}} dual controls, {{all of which}} being contained within a large Plexiglas nose section. Initially, the cockpit would be outfitted with internal telephone systems that allowed for communication between the pilots of the glider and tug aircraft while connected; however, this was replaced on later-built models by radio sets instead, which {{had the advantage of}} being able to maintain contact after detaching. Aft of the pilot's compartment was the freight loading door on the port side; the hinged door could also be used as a loading ramp. The main compartment could accommodate 15 troops on benches along the sides with another <b>access</b> <b>door</b> on the starboard side. Supply containers could also be fitted under the centre-section of the wing, three on each side.|$|E
25|$|The Gazelle {{is capable}} of {{transporting}} up to five passengers and up to 1,320 pounds of cargo on the underside cargo hook, or alternatively up to 1,100 pounds of freight in 80 cubic feet of internal space {{in the rear of}} the cabin. Armed variants would carry up to four HOT (Haut subsonique Optiquement Téléguidé Tiré d'un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin. Various optional equipment can be installed upon the Gazelle, such as fittings for engine noise suppression, 53 gallon ferry tanks, a rescue winch capable of lifting up to 390 pounds, emergency flotation gear, particle filter, high landing skids, cabin heater, adjustable landing lights, and engine anti-icing systems. While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type's entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well. The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator Vought Helicopters at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles. Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external baggage <b>access</b> <b>door</b> mounted beneath the main cabin.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} bunker, {{there is also}} a network of storage {{facilities}} that extend under the railway workshop. Sometime between 1977 and 1978 the steel <b>access</b> <b>doors</b> were fitted with locks (Railway SL type). The steel <b>access</b> <b>doors</b> were bolted into the side of a stormwater drain which runs along the old RTA building in Chullora, then under the Hume Hwy and eventually under the rail workshop. It has also been alleged that a tunnel approximately four miles long connects this complex with the Bankstown Bunker.|$|R

500|$|The {{main part}} Ones story {{takes place at}} a Japanese high school, though little is shown except for Kōhei's classroom, the cafeteria, and {{a little of the}} {{surrounding}} area. The main school building is three-stories, and the roof is accessible, albeit with a sign on the roof's <b>access</b> <b>door</b> saying [...] "No Entry", but the door is never locked regardless. Adjacent to the main building is another which houses club rooms. The school borders a forest on one side with a chain link fence. Beyond the forest is a park with a fountain and a flight of stairs on a hill. Other than the school, the shopping district in town and the usual path Kōhei takes to school are shown, but otherwise the only other place depicted is Kōhei's two-story house.|$|E

2500|$|Two DL-109s {{received}} a special rebuild {{to make them}} able to [...] "MU" [...] (multiple unit) {{with more than one}} other unit; originally, they only had the MU cables on the rear, meaning that only a back-to-back pair could be made. The two special units had cables put on the front so they could be used to make a 3-unit set for longer trains. [...] One of the units had the nose rebuilt with an <b>access</b> <b>door,</b> raising the headlight and changing the contour of the nose.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978 {{the revised}} Series 2 (or S2) Esprit was introduced.

S2 Esprits also had [...] Speedline alloy wheels designed by Lotus. Other changes included relocating the battery from above {{the right side}} fuel tank under the rear quarter window {{to the rear of}} the car, adding an <b>access</b> <b>door</b> to the engine cover, installing wider seats and replacing the Veglia instrument cluster with individual gauges made by Smiths and a new style of illuminated dashboard switches.|$|E
