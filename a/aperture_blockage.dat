40|$|In recent years, {{the compact}} range {{has become very}} popular for {{measuring}} Radar Cross Section (RCS) and antenna patterns. The compact range, in fact, offers several advantages due to reduced size, a controlled environment, and privacy. On the other hand, it has some problems of its own, which must be solved properly {{in order to achieve}} high quality measurement results. For example, diffraction from the edges of the main reflector corrupts the plane wave in the target zone and creates spurious scattering centers in RCS measurements. While diffraction can be minimized by using rolled edges, the field of an offset single reflector compact range is corrupted by three other errors: the taper of the reflected field, the cross polarization introduced by the tilt of the feed and the <b>aperture</b> <b>blockage</b> introduced by the feed itself. These three errors can be eliminated by the use of a subreflector system. A properly designed subreflector system offers very little <b>aperture</b> <b>blockage,</b> no cross-polarization introduced and a minimization of the taper of the reflected field. A Gregorian configuration has been adopted in order to enclose the feed and the ellipsoidal subreflector in a lower chamber, which is isolated by absorbers from the upper chamber, where the main parabolic reflector and the target zone are enclosed. The coupling between the two rooms is performed through a coupling aperture. The first cut design for such a subreflector system is performed through Geometrical Optics ray tracing techniques (GO), and is greatly simplified by the use of the concept of the central ray introduced by Dragone. The purpose of the GO design is to establish the basic dimensions of the main reflector and subreflector, the size of the primary and secondary illuminating surfaces, the tilt angles of the subreflector and feed, and estimate the feed beamwidth. At the same time, the shape of the coupling aperture is initially determined...|$|E

A simplex search method is used in the study for optimizing the performance index. The sidelobe level (SLL) constraint has been incorporated using the penalty function method. The method is applied to circular monopulse aperture distribution with circular blockage to obtain maximum directivity factor (DF) in the sum mode and maximum angular sensitivity factor (ASF) in the difference mode, with sidelobe level constraint. The effect of blockage on the maximum directivity and maximum angular sensitivity is studied for various sidelobe level constraints...|$|E

Previous work [1]-[7] has demonstrated a variety of microstrip reflect arrays, using different elements at a range of frequencies. In this paper we describe the use of crossed dipoles as reflecting elements in a microstrip reflectarray. Theory of the solution will be described, with experimental results for a 6 " square reflectarray operating at 28 GHz. The performance of crossed dipoles will be directly compared with microstrip patches, in terms of bandwidth and loss.

This research was prompted by the proposed concept of overlaying a flat printed reflectarray on the surface of a spacecraft solar panel. Combining solar panel and antenna apertures in this way would lead to a reduction in weight and simpler deployment, with some loss of flexibility in independently pointing the solar panel and the antenna.

40|$|In this {{continuation}} of our {{paper in the}} last conference proceedings 1, we consider further developments {{in the area of}} Impulse Radiating Antennas (IRAs). First, we consider definitions of gain in the time domain, which are important for optimizing the performance of IRAs. A reasonable definition of gain must be equally valid in transmission as in reception. Such a definition leads naturally to a transient radar equation, which we discuss. Next, we consider how to optimize the feed impedance in a reflector IRA. If we use our simple model of IRA performance, the gain of an IRA is always better at lower impedances. But this implies larger feeds with more <b>aperture</b> <b>blockage.</b> To resolve this, we refine our simple model to account for feed blockage. We also consider the radiation pattern of IRAs, and we provide simple calculations. Finally, we provide a sample experiment which confirms our theory of IRA operation. I.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{holographic}} antennas are investigated as an alternate technology to reflectors and microstrip phased arrays {{for use in}} Ka-band applications. These antennas combine the advantages of low profile printed technology with an unconstrained feed to avoid excessive losses associated with conventional phased array feeds. The main purpose of this work is to apply optical holography theory at microwave frequencies {{in the design of}} Ka-band holographic antennas. As with optical frequencies, the interference pattern between two waves is calculated in order to generate the hologram. The simplest pattern is a zone plate representing the destructive pattern which can be easily reproduced using microstrip technology. To fabricate the antennas, conductor strips are etched on a dielectric material where the two interfering waves are 180 ° out of phase. The hologram is then illuminated by the reference wave to reconstruct the desired antenna pattern. An interesting feature of these antennas is that they can be designed so that the feed is in the same plane as the holographic plate, making the structures almost flat and preventing feed <b>aperture</b> <b>blockage.</b> Measurements of various prototypes validated the holographic concept and have shown that the efficiency of the proposed holographic antennas is comparable to that of Ka-band passive phased arrays with conventional microstrip feeds. Also, based on the experimental results, some design guidelines are established along with a methodology for enhancing the efficiency. The efficiency-improvement methods include multi-layer structures, feed horns, dipole-holograms, diamond-shaped holograms, and many others...|$|E
40|$|Beamforming of {{ultrasound}} {{signals in}} the presence of clutter, or partial <b>aperture</b> <b>blockage</b> by an acoustic obstacle can lead to reduced visibility of the structures of interest and diminished diagnostic value of the resulting image. We propose new beamforming methods to recover the quality of ultrasound images under such challenging conditions. Of special interest are the signals from large apertures, which are more susceptible to partial blockage, and from commercial matrix arrays that suffer from low sensitivity due to inherent design/hardware limitations. A coherence-based beamforming method designed for suppressing the in vivo clutter, namely Short-lag Spatial Coherence (SLSC) Imaging, is first implemented on a 1 -D array to enhance visualization of liver vasculature in 17 human subjects. The SLSC images show statistically significant improvements in vessel contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio over the matched B-mode images. The concept of SLSC imaging is then extended to matrix arrays, and the first in vivo demonstration of volumetric SLSC imaging on a clinical ultrasound system is presented. The effective suppression of clutter via volumetric SLSC imaging indicates it could potentially compensate for the low sensitivity associated with most commercial matrix arrays. The rest of the dissertation assesses image degradation due to elements blocked by ribs in a transthoracic scan. A method to detect the blocked elements is demonstrated using simulated, ex vivo, and in vivo data from the fully-sampled 2 -D apertures. The results show that turning off the blocked elements both reduces the near-field clutter and improves visibility of anechoic/hypoechoic targets. Most importantly, the ex vivo data from large synthetic apertures indicates that the adaptive weighing of the non-blocked elements can recover the loss of focus quality due to periodic rib structure, allowing large apertures to realize their full resolution potential in transthoracic ultrasound.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 83 - 84) The {{purpose of}} this study is to investigate the radiation pattern distribution produced by scattering from an electrically intermediate sized parabolic reflector antenna. This investigation has been prompted by the fact that very little has been written on pattern prediction for this size class of antennas. Three methods are employed for the actual numerical calculation of the patterns. These methods are compared by considering the deviations from existing radiation patterns obtained experimentally. Two methods are based on a prior knowledge of the field distribution over the aperture; the scattered field in the far zone being expressible in terms of the integrals of the field vectors over the aperture surface. This is known in the literature as the aperture-field method. The problem is first attacked by assuming a uniformly illuminated circular aperture. Secondly, the aperture fields are modified in accordance with the natural or "space" tapering of these fields due to the parabolic reflector. The third method, termed as the induced surface current method, computes scattered fields by integration of surface currents induced on the reflector by known incident fields from sources located at the focus of the parabola. Due to the complexity of the integrands generated by the latter two techniques, it was necessary to numerically integrate the expressions to arrive at the far zone field values. Included in all three models is the effects of <b>aperture</b> <b>blockage</b> due to the feed assembly. All the techniques employ the assumption of a "point source" feed; the simplest case being the superposition of electric and magnetic dipoles forming a "Huygen's source" illumination. These three methods and their implementation comprise Sections 2. 0 and 3. 0. In Section 4. 0 the accuracy achieved by these methods is compared to measured data. Lastly, the techniques for achieving greater accuracy in the results for the scattered field values is discussed in Section 5. 0...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{experiments in}} Microwave Holography using the 26 m radio telescope at the Mount Pleasant Observatory, {{and the development}} of data processing methods to overcome a major limitation of traditional holographic measurements. Microwave Holography is a fast and effective technique for measuring the surface profile of reflector antennas. It requires measurement of the amplitude and phase of the antenna's far field radiation pattern. The Fourier transform relationship of the far field pattern to the aperture current function is used to estimate the aperture phase profile, which can be related directly to the surface profile. Using an unmodulated 12. 7 GHz carrier signal transmitted by the AUSSAT- 1 geostationary satellite, the 26 m diameter surface was measured to an accuracy of ± 53 μm with a resolution of 0. 6 m. Using a beacon signal, weaker by 20 dB, gave a comparable accuracy of ± 64 μm. Each map took about 4 hours to record. In practice {{only a small part of}} the complete radiation pattern can be measured, so information about high spatial frequencies in the aperture is lost. This causes detailed structure in the surface error map to be smoothed out. Most large reflectors are constructed with panels, and misaligned panels give discontinuities in surface error which cannot be resolved. This can lead to incorrect assessment of panel positions. Significant improvement can be obtained by recognizing at the outset that the reflector surface is not smooth and continuous, but a collection of individual rigid panels. The Method of Successive Projections is an algorithm, with a simple geometrical interpretation, which allows information about the panel boundaries to be readily incorporated into the data reduction process. The algorithm is straight-forward to apply and is very flexible: <b>aperture</b> <b>blockage</b> effects do not disturb its operation, and panel distortions can be included in the analysis with minimal extra effort. Good results may be achieved while minimizing measurement time. This is an important consideration for high-performance antennas with a busy operating programme...|$|E
