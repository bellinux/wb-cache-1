40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Durum wheat cultivars for North-Eastern Oregon {{have to be}} {{competitive}} {{in terms of their}} yield potential with soft white winter wheat cultivars and meet strict quality requirements of the milling industry. Combining the high yield potential of fall planted durum wheat cultivars which have an acceptable level of winter hardiness with the good quality characteristics of the spring types through winter by spring crosses is believed to be an appropriate strategy. However, to be efficient, quality traits of the breeding lines and the nature of their inheritance must be evaluated early in the breeding process. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the nature of genetic variability involving two main quality traits, namely gluten strength and carotenoid pigment content. These traits are measured by the SDS sedimentation test and by spectrophotometric analysis of pigment extracts, respectively. Total genetic variability involving grain yield, kernel weight and protein content was also studied. Combining ability analysis of a 4 x 4 diallel cross using two winter and two spring parents was performed according to Griffing's (1956) Model 1, method 1. Both additive and non <b>additive</b> <b>type</b> gene action controlled all traits studied. Non <b>additive</b> <b>type</b> gene action was particularly important for grain yield and kernel weight suggesting that selection for these traits should be delayed until later generations (F 5 or F 6). Protein and pigment content were controlled primarily by genes functioning in an additive manner although they are also influenced by significant non <b>additive</b> <b>type</b> gene action. Reciprocal effects were significant for pigment content suggesting that some maternal effect might be involved. The predominance of <b>additive</b> <b>type</b> gene action for sedimentation volume suggests that this trait can be used to screen early generation material (F 2, F 3) for gluten strength. F 2 populations generated from the diallel cross were compared in terms of their genetic variances, potential transgressive segregation and were used to investigate the possible associations between the traits measured. Winter by spring crosses were usually characterized by an enhanced genetic variability for yield and gluten strength. Transgressive segregation for sedimentation volume was present in these crosses. Protein content was negatively associated with grain yield. No relationship between gluten strength and grain yield was observed. Gluten strength did not appear to be associated with total protein content of the grain. Sedimentation volume varied greatly, even in populations with low variability in protein content. Consequently, selection on the basis of sedimentation volume per se would not be result in selecting inadvertently agronomically unsuitable types...|$|E

S(, 1) families from each cycle were crossed to a male-sterile inbred line tester (KS 56). Evaluation of S(, 1) 2 ̆ 7 s and their testcrosses was made in a 2 -year experiment at Mead, Nebraska. The objective was to investigate {{recurrent selection}} in improving sorghum populations through intrapopulation (S(, 1)) and interpopulation (S(, 1) x tester) methods. ^ Realized and expected gains in yield manifested the superiority of S(, 1) family testing over S(, 1) testcrossing. The superiority of S(, 1) family testing was {{an indication of the}} prevalence of additive and <b>additive</b> x <b>additive</b> <b>types</b> of gene action in sorghum populations. Improvement of yield was accompanied by late maturity, which might limit the genetic gains from recurrent selection, especially in areas where testing is affected by late stresses (e. g. cold or dry conditions). ^ Phenotypic and genetic correlations between the two selection methods indicated a strong relationship which could have predictive value due to high r(2 ̆ 72) -values associated with them; the highly significant homogeneous correlations between the two testing methods at both cycles of selection for yield are also evidence of the importance of additive and <b>additive</b> x <b>additive</b> <b>types</b> of gene actions. ^ The phenotypic and genetic correlations among characters indicated the positive association of yield with bloom and height and a negative correlation of yield with oil and protein. The heterogeneity in correlations between yield and bloom in different cycles of selection indicated the effectiveness of cyclic recombination in breaking linkage between these characters. Consequently, the possibility exists through selection indices to improve the yield of sorghum populations coupled with controlled maturity. ...|$|R
