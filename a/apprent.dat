40|$|Experimental {{methods and}} {{findings}} in human problem-solving using on-line and off-line computer systems are reviewed. For historical and technicul reusons the field o f applied mae-computer commu-nication {{has not been}} the subject of extensive scientific study. The advent of time-sharing systems in the last decade produced an initial body o f empirical data from user statistics and experimental studies comparing time-sharing with batch-processing. This body of data is reviewed for its implications to the controversy over batch and time-sharing systems and to the understanding of human behavior in the mancomputer setting. Although the available experimental data are meager and tentative. it is already <b>apprent</b> that behavioral principles of human problem-solving and learning theory can account for many of the trends observed. In turn. the theories can be enriched by new leads stemming from studies of man-computer dialog. A plea is made for interdisciplinary cross-fertilization between behav-ioral and computer sciences to bridge the humanistic lag in mancomputer communication...|$|E
40|$|John Ford is {{best known}} as the author of the controversialTis Pity She’s a Whore, but his other plays are also full of interest. The Lady’s Trial, his last play, encapsulates the final {{development}} of his own unique theatrical aesthetic while looking back to the drama of his youth, most notably Othello, whose story is here rewritten. In Ford’s version, the supposedly wronged husband, the victorious general Auria, does not simply take the word of his friend, the well-intentioned but overly suspicious Aurelio, that his wife, Spinella, is unfaithful: instead he does what Othello apparently never even thinks of doing, and conducts a rational, public sifting of the <b>apprent</b> evidence, {{at the end of which}} Spinella is triumphantly cleared. In combining this story of public vindication with his distinctive dramatic style of delicate reticence, Ford offers a powerful exploration of both the capabilities and the limitations of language and its role in human relationships. This first scholarly edition of this undeservedly neglected play situates it in its dramatic and historical contexts and helps elucidate Ford’s understated, allusive style. </p...|$|E
40|$|Vegetation {{is a major}} {{environmental}} factor influencing habitat selection in bird species. High resolution mapping of vegetation cover is essential to model the distribution of populations and improve the management of breeding habitats. However, the task is challenging for grassland birds because microhabitat variations relevant at the territory scale cannot be measured continuously over large areas to delineate areas of higher suitability. Remote sensing may help to circumvent this problem. We addressed this issue by using two methods. We (i) mapped the continuous Ellenberg index of moisture and (ii) identified 5 vegetation classes distributed accross the wetness gradient. These two methods produced consistent output maps, but they also provided more information about vegetation structure, and possibly trophic resources. In spite of the <b>apprent</b> uniformity of meadows, our data show that birds do not settle randomly along the moisture and vegetation gradients. Overall birds tend to avoid the driest vegetation classes, i. e. the highest grounds. Thus, vegetation maps based on remote sensing could be valuable tools to study habitat selection and niche partition in grassland bird communities. It is also a valuable tool for conservation and habitat management...|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is the result}} of over a year of ongoing Empirical Research at the University of Southampton in the UK on Security Issues in Agile. The research was conducted on the most publicised and predominant security related proposals and solutions offered by practitioners of Security and Agile which attempted to add best practices of security into the most popular flavors of Agile methods such as Scrum, XP, FDD, and TDD. The presentation will outline the most predominant and discussed security issues in Agile and elaborate on the need for each proposal and the <b>apprent</b> level of concensus reached on the topic by researchers as well as practitioners working in the field. The presentation will include the major points of discussion and results from all aspects of the practice and theory. The attendees will learn the most up-to-date information about how to move Agile forward on critical projects involving security and how to achieve a consistent Secure Development Lifecycle for their respective companies. This information was also presented in the Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement Conference (ESEM 2010) as a representative sample of the state of security practice in Agile in Bolzano-Bozen, Italy. The presentation will be followed by a short 5 minute Q/A in order to give a change for the audience to ask question...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss a}} number of ethical {{considerations}} related to genome research and results of human genome project’s efforts. It shall become <b>apprent</b> that there are ethical risks and also numerous questions which are open and yet to be defined by those reputable teams, especially concerning the use of genetic enhancement and genetic enrichment of particular human being in comparison with other human being given differences in economics position in society. Key Words: human genome, genetic enhancement, genetic enrichment, risk, ethical issues. Despite {{a number of}} widespreading articles [2][3] considering the completion and possible advantages of human genome project (HGP), there are only few articles which focus on ethical concerns related to HGP, see article [1] for instance. These ethical concerns include germline intervention and also enhancement engineering, for example. “Germline interventions involve more significant ethical concerns, because risks will extend across generations, magnifying the impact of unforeseen consequences. While these greater risks call for added caution, most ethicists would not object {{to the use of}} germline interventions for the treatment of serious disease if we reach the point where such interventions could be performed safely and effectively. ”[1] “Enhancement engineering is widely regarded as both scientifically and ethically problematic. From a scientific standpoint, it is unlikely that we will soon be able to enhance normally functioning genes without risking grave side effects. ”[1] Furthermore, one should keep in mind that Genome Project was actually a sequence o...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed that}} the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of a Brassica campestris callus culture had undergone extensive rearrangements (i. e. large inversions and a duplication) relative to DNA of the control plant [54]. In this study we observed that after continued growth, the mtDNA of this culture continues to change, with rearranged forms amplifying and diminishing to varying proportions. Strikingly similar changes were detected in the mtDNA profiles {{of a variety of}} other long- and short-term callus and cell suspension lines. However, the proportions of parental (‘unrearranged’) and novel (‘rearranged’) forms varied in different cultured cell mtDNAs. To address the source of this heterogeneity, we compared the mtDNA organization of 28 individual plants from the parental seed stock. With the exception of one plant containing high levels of a novel plasmid-like mtDNA molecule, no significant variation was detected among individual plants and therefore source plant variation is unlikely to have contributed to the diversity of mitochondrial genomes observed in cultured cells. The source of this culture-induced heterogeneity was also investigated in 16 clones derived from single protoplasts. A mixed population of unrearranged and rearranged mtDNA molecules was <b>apprent</b> in each protoclone, suggesting that the observed heterogeneity in various cultures might reflect the genomic composition of each individual cell; however, the induction of an intercellular heterogeneity subsequent to the protoplast isolation was not tested and therefore cannot be ruled out. The results of this study support our earlier model that the rapid structural alteration of B. campestris mtDNA in vitro results from preferential amplification and reassortment of minor pre-existing forms of the genome rather than de novo rearrangement. Infrequent recombination between short dispersed repeated elements is proposed as the underlying mechanism for the formation of these minor mtDNA molecules...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} thesis deals with the anticancer activity of four medicinal plants: 'Caralluma tuberculata' (Asclepiadaceae), 'Fagonia indica' (Zygophyllaceae), 'Solanum surattense' (Solanaceae) and 'Arisaema utile' (Araceae) that originate from the North West and Himalayan regions of Pakistan. Through a bioactivity-guided fractionation approach, the crude and resultant organic fractions were tested on cultured breast cancer cells (MCF- 7 and MDA MB- 468) and colorectal carcinoma cells (Caco- 2) in vitro. Five new compounds out of seven in total were isolated from potent fractions of the new medicinal plants using repeated flash column chromatography. Structural elucidation was carried out {{through a series of}} spectroscopic experiments (1 -D and 2 -D NMR, GC-MS, LC-MS). SIngle crystal X-ray structure was determined using X-ray crystallography for the crystalline compounds, which showed a defraction pattern. The <b>apprent</b> IC[sub] 50 for compounds (1 - 6) were estimated from serial dilutions of eight concentrations (0. 78 - 100 [mu]M) of each compound, tested against breast and colon cancer cell lines, using two cell viability assays (MTT and neutral red uptake assays) for 24 h and 48 h treatments. Two new steroidal glycosides, acylated pregnane (1) and acylated androstane (2) glycosides, isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of 'Caralluma tuberculata' showed highly significant (P< 0. 001) percentage growth inhibition in Caco- 2 cells (IC[sub] 50) 1. 56 - 6. 25 [mu]M) and MCF- 7 cells (IC[sub] 50 6. 25 - 25 [mu]M), however, oestrogen independent cancer cells (MDA MB- 468) were less responsive with IC[sub] 50 25 - 50 [mu]M. These steroidal glycosides induced apoptosis in cancer cells as measures of cytoxic activity (NRU, PARP clevage, DNA ladder) on MCF- 7, MDA MB- 468 and Caco- 2 cells were inhibited by pre-treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK). Another pregnane glycoside (3), isolated for the first time from 'Fagonia indica', was found to be more potent in suppressing cell growth (IC[50] 6. 25 - 25 [mu]M), in oestrogen negative breast cancer cells (MDA MB- 468,) as compared to oestrogen positive cancer cells (MCF- 7). Although a cleaved PARP (89 kDa) was detected by Western blotting, cytomorphological alterations and in cells pre-treated with a pan-caspase inhibitor (NRU assay), indicated that the necrosis mode of cell death is more likely. Moreover, three esters: hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester (4), phtalic acid 1 -(1, 1 -dimethyl-pentyl) ester 2 -(2 -ethyl-dec- 5 -enyl) ester (5) from chloroform fraction of 'Solanum surattense', and 5 -Oxo- 19 -propyl-docosanoic acd methyl ester (6) from 'Arisaema utile', showed a highly significant) p< 0. 001) decrease in cell numbers for MDA MB- 468 and Caco- 2 cells with apparent IC[50] 6. 25 - 12. 5 [mu]M in cell viability assays (MTT and NRU) after 48 h treatment, while MCF- 7 cells were less responsive (IC[sub] 50 25 [mu]M). Compunds 5 and 6 (first report from a natural source) did not restrict the growth inhibition in MCF- 7 and Caco- 2 cells, pre-treated with Z-VAD-FMK, which indicated less involvement of Capase-dependent apoptosis, while DAPI staining and Western blots (cleaved-PARP) showed characteristics of apoptosis that suggested the possibility of aponecrosis phenomenon of cell death. In preliminary screening (Western blot and DNA ladder assays), compounds (1 - 6) were not toxic to normal human cells (HUVEC and U 937) and indicated some selctivly between malignant and normal cells.
