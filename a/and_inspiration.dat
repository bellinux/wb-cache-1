5|$|Chiefly {{written by}} Sam Lake, Alan Wake took {{over five years}} to create—an unusually long {{development}} time in the game industry. The game received positive reviews from critics, and is often praised for its visuals, sound, narrative, pacing, and atmosphere. Alan Wake was awarded the first spot in Time magazine's list of the top 10 video games of 2010. Alan Wake's American Nightmare, a full stand-alone title, was released in February 2012 on the Xbox Live Arcade service. A sequel was in development but was cancelled. However, the scrapped sequel became the foundation <b>and</b> <b>inspiration</b> of Remedy's next title, Quantum Break.|$|E

He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in Venezuela gathering research <b>and</b> <b>inspiration.</b> The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth. The floating house is attached by a varying number between 10,000 and 20,000 balloons in the film's sequences. Up was Pixar's first film to be presented in Disney Digital 3-D.|$|E
5|$|Dunne's {{bartender}} came to wider {{attention with}} the wartime columns, and the Dooley pieces were soon in newspapers nationwide. Both the columns {{and the books}} collecting them gained national acclaim. Beginning around 1905, Dunne had increasing trouble finding time <b>and</b> <b>inspiration</b> for new columns, and they ended in 1915, except for a brief resurrection in the mid-1920s. Even in Dunne's own time (he died in 1936), his work was becoming obscure {{due in part to}} his use of dialect, and the unusual spellings that it used have proved a lasting barrier for potential readers.|$|E

She related her experiences working at Dear Stage, where originally worked as a waitress and performer. She said that she worked hard to meet customer expectations, and that performing at the venue's stage would prove to be a valuable experience as it would allow her to perform at larger stages with more imagination <b>and</b> <b>inspiration.</b> She mentioned that while writing lyrics for anime series, she wants the tone and mood of her songs to match the anime's setting.|$|E

5|$|Many of Poe's conclusions, however, are {{speculative}} {{due to his}} {{rejection of}} analytic logic and emphasis on intuition <b>and</b> <b>inspiration.</b> Further, Eureka contains many scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets. He also says that Johannes Kepler came to his conclusions not through science but through guesswork. For this reason, {{it has been suggested}} that what Poe demands is true in Eureka is not actually about this universe, but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates. If this is the case, as interpreted by poet Richard Wilbur, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition.|$|E
5|$|The concerts were {{attended}} by {{a total of}} 40,000 people, and raised close to $250,000 for Bangladesh relief, which was administered by UNICEF. Although the project was subsequently marred by financial problems – a result of the pioneering nature of the venture – the Concert for Bangladesh is recognised as a highly successful and influential humanitarian aid project, generating both awareness and considerable funds as well as providing valuable lessons <b>and</b> <b>inspiration</b> for projects that followed, notably Live Aid. By 1985, through revenue raised from the Concert for Bangladesh live album and film, an estimated $12 million had been sent to Bangladesh in relief.|$|E
5|$|At an {{ecclesiastical council}} held at Lambeth in 1281, Peckham ordered the clergy to {{instruct}} their congregations in doctrine {{at least four}} times a year. They were to explain and teach the Articles of Faith, the Ten Commandments, the Works of Mercy, the Seven Deadly Sins, the Seven Virtues and the Sacraments. This command was issued as a canon, or law, of the council, and the group is known as the Lambeth Constitutions. Even later these constitutions were collected as the Ignorantia sacerdotum. The six doctrines comprised the minimum theological knowledge the archbishop considered necessary for the laity to know. The constitutions, which were originally in Latin, were the basis <b>and</b> <b>inspiration</b> for pastoral and devotional works throughout the remainder of the Middle Ages, and were eventually translated into English in the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|In the 2011 census, the {{population}} of Dorchester was 19,060, with further people coming from surrounding areas {{to work in the}} town which has six industrial estates. The Brewery Square redevelopment project is taking place in phases, with other development projects planned. The town has a land-based college, Kingston Maurward College, the Thomas Hardye Upper School, three middle schools and thirteen first schools. The Dorset County Hospital offers an accident and emergency service, and the town is served by two railway stations. Through vehicular traffic is routed round the town by means of a bypass. The town has a football club and a rugby union club, several museums and the biannual Dorchester Festival. It is twinned with three towns in Europe. As well as having many listed buildings, a number of notable people have been associated with the town. It was for many years the home <b>and</b> <b>inspiration</b> of the author Thomas Hardy, whose novel The Mayor of Casterbridge uses a fictionalised version of Dorchester as its setting.|$|E
5|$|Many castles were {{originally}} built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone. Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking {{features such as}} towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep. In the late 12thand early 13thcenturies, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged. This led to the proliferation of towers, {{with an emphasis on}} flanking fire. Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence– several stages of defence within each other that could all function {{at the same time to}} maximise the castle's firepower. These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, <b>and</b> <b>inspiration</b> from earlier defences, such as Roman forts. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.|$|E
5|$|Elgar began {{composing}} when still a child, and all {{his life}} he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes <b>and</b> <b>inspiration.</b> The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which {{he and his brother}} played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the repertory.|$|E

5|$|Harihara's nephew and protégé, the {{dramatic}} poet Raghavanka of Hampi, whose style {{is compared to}} that of 10th-century poet Ranna, was the first to establish the shatpadi metre in Kannada literature in the epic Harishchandra Kavya (1200). According to L. S. Seshagiri Rao, it is believed that in no other language has the story of King Harishchandra been interpreted in this way. The writing is an original in tradition <b>and</b> <b>inspiration</b> that fully develops the potential of the shatpadi metre. The narration has many noteworthy elegiac verses such as the mourning of Chandramati over the death of her young son Lohitashva from snake bite. The very writing that made Raghavanka famous was rejected by his guru, Harihara. His other well-known writings, adhering to strict Shaiva principles and written to appease his guru, are the Siddharama charitra (or Siddharama Purana), a larger than life stylistic eulogy of the compassionate 12th-century Veerashaiva saint, Siddharama of Sonnalige; the Somanatha charitra, a propagandist work that describes the life of saint Somayya (or Adaiah) of Puligere (modern Lakshmeshwar), his humiliation by a Jain girl and his revenge; the Viresvara charita, a dramatic story of the blind wrath of a Shaiva warrior, Virabhadra; the Hariharamahatva, an account of the life of Harisvara of Hampi; and Sarabha charitra. The last two classics are considered lost.|$|E
