5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous.

In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor noticed that <b>a</b> <b>severely</b> ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective.

Spitfires shot down the entire 1. and 2. staffels of JG 1 at Twente airport as they took off (for the loss of two). Ihlefeld threatened to court martial Major G.

5|$|Against the Chicago Bulls in {{the first}} round of the 2006 NBA Playoffs, Wade shook off a few {{injuries}} that scared Heat fans, including <b>a</b> <b>severely</b> bruised hip in Game 5. Returning late in the half, Wade resurrected his team by scoring 15 of his 28 points while suffering from intense pain, leading the Heat to the much-needed 3–2 series lead. After this, Wade successfully led his team to the 2006 NBA Finals, despite suffering from flu-like symptoms in game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Detroit Pistons. He put up a double-double with 14 points and 10 assists in that game, including an 8-point flurry to close out the third quarter that put the game out of reach.|$|E
5|$|Douglas and Jean MacArthur {{spent their}} last years {{together}} in the penthouse of the Waldorf Towers, {{a part of the}} Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.

In that year, he earned a salary of $68,000 (equivalent to $612,000 in 2016), in addition to $20,000 pay and allowances as a General of the Army. The Waldorf became the setting for an annual birthday party on 26 January thrown by the general's former deputy chief engineer, Major General Leif J. Sverdrup. At the 1960 celebration for MacArthur's 80th birthday, many of his friends were startled by the general's obviously deteriorating health. The next day, he collapsed and was rushed into surgery at St. Luke's Hospital to control <b>a</b> <b>severely</b> swollen prostate.|$|E
5|$|During their travels {{across the}} Wastelands, the player can be {{accompanied}} by a single non-player character (NPC) companion, who can assist in combat. Which companion can accompany the player depends on who they have encountered that can join them; it is possible to not encounter all depending on how the game is played. Only one companion may travel with the player, and should they wish to take another with them, the first must be dismissed (either voluntarily by the player or as a consequence of other events) or die in combat. One unique companion the player can have, that can allow a third to join without issue, is a dog named Dogmeat, who can be killed during the game if the player misuses him or places him in <b>a</b> <b>severely</b> dangerous situation; the release of the Broken Steel DLC, makes it possible to replace Dogmeat, provided the player acquires a Perk that grants the opportunity of getting another dog.|$|E

This study evaluated a brief early intervention designed to improve communication between severely aphasic individuals and their communication partners. The intervention included a three-session component which addressed supported use of pointing, gesturing and drawing...|$|R

5|$|Faced {{with these}} constraints, the Spanish {{expedition}} {{had to cross}} the river several times and fight at each ford against stiff opposition. The bulk of the Inca army confronted the Spaniards from a set of terraces overlooking a plain by the Urubamba River. Several Spanish assaults against the terraces failed against a shower of arrows, slingshots and boulders {{coming down from the}} terraces as well as from both flanks. To hinder the efforts of the Spanish cavalry the Incas flooded the plain using previously prepared channels; water eventually reached the horses' girths. The defenders then counterattacked; some of them used Spanish weapons captured in previous encounters such as swords, bucklers, armor and even a horse, ridden by Manco Inca himself. In <b>a</b> <b>severely</b> compromised situation, Hernando Pizarro ordered a retreat; under the cover of darkness the Spanish force fled through the Urubamba valley with the Incas in pursuit and reached Cusco the next day.|$|E
5|$|From {{analysis}} of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in {{reducing the risk of}} further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through <b>a</b> <b>severely</b> narrowed vessel) on transcranial doppler despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient.|$|E

He was the only British pilot to bail out in the battle. The Hurricane crashed near Addolorata Cemetery near Paola. MacLachlan remained in hospital with <b>a</b> <b>severely</b> wounded left arm.

His determination and reputation was as such, the nurses and squadron were already taking bets on whether or not he would return to action within a fortnight {{on the day of the}} operation. While in hospital he began speaking with Luigi Armanino, the pilot he had shot down days earlier.
