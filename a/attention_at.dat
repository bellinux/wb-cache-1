5|$|Final Fantasy II {{introduced}} {{many elements}} {{that would later}} become staples of the Final Fantasy franchise, including chocobos and the recurring character Cid. It also eliminated the traditional experience point leveling system of the previous and later games in the series, instead introducing an activity-based progression system where the characters' statistics increase according to how they are used or acquired. Despite being a sequel to Final Fantasy, the game includes no characters or locations from the first game. Final Fantasy II received little <b>attention</b> <b>at</b> the time from non-Japanese reviewers, though its remakes have garnered favorable reviews.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president forty years earlier. Sherman was not a civil service reformer, but he went along with Hayes's instructions. The foremost enemy of reform—and Hayes—was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, and it was to Conkling's spoilsmen that Hayes first turned his <b>attention.</b> <b>At</b> Hayes's direction, Sherman ordered John Jay to investigate the New York Custom House, which was stacked with Conkling's appointees. Jay's report suggested that the New York Custom House was so overstaffed with political appointees that 20% of the employees were expendable.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Ambarawa brought Sudirman greater <b>attention</b> <b>at</b> a {{national}} level, and generally silenced whispers {{that he was}} unfit for military command because of his lack of military experience and previous employment as a schoolteacher. Ultimately, Sudirman was chosen as his loyalty was undoubted, while Oerip's former pledge of loyalty to the Dutch led to him being viewed with suspicion. Sudirman was confirmed as commander-in-chief on 18December 1945. He was replaced {{as head of the}} Fifth Division by Colonel Sutiro, and began to focus on strategic problems. This was done partly by establishing a board of advisors, which gave the general advice on both political and military issues. Oerip handled many of the military matters.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} Sutcliffe's {{aneurysm}} is unknown, {{although it is}} believed to have been started by an earlier head injury, as he was either kicked in the head, or thrown, head first, against a brick wall during a fight outside Lathom Hall, after a performance in January 1961. According to former manager Allan Williams, Lennon and Best went to Sutcliffe's aid, fighting off his attackers before dragging him to safety. Sutcliffe sustained a fractured skull in the fight and Lennon's little finger was broken. Sutcliffe refused medical <b>attention</b> <b>at</b> the time and failed to keep an X-ray appointment at Sefton General Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Vincent Tabak, a 32-year-old Dutch {{engineer}} and neighbour of Yeates, {{was arrested on}} 20 January 2011. Media <b>attention</b> <b>at</b> the time centred on the filming of a re-enactment of her disappearance for the BBC's programme, Crimewatch. After two days of questioning, Tabak was charged on 22 January 2011 with Yeates' murder. On 5 May 2011, {{he pleaded guilty to}} Yeates' manslaughter, but denied murdering her. His trial started on 4 October 2011; he was found guilty of murder on 28 October 2011, and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 20 years.|$|E
5|$|According to Crowley, Reuss {{had named}} him {{head of the}} O.T.O. upon his death, but this was {{challenged}} by {{a leader of the}} German O.T.O., Heinrich Tränker. Tränker called the Hohenleuben Conference in Thuringia, Germany, which Crowley attended. There, prominent members like Karl Germer and Martha Küntzel championed Crowley's leadership, but other key figures like Albin Grau, Oskar Hopfer, and Henri Birven backed Tränker by opposing it, resulting in a split in the O.T.O. Moving to Paris, where he broke with Olsen in 1926, Crowley went through a large number of lovers over the following years, with whom he experimented in sex magic. Throughout, he was dogged by poor health, largely caused by his heroin and cocaine addictions. In 1928, Crowley was introduced to young Englishman Israel Regardie, who embraced Thelema and became Crowley's secretary for the next three years. That year, Crowley also met Gerald Yorke, who began organising Crowley's finances but never became a Thelemite. He also befriended Thomas Driberg; Driberg did not accept Thelema either. It was here that Crowley also published one of his most significant works, Magick in Theory and Practice, which received little <b>attention</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the game}} was slow to gain popularity. Defender did not attract much <b>attention</b> <b>at</b> the 1980 AMOA show. In retrospect, Jarvis {{believed}} many passersby were intimidated by its complexity. The game, however, was well received in arcades, and crowds gathered around the cabinet during its first nights of play testing. The success spurred Williams to release a cocktail version as well. Defender eventually became Williams' best selling arcade game, with over 55,000units sold worldwide. By 2004, {{the game was}} a popular collector's item; the upright cabinets were common, while the cocktail models were more rare. Since its release, it {{has become one of}} the highest grossing arcade games ever, earning over US$1billion. Williams employee Larry Demar was surprised at the game's popularity, stating that it was the only game he'd seen able to earn that quantity of quarters. Six months after its release, the game was one of the top earners in the United States video game industry. Mark Stearny of JoyStik magazine called Defender the most successful game in 1981, commenting that it outperformed Pac-Man.|$|E
5|$|The four British ships fired {{more than}} 2,800 shells at Bismarck, and scored more than 400 hits, but {{were unable to}} sink Bismarck by gunfire. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser Dorsetshire to sink Bismarck with torpedoes and sent his battleships back to port. Dorsetshire fired a pair of torpedoes into Bismarcks {{starboard}} side, one of which hit. Dorsetshire then moved around to her port side and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly awash. It appears that the final torpedo may have detonated against Bismarcks port side superstructure, which was by then already underwater. Around 10:35, Bismarck capsized to port and slowly sank by the stern, disappearing from the surface at 10:40. Some survivors reported they saw Captain Lindemann standing at <b>attention</b> <b>at</b> the stem of the ship as she sank.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of attention and trait empathy within the production of neural facial mimicry responses that have been previously {{found to be associated}} with the experience of empathy. More specifically, do people who have high trait empathy levels require less attention to emotional information in order to still exhibit these physiological responses than people who have lower trait empathy levels? It has previously been demonstrated that responses in the zygomaticus and corrugator muscles have been associated with the experience of empathy. College aged participants were shown series of happy, angry, and neutral faces with the amount of attention allocated to the emotional information of the faces manipulated. It was predicted that the level of <b>attention</b> directed <b>at</b> the emotional faces would affect the level of these physiological empathetic responses. <b>Attention</b> directed <b>at</b> the emotional content of the photos was shown to elicit higher activations of these physiological responses than when participants’ <b>attention</b> was directed <b>at</b> another characteristic of the stimuli, gender, but trait empathy was not shown to significantly moderate the relationship between these physiological responses and the level of <b>attention</b> directed <b>at</b> the emotional information...|$|R
