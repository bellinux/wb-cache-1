5|$|BuroHappold's early {{projects}} {{ranged from}} designing giant fabric umbrellas for Pink Floyd concerts to the Munich Aviary and the Mannheim Multihalle, both with Frei Otto, an architect who repeatedly worked with Buro Happold on projects which pioneered lightweight structures. The Mannheim Multihalle was a timber gridshell of 50 by 50mm lathes of hemlock of irregular form, {{depending on the}} elasticity of spring washers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> for its flexible form. It {{was one of the}} first major uses of structural gridshells.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the century, {{the many}} repairs {{undertaken}} since the memorial's construction had left a patchwork of materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project, a major C$30million restoration project to restore Canada's memorial sites in France and Belgium, in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified manner. In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

25|$|The {{skeleton}} of the thumb {{consists of the}} first metacarpal bone which articulates proximally with <b>the</b> carpus <b>at</b> <b>the</b> carpometacarpal <b>joint</b> and distally with <b>the</b> proximal phalanx <b>at</b> <b>the</b> metacarpophalangeal <b>joint.</b> This latter bone articulates with <b>the</b> distal phalanx <b>at</b> <b>the</b> interphalangeal <b>joint.</b> Additionally, there are two sesamoid bones <b>at</b> <b>the</b> metacarpophalangeal <b>joint.</b>|$|R
5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the joints}} of the insect have tactile setae that {{register}} movement. Hair beds {{and groups of}} small hair like sensilla, determine proprioreception or information about {{the position of a}} limb, and are found on the cuticle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> of segments and legs. Pressure on the body wall or strain gauges are detected by the campiniform sensilla and internal stretch receptors sense muscle distension and digestive system stretching.|$|E
25|$|The ballast {{also serves}} as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is {{attached}} by direct fixation without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By welding rails together to form lengths of continuous welded rail, additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface gap <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride (passenger trains).|$|E
25|$|Jointed rails {{were used}} {{at first because}} {{contemporary}} technology did not offer any alternative. However, the intrinsic weakness in resisting vertical loading results in the ballast becoming depressed and a heavy maintenance workload is imposed to prevent unacceptable geometrical defects <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> The joints also needed to be lubricated, and wear at the fishplate (joint bar) mating surfaces needed to be rectified by shimming. For this reason jointed track is not financially appropriate for heavily operated railroads.|$|E

25|$|The {{fit of the}} {{underwear}} {{should allow}} the same range of movement as the suit itself, and together should allow the diver to bend, squat, kneel, climb a ladder, fin and reach all critical parts of the diving equipment. Underwear which is flexible and stretches, particularly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> will allow the diver more freedom of movement, and {{is less likely to}} chafe, and materials which resist compaction under light pressure will maintain a more even thickness in use, which will provide better insulation for the same overall volume.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} paravians, {{the feet of}} Anchiornis (except for the claws) were {{completely}} covered in feathers, though these were much shorter than the ones making up the hindwing. Some specimens have preserved scales on the toes, tarsus, and even lower leg (tibia), suggesting that scales existed beneath the feathers. The underside of the toes were formed into fleshy pads with distinct creases <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> The foot pads were covered in small, pebble-like scales. Scales were also present {{on the top of}} the feet but these are very hard to see in all known fossils.|$|E
25|$|Underneath {{the coarse}} {{stones of the}} Byzantine walls, {{the walls of the}} monastery were built of large finely dressed stones, {{plastered}} and molded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints,</b> a feature of Herodian construction. The monastery had been built over the remains of a large Second-Temple-era building which had stood adjacent to a major entrance to the Herodian Temple Mount. Benjamin Mazar had suggested that this may have been a courthouse of the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish judicial and legislative body, a building referred to in the Mishnah, Tractate Sanhedrin 11.2. Additional support for this identification comes from a fragment of a Hebrew inscription found nearby. The inscription contained the word kenim (elders), probably referring to the Sanhedrin.|$|E

25|$|The wing {{included}} three clawed fingers; however, unlike in some more primitive theropods, the longest two fingers were not separate, but were bound {{together by the}} skin and other tissue forming the wing, so Anchiornis was functionally two-fingered. These bound fingers were incorporated into a post-patagium, or flap of skin and other tissues that helped support the bases of the main wing feathers. Like the toes, the skin around {{the bottom of the}} fingers was covered in tiny, rounded scales. Unlike the toes, the flesh around the underside of the finger bones was twice as thick as the bones themselves and lacked distinct pads; instead, the fingers were straight and smooth without any major creases <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> Scales and skin around the fingers is very rarely preserved in fossils of early pennaraptorans, the only notable exceptions being Anchiornis and Caudipteryx, which had similar thick, scaly fingers associated with its wings.|$|E
25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin {{was soft and}} moist, with muscles that still allowed for {{her arms and legs}} to flex <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in her veins. There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp {{on the back of her}} head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E
25|$|The tube frame design, using {{steel core}} and {{perimeter}} columns protected with sprayed-on fire resistant material, created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more {{in response to}} the wind compared to traditional structures, such as the Empire State Building that have thick, heavy masonry for fireproofing of steel structural elements. During the design process, wind tunnel tests were done to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces. Experiments also were done to evaluate how much sway occupants could comfortably tolerate; however, many subjects experienced dizziness and other ill effects. One of the chief engineers Leslie Robertson worked with Canadian engineer Alan G. Davenport to develop viscoelastic dampers to absorb some of the sway. These viscoelastic dampers, used throughout the structures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> between floor trusses and perimeter columns along with some other structural modifications, reduced the building sway to an acceptable level.|$|E

25|$|On 8 June, {{several hundred}} Hanover {{residents}} converged {{close to the}} Leine River and searched both {{the banks of the}} river and the surrounding areas, discovering a number of human bones, which were handed to the police. In response to these latest discoveries, police decided to drag the entire section of the river which ran {{through the center of the}} city. In doing so, they discovered more than 500 further human bones and sections of bodies—many bearing knife striations—which were later confirmed by a court doctor as having belonged to at least 22 separate human individuals. Approximately half of the remains had been in the river for some time, whereas other bones and body parts had been discarded in the river more recently. Many of the recent and aged discoveries bore evidence of having been dissected—particularly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints.</b> Over 30 percent of the remains were judged to have belonged to young males aged between 15 and 20.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} thin {{materials}} which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of stockinette fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, laminated layers of nylon and butyl rubber known as Trilaminate or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With {{the exception of the}} rubber-coated stockinette, membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly over-sized and baggy to allow flexibility <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.|$|E
500|$|Schlumbergera {{is a small}} genus of cacti {{with six}} species found in the coastal {{mountains}} of south-eastern Brazil. Plants grow on trees or rocks in habitats that are generally shady with high humidity, and can be quite different in appearance from their desert-dwelling cousins. Most species of Schlumbergera have stems which resemble leaf-like pads joined {{one to the other}} and flowers which appear from areoles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>joints</b> and tips of the stems. Two species have cylindrical stems more similar to other cacti. In Brazil, the genus is referred to as [...] (May flower), reflecting the period in which they flower in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
