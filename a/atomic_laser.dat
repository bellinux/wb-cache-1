40|$|This book is {{especially}} concerned with fundamental theoretical and experimental aspects of relativistic beam physics, recoil, and cooling phenomena in atomic and ion beams and traps, {{with emphasis on}} coherence and collective effects. The central theme is the physics of <b>atomic</b> <b>laser</b> and free electron laser, {{and the development of}} a bridge between them through the mechanism of the so-called recoil induced gain mechanism. The links between relativistic beam physics and <b>atomic</b> <b>laser</b> physics are explored. This book is targeted at an audience of non-specialists or specialists in only one of the fields mentioned above. It addresses the following topics: Fundamentals of laser cooling and trapping of atoms: theory and experiments; Quantum optics and atomic coherence effects; Laser cooling of trapped ions; from single ion to ion crystal; Spatio-temporal instabilities in optical systems; Coherence in atom optics; atomic diffraction and interferometry; Optical lattices; nonlinear effects in laser-cooled atoms; Coherent population trapping; Two-level gain and collective recoil-induced effects; Fundamental physics of relativistic particles beams; High-gain free electron laser: theory, experiments and projects; Cooling of ion beams in a storage ring; Experiments on dense laser-cooled stored ion beams...|$|E

40|$|Considered as a {{fundamental}} step {{for the development of}} the <b>atomic</b> <b>laser</b> and quantum computing, as well as the theoretical explanation of super fluidity, the Bose- Einstein condensate (BEC) has emerged as one of the most important topics in modern physics. This project is devoted to the analysis of a condensate based on exciton-polaritons. This BEC is characterized by a high critical temperature of condensation (about 20 K) and non-equilibrium dynamics. A mathematical model called complex Gross- Pitaevskii equation (cGPE) is used to describe its behavior. The steady state solutions of the cGPE are studied and a numerical method based on a collocation method is proposed in order to find these solutions. Once the steady state solutions are found, a linear stability analysis is performed, demonstrating that the steady state solutions become unstable as the pumping spot radius increases. Finally, the manifestations of these instabilities are analyzed by direct simulation of the cGPE, using a second order time-splitting spectral method. As a result, it is possible to see the formation of quantum vortices, which increase in number as the pumping spot radius increases...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{invention}} of the laser more than 50 years ago, scientists have striven to achieve amplification on atomic transitions of increasingly shorter wavelength. The introduction of X-ray free-electron lasers makes it possible to pump new <b>atomic</b> X-ray <b>lasers</b> with ultrashort pulse duration, extreme spectral brightness and full temporal coherence.

Tobias Kippenberg (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) : Back-action Cooling of Mechanical Oscillators The mutual {{coupling}} of optical and mechanical {{degrees of freedom}} via radiation pressure has been a subject {{of interest in the}} context of quantum limited displacements measurements for Gravity Wave Detection for many decades. Recent advances in nano- and micro-mechanical oscillators have allowed the observation for the first time of radiation pressure phenomena in an experimental setting and constitute the emerging research field of Cavity Optomechanics. Using on-chip micro-cavities that combine both optical and mechanical degrees of freedom in one and the same device, radiation pressure back-action of photons is shown to lead to effective cooling of the mechanical oscillator mode. This back-action cooling exhibits many close analogies to the physics of <b>atomic</b> <b>laser</b> cooling. The case of resolved sideband cooling in the quantum regime will be mentioned, which has enabled preparation of a 75 MHz mechanical oscillator with only 20 quanta. In addition, measurements of both micro- and nanomechanical motion at the standard quantum limit of motion measurement are presented. INHALT ====== Kapitel Titel Position [...] - 1.

40|$|The gain in a usual free {{electron}} laser (FEL) vanishes when the energy spread of the electron beam is too broad because electrons with positive detuning parameter {ital v} are bunched around a certain phase contributing to a positive gain, while those with negative {ital v} are bunched around another phase contributing to a negative gain. The net gain therefore vanishes for a beam of electrons distributed over {{a broad range of}} positive and negative values of {ital v}. To avoid this problem, it was proposed recently to use two undulators and to insert a device between them which separates the electrons of negative v and to displace them in phase so that they contribute to an overall positive gain after passing through the second undulator. The device will be referred to as the ``redistributor``. The scheme, was an effort to extend the idea of the inversionless <b>atomic</b> <b>laser</b> to the FEL, and, if true, would have an important consequence for future FEL development. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that the scheme does not work as proposed. The reason is simple: consider an initial electron distribution which is uniform extending to a large positive and negative detuning where the FEL interaction vanishes. The distribution, because of Liouville`s theorem, will remain the same after the first undulator. The redistributor would have no effect on this distribution, and the gain of the total system vanishes. The reasoning above is wrong because we did not take into account the contributions of {ital all electrons}. The first group contributes to a positive net gain. However, this is canceled by the negative net gain due to the second group, irrespective of how the phase of electrons in the region of negative detuning is displaced relative to those in the positive detuning...|$|E
