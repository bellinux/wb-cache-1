Due to the small element spacing, the mutual coupling between adjacent SRA's in the mixer array can not be ignored. ADS momentum simulation has been performed to study the self- and mutual- impedances of the SRA array vvith various element spacings. The element SR A off-axis radiation patterns (with silicon lens) have been calculated using ray-tracing techniques and the imaging angular resolution has been predicted.

In order to identify biomarkers and potential regulators of the process of differentiation, a high quality microarray containing 16, 659 seventy base pair oligonucleotides was used to compare gene expression profiles of undifferentiated hESC lines and differentiating embryoid bodies. Results Previously identified "stemness" genes in undifferentiated hESC lines showed down modulation in differentiated cells while expression of several genes was induced as cells differentiated. In addition, a subset of 194 genes showed overexpression of greater than ≥ 3 folds in human embryoid bodies (hEB). These included 37 novel and 157 known genes. Gene expression was validated by a variety of techniques including another large scale <b>array,</b> <b>reverse</b> transcription polymerase chain reaction, focused cDNA microarrays, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) analysis and immunocytochemisty. Several novel hEB specific expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were mapped to the human genome database and their expression profile characterized. A hierarchical clustering analysis clearly depicted a distinct difference in gene expression profile among undifferentiated and differentiated hESC and confirmed that microarray analysis could readily distinguish them. Conclusion These results present a detailed characterization of a unique set of genes, which can be used to assess the hESC differentiation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Tumor Suppressor Candidate 2 (TUSC 2) {{is a novel}} tumor {{suppressor}} gene located in the human chromosome 3 p 21. 3 region. TUSC 2 mRNA transcripts could be detected on Northern blots in both normal lung and some lung cancer cell lines, but no endogenous TUSC 2 protein could be detected in a majority of lung cancer cell lines. Mechanisms regulating TUSC 2 protein expression and its inactivation in primary lung cancer cells are largely unknown. We investigated {{the role of the}} 5 ’- and 3 ’-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the TUSC 2 gene in the regulation of TUSC 2 protein expression. We found that two small upstream open-reading frames (uORFs) in the 5 ’UTR of TUSC 2 could markedly inhibit the translational initiation of TUSC 2 protein by interfering with the “scanning” of the ribosome initiation complexes. Site-specific stem-loop <b>array</b> <b>reverse</b> transcription-polymerase chain reaction (SLA-RT-PCR) verified several micoRNAs (miRNAs) targeted at 3 ’UTR and directed TUSC 2 cleavage and degradation. In addition, we used the established let- 7 -targeted high mobility group A 2 (Hmga 2) mRNA as a model system to study the mechanism of regulation of target mRNA by miRNAs in mammalian cells under physiological conditions. There have been no evidence of direct link between mRNA downregulation and mRNA cleavages mediated by miRNAs. Here we showed that the endonucleolytic cleavages on mRNAs were initiated by mammalian miRNA in seed pairing style. Let- 7 directed cleavage activities among the eight predicted potential target sites have varied efficiency, which are influenced by the positional and the structural contexts in the UTR. The 5 ’ cleaved RNA fragments were mostly oligouridylated at their 3 ’-termini and accumulated for delayed 5 ’– 3 ’ degradation. RNA fragment oligouridylation played important roles in marking RNA fragments for delayed bulk degradation and in converting RNA degradation mode from 3 ’– 5 ’ to 5 ’– 3 ’ with cooperative efforts from both endonucleolytic and non-catalytic miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC).

Several abiotic stresses are important to lentil yields world wide and include drought, heat, salt susceptibility and iron deficiency. The biotic stresses are numerous and include: susceptibility to Ascochyta blight, caused by Ascochyta lentis; Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum truncatum; Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum; Sclerotinia white mold, caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; rust, caused by Uromyces fabae; and numerous aphid transmitted viruses. Lentil is also highly susceptible to several species of Orabanche prevalent in the Mediterranean region, for which there {{does not appear to}} be much resistance in the germplasm. Plant breeders and geneticists have addressed these stresses by identifying resistant/tolerant germplasm, determining the genetics involved and the genetic map positions of the resistant genes. To this end progress has been made in mapping the lentil genome and several genetic maps are available that eventually will lead to the development of a consensus map for lentil. Marker density has been limited in the published genetic maps and there is a distinct lack of co-dominant markers that would facilitate comparisons of the available genetic maps and efficient identification of markers closely linked to genes of interest. Molecular breeding of lentil for disease resistance genes using marker assisted selection, particularly for resistance to Ascochyta blight and Anthracnose, is underway in Australia and Canada and promising results have been obtained. Comparative genomics and synteny analyses with closely related legumes promises to further advance the knowledge of the lentil genome and provide lentil breeders with additional genes and selectable markers for use in marker assisted selection.
