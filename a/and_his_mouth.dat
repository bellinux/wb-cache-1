5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> muzzled.|$|E

500|$|Homosexual or {{bisexual}} activity also occurs between gods, {{although such}} interactions are most usually considered purely ritualistic, or have purposes other than sexual pleasure. Agni, {{the god of}} fire, wealth and creative energy, has same-sex sexual encounters that involve accepting semen from other gods. [...] Although married to the goddess Svaha, Agni is also shown as {{being part of a}} same-sex couple with Soma, the god of the moon. Agni takes a receptive role in this relationship, accepting semen from Soma with his mouth, paralleling Agni's role in accepting sacrifices from Earth to Heaven. Orthodox Hinduism emphasises that these are [...] "mithuna", ritual sexual encounters, and Agni <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> represent the feminine role.|$|E

500|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{lips are}} thin and tightly pursed <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> is broad and down-turned, yet his {{features}} {{are those of}} a handsome man. Marcel Brion described him as appearing [...] "mild and thoughtful", an impression reinforced by the uncomplicated design of the painting. This view {{is reinforced by the}} relative drabness or simplicity of his clothes, which seem intended to convey a reserved, ascetic piousness. Dürer presents his father more like a low-ranking [...] ecclesiastic than a tradesman: a calm, considerate and straightforward man dressed up in his best, albeit modest, clothes. After his father's death in 1502, Dürer wrote that Albrecht the Elder [...] "passed his life in great toil and stern hard labour, having nothing for his support save what he earned with his hand for himself, his wife and his children... He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him... he was also of few words, and was a God-fearing man." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1930 Geldray heard a mouth organ {{player on}} BBC Radio and {{mentioned}} the performance to a friend, Hans Mossel, {{owner of a}} music shop in Amsterdam; Mossel had ordered a chromatic harmonica the previous week {{and gave it to}} Geldray, who practised assiduously. By 1934 Geldray had made some appearances on Dutch radio and formed a band with eight others; an agent named Franklin billed the group as [...] "Mac [...] Geldray <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>Mouth</b> Accordion Band", changing the surname of the principal to the name he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. With his performances, Geldray became the first person to play the harmonica in the jazz style. A change in the format of the band to a quartet and the introduction of a new manager led to a six-week tour of English theatres in 1937, accompanying the comedian Tom Moss; the band changed its name to [...] "The Hollander Boys". During the tour Moss introduced Geldray to Jack Hylton, who invited him to play in his orchestra for the evening.|$|E
500|$|The series {{makes use}} of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Beginning with the second season, visual effects became an {{in-house}} department. Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden feels this improved the series because a fixed budget allowed them to compensate for other scenes that lacked effects, such as in [...] "Nightshifter". Wide shots of the bank's exterior—featuring closed-off streets, police, and SWAT helicopters—were accomplished with visual effects. The series' catchphrase—"Scary just got sexy"—was added to a billboard in the background. For the episode [...] "Houses of the Holy", production did not want viewers {{to be able to}} determine that the [...] "angel" [...] was in actuality a priest. Thus, the shape engulfed in light was a girl wearing a skintight white leotard. At times, the visual effects used were subtle. Cockroaches were digitally inserted into the sewer scenes of [...] "No Exit"; director Kim Manners did not ask for it, but thought the addition [...] "made it really creepy". The episode [...] "Playthings" [...] featured a scene of a man dying after falling down stairs. The department added blood flowing from underneath him, and also made his fingers twitch <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> open and close to create a more lifelike appearance.|$|E

2500|$|Producer David Puttnam viewed {{footage from}} a 1924 film of Liddell and Abrahams while researching the film with {{scriptwriter}} Colin Welland and Liddell's unorthodox running style as {{portrayed in the}} film, with his head back <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> wide open, is also said to be accurate. At an athletics championship in Glasgow, a visitor watching the 440 yard final in which Liddell {{was a long way}} behind the leaders {{at the start of the}} last lap (of a 220-yard track) remarked to a Glasgow native that Liddell would be hard put to win the race. The Glaswegian merely replied, [...] "His head's no' back yet." [...] Liddell then threw his head back and with mouth wide open caught and passed his opponents to win the race. In the 1945 report of his death The Guardian wrote [...] "He is remembered among lovers of athletics as probably the ugliest runner who ever won an Olympic championship. When he appeared in the heats of the 400m at Paris in 1924 his huge sprawling stride, his head thrown back and his arms clawing the air, moved the Americans and other sophisticated experts to ribald laughter." [...] Rival Harold Abrahams said in response to criticism of Liddell's style: [...] "People may shout their heads off about his appalling style. Well, let them. He gets there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon the Just was so {{skeptical of}} the reasons for which nazirites might have {{interrupted}} their status that he found only one that he really trusted. He said that only once in his life had he eaten of the trespass-offering brought by a defiled tear in connection with an interrupted nazirite vow. On that occasion a nazirite came from the South country, and Simeon the Just saw that he had beautiful eyes, was of handsome appearance, and with thick locks of hair symmetrically arranged. Simeon the Just asked him what reason the nazirite had seen to destroy this beautiful hair by shaving it for the nazirite vow. The nazirite replied that he was a shepherd for his father and once he went to draw water from a well and gazed upon his reflection in the water, and his evil desires rushed upon him and sought to drive him from the world through sin. But the shepherd swore that day that he would shave his beautiful hair off for the sake of Heaven. Simeon the Just immediately arose and kissed the nazirite's head, praying that there would be many nazirites such as him in Israel. And Simeon the Just said that it was of this nazirite that [...] says, [...] "When either {{a man or a woman}} shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazirite, to separate themselves unto the Lord ..." [...] Rabbi Mani inquired why Simeon the Just did not eat of the guilt-offering of a nazirite. If it was because the nazirite was a sinner because he tormented himself, depriving himself of wine, that would be inconsistent with ever eating of the sin-offering (for example) for tasting forbidden fat or of the sin-offering for tasting blood. Simeon the Just thought that people made the nazirite vow in a fit of temper, and since they vowed in a fit of temper they would ultimately come to regret it. And once they regretted it, their sacrifices become like those of people who slaughtered unconsecrated animals in the Temple court (which would be disrespectful and forbidden). This nazirite, however, vowed after due mental deliberation <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and heart were in agreement.|$|E
