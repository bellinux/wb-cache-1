The complete battalion was deployed and the riot was under control by 21:40 and <b>a</b> <b>curfew</b> imposed {{for the rest of}} the night. Early the following day the curfew was broken by large crowds gathering to loot and burn buildings, so the remainder of the brigade was deployed to the city under the codename Operation Bellicose. Night time curfews remained in place until 05:20 on 20 November, when all troops returned to their barracks.
