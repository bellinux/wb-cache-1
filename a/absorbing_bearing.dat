40|$|A rotary {{blood pump}} {{includes}} a pump housing for receiving a flow straightener, a rotor mounted on rotor bearings and having an inducer portion and an impeller portion, and a diffuser. The entrance angle, outlet angle, axial and radial clearances of blades {{associated with the}} flow straightener, inducer portion, impeller portion and diffuser are optimized to minimize hemolysis while maintaining pump efficiency. The rotor bearing includes a bearing chamber that is filled with cross-linked blood or other bio-compatible material. A back emf integrated circuit regulates rotor operation and a microcomputer {{may be used to}} control one or more back emf integrated circuits. A plurality of magnets are disposed in each of a plurality of impeller blades with a small air gap. A stator may be axially adjusted on the pump housing to <b>absorb</b> <b>bearing</b> load and maximize pump efficiency...|$|R
5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of <b>absorbing</b> impact, <b>bearing</b> weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|R
40|$|Broadly <b>absorbing</b> perylene dyes <b>bearing</b> three-triarylamine {{groups were}} {{synthesized}} via Sonogashira coupling. The triarylamine moieties allowed further installation of electron donating ability, to enable tuning of the oxidation potential and optical band gap. With introducing more electron-donating groups into the three-triarylamine moieties the device performance was improved. The trend can be rationalized by {{the distribution of}} the electron density in the HOMO of the perylene moiety as well as the light-harvesting property of the perylene dyes...|$|R
5|$|The {{limbs of}} the horse are {{structures}} made of dozens of bones, joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support {{the weight of the}} equine body. They include two apparatuses: the suspensory apparatus, which carries much of the weight, prevents overextension of the joint and absorbs shock, and the stay apparatus, which locks major joints in the limbs, allowing horses to remain standing while relaxed or asleep. The limbs play a major part in the movement {{of the horse}}, with the legs performing the functions of <b>absorbing</b> impact, <b>bearing</b> weight, and providing thrust. In general, the majority of the weight is borne by the front legs, while the rear legs provide propulsion. The hooves are also important structures, providing support, traction and shock absorption, and containing structures which provide blood flow through the lower leg. As the horse developed as a cursorial animal, with a primary defense mechanism of running over hard ground, its legs evolved to the long, sturdy, light-weight, one-toed form seen today.|$|R
60|$|At {{this time}} an eye might have noticed a figure flitting in and about those draughty apartments, and making no more noise {{in so doing}} than a puff of wind. Its motion hither and thither was rapid, but methodical, its <b>bearing</b> <b>absorbed,</b> yet cautious. Though it ran more or less through all the {{principal}} rooms, the chief scene of its operations was the Long Gallery overlooking the Pleasance, which was covered by an ornamental wood-and-plaster roof, and contained a whole throng of family portraits, besides heavy old cabinets and the like. The portraits which were of value as works of art were smaller than these, and hung in adjoining rooms.|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} crash {{energy absorbing}} concepts for road and railway vehicles are introduced, which were developed during research {{activities at the}} German Aerospace Center (DLR) – Institute of Vehicle Concepts. The crash concept for road vehicles uses AZ 31 B magnesium, a material with a tension-compression asymmetry. Crash-related structures under bending can be significantly improved by filling hollow thin-walled beams with a stabilizing polyurethane core. To evaluate the crashworthiness of hollow and foam filled magnesium beams, quasi-static and dynamic three-point bending tests were performed. The crash concept for railway vehicles uses structurally load bearing tapering tubes with different sizes and energy levels. Results given in the paper present the smallest energy absorbers with tubes made of HSD®-steel, a material which combines a high strength with a high ductility, and a die made of tempered steel. Quasi-static and dynamic tests in longitudinal and transverse directions relative to the tube axis were performed, to evaluate the energy <b>absorbing</b> and load <b>bearing</b> capabilities of the absorbers...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe brick infill walls {{cease to}} {{contribute}} to the lateral strength and stiffness of a structure as soon as they fail in a brittle manner {{in the early stages of}} an earthquake. Recent studies indicated that the perforated steel plates externally bonded to both faces of a wall lead to two benefits. First, the increase in the lateral strengths and rigidities of the walls increase the overall lateral strength and stiffness of the structure. Secondly, the increase in the ductilities of the walls allows the walls to absorb higher amounts of the earthquake-induced energy before failure so that smaller amounts of energy are required to be <b>absorbed</b> by the <b>bearing</b> structural members. The present study is dedicated to investigate the efficiency of this technique on the behavior of brick walls under out-of-plane bending moments, induced by the blast effect of an explosion or pressure from the soil, wind or snow next to the wall. A brick wall strengthened with perforated steel plates and a brick wall strengthened with perforated steel plates and steel strips on both faces were subjected to four-point bending. The steel plates greatly contributed to the bending capacities of the walls. The use of steel strips on the plates did not affect the flexural capacity of the wall, while increasing the ductility of the wall considerably...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} investigations on progressive bearing failure mechanisms of composite bolted joints and their integration into a crash design concept. The {{objective of the}} presented test program is a crash design for a generic composite transport aircraft fuselage structure that utilizes tension loads in the passenger cross beam for energy absorption. In this design, the passenger cross beams are fabricated from carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) and kinetic energy shall be <b>absorbed</b> by progressive <b>bearing</b> failure of their bolted attachments. A specific design for a standard bolted joint was developed and experimentally investigated, which provides controlled bearing failure to reliably ensure energy absorption in combination with sufficient structural integrity in a crash event. The concept ensures • controlled direction of bearing failure under various loading conditions (on- and off-axis loading), • a robust stop mechanism to limit the progressive bearing failure to a certain displacement, • steady, progressive failure with non-constraining flow of the debris out of the local crush zone to prevent blockage effects, which may lead to abrupt load increase. In a comprehensive test program on coupon level several design concepts were investigated under quasi-static loading considering the progressive failure mechanisms of one single bolt. This bolt connects two CFRP sheets and is set under regular conditions (pre-stressed). In the shear tests, the bolt shaft is pulled {{through one of the}} CFRP sheets leading to significant energy absorption. Different design concepts, including specific notches and modified washers, were tested with the aim to ensure constant load level during the failure process by steady debris outflow that prevents debris blockage effects in the local crush zone in front of the bolt. Subsequently, preferential concepts were tested with a crash relevant dynamic loading rate of v = 2 m/s. The concept was proven on element level using multi-bolt specimens (2 -bolt and 4 -bolt). On-axis and off-axis loading up to 30 ° was tested under dynamic loading conditions of v = 0. 1 m/s and v = 2 m/s. Further design modifications were investigated that focused on enhanced robustness and an improved connection for the standard operating condition. On this element level, the concept feasibility could successfully be confirmed. Finally, this paper presents application aspects of the tension absorber concept. Crash simulations of a fuselage section are presented that illustrate the potential of energy absorption by utilization of tensile crash loads in the passenger cross beam...|$|R
