5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the absorption edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence {{the structure of the}} whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around the absorption edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E

5|$|Various {{anatomical}} {{features of}} the goblin shark, such as its flabby body and small fins, {{suggest that it is}} sluggish in nature. This species hunts for teleost fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans both near the sea floor <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the water column. Its long snout is covered with ampullae of Lorenzini that enable it to sense minute electric fields produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are unintentionally caught by deepwater fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern, despite its rarity, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.|$|E
