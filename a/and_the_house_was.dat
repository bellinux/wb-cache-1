50|$|In 1824 the {{construction}} of a church at the square (then called St Barnabas) was completed. During Victorian times, the social composition of <b>the</b> area changed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>was</b> occupied mostly by poorer Londoners, with houses divided into smaller flats.

5|$|Sir Horatio died in 1814 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{inherited}} by James Cornwallis, Bishop of Lichfield, {{who was the}} widowed {{husband of}} Mann's older sister, Catherine. Cornwallis became the fourth Earl Cornwallis {{on the death of}} his nephew Charles Cornwallis, 2nd Marquess Cornwallis in 1823, but died himself in 1824. The estate passed to his son James, the fifth Earl. On the fifth Earl's death in 1852, the property was inherited by his daughter Julia. In 1862, she married William Amherst, Viscount Holmesdale (later, after her death in 1883, the third Earl Amherst).|$|E
5|$|The Nixons {{moved to}} a gated complex in Park Ridge, New Jersey, in 1991. Pat's health was failing, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> smaller and {{contained}} an elevator. A heavy smoker most of her adult life who nevertheless never allowed herself {{to be seen with}} a cigarette in public, she eventually endured bouts of oral cancer, emphysema, and ultimately lung cancer, with which she was diagnosed in December 1992 while hospitalized with respiratory problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{next and}} last {{residents}} of the house were Gilbert and Esme Smyth. They lived there for the next thirty years. Gilbert died in a 1940 and Esme in 1946 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> left to their daughter Esme Francis Cavendish. She and her husband tried {{to sell the house}} immediately in 1946 to help pay the death duties. However the Cavendish family did not succeed until thirteen years later in 1959 during which time the house was unoccupied and started to decay. It was sold at this time to Bristol City Council who still owns it today.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} the Rova's {{buildings}} possessed unique design features. The modest wood building then known as Manjakamiadana was also called Felatanambola ("Silver Hands") for the hand-shaped sculptures crafted from melted silver piastres and attached {{to each of the}} building's four tandrotrano (roof horns)—an architectural design element formed from the crossed gable beams that extended past the roof line of all traditional aristocratic Merina houses. Felatanambola's decorative silver hands were later affixed to the roof horns of Besakana. Another distinctive building from this period was called Bevato ("Many Stones") because its foundation was atypically composed of stone blocks. Manatsara was said to be the most well constructed of the many houses because it was built using ambora (Tambourissa parrifolia), an extremely durable and rot-resistant indigenous hardwood, rather than a traditional wood called hazomena (Weinmannia rutenbergii). According to oral history, Manatsara was treasured by Andrianampoinimerina <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> quite old but still well preserved in the mid-19th century when Queen RanavalonaI decided to recover its interior walls with wood taken from Sihanaka country.|$|E
5|$|The 18th century saw the {{beginnings}} of change to agriculture on Shapinsay, courtesy of the Balfour family. The family owned the estate of Sound, which covered {{the western part of}} the island. Sound had passed from the Tulloch family to the Buchanan family in the 17th century. In 1674, Arthur Buchanan built the house of Sound, where Balfour Castle now stands. His granddaughter married James Fea, who is best known for his role in the capture of the Orkney Pirate John Gow. Fea was a supporter of the Jacobite Rebellion, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> burned by Hanoverian troops in revenge. The estate was acquired by Andrew Ross, Stewart Depute in Orkney of the Earl of Morton. Ross's heirs, the Lindsay brothers, sold the estate to Thomas Balfour in 1782. Balfour had previously rented the Bu of Burray, a large manor farm on another Orkney island, but had insufficient wealth to acquire the estate even though his wife had inherited a legacy on the death of her aristocratic brother. To raise the necessary funds, Balfour had to sell his military commission and borrow from his brother, John, who was prospering in India with the East India Company. Once installed on the island, he built a new house, Cliffdale, and founded the village of Shoreside, now known as Balfour. He also reformed the local agriculture, enclosing fields and constructing farm buildings.|$|E
5|$|The family's {{fame and}} notoriety {{were to be}} short-lived. Subsequent generations settled down in Somerset to live the lives of county gentry, {{representing}} Somerset in Parliament and when necessary following occupations {{in the army and}} the church. This peaceful existence was jolted when the estate was inherited by William Phelips (1823–89), who in his early days made many improvements and renovations to Montacute. He was responsible for the Base Court, a low service range adjoining {{the south side of the}} mansion. and the restoration of the Great Chamber, which he transformed into a library. Later, he was to become insane; an addicted gambler, he was eventually incarcerated for his own good. Sadly for his family, this was after he had gambled away the family fortune and vast tracts of the Montacute Estate. In 1875, when his son William Phelips (1846–1919) took control of the estate, agricultural rents from what remained of the mortgaged estate were low, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> a drain on limited resources. Selling the family silver and art works delayed the inevitable by a few years, but in 1911 the family were forced to let the house, for an annual sum of £650, and move out. The Phelipses never returned.|$|E

Most of these farms no longer exist, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> {{protected}} as a Flemish monument since 1981. To conserve <b>the</b> heritage, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> restored to its original state.

25|$|The {{house itself}} is {{relatively}} simple, {{but for the}} late 16th century {{it would have been}} considered quite a substantial dwelling. John Shakespeare, William's father, was a glove maker and wool dealer, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> originally divided in two parts to allow him to carry out his business from the same premises.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{the house}} began in 1616 but work on the house stopped in April 1618 when Anne became ill and died the next year.

25|$|Zettler {{was born}} on July 15, 1917 in Kfar Saba, a Jewish {{community}} in what became the British Mandate of Palestine following World War I, and later part of Israel. The community — including Zettler's home — was largely destroyed in Arab riots in 1921, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> reconstructed after his family and other residents returned. He attended the Geula school in Tel Aviv.|$|E

25|$|Hester Ann Harwood died {{intestate}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> sold in 1926 to St. John’s College.

25|$|Number 9. Archbishop’s Palace. It was {{property}} of Lviv Roman Catholic Archbishops. Among its guests, {{there were several}} Polish kings and nobles. In 1634 it was thoroughly remodelled by Archbishop Stanislaw Grochowski. Here, on 10 November 1673, died King Michael Korybut Wisniowiecki. In 1845, a second floor was added <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> turned into a condominium. Polish kings Sigismund III Vasa and his son Wladyslaw IV stayed here while in Lviv.|$|E
25|$|The “people of St. John” did {{not attend}} to the {{responsibilities}} left by this gift, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> vandalized and covered with graffiti. It soon fell into disrepair. Finally, the United States Virgin Island government took over the property, and created a Community Center on the property. Now, the center can be rented out by paying a small fee for such events as senior citizen outings, Boy Scouts meetings, local reggae and calypso bands, picnics, weddings, and birthday parties.|$|E
