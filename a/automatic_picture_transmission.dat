5|$|A {{dispatch}} {{from the}} Associated Press to Mexico City reported that 20,000 citizens from villages in Durango, Sinaloa, Nayarit, and Jalisco evacuated {{due to the}} threat of flooding and high winds from Naomi. The damage from Naomi in Mexico was moderate, although no monetary figures have ever been released. The Associated Press dispatch also reported that Naomi was responsible for knocking out communications over a large area in Mazatlán as well as downing power lines and damaging houses. At least 2000 people were reported homeless in Durango due to the hurricane. The hurricane also caused damage to Highway 15 between Mazatlán and Tepic. Although the highway reopened soon afterward, some areas that were struck by the hurricane were still rough. Naomi's most notable impact in Mexico involved the Lázaro Cárdenas Dam on the Nazas River, which was not complete by the time the hurricane hit. The dam, upriver from Gómez Palacio and Torreón, was feared to break down from the water being built up behind it, influenced by the hurricane. The two options were to either open the dam, saving Torreón by inundating Gómez Palacio, or risk inundating both towns by keeping the dam closed. The decision was made harder by the fact that, if the dam was released and no rain fell to refill the basin behind the dam, the farms would have insufficient water for agricultural growth. Photography from the Environmental Science Services Administration's <b>Automatic</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Transmission</b> based on the ESSA-6 weather satellite showed that the clouds from Naomi responsible for the rain had almost moved over the area near the dam. Based on the images, the authorities decided to gamble on the dam to successfully hold up, and it managed to hold back the waters without breaking. The hurricane caused four drowning deaths and $16 million in damage in Sinaloa.|$|E

50|$|NOAA-19, {{launched}} on 6 February 2009 and still operating as of June 2016, {{is the last}} NOAA satellite to carrythe old analog <b>automatic</b> <b>picture</b> <b>transmission</b> (APT) system, which {{dates back to the}} 1960s.At one point, NOAA indicated it would move to a system such as LRPT on future vehicles,but after the NPOESS program was replaced with JPSS in February 2010, NOAA decided to eliminate Low Rate Data (LRD)transmissions from JPSS.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Automatic</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Transmission</b> (APT) {{system is}} an analog image {{transmission}} system developed {{for use on}} weather satellites. It {{was introduced in the}} 1960s and over four decades has provided image data to relatively low-cost user stations at locations in most countries of the world. A user station anywhere in the world can receive local data at least twice a day from each satellite as it passes nearly overhead.|$|E
50|$|The {{system is}} an update and {{replacement}} of the existing analog system called <b>automatic</b> <b>picture</b> <b>transmission</b> (APT), which has been used since the 1960s aboard NOAA's TIROS polar-orbiting satellites. The APT system provided only two image channels, which were at a reduced accuracy and resolution (8-bit, 4 km/pixel, two lines/second). Compared to the APT system, LRPT images are four times more accurate and contain twelve times the resolution. Further, the additional data from other sensors increases the applications of the satellites and the users who receive the signal.|$|E

50|$|Weather {{satellite}} {{pictures are}} often broadcast as high-resolution <b>picture</b> <b>transmissions</b> (HRPTs), color high-resolution <b>picture</b> <b>transmissions</b> (CHRPTs) for Chinese weather satellite transmissions, or advanced high-resolution <b>picture</b> <b>transmissions</b> (AHRPTs) for EUMETSAT weather satellite transmissions. HRPT transmissions are available {{around the world}} and are available from both polar and geostationary weather satellites. The polar satellites rotate in orbits that allow each location on earth to be covered by the weather satellite twice per day while the geostationary satellites remain in one location at the equator taking weather images of the earth from that location over the equator. The sensor on weather satellites that picks up HRPT is referred to as an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>picture</b> organizers. These are {{software}} packages that read data present in digital pictures and use this data to automatically create an organization structure. Each digital picture contains {{information about the}} date when the picture was taken. It is this piece of information {{that serves as the}} basis for <b>automatic</b> <b>picture</b> organization. The user usually has little or no control over the automatically created organization structure. Some tools create this structure on the hard drive (physical structure), while other tools create a virtual structure (it exists only within the tool).|$|R
50|$|In 1985, {{instruments}} {{such as the}} <b>Automatic</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Transmission</b> Receiver, and the Radio Meter Sonde {{were set}} up to calculate wind velocities and solar intensities to determine the feasibility of generation of wind energy and solar energy. 2000 philatelic covers were cancelled, while videos were taken on the station. An electrified garage to store snow vehicles and skidoos was constructed {{as well as a}} repair workshop for them was constructed along with three cottages made with pre-fabricated material, built by the Defence Research and Development Organisation.The Indian navy helped set up the communications system for wireless transmission to India.|$|E
5000|$|Satellite {{meteorology}} {{came to the}} Philippines in 1970 when an <b>Automatic</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Transmission</b> {{system was}} set-up to intercept phototransmission of the upper atmosphere by weather satellites. The first post-war major research initiative of the Bureau was launched in the same year. Called the [...] "Typhoon Research Project, it was launched in 1970 was made possible through the financial assistance of the National Science Development Board. In 1971, upon invitation of the Philippines, the ECAFE/WMO Joint Unit was reallocated in Manila and was rechristened as the Typhoon Committee Secretariat. In the same year, the linking of five weather surveillance radars installed across {{different parts of the}} country and the Manila radar station (it was not yet destroyed until 1978) paved the way for the Weather Radar Surveillance Network of the Bureau.|$|E
50|$|Forming from a {{disturbance}} in the ITCZ on September 9, the storm rapidly intensified, becoming a hurricane shortly after being upgraded into a tropical storm. The hurricane eventually made a {{turn to the}} northeast, which took it to a landfall on Sinaloa {{near the town of}} Punta Piaxtla. There were four Sinaloan casualties from the hurricane, and a worker in Texas was injured when the roof of a plant they were working at collapsed from accumulated rainfall due to the interaction between Naomi and a frontal system over the Gulf Coast. The hurricane also was responsible for a panic involving the Lázaro Cardenás Dam, which was unfinished when the hurricane struck. Due {{in large part to the}} help of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Picture</b> <b>Transmission</b> technology, two towns downriver from the dam were saved when it was kept closed. A total of $16 million (1968 USD) in damages was reported from the hurricane in Sinaloa.|$|E
40|$|Data {{digitization}} and thresholding {{are applied}} to two scenes - sea ice and fresh-water lakes - to define the possible uses of <b>automatic</b> <b>picture</b> processing of uncalibrated SAR L-band imagery. It is shown that certain types of features, those which have constant returns which are also very high or very low in intensity can be effectively studied using simple <b>automatic</b> <b>picture</b> processing techniques applied to uncalibrated radar data. In areas which are generally inaccessible or in which monitoring of the changes of some types of earth surfaces are required, the uncalibrated SAR data can provide valuable inputs for modeling and mapping purposes...|$|R
50|$|The first {{digital image}} was {{produced}} in 1920, by the Bartlane cable <b>picture</b> <b>transmission</b> system. British inventors, Harry G. Bartholomew and Maynard D. McFarlane, developed this method. The process consisted of “a series of negatives on zinc plates that were exposed for varying lengths of time, thus producing varying densities,”.
