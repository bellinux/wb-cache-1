Overall, {{the intake}} and careers of undergraduates remained {{dominated by the}} Church (up to half), drawn {{from a range of}} backgrounds. The college remained largely independent of the large public schools. Brasenose's <b>academic</b> <b>record</b> remained solid, if unremarkable; its strengths lay in classics, although one of its most prominent academics– Arthur Evans– studied modern history.|$|E

5|$|At Cranbrook, Romney helped {{manage the}} ice hockey team, {{and he joined}} the pep squad. During his senior year, he joined the cross country running team. He belonged to eleven school {{organizations}} and school clubs overall, including the Blue Key Club, a booster group that he had started. During his final year there, his <b>academic</b> <b>record</b> improved but fell short of excellence. Romney was involved in several pranks while attending Cranbrook. He has since apologized for those, stating {{that some of the}} pranks may have gone too far. In March of his senior year, he began dating Ann Davies; she attended the private Kingswood School, the sister school to Cranbrook. The two became informally engaged around the time of his June 1965 graduation.|$|E
5|$|The post-1785 period {{would see}} {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} of the college under Principal William Cleaver. The college began to be populated by gentlemen, its income doubling between 1790 and 1810, and academic success considerable. Efforts to reconstruct Brasenose were not completed, however, until {{the second half of}} the century with the addition of New Quad between 1886 and 1911. Brasenose's financial position remained secure, although under the tenure of Principal Edward Hartopp Cradock Brasenose's <b>academic</b> <b>record</b> waned greatly, with much of its success focussed on sports– where it excelled most notably in cricket and rowing. The mid-Century Royal Commissions were navigated– although they were opposed in form, their recommendations welcomed including the submission of accounts. The election of Charles Buller Heberden as Principal in 1889 led to a reversal in Brasenose's academic failures, although its sporting performance suffered. Heberden was the first lay Principal, presiding over an increasingly secular college, opening up the library to undergraduates, instituting an entrance exam for the first time and accepting Rhodes scholarships.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} {{initiated a}} worldwide search for five pro-vice-chancellors in mid-2014. Two of them, Ian Holliday and Douglas So, were appointed in November 2014. Another two, Andy Hor and John Kao, were appointed in March 2015 to commence employment in September 2015. The sole candidate for position of pro-vice-chancellor (academic staffing and resources), recommended by unanimity, was Johannes Chan. The {{news of the}} selection committee's recommendation was broken by Wen Wei Po in a feature report “in {{the best interest of}} the public” even before the HKU council had been informed of the selection. Chan then became the target of a concerted attack by Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Po for his <b>academic</b> <b>record.</b> Wen Wei Po, citing from a leaked University Grants Commission report, stated that Chan's <b>academic</b> <b>record</b> on research was not up to international standards while he was dean of the law school. The journal accused Chan of being so busy with politics that he neglected research.|$|E

He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood, a foundation school in the City of London, gaining an average <b>academic</b> <b>record</b> but becoming a prolific reader. After this, he attended further education at Aldenham School in Hertfordshire. For a time, he was a boarder at King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon.|$|E
25|$|Peirce {{was born}} at 3 Phillips Place in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He {{was the son of}} Sarah Hunt Mills and Benjamin Peirce, himself a {{professor}} of astronomy and mathematics at Harvard University and perhaps the first serious research mathematician in America. At age 12, Charles read his older brother's copy of Richard Whately's Elements of Logic, then the leading English-language text on the subject. So began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning. He went on to earn the A.B. and A.M. (1862) from Harvard; in 1863 the Lawrence Scientific School awarded him a B.Sc. that was Harvard's first summa cum laude chemistry degree; and otherwise his <b>academic</b> <b>record</b> was undistinguished. At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Chauncey Wright, and William James. One of his Harvard instructors, Charles William Eliot, formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This opinion proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard 1869–1909—a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life—repeatedly vetoed Harvard's employing Peirce in any capacity.|$|E
