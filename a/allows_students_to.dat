30|$|<b>To</b> {{maximize}} <b>student</b> comfort, reduce anxiety, {{and maximize}} idea sharing, instructors could consider <b>allowing</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> choose which other students {{they work with}} during class. Previous research suggests that <b>allowing</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> choose their own groups during active learning could be anxiety-reducing for students and particularly beneficial for female and LGBTQIA students (Cooper and Brownell 2016; Eddy et al. 2015 a; Theobald et al. 2017). However, this current study suggests that <b>allowing</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> choose whom they work with may reduce all students’ anxiety because they can choose partners who they are most comfortable with.|$|R
