5|$|Another {{portion of}} modern VT 14, between East Brookfield and Williamstown center, {{was to be}} {{improved}} by another turnpike corporation, the Williamstown Center Turnpike, which was chartered on November 14, 1803. The charter provided that the road {{be turned over to}} the state after having been in operation for 25 years (later amended to 40 years). The company, however, did not do <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> its first two years of existence and only began laying out the road in 1805.|$|E
5|$|His admissions {{were not}} {{produced}} by oppression or coercive conduct {{on the part}} of the Gardaí. Neither were the admissions produced as a result of <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the nature of a bribe or inducement. There was no deliberate attempt to frame Dean Lyons. However, Dean Lyons was able to provide accurate details of murders it is now accepted that he did not commit, due to the manner in which he was interviewed by gardaí. He wished to associate himself with the murders and readily agreed to leading questions which were asked by interviewing gardaí.|$|E

5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as time goes on.

Love does not feel that text is necessarily the best way to tell a story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have long}} speculated about the {{influence}} – if any – of Hamnet's death upon William Shakespeare's writing. Unlike his contemporary Ben Jonson, who wrote a lengthy piece {{on the death of}} his own son, Shakespeare, if he wrote <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> response, did so more subtly. At the time his son died, Shakespeare was writing primarily comedies, and that writing continued until a few years after Hamnet's death, when his major tragedies were written. It is possible that his tragedies gained depth from his experience.|$|E
5|$|The Combine is {{composed}} of various species and machines. The most commonly encountered enemies throughout Half-Life 2 and its expansions are the transhuman Overwatch soldiers and human Civil Protection officers. A variety of combat machines also encountered, ranging from APCs and helicopter gunships to a giant 'Smart wall' which encloses occupied cities and gradually destroys <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> its path. A number of weaponised alien 'synths' are also encountered by Freeman.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of Article IX is to create the Virginia State Corporation Commission, which is charged with {{administering}} the laws that regulate corporations. The State Corporation Commission also issues charters for Virginia corporations and licenses to do business for “foreign” (non-Virginia) corporations. Section 5 of Article IX prohibits such foreign corporations from doing <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> Virginia that a Virginia corporation could not do.|$|E
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, <b>anything,</b> <b>in</b> an effort to get the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E
5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, {{sometimes}} {{in opposition to}} other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E

5|$|Adam (Peter Krause) is {{stressed}} {{about work}} because his boss Gordon (William Baldwin) feels {{he is too}} distracted by family issues. Sarah (Lauren Graham), frustrated with her children for losing their shoes, off-handedly remarks to Adam about her desire for a LoJack to help locate missing shoes. Put on the spot for new ideas at work, Adam pitches the LoJack idea and Gordon loves it, insisting Adam start developing it. When Sarah learns this later she is excited, but feels upset she is not given credit. When Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) encouraged her {{to stand up for}} herself, Sarah confronts Adam, but claims he has made many sacrifices for Sarah in the past and never asked for <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> return. Later, however, Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah's idea. That night, Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company's design department, which she happily accepts.|$|E
5|$|Although the BBC has {{invested}} in the reconstruction of episodes using animation, it has never attempted to do <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> the way of complete re-staging of missing episodes; the closest that {{it has come to}} this was the recreation of parts of various serials, including the completely missing Marco Polo, in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time produced for the 50th anniversary in 2013. However, in 2012 a reimagined version of The Power of the Daleks, written by, directed by, and starring Nick Scovell, was released on YouTube in three parts before it was shown complete at the Power:Reimagined convention in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|An autopsy reveals Wells' {{death was}} the result of an asthma attack. However the ambitious {{district}} attorney, Gordon Roberts (Robert Wisden) believes Plott is somehow responsible. The investigation stalls until another child, Danielle Barbakow (Lauren Diewold), mentions overhearing Wells being physically abused by Plott. Plott is arrested by Sherman, who she reprimands sternly, reminding him that she looked after him as a child too, and has never been accused of <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> three decades of childcare work. Sherman sees she is incapable of what she has been accused of and continues to send his son to the daycare, but other parents protest, to the point of picketing and vandalizing the fence around the daycare.|$|E

5|$|As Captain Picard and Commander Data (Brent Spiner) {{discuss the}} matter with the Ventaxian leader (Marcelo Tubert), a woman appears in the chamber, announcing herself as Ardra. She proves her {{identity}} by starting an earthquake at will, and transforming into both the Christian and then the Klingon devil. Ardra states that {{she has come to}} claim the planet. Picard is instantly suspicious and orders Data to examine the contract that supposedly was signed by Ardra and the leaders of the planet a thousand years ago. Picard returns to the Enterprise afterwards, and Ardra appears on the bridge sitting in the Captain's chair. Security Chief Worf (Michael Dorn) tries to remove her without success, Data returns just then and confirms the language of the contract as well as Ardra's claim to the planet, including <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> orbit, including the Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|At the Red Electoral Alliance's city {{convention}} Folkvord {{was elected}} their lead candidate in Oslo for the 2005 election. Folkvord, along with Torstein Dahle, {{were the only}} representatives from the party who had a chance of gaining a seat in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards {{the idea of having}} any representatives from the Red Electoral Alliance in parliament, saying that the voters should do <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> their power to stop them from earning a seat in parliament. When the votes were counted Folkvord did not gain a seat in parliament.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Harvey's {{account of}} the smoke-filled room had Harding being sent for {{in the early morning}} hours, to be {{informed}} by Harvey that the Ohioan would be the candidate. Harvey stated he asked if there was <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> Harding's background that might harm his candidacy, to which the senator, who had had at least one extramarital affair, replied there was not. Harding biographer Charles W. Murray noted that there is no evidence besides Harvey's word that Harding went to the Hays suite that night, and that other participants denied that Harding was there. Harding was so uncertain of victory that he filed for re-election to the Senate, though Daugherty continued to urge delegates to support him.|$|E

5|$|During this time, the Flames {{found it}} {{increasingly}} difficult to retain their best players as salaries escalated while the Canadian dollar lost value against the American dollar. Calgary has always been one of the smallest markets in the league (it is currently third-smallest, behind only Edmonton and Winnipeg) and the NHL's small-market Canadian teams found {{it increasingly difficult}} to compete in the new environment. In 1999, for example, the Flames traded Fleury to the Colorado Avalanche midway through the season. The trade came shortly after Fleury became the franchise's all-time leading scorer. Fleury was due to become an unrestricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season, and the Flames did not want to risk losing him without getting <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> return.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what portion of the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses to decide whether the dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it {{is not clear}} that <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E
