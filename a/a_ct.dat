5|$|Some {{treatments}} for stroke are time-critical. These include clot dissolution or surgical {{removal of a}} clot for ischaemic strokes, and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes. As stroke is time critical, hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually <b>a</b> <b>CT</b> scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and <b>a</b> <b>CT</b> or MR angiogram to evaluate arteries that supply the brain. MRI scans, not as widely available, {{may be able to}} demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately, particularly with ischaemic stroke.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} locating {{the site of}} a CSF leak is to use heavily T2-weighted MR myelography. This has been effective in identifying the sites of a CSF leak without the need for <b>a</b> <b>CT</b> scan, lumbar puncture, and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E

5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, <b>a</b> <b>CT</b> scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|After a subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is confirmed, its origin {{needs to be}} determined. If the bleeding {{is likely to have}} originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on <b>a</b> <b>CT</b> scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E
5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that <b>a</b> <b>CT</b> scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
40|$|Proteolytic {{processing}} of the {{amyloid precursor protein}} by β-secretase yields <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT</b> (C 99), which is cleaved further by the as yet unknown γ-secretase, yielding the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide with 40 (Aβ 40) or 42 residues (Aβ 42). Because the position of γ-secretase cleavage is crucial for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease, we individually replaced all membrane-domain residues of <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT</b> outside the Aβ domain with phenylalanine, stably transfected the constructs in COS 7 cells, and determined {{the effect of these}} mutations on the cleavage specificity of γ-secretase (Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 ratio). Compared with wild-type <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT,</b> mutations at Val- 44, Ile- 47, and Val- 50 led to decreased Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 ratios, whereas mutations at Thr- 43, Ile- 45, Val- 46, Leu- 49, and Met- 51 led to increased Aβ 42 /Aβ 40 ratios. A massive effect was observed for I 45 F (34 -fold increase) making this construct important for the generation of animal models for Alzheimer’s disease. Unlike the other mutations, A 4 CT-V 44 F was processed mainly to Aβ 38, as determined by mass spectrometry. Our data provide a detailed model for the active site of γ-secretase: γ-secretase interacts with <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT</b> by binding {{to one side of the}} α-helical transmembrane domain of <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT.</b> Mutations in the transmembrane domain of <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT</b> interfere with the interaction between γ-secretase and <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT</b> and, thus, alter the cleavage specificity of γ-secretase...|$|R

5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic liver disease. Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications.

5|$|SAH {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a {{ruptured}} cerebral aneurysm. Risk factors for spontaneous cases included high blood pressure, smoking, family history, alcoholism, and cocaine use.

After confirmation further tests are usually performed to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|When a more {{exacting}} plan {{is needed}} beyond clinical judgment, the dentist {{will make an}} acrylic guide (called a stent) prior to surgery which guides optimal positioning of the implant. Increasingly, dentists opt to get <b>a</b> <b>CT</b> scan of the jaws and any existing dentures, then plan the surgery on CAD/CAM software. The stent can then be made using stereolithography following computerized planning of a case from the CT scan. The use of CT scanning in complex cases also helps the surgeon identify and avoid vital structures such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the sinus.|$|E
40|$|AbstractProteolytic {{processing}} of Alzheimer’s disease {{amyloid precursor protein}} (APP) by β-secretase leads to <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT</b> (C 99), which is further cleaved by the as yet unknown protease called γ-secretase. To study the enzymatic properties of γ-secretase independently of β-secretase, <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT</b> together with <b>an</b> N-terminal signal peptide (SPA 4 CT) may be expressed in eukaryotic cells. However, in all existing SPA 4 CT proteins the signal peptide is not correctly cleaved upon membrane insertion. Here, we report the generation of a mutated SPA 4 CT protein that is correctly cleaved by signal peptidase and, thus, identical to the APP-derived <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT.</b> This novel SPA 4 CT protein is processed by γ-secretase {{in the same manner}} as APP-derived <b>A</b> 4 <b>CT</b> and might be valuable for the generation of transgenic animals showing amyloid pathology...|$|R
40|$|Background: Integrins are a {{group of}} transmembrane {{signaling}} proteins {{that are important in}} biological processes such as cell adhesion, proliferation and migration. Integrins are a/b hetero-dimers and there are 24 different integrins formed by specific combinations of 18 a and 8 b subunits in humans. Generally, each of these subunits has a large extracellular domain, a single pass transmembrane segment and <b>a</b> cytosolic tail (<b>CT).</b> CTs of integrins are important in bidirectional signal transduction and they associate with a large number of intracellular proteins. Principal Findings: Using NMR spectroscopy, we determined the 3 -D structure of the full-length <b>a</b> 4 <b>CT</b> (Lys 968 -Asp 999) and characterize its interactions with the adaptor protein paxillin. The <b>a</b> 4 <b>CT</b> assumes <b>an</b> overall helical structure with a kink in its membrane proximal region. Residues Gln 981 -Asn 997 formed a continuous helical conformation that may be sustained by potential ionic and/or hydrogen bond interactions and packing of aromatic-aliphatic side-chains. 15 N- 1 H HSQC NMR experiments reveal interactions of the <b>a</b> 4 <b>CT</b> C-terminal region with a fragment of paxillin (residues G 139 -K 277) that encompassed LD 2 -LD 4 repeats. Residues of these LD repeats including their adjoining linkers showed <b>a</b> 4 <b>CT</b> binding-induced chemical shift changes. Furthermore, NMR studies using LD-containing peptides showed predominant interactions between LD 3 and LD 4 of paxillin and <b>a</b> 4 <b>CT.</b> Docked structures of the <b>a</b> 4 <b>CT</b> with these LD repeats suggest possible polar and/or salt-bridge and non-polar packing interactions...|$|R

5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). <b>A</b> <b>CT</b> scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E
5|$|Blood tests may be {{performed}} to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated creatine kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as <b>a</b> <b>CT</b> scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also {{be performed}} to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. <b>A</b> <b>CT</b> scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus is usually treated through the insertion of a shunt, which diverts fluid {{to another part of the}} body, such as a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.|$|E

5|$|In February, the 76ers had Okafor and Nerlens Noel swap {{positions}} as Okafor moved from center to power forward. On February 6, he recorded 22 points and a season-high 17 rebounds in a 103–98 {{win over the}} Brooklyn Nets. The position swap was considered an improvement over the two players splitting time or having Noel play out of his natural position. On February 21 against the Dallas Mavericks, Okafor posted a career-high 31 points in a 129–103 loss, surpassing not only his NBA career high, but also his 30-point game at Duke. On February 28, Okafor posted 26 points against the Orlando Magic, but he endured a shin contusion in a collision with teammate Isaiah Canaan that was only expected to sideline him for a game. As he missed his fifth consecutive game, 76ers head coach Brett Brown noted that Okafor had <b>a</b> <b>CT</b> scan on his knee.

5|$|One {{point of}} {{concern has been}} the {{standard}} of radiation emission from 10,000 years to 1,000,000 years into the future. On August 9, 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency proposed a limit of 350millirem per year for that period. In October 2007, the DOE issued {{a draft of the}} Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in which it shows that for the first 10,000years mean public dose would be 0.24mrem/year and that thereafter to 1,000,000 years the median public dose would be 0.98mrem/year, both of which are substantially below the proposed EPA limit. For comparison, a hip x-ray results in a dose around 83 mrem and <b>a</b> <b>CT</b> head or chest scan results in around 1,110 mrem. Annually, in the United States, an individual's doses from background radiation is about 350 mrem, although some places get more than twice that.|$|E
