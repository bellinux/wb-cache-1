2500|$|Bassist Tony Lombardo, some 20 {{years his}} bandmates' senior, wrote songs expressing {{his desire for}} {{stability}} and individuality. [...] "I'm Not a Punk" [...] reflected his disinterest in {{being part of the}} anarchic, destructive aspect of the punk scene: [...] "That whole thing turned me off. I just wanted to play the music and do it <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> and I {{had a lot of fun}} doing that [...] It's like 'I'm Not a Punk'. I want to be my own person." [...] "Suburban Home" [...] was quite literal, expressing his desire for [...] "a house just like mom and dad's": [...] "I definitely wanted a home. I couldn't live in a place where all the people are cool. I don't like dysfunctionality. I have an abhorrence of dysfunctionality because my mother was an alcoholic, my parents are divorced, I just don't need that assault on my emotions and psyche." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, {{longtime}} business {{correspondent and}} Moneyline host Lou Dobbs left CNN, reportedly due to heated clashes with the network's {{president at the}} time, Rick Kaplan, over programming priorities and questions about Kaplan's political objectivity. Dobbs returned the following year {{at the behest of}} CNN founder Ted Turner. From the time he rejoined the network, Dobbs had continuously railed against illegal immigration, offshoring, globalization and free trade in his [...] "War on the Middle Class" [...] and [...] "Broken Borders" [...] segments. Journalist Kurt Andersen in an article in New York criticized CNN for allowing Dobbs' program, [...] "Lou Dobbs Tonight", to become [...] "an amazingly tendentious nightly CNN 'news' program that goes well beyond the line-blurring that Fox [...] pioneered." [...] Dobbs announced his resignation from CNN on November 11, 2009 on what would be his last show for that network. He did not immediately explain the reason for his departure in his sign-off speech, but it was reported that CNN wanted him out and offered him $8 million to leave. Later upon questioning Dobbs discussed his exit, [...] "I tried to accommodate them <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> but I've said for many years now that neutrality is not part of my being." ...|$|E

30|$|I {{felt like}} they were there just to teach us what we were {{supposed}} to know and if we didn’t grasp it then it wasn’t their problem. I would get outside tutoring help and they would try to help me out <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but because my teacher wasn’t teaching the basics it was just hard for me to grasp onto the concepts.|$|R
5000|$|Frusciante on the album: [...] "I started being {{serious about}} {{following}} my dream to make electronic music, {{and to be}} my own engineer, five years ago. For the 10 years prior to that, I had been playing guitar along {{with a wide range}} of different types of programmed synthesizer and sample-based music, emulating what <b>I</b> heard <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> found that the languages machines forced programmers to think in had caused them to discover a new musical vocabulary...|$|R
5000|$|You {{said earlier}} that when you showed Dog Shot Film at the {{screening}} room at 42nd Street {{that you wanted to}} hurt the viewers.Yeah, I mean that whole night on 42nd Street, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it, was the most aggressive way <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of to show a film, the most damaging thing that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to the audience by showing a film. I hired a photographer with a camera so when people were leaving the theater, they were assaulted by a flash, attacked.|$|R

40|$|Bean leaf beetles {{are still}} {{extremely}} abundant in some fields and {{are continuing to}} cause damage to pods. I swept one field south of Ames on September 8 that {{was just beginning to}} turn yellow. In 10 sweeps I collected 229 bean leaf beetles, or <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> count! In an adjacent variety where approximately half of the leaves were yellow, I collected 82 beetles in 10 sweeps. It was not uncommon for 60 - 70 percent of the pods on the upper half of the plants to be heavily scarred or flat with no developing seeds...|$|R
40|$|I {{think that}} what kept me {{interested}} and following this page <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> was following the page numbers. Looking at the page numbers allowed me {{to stay focused on}} one page at a time, and I would record what information I learned page by page, with each link I visited that was connected to that page. I would also enlarge the pictures to see them more clearly because they are very detailed and interesting. Lastly, I would suggest always looking at the advanced information instead of just the beginner's because the information is not too overwhelming, and it may be exactly what the viewer is looking for. ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Vice later that month, Kossisko said his next project would be titled Sex Symbols, which he had already started recording. He described it as different saying, [...] "It's more influenced by R&B. I've got some singers on there. It's {{going to be more}} funky, too. What I wanted to do, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> was have a fusion between 1990s mack-rap and late 1980s pop and soul. Something like Bobby Brown or Rick James." [...] On January 23, 2013, Ice Cold Perm was released for digital download. In early 2013, he went on the Group Hug Tour with Kreayshawn, then performed five shows at 2013's SXSW.|$|R

50|$|David Kennedy {{is known}} to have a love of motorcycles. In July 2009 he entered and won his first race at the Willow Springs Motorcycle Club. Afterwards Kennedy stated,“I was nervous at the start, feeling just like I do before I go on stage to play for a huge crowd. There's a lot to compare between playing on stage and racing. Once the race started I just wanted to perform <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{possibly}} <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> always want to be the <b>best</b> at what <b>I</b> dedicate myself to doing. A lot of people have helped me get to this point with my riding and I couldn't let them down. So it felt as though my riding was a lot like doing a performance.” He added that he wants to race as many tracks as he can.|$|R
60|$|In {{this tragedy}} {{it has been}} my {{intention}} to follow the account of Diodorus Siculus;[4] reducing it, however, to such dramatic regularity <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>best</b> <b>could,</b> and trying to approach the unities. I therefore suppose the rebellion to explode and succeed in one day by a sudden conspiracy, instead of the long war of the history.|$|R
5000|$|I couldn't {{write a song}} without God. Sure, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hack out {{hackneyed}} {{phrases and}} clichés, but to write anything meaningful I {{have to be in}} tune with God. He is the great source, my inspiration, the current that I have to connect to. Sadly I've not always used the gift He's given me—the answered prayer—as <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> or should have. I've made mistakes. I've done things I wish I hadn't done.|$|R

5000|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. You are not done yet figuring out what you need to figure out, and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that <b>I</b> used it <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|R

The poor heart-broken little brother said he knew {{the way back to the}} wigwams of his tribe, so I gave him the most of the {{provisions}} I had, told him my name, and sent him away." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{closed and}} made fast the window, then I bethought me that, being in {{ignorance of the}} {{whereabouts}} of St. Auban's bed-chamber, I must perforce spend the night <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> within that very room.|$|E

60|$|After I had pawned my things, and had begged a small {{advance of}} wages {{at the place}} where I work to make up what was still wanting to pay for Mary's funeral, I thought I might have had a little quiet time to prepare myself <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>best</b> <b>could</b> for to-morrow.

60|$|The {{thousand}} injuries of Fortunato I {{had borne}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>best</b> <b>could,</b> {{but when he}} ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that I gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely settled--but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved, precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish, but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong.|$|R
60|$|It was in vain I {{accelerated}} my pace down stairs; I heard bolt after bolt withdrawn by the officious scoundrel, {{while all}} the time he was boasting his own and his master's loyalty to King George; and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily calculate that the party must enter before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> arrive at the door to replace the bars. Devoting the back of Andrew Fairservice to the cudgel so soon as I should have time to pay him his deserts, I ran back to the library, barricaded the door <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>best</b> <b>could,</b> and hastened to that by which Diana and her father entered, and begged for instant admittance. Diana herself undid the door. She was ready dressed, and betrayed neither perturbation nor fear.|$|R
