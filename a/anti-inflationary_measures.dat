50|$|On 25 August 1959, the {{government}} implemented sweeping <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures,</b> devaluing the currency by 75 percent and declaring that all Rp500 and Rp1000 notes would henceforth be worth one tenth of their face value. Meanwhile, anti-ethnic Chinese measures, including repatriations and forced transfer to cities, damaged economic confidence further. However, by 1960, inflation had reached 100 percent per annum.|$|E
50|$|In Canada the {{transition}} was less clearly marked, though Pierre Trudeau {{had begun to}} adopt monetarist <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures</b> as early as 1975. Likewise for most of continental Europe except for France, {{the transition}} away from Keynesian economics was less distinct, partly as Keynes had not been as important there, since European states had generally pursued Dirigiste measures even before Keynes, never having embraced classical economics in the first place. In France, François Mitterrand {{came to power in}} 1981 with a commitment to expansionary Keynesian policy, to help reduce unemployment caused by the worldwide recession underway at the time. Similar to what had happened after Léon Blum's election back in 1936, many of the wealthy moved their money out of France, and by 1983 Mitterrand had been forced to largely abandon Keynesian policy.|$|E
5000|$|As {{global trade}} {{expanded}} after the 1979-1982 recession, some American industries, {{such as the}} steel and automobile sectors, which had long thrived in a large domestic market, were increasingly exposed to foreign competition. Specialization, lower wages, and lower energy costs allowed developing nations entering the global market to export high quantities of low cost goods to the United States. Simultaneously, domestic <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures</b> (e.g. higher interest rates set by the Federal Reserve) led to a 65% increase in the exchange value of the US dollar in the early 1980s. The stronger dollar acted in effect as an equal percent tax on American exports and equal percent subsidy on foreign imports. [...] American producers, particularly manufacturers, struggled to compete both overseas and in the US marketplace, prompting calls for new legislation to protect domestic industries. [...] In addition, the recession of 1979-82 did not exhibit the traits of a typical recessionary cycle of imports, where imports temporarily decline during a downturn and return to normal during recovery. Due to the high dollar exchange rate, importers still found a favorable market in the United States despite the recession. As a result, imports continued to increase in the recessionary period and further increased in the recovery period, leading to an all-time high trade deficit and import penetration rate. The high dollar exchange rate in combination with high interest rates also created an influx of foreign capital flows to the United States and decreased investment opportunities for American businesses and individuals.|$|E

50|$|The Guyanese dollar (currency sign: $, G$ and GY$; ISO: GYD) {{has been}} the unit of account in Guyana (formerly British Guiana) since 29 January 1839. Originally it was {{intended}} as a transitional unit to facilitate the changeover from the Dutch guilder system of currency to the British pound sterling system. The Spanish dollar was already prevalent throughout the West Indies in general, and from 1839, the Spanish dollar unit operated in British Guiana in conjunction with British sterling coins at a standard conversion rate of one dollar for every four shillings and twopence. In 1951 the British sterling coinage was replaced with a new decimal coinage which was simultaneously introduced through all the British territories in the Eastern Caribbean. When sterling began to depreciate in the early 1970s, a switch to a US dollar peg became increasingly attractive as an <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measure</b> and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority (of which Guyana was a member) made the switch in October 1975. The Guyanese dollar is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign $, or alternatively G$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.|$|R

As the economic program in Malawi has not involved substantial exchange rate action or cuts in subsidies, the real incomes of the poor have been most clearly affected by the pricing policies of the agricultural parastatal and the overall <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures</b> incorporated in the program; developments in minimum wages have also been important. The study suggests that, on balance, these various factors have led {{to an increase in}} real incomes of the poor over the program period. ...|$|E

We discuss the fiscal strains {{that gave rise to}} this inflation and consider the role played by early Communist market-based <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures</b> such as the 'economic warfare' against speculators conducted by the government's state trading companies. While later monetary and fiscal tightening sustained the stabilization achieved in March – at considerable cost to the real economy – the Chinese experience seems to confirm that there is more to inflation stabilization than fiscal balance alone.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to discuss {{conceptual}} approaches to the development of stabilization policy in federal countries. In this article, the authors have justified the need for a regional component in the mechanism of the domestic price level stabilization policy and systemized relevant factors that have a significant impact on the spatial outcome of stabilization policy. The article proposes a method of determining the spatial zones of high, medium and low “susceptibility” to measures of stabilization policy center, and includes the following: 1) analysis of regional price manageability background; 2) sensitivity study of the regional banking system to a change in central bank policy; 3) elasticity analysis of the reaction of the population and business in the region to change the activity of the regional banking system. The authors have formulated the principles of coordination of actions between the federal center and the regions in the implementation of stabilization policies that allow to take into account differences between the regions in response to the changes made in federal policy. The paper has substantiated the system of performance indicators that <b>measures</b> <b>anti-inflationary</b> policy and also takes into account the heterogeneity of economic space of the Russian Federation in the context of the “direct” and “conjugate” effects on the central regions. Theoretical position application and output indicators, which are outlined in this article allow building a system of coordination and interaction between the federal center and the regions and thus ensuring the effectiveness of stabilization policies and non-inflationary development of Russia...|$|R
40|$|Given the above-average price {{increases}} experienced in Austria {{since the end}} of 2007, <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures</b> are at the centre of the ongoing economic-policy debate, with a strong focus on budget policy. The current price surge also needs to be looked at from the viewpoint of distribution policy: on the one hand, transfer payments by the state to private households are subject to devaluation in real terms; on the other hand, the inflation-related real loss of purchasing power of both earned income and transfer payments particularly affects low income earners, who spend much or all of their disposable income on consumption. All budget policy can do is (partially) neutralise the effect of {{price increases}} on income distribution; it is not able to contribute towards eliminating the causes of inflation.

The methodology involves estimating a general model, which provides for capturing the impact of inflation as well as imported inflation interactively with economic openness on economic growth. The sample period runs from 1991 to 2001. The research found that economic growth reacted in a predictable fashion to changes in the regressors employed in the study. The results obtained from the study also reflects the conventional thinking in the literature that, ceteris paribus, the growth impact of inflation can be counter productive, especially, if not controlled. The study recommends appropriate <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures</b> for the Namibian economy. A further study on how to minimize the negative repercussion of inflation on the economy of Namibia is highly recommended...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to provide an}} in-depth discussion on {{the ways in which}} chronic inflation distorts efficient allocation of resources in an economy. The rate of inflation in some developing countries has been high and volatile, and the rate of adjustment of the nominal variables is quite low both in the short and long-run. The process of adjustments is not only low but also less systematic thereby adversely affects contracts denominated in money and money terms. The study also highlights some likely distortions arising from <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures</b> such as usury laws and other state controls, and their likely impacts on long-term finance and implications for rate of urban development in less developed countries. However, the study concludes that monetary inflation is non-neutral on resource allocation as it erodes the real value of money and monetary assets. Therefore, we recommend that given the severity of the distortions and its associated costs there is the need for an effective monetary correction mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{relevance}} of post-Keynesian theory of conflict inflation for the transition economies. While the conflict inflation theory {{does not have any}} explanatory tower for the performance of socialist economies and for their immediate post-socialist behaviour. it becomes relevant in later phases of their transition. The reason lies in the development of labour market institutions and in the establishment of collective bargaining. The inflation rate is determined by the real wage aspiration gap and by the bargaining power of the capital and labour side. The pervasive role of the state in setting target wage guidelines and a weak position of employers' organizations and trade unions as typical features of transitional tripartism lead to a relatively low rate of conflict inflation. However, this type of inflation is not responsive to monetarist <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures,</b> which successfully cured the hyperinflationary tendencies in early transitional stages. Conflicting-claims inflation requires a more delicate approach. based on incomes policy measures and growth incentives. ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{striking}} features of recent Soviet history has been the combination of emerging democracy and prolonged economic crisis. In E. Gaidar's formulation in the opening article of our current issue ("At the Beginning of a New Phase: An Economic Review"), {{it is as though}} history decided to conduct an experiment: Can democracy take root under conditions of a continuing economic crisis? This {{is only one of the}} interesting questions posed in Gaidar's review of Soviet economic policies and performance during the period 1985 - 90. The author focuses particular attention on the factors making for inflation and the obstacles to an effective anti-inflationary policy. In the course of warning Soviet readers about the potential dangers of the existing situationin particular, the dangers stemming from a "party of order" Gaidar notes that runaway inflation in Latin American countries has been repeatedly followed by military coups. This article also presents some useful empirical material bearing on Soviet inflationary pressures (changes in money incomes of the population, rates of capital investment, the budget deficit as a percentage of GNP). Of special interest is Gaidar's elaboration of the argument that effective <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures,</b> while obviously necessary from an economic standpoint, became "politically impossible. " In what sense? Only a political leadership that had very substantial popular supportcertainly more than that possessed by the Gorbachev leadership at the beginning of the ninetiescould have imposed the kind of wage restraints, limits on social programs, reductions in subsidies, etc., required to control and reverse the acceleration of inflation. ...|$|E

It is to be noted the growing importance of the premium amount and of the fact after how many years the pension should be available. Decreasing is the role of <b>anti-inflationary</b> <b>measures</b> and of the range of a given an insurance. Relatively least importance is still attached to a possibility of depositing an insurance in quality of a pawn in a bank. The same - for the manner of payment of retirement pension and for the frequency of insurance rate; - reliability of the insurer is being stressed more often by the professionals, persons from higher income households or those who claim their wealth level being high (55 - 65 per cent). The insurance premium amount is of bigger importance for the elderly, the less educated, the unpropertied and the pessimists; - percentage of those who are interested in possessing their private pension for retired has recently increased. However, relatively few persons do possess such an insurance (every tenth person) despite enough financial means for that aim. Relatively large group of the undecided has been separated (up to 15 per cent). A wish of possessing private retirement pension is thebigger the higher is education level of a person, the bigger are the wealth and income level of the household; average amount of the declared insurance rate is 118 PLN monthly. This sum increases together with education level and earnings of particular members of a household; interest the firms have in possessing a group insurance passed with an investment fund is now expressively bigger.
