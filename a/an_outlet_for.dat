5|$|When the {{existence}} of the tapes was first publicly reported in July 1973, Williams was planning to ask Apple for at least £100,000. Williams said he later met with George Harrison and Starr to offer the tapes for £5000, but they declined, citing financial difficulties at the time. Williams and Taylor teamed up with Paul Murphy, head of Buk Records, to find <b>an</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> the tapes.|$|E

A record label, Deptford Fun City Records {{was set up by}} Miles Copeland III, brother of Stewart Copeland, in the late 1970s as <b>an</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> Deptford bands such as Alternative TV and Squeeze.|$|E
5|$|In March 1915, Ball began a {{short-lived}} engagement to Dot Allbourne (or Ellbourne), {{though he was}} still interested in other girls such as Thelma Starr. In June, {{he decided to take}} private flying lessons at Hendon Aerodrome, which would give him <b>an</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> his interest in engineering and possibly help him to see action in France sooner. He paid to undertake pilot training in his own time at the Ruffy-Baumann School, which charged £75 to £100 for instruction (£5,580 to £7,440 in 2010 prices).|$|E

5|$|Carpentier was {{an admirer}} of the elegance and wit {{in the work of}} satirical French writers and artists of the eighteenth century, and often {{employed}} grotesques in his descriptions to ridicule the ostentation of colonial aristocracy. Examples include Ti Noel's comparison of wax heads at a barber's shop to white men's heads being served at a banquet, or the portrayal of the decadence of Mademoiselle Floridor, a fourth-rate actress who performs for slaves as <b>an</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> her desire to act. Carpentier further satirizes the pomp of those in power through a series of details of protocol and ceremony whose cumulative effects ridicule the object of description, {{as is the case with}} Henri Christophe's chambers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} 1814–1815, Hermes o Logios reached an {{absolute}} low, with seven issues in 1814 {{and only one}} in 1815, which consisted of 16 pages written by Korais and directed against his ideological adversary, the conservative scholar, Neophytos Doukas. On the other hand, Gazis returned. In the following years, however, the periodical was subsidized by the princes of Moldavia, Scarlat Callimachi and Michael Soutzos. Apart from the difficulties faced, 1816 was a turning point, as two scholars and adherents of Korais, Theoklitos Farmakidis and Konstantinos Kokkinakis, were placed in charge. Consequently, Hermes o Logios actually became <b>an</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> Korais and continued to appear without interruption until the Greek War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Mozart {{composed}} the concerto {{in the winter}} of 1785–86, during his fourth season in Vienna. It was the third in a set of three concertos composed in quick succession, the others being No. 22 in E-flat major and No. 23 in A major. Mozart finished composing the No. 24 shortly before the premiere of his comic opera The Marriage of Figaro; the two works are assigned adjacent numbers of 491 and 492 in the Köchel catalogue. Although composed at the same time, the two works contrast greatly: the opera is almost entirely in major keys while the concerto is one of Mozart's few minor-key works. The pianist and musicologist Robert D. Levin suggests that the concerto, along with the two concertos that precede it, may have served as <b>an</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> a darker aspect of Mozart's creativity {{at the time he was}} composing the comic opera. The premiere of the concerto was on either 3 or 7 April 1786 at the Burgtheater in Vienna; Mozart featured as the soloist and conducted the orchestra from the keyboard.|$|E
