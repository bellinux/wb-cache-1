The general <b>admission</b> <b>plan</b> charged [...] "adults" [...] $1.00 to get through the gate, [...] "juniors", $.50, while children ages 4 and under were free. This plan allowed people to enjoy live entertainment and any non-ride facility; if they wanted to ride rides, they had to purchase tickets just like any season prior. This was the only season the park had the general <b>admission</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} {{need to develop a}} platform for comparing hospital <b>admission</b> <b>planning</b> systems due to a shift in the service paradigm in the health sector. The current service concept of hospital <b>admission</b> <b>planning</b> aims at optimising the use of scarce hospital resources without paying much attention to the level of service offered to patients. As patients nowadays do not accept long waiting times for hospital admission, it becomes necessary to consider alternative admission service concepts. Waiting lists have also become a political issue, and alternative concepts have been advocated such as giving all patients an appointment for admission. A simulation model was built to examine the impacts of extreme admission service concepts in a simplified hospital setting. The alternative concepts considered are based on the ‘zero waiting time’ principle (immediate treatment), and the ‘booked admissions’ principle (using an appointment for admission). The results of these admission service concepts are compared with the results of the current concept, based on the ‘maximising resource use’ principle.

The problem’s search space associated with these move operators is analysed for three typical fitness surfaces, representing different compromises between patient waiting time, surgeon overtime, and waiting time for children in the morning on the day of surgery.

40|$|Hospitals – {{like any}} other {{organization}} – continuously aim to improve the efficiency of their most costly resources. Faced with the uncertain and highly variable nature of the care process, they try to manage the flow of patients {{in such a way}} that operational inefficiencies (overtime in the operating theatre, bed shortages in hospital wards, etc.) are minimized, while still providing care to all patients in a timely fashion. One key instrument in this management process is the admission planning of elective patients. The research question that we pose is: what automated, intelligent tools can we provide to support this decision-making process? Our current research focuses on developing decision-support models and algorithms for admission planning in hospitals. By effectively planning the inflow of elective patients, we try to improve efficiency of a hospital’s key resources (operating theatres, hospital wards and beds, and personnel). At the same time, we also anticipate the inflow of non-elective (i. e. emergency) patients – which by definition cannot be planned. This demo presents the planning of a set of elective patients over a certain period of time. The aim is to improve operational efficiency of two key resources: the operating theatre and the hospital wards. The demo shows how a metaheuristic algorithm improves an initial <b>admission</b> <b>plan</b> to have high operating theatre load, while avoiding overtime; to have a balanced patient load in the hospital wards, ensuring a stable workload; and – finally – to meet patient (room) preferences while avoiding room conflicts (e. g. male/female patient separation). status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|Because of {{the random}} nature of user mobility, the channel gain of each user in a {{cellular}} network {{changes over time}} causing the signal-to-interference ratio (SNR) of the user to fluctuate continuously. Ongoing connections may experience outage events during periods of low SNR. As the outage ratio depends on the SNR statistics {{and the number of}} connections admitted in the system, <b>admission</b> capacity <b>planning</b> needs {{to take into account the}} SNR fluctuations. In this paper, we propose new methods for <b>admission</b> capacity <b>planning</b> in orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFMDA) cellular networks which consider the randomness of the channel gain in formulating the outage ratio and the excess capacity ratio. <b>Admission</b> capacity <b>planning</b> is solved by three optimization problems that maximize the reduction of the outage ratio, the excess capacity ratio, and the convex combination of them. The simplicity of the problem formulations facilitates their solutions in real time. The proposed planning method provides an attractive means for dimensioning OFDMA cellular networks in which a large fraction of users experience group-mobility.|$|R

40|$|Recently {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} of incorporating cellular architecture (with wired base stations and last-hop wireless connections) into fieldbuses to support mobile real-time applications. A promising trend is that such cellular fieldbuses will go multichannel multiradio, due to the wide availability of cheap multichannel commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) wireless nodes, and the rise of 4 G and future cellular technologies. For multichannel multiradio cellular fieldbuses, per-flow real-time schedulability guarantee in the inter-cell level has not yet been well studied. Particularly, unlike 3 G cellular networks, which use static FDMA/CDMA to isolate cells, the multichannel multiradio feature allows neighboring cells to use the same radio frequency channel at different time-slots, or the same time-slot at different radio frequency channels. How to carry out channel time-slot scheduling is therefore the focus of this paper. To address this issue, we propose a greedy scheduling algorithm, together with a polynomial time closed-form schedulability test. The relationship between the schedulability test result, greedy scheduling schedulability, and schedulability is explored. We prove the equivalence of the three for chained cellular fieldbus topology, a typical topology with broad applications. This also implies the optimality of greedy scheduling, and the sufficiency and necessity of the schedulability test in the context of chained topology. To demonstrate and validate these schedulability theories, we carry out a case study on a classic <b>admission</b> <b>planning</b> problem. The schedulability test not only serves as a planning constraint, but also guides us to propose an approximation algorithm to solve the NP-hard <b>admission</b> <b>planning</b> problem. Comparisons to exhaustive search corroborate the validity of our schedulability theories. Department of ComputingRefereed conference pape...|$|R
