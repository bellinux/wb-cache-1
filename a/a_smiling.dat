Her waist is slim and her breasts well-developed.|$|E
5|$|The dodo {{is used as}} a mascot {{for many}} kinds of products, {{especially}} in Mauritius. It appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Mauritius, {{is used as a}} watermark on all Mauritian rupee banknotes, and features as the background of the Mauritian immigration form. <b>A</b> <b>smiling</b> dodo is the symbol of the Brasseries de Bourbon, a popular brewer on Réunion, whose emblem displays the white species once thought to have lived there.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Attack on Titan {{revolves}} around the adventures of Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and their childhood friend Armin Arlert. After the wall which protects their hometown of Shinganshina is breached by the Colossal Titan leading the other Titans to enter, Eren watches in horror as <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> Titan eats his mother. Vowing to kill all the Titans, Eren enlists in the military, along with his friends.|$|E

5|$|Homer, {{disturbed}} by the box of Mr. Sparkle, contacts the manufacturer in Hokkaidō, Japan for information. He is sent a promotional video for Mr. Sparkle, which consists of a TV commercial. At {{the end of the}} video, the mascot is shown to be a result of a joint venture between two large Japanese conglomerates, Matsumura Fishworks and Tamaribuchi Heavy Manufacturing Concern. Their mascots, <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> anime fish and light bulb, merge to form Mr. Sparkle. Thus, Homer discovers the similarity was a mere coincidence.|$|E
5|$|The Dhyana Mantra of Raja-matangi {{from the}} Purashcharyarnava {{describes}} Matangi as green in colour with the crescent moon upon her forehead. She has long hair, <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> expression and intoxicated eyes, and wears a garland of kadamba flowers and various ornaments. She perspires a little around the face, which renders {{her even more}} beautiful. Below her navel are three horizontal folds of skin and a thin vertical line of fine hair. Seated on an altar and flanked by two parrots, she represents the 64 arts. The Saradatilaka, adds to this description that Raja-Matangi plays the veena, wears conch-shell earrings and flower garlands, and has flower paintings adorning her forehead.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E

25|$|Cheater {{recognition}} {{is closely related}} to the recognition of specific emotions. Bell et al. argue for the existence of an emotional incongruity effect. Memory is better for the face of <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> cheater than of <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> cooperator, because the incongruity captures the attention of the participant. If the emotion violates the expectancy then it is much better remembered. Furthermore, negative information is much better remembered whether it violates expectancies or not. Negative emotions have a strong effect on source memory due to the presence of threatening stimuli.|$|E
25|$|By 1989, while {{continuing}} his comeback, Foreman had sold {{his name and}} face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from grills to mufflers on TV. For this purpose his public persona was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman {{had been replaced by}} <b>a</b> <b>smiling,</b> friendly George. He and Ali had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside the boundaries of boxing.|$|E
25|$|The profile {{photograph}} {{promoting the}} page was <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> photograph of Khaled Said which portrayed his middle class status and young innocence.

By doing this, police forces became hesitant with their actions knowing that the Facebook page was being used to document their flaws and overuse of force.|$|E

25|$|Moments after news of {{her death}} emerged, CNN, MSNBC and Fox News all broke from their {{regularly}} scheduled programming to dedicate time to non-stop coverage of Houston's death. All three featured live interviews with people who had known Houston including those that had worked with her, interviewed her {{along with some of}} her peers in the music industry. Saturday Night Live displayed a photo of <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> Houston, alongside Molly Shannon, from her 1996 appearance. MTV and VH-1 interrupted their regularly scheduled programming on Sunday February 12 to air many of Houston's classic videos with MTV often airing news segments in between and featuring various reactions from fans and celebrities.|$|E
25|$|Around 1917-1920 social outsiders, the nostalgic loners {{who spend}} their lives in saloons or {{interiors}} with scanty furniture, replaced the earlier fishermen and their families, sailors, and merchants. Here we have a clear connection with the “miserable” trend of the young Picasso, such as his Saltimbanques of the blue period. At the same time, these sad themes are counterbalanced by representations of happy families in various configurations: a mother playing with <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> child, a family playing with a puppet-theatre, etc. The paintings from his last period gain more light and life, while the artist does not eschew dissonances. Contours dissolve {{on the edges of}} bordering color areas and spot-lighting melts the surfaces of stylized forms.|$|E
25|$|Philip's parents {{appeared}} {{regularly on}} the news and clutched what {{has now become a}} well-recognised picture of <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> Philip in his Confirmation clothes of a blue jacket and a red rosette. This photo has been deemed a precursor to that of British infant Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal 21 years later. However, the family, unlike the McCanns, have been relatively private about their loss, speaking to the media on only a few occasions in the past 25 years. It has been reported that this is due to several inaccurate reports of the incident of which they have disapproved. Gardaí have, however, praised the media as a proven method for encouraging people to come forward with further information on the case each time an appeal is broadcast. Residents' organisation ACRA also launched an intense campaign to attempt to find Philip.|$|E
60|$|Whatever Fan said, she {{accompanied}} with <b>a</b> <b>smile.</b> Indeed <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> was {{the necessary}} {{result of the}} opening of her little mouth for whatever purpose--not <b>an</b> affected <b>smile,</b> but <b>a</b> merry one--which always had the effect, her face being plump, of half shutting her eyes.|$|R

25|$|Koffing {{resembles a}} large, {{floating}} blue-purple ball with various gas-emitting stud-like orifices surrounding its body save for its face, which appears as <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> mouth with two eyes, {{and two small}} white upper fangs protruding from its mouth and a skull and crossbones symbol directly below said mouth. Once a Koffing has gained enough experience points, it evolves into a Weezing. Weezing's design appears as two light-purple Koffing fused together at the side, one larger and the other smaller than normal, additionally joined by an appendage from each connecting to a smaller, spherical mass. Both faces appear to be frowning, with the larger featuring two lower large fangs and two upper blunted teeth. On each, the skull has been changed to simpler oval, with the smaller lacking the crossbones. Koffing is 2feet (60cm) tall, while Weezing is 3feet 11inches (119cm) tall.|$|E
25|$|Jan van Mill has {{described}} βN as a 'three headed monster' — the three heads being <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> and friendly head (the behaviour {{under the assumption}} of the continuum hypothesis), the ugly head of independence which constantly tries to confuse you (determining what behaviour is possible in different models of set theory), and the third head is the smallest of all (what you can prove about it in ZFC). It has relatively recently been observed that this characterisation isn't quite right - there {{is in fact a}} fourth head of βN, in which forcing axioms and Ramsey type axioms give properties of βN almost diametrically opposed to those under the continuum hypothesis, giving very few maps from N* indeed. Examples of these axioms include the combination of Martin's axiom and the Open colouring axiom which, for example, prove that (N*)2 ≠ N*, while the continuum hypothesis implies the opposite.|$|E
25|$|While {{none of the}} Lithuanians {{playing in}} the EuroBasket 2015 Final {{were part of the}} team who won the 2003 tournament, the adversary was the same, a Spanish team led by Pau Gasol and {{featuring}} Felipe Reyes, as well as two of the referees, Luigi Lamonica and Ilija Belošević. And this time, the final went absolutely different, with Spain hitting with stunning accuracy right from the 19–8 first quarter. The Lithuanian squad tried to reduce the deficit multiple times, but the Spanish kept the lead at all times for an 80–63 win. Jonas Valančiūnas and Jonas Mačiulis were selected to the All-Tournament Team, but were visibly unhappy at losing the second straight European championship final. Yet on the next day, the national team members, as in the previous years, were warmly greeted at the Town Hall in Vilnius by <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> crowd. On September 22, the team was invited to the Presidential Palace, where they were awarded with more state awards.|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} shown that it is {{possible}} to hear whether a person is speaking with or without <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> on their face, and that this prosodic information that is being sent by the facial expression is processed unconsciously. It had been shown that this effect affects text comprehension, but is it unclear what is does to credibility. To find out, the main question is asked: “Do the phonetic effects of <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> affect the credibility of an utterance?” In this study there have been made recordings of several sentences, all produced with and without <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> on the speakers face. These recordings were judged on credibility by a collection of test subjects. The study has shown that sentenced uttered with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> were regarded as less credible. This is why the main question is answered with “the phonetic effects caused by <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> affect the credibility of an utterance in a negative way”. When a speaker is trying to convince a listener, speaking with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> will make things harder for him...|$|R

25|$|Born in Kanagawa Prefecture in September of {{the first}} year of Bunkyū (1861), Sōjirō is an illegitimate child who was badly mistreated by his father's family {{to the point of being}} beaten for faltering in his tasks. To build a {{tolerance}} to the beatings, Sōjirō put on <b>a</b> <b>smiling</b> face as his tormenters decide to let him be. One night, at age eight, Sōjirō witnessed the recently scarred Makoto Shishio killing two police officers and was spared due to the criminal seeing the boy's smile. While secretly feeding Shishio and providing him with bandages, Sōjirō takes the man's ideals to heart while receiving a wakizashi. When his family learned that he is harboring Shishio and decide to murder the child and pin the blame on the fugitive, Sōjirō uses the wakizashi Shishio gave him to slaughter his family. Soon after, once Shishio's wounds are healed, Sōjirō travels with him as his right hand and member of the Jupongatana.|$|E
